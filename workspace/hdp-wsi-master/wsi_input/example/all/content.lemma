Zhibang Jia , standing vice-director of the organizing committee of the negotiation conference and vice-governor of Shaanxi province , says that this negotiation conference will be based on the principle of " mutual benefit , cooperation , development , and comprehensively pushing cooperation between the east and the west towards the 21st century " .  It will highlight the horizontal links and co-operation of east and west areas as the main content .  It will carefully select a number of cooperative projects in accord with national industry policy to attract business from domestic and overseas markets .  
This meeting is named " the Urumchi external economy and trade negotiation meeting " , while the two previous meetings were called " Urumchi border local region negotiation meeting " .  Its merchant invitation scope extends from neighboring countries to nearly 100 countries and regions such as Europe and America , southeast Asia , western Asia , the Middle East , etc .  Negotiation content include not only barter trade , but have also added items such as cash trading , economic and technological co-operation and capital and technology introduction , etc .  
This is because the compilation and publication that comes out of the ISI 's citation indexing database is aimed at providing services for scientific and technical information , and the items cited do not all directly affect the concrete substance of articles ; so as a type of statistical analysis product , the influence itself of the data does not have an academic evaluative content and should not be deemed the authoritative data for evaluating academic publications .  
At present , many foreign academic journals , because they have established specialized web pages on the Internet , not only have provided weekly content for articles to be published , but some have even set up links to vast information databases . 
Those projects in which they have invested is large in scale , high in technological content , and strong in competition .  This has raised Shanghai 's entire level of using foreign capital and sped up the development of new and high-tech industries .  
These investment projects are large in scale , with high technological content and strong market competitiveness .  These projects have enhanced Shanghai 's overall level of utilizing foreign capital and accelerated the development of its advanced and new technological industry .  
At the same time , spurred by market forces and supported by bank loans , a number of new-style domestic electrical appliances , computers , mobile phones and so on , with high science and technology content , low energy consumption , and a variety of functions rapidly sprang up , thus further improving market supply .  The quality of China 's economic growth has gradually improved amid both protection and pressure .  
General Secretary Jiang Zemin sent a letter to the National Conference on Popularizing Science , pointing out : We must strengthen in real earnest the work of popularizing science by taking it as an important task aimed at implementing the strategy of " national rejuvenation through science and education " and as an important content of socialist spiritual civilization building ; should energetically popularize scientific knowledge in the whole society ; and should advocate the spirit of science ; publicize scientific thinking ; and disseminate scientific measures ;  
During study and discussion , these localities generally said that the speech made by General Secretary Jiang Zemin at Guangdong 's Gaozhou City and the speeches delivered by the six standing committee members of the Central Political Bureau in these six localities are profound , rich and realistic in content , out of an overall strategic consideration and in light of the actual situation of the building of the county ( city ) leading groups and the leading cadre ranks .  
He said : Proposals received since the Second Session of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee were broad in content .  They primarily concerned the following : Maintaining a sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy ; strengthening agriculture and doing well in rural work ;  
Qinghai is rich in petroleum , natural gas , salt , and nonferrous metal deposits , and it has special climatic conditions for the development of special agriculture and animal husbandry .  There are prospects for attaining development in a leaping-forward way [ kua yue shi de fa zhan 6421-6390-1709-4104-4099-1455 ] in a relatively short period of time , provided that we seize the opportunity , accelerate the progress of reform and opening up , enhance our concept of the market , and pay attention to the scientific and technological content in the exploitation and utilization of resources .  
the industrial structure is irrational , the total number of secondary and tertiary industries is not large enough , with low technological content and poor efficiency .  
Deputy Tian Chengzhong , secretary of Pingdingshan City CPC Committee in Henan , said that ideological and political work includes many aspects such as education content , ways and means , leadership system , operational mechanism , component force , and position carriers [ zhen di zai ti , 7109-0966-6528-7555 ] , and is closely lined with structural reform , the building of the legal system , and cultural construction .  
The content of the proposals is mainly : Maintaining sustained rapid and healthy national economic growth , expanding domestic demand , promoting strategic economic restructuring , continuing to push ahead with reform and strengthening management , speeding up the development of science and technology and education , opening wider to the outside world , intensifying the building of a social security system , stepping up environmental protection , and strengthening the building of spiritual civilization and an honest and clean government .  
The motions handled since the Second Session of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee , which are rich in content , have mainly included those aimed at maintaining sustained , rapid , and healthy national economic growth ; strengthening agriculture and doing a good job in rural work ; continually and energetically pressing ahead with the state-owned enterprise reform ; guarding against and alleviating the financial crisis ; expanding domestic demand ; continually implementing the principle of opening up to the outside world and vigorously opening up the international market ;  
The forum maintained that the forms applied to conduct the education on the legal system for youngsters should be suitable to the youngsters ' cognitive features , and efforts should be made to make the education rich in content and to conduct it in a lively and varied manner .  
The PLA and armed police units are treating the campaign of learning from Lei Feng and Li Xiangqun as an important content of their ideological and political education , organizing the officers and men to learn from the advanced deeds of Lei Feng and Li Xiangqun in light of the realities of army building in the new period , and help the officers and men further their understanding of Lei Feng 's and Li Xiangqun 's lofty spirit .  
The " three representations " is the scientific summary of the Party 's character and aim , is the centralized requirements of maintaining the Party 's advancement , is the creative utilization and development of Theory of Marxism Party building , and is the fundamental guiding ideology of strengthening Party building under new circumstances , which has strong ideological content , theoretical content and distinctive character of the day .  
Schools of different types and at all levels should strive to explore new paths for conducting young people 's and students ' ideological education in the new period , reform and enrich the content of the ideological education courses taught at primary and middle schools and at colleges , actively support and help students to engage in extracurricular activities that are healthy in content , rich and colorful , and loved by them .  
The leaders of the two countries have reached consensus on the 16-character principle of " maintaining long-term stability , gearing to the needs of the future , maintaining good neighborly and friendly relations , and engaging in an all-round cooperation , " and have defined a framework for the future growth of relations between our two countries in the new century .  This has served to enhance mutual understanding and enrich the content of relations between our two parties and two countries .  
Centered on making breakthroughs in the reconnaisance and early warning problems in " striking at three things " and on " bottleneck " problems such as in guarding information in " defending against three things , " we should fully exploit the wisdom and talent of the officers and men , launch extensive mass innovation activities , combine indigenous with foreign things , continually tap the combat potential of the existing armament , and enhance the new technology content .  
In order to raise the strategizing competence of captains in the context of modern naval warfare , this detachment adjusted the content of training and took its vessel formation from yellow waters into blue waters , from training under general inshore conditions to rapid-reaction training under complex conditions in the coastal waters .  
The overall concept and content of human rights are indivisible and unchangeable .  The firm stride of the Chinese people walking toward domestic prosperity is unstoppable .  
some people , seeing others getting rich ahead of them , become mentally unbalanced , are no longer content with the salaried way of life of civil servants , stay aloof from the workers and peasants , draw close to " big money , " and gradually change from small fishing to big corruption .  
Today , with the reforms and opening to the outside , only when leading cadres at all levels possess noble values , strive to become pure people , noble people , people detached from base interests , people benefiting the people , thinking what the masses think , feeling the anxiety of the masses , suffering first , enjoying later , content to live an austere life , and having far-reaching ambitions , can they unite and lead the masses to approach common prosperity sooner .  
This important thinking , with rich content , profound thought and prominent characteristics of the current era , being highly theoretical and practicable , is a new summary of the Party 's nature , of its essential principles and of its historic mission , is a new development in Marxist theory on Party construction and is a new requirement of the Party organizations and cadres at all levels in the new situation .  
As in-depth changes in the military fields in the world are caused by the development of modern science and technology , especially high technology , the scientific and technological content of army building and modern warfare has been increased to an unprecedentedly high level .  This has put ever higher demands on the scientific and cultural qualities of our officers and men .  
After the new technologies and new methods of operation produced through the academy and troops ' joint effort in tackling key problems were popularized and applied in the various relevant units , the scientific and technological content of army training have greatly increased .  As a result , troop training through science and technology , in which the troops under training strike extreme low-altitude , high-speed targets with air defense missiles , has gotten over its " bottleneck " and is developing in the direction of high quality and greater depth .  
In line with a civilian market having abundant technology and products that are suited to the requirements of military equipment , many civilian-use technologies such as electronics technology , information technology , production technology , and materials technologies , all of which have developed rapidly , our army has instituted several " joint logistics reforms " and logistics reforms with " socialized support " as the main content , thus decreasing the burden and lengthening the strides forward .  
In theoretical study , they emphasized the need to grasp the basic content and essence of the " three represents . "  They paid special attention to finding where they lagged behind in practicing the " three represents " and improving rules and regulations based on the " three represents " in their efforts to improve work .  In this way , the study and implementation of the " three represents " has become a major part of the teaching by positive example in the " three stresses " education .  
Studying and understanding the important thinking of the Three Represents should be the key content in such study programs as Party committees central groups , theoretical learning programs for cadres ranked above regiment level and the education through Party 's lectures .  
For illegal publications whose content was not pornographic or criminal , but which had not gone through the approval process , this judicial explanation made it clear that seriously lurid publications and the disruption of orderly markets could be punished as " illegal business operations " .  
The rich ideological content of those songs realizes the spirit of Chairman Jiang 's major instructions on enhancing the Army 's ideological and political education , warmly eulogizes the nature and purposes of the people 's army and the glorious chapters of unity and struggle under the Party leadership , and displays the spiritual outlook of the vigorous and high-fighting spirit contemporary military personnel .  Songs are varied in style .  
With the introduction of modern information technology and with some units hit by an " online craze " , there arises the problem of " deviation " in the content of the ideological and political education , that is , neglect in employing advanced methods to conduct basic indoctrination of basic theories , and unsystematic , incomplete , and even fragmentary expounding of basic principles related to enhance convictions and to conduct oneself .  
Adopting advanced scientific means is meant to serve for ideological and political education .  First of all , content of political education must meet the needs of the times .  Political education content should be colorful and knowledge-based or it will not only not be conducive to solving ideological problems but also will produce negative impacts and cancel out the results of ideological and political education .  
He said : In our professional work , we must always set a high standard and strict demands .  We must acquire superior technique , increase the technology content of training , deep reform , and make constant efforts to explore and sum up new training methods and approaches .  
After being formed into an armored infantry array , " Special Contribution Company No . 5 " equipped itself with new equipment , and its training content has also been changed from a unitary infantry profession into a comprehensive training which integrated armored training with communications and crew training .  
In addition to making great efforts to strengthen ideological and political construction , all military colleges and universities should face modernization , face the world and face the future .  All military colleges and universities should be motivated to update their concepts of education , further update curricular content and methodology , continuously add new aspects to existing theories , knowledge , technology and tactics , and form a curriculum oriented toward the 21st century .  
During recent years , they " sharpened " themselves with the tasks of dealing with the priorities and difficulties in information operations and electronic countermeasures , established more than 20 tasks to tackle difficult problems in science-technology military training , including acquiring new knowledge , mastering new equipment , studying new military tactics and training high-quality personnel .  Through taking specific measures such as fixing the training content , measures , levels , and steps , they institutionalized and standardized science-technology military training .  
Instead of confining the research of the network offensive and defensive operation to leading organs and laboratories , this army unit has incorporated the subject into the training of its troops as a training content ; and this has enabled its troops to initially master the ability of conducting a network offensive and defensive operation .  
At the Central Committee Ideological and Political Work Conference , Comrade Jiang Zemin emphasized that , in the face of the new circumstances and new situation , ideological and political work must make efforts to carry out innovation and improvement on a foundation of carrying on and developing superior traditions and in such areas as content , form , method , means , and mechanisms .  In particular , he stressed , efforts must be made to heighten the sense of the times and strengthen direction , effectiveness , and initiative .  
Educational activities directed at certain targets , defining certain content , and organized around a relative focus , such as winter training for Party members , basic level Party schools , political schools for workers , night schools for peasants , theory study groups for young people , local educational institutes , and various types of training groups , etc .  
To effectively solve this problem , the division has conducted research on simulated high-plateau oxygen-deficient training in light of training troops with science and technology in recent years , and has summed up a complete set of methods for physical training .  As a result , routine training has basically produced the actual results of similar training in places over 4,500 m above the sea level , where only half of the normal oxygen content is in the air .  
Japanese-US joint military exercises have seen great changes in content , form and scale in recent years .  Their advance combat planning has been perfected and their combat capability and level of coordination have been further improved .  The trend of the two sides joining forces in military intervention in the security affairs of the Asia-Pacific region and in the handling of the surrounding situation is becoming more obvious , and this is bound to become a new destabilizing factor in security of the Asia-Pacific region .  
His subjective dynamic role is subject to the restriction of his own scientific and cultural level as well as scientific and technological content . 
This means shifting our civil air defense focus from service to winning high-tech wars , our civil air defense priority to higher high-tech content and establishing quality and better organizational command and emergency rescue capabilities , our civil air defense guidance to construction and management in accordance with law , and our civil air defense efficiency to the real achievement of a good cycle of war readiness , social , and economic efficiency .  
- - - Equipment training system for combat readiness : In the training system , this department adopted a training system which organically combines education in institutions with training in the base and troop training , persisted in conducting complete and united individual training , unit training , training for chiefs and organs , and comprehensive drills , basically built an orderly , regular , and well-coordinated equipment training system for combat readiness , which has a perfect structure and content .  
New scientific theories are the results of summarizing newly verified scientific facts , but we can not ignore the original verified scientific facts ( unless we can scientifically verify that the original beliefs were neither complete nor accurate ) .  We can not repudiate all the scientific content in the original theories that have been scientifically tested .  The evolution of old theories into new theories is not a matter of total repudiation .  
At the same time , the division also scientifically adjusted the content of its training , actively reformed the training methods and approaches , and built a number of simulated supplementary training laboratories .  As a result , the new armament 's automation , information , and combination functions are fully utilized and quickly transformed into combat strength .  
With the growing high-tech content in modern armaments , there are increasingly high requirements on our armed forces ' officers and soldiers in connection with scientific and cultural knowledge and military technological qualities .  
Only thus can we avoid making subjective judgments and acting blindly .  Only by persisting in seeking truth from facts can the content of arduous struggle be unceasingly renewed , the hardworking spirit be passed on to future generations , and the banner of arduous struggle attract , amass , and inspire the people .  
Some anti-chemical warfare equipment with high technological content have been successively developed and produced .  A modern anti-chemical warfare system being capable of observation , detection , cleanup , diffusing smoke and burning has been formed .  The main battle outfit is capable of defense against the three kinds of attacks .  
Starting in the late 1980 ' s and the early 1990 ' s , the US military has stepped up studies and practice in joint training , carried out exploration in the structure , content , order , rules , and means of joint training , and gradually formed a complete set of joint training structures with marked characteristics .  
They have achieved marked S &amp; T troop training results , sharply cultivating high-quality military talent , daring to reform and innovate , adhering to scientific objectivity , reforming training content , improving training methods , and creating innovative training means , to have made a prominent contribution to the in-depth development of S &amp; T troop training throughout the PLA .  
The five kinds of spirit proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin are a new development and summation of various kinds of lofty spirit that have emerged in a long process of the party 's cause of uniting with and fighting together with the people .  They have carried forward and nurtured our national spirit .  They have a rich ideological content and distinct characteristics of the times .  
The main contradiction plaguing the western regional garrisons ' logistical construction is the low standard of scientific and technological innovations and the key logistics elements ' low scientific and technological content .  There is a serious lack of qualified science and technology and well-educated personnel .  
The state has decided to make infrastructure construction the base , strengthening the protection and construction of the ecological environment the main content , grasping the readjustment of the industrial structure the key , developing scientific and technological education the basic condition , and thorough reform and expanded open up the strong driving force of development .  
Institutions of higher learning shall introduce an appropriate curriculum in national defense education ; senior middle schools and schools equivalent to senior middle schools shall introduce a special content of national defense education into relevant curricula and may conduct diverse forms of activities in national defense education among their students .  
He stated that the science and technology hall is an important place for people to acquire scientific and technical knowledge , understand science and technology , and exchange S &amp; T knowledge and results , as well as being a base for primary and middle-school students to engage in quality education , so we should make full use of existing facilities , enhancing the content of the exhibits and also doing a good job of making the briefings and lectures lively and explaining difficult concepts in simple terms .  
At the Guangdong Trade Show , there was one point of view which received general assent : The leap from a large foreign trade country to a foreign trade power rests on transformation of China 's entire economic structure and expansion methods , and within that transformation there must be strong promotion of new high technology export products in addition to the use of new high technology to refurbish traditional industries and raise the overall technological content and value added of export products .  
In early 1999 , the PLA general departments decided to build through three stages and within three years this innovation project by following the train of thought for work : Ensuring unified leadership , formulating advance theories , testing results through practice , working out plans at the top level , and simultaneously building all arms and services , with an eye on introducing a new system of training content in light of the requirements for fighting and winning a local war under hi-tech conditions .  
Raidi , chairman of the Standing Committee of the Tibetan Autonomous Regional People 's Congress , noted : " Tibet is at its best time in history , for it now enjoys sound social progress , economic growth , and national unity ; its border defense remains strong and consolidated ; and its people are living a prosperous and content life .  All this does not come easily . "  
He noted : " Today , a constant increase has been registered in the income of peasants in our Naxi Town , and people in all parts of Tibet are leading a prosperous and content life .  All this comes from the fact that we enjoy a stable and relaxed social environment .  
As our reform is entering a crucial stage of storming fortified positions , new developments and problems have emerged in large numbers , such as the work of preparing for military struggle with the aim of winning the war and not become morally degenerate , and the cadre system reform with the implementation of the raw on Officers on Active Service and the temporary Measures for Resettling Demobilized Soldiers as the content . 
There are 21 provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities that have formulated rules and regulations on the study and application of laws among the leading cadres , and have clearly defined that whether a cadre possesses necessary legal knowledge and whether he is capable of managing affairs strictly according to law should be taken as a major content for the assessment of his work performance .  
Commenting on the " Shanghai Five " summit to be held in June this year , Akayev emphatically pointed out that the gratifying thing about this sixth summit is that it would be held in Shanghai this year , where the " Shanghai spirit " with mutual trust , mutual benefit , mutual consultation and mutual respect of the diversity and common development of culture as its basic content was born .  
Through the previous period of study , the majority of Party members in the military have obtained a certain level of awareness and understanding of the rich content and political , theoretical and practical meaning of the important thinking of the " three represents " .  However , this important thinking is broad , extensive and profound , with very rich content .  
The responsible official at the foreign trade division of MOFTEC concluded that all the aforementioned facts showed that the temporary protective measures the Japanese side imposed against the three Chinese farm products severely ran counter to WTO rules in terms of its procedure and its substantial content .  
At present , the important " three represents " thinking has become a major topic in the theoretical study of the entire party and a focal point of the " three stresses " education conducted among leading cadres at all levels .  It has also become an important content of our theoretical research and propaganda work conducted by our press circles .  Practicing the " three represents " thinking has become a conscious act of the broad masses of party members and cadres .  
Strengthening socialist ideological and ethical building constitutes the essential content of and a key link in developing China 's advanced culture .  
Communist China will extensively revise its party constitution at the 16th CPC National Congress to be held next year .  Besides the inclusion of Jiang Zemin 's " three represents , " the revised party constitution will include content on expanding the representation of party membership .  People of various social strata will be allowed to join the party , including proprietors of private enterprises , individual business operators , and those who are not " proletariat " so long as they are " ideologically and politically " qualified with correct " behavior . "  
A large number of private enterprise owners and individual business operators have emerged .  Besides , there are also people at managerial level of foreign funded enterprises and independent workers .  Therefore , China 's society can no longer be divided simply based on people 's class content .  
Go a step further in optimizing foreign companies ' investment in the industrial structure , raise foreign companies ' investment in the content of science and technology , continually expand the scope of foreign companies ' investment , strive to complete the regional distribution of foreign companies ' investment , encourage foreign companies to invest in our central and western areas , improve the legal system concerning foreign investment , further transform the role of government , and carry forward administration according to law .  
The meeting unanimously agreed : General Secretary Jiang 's important speech is very insightful , all-embracing , rich in content , and of great significance , it has very strong political character , theoretical traits , strategic nature , and relevance .  
Vice-Principal Feng Guoqiang of the Party school of the Shangxi provincial Party committee said that the thinking of " three represents " precisely grasps the three most fundamental and decisive factors about social order , most clearly reflects the advanced nature of our Party , brings to light the content of our Party 's advanced nature , and answers the issue of how to maintain the advanced nature of our Party from an ideological point of view .  
Ferreting out the " protective umbrella " of underworld and evil forces should be perceived as a major content of the current drive of investigating and handling on-the-job crimes , as an emphasis of the work in deeply promoting the anti-corruption campaign , and as an important content of the work in examining and approving the arrests of criminals and in examining lawsuits .  No matter what unit and what persons are involved , all cases must be investigated thoroughly regardless of obstructions so that the evil forces can be rooted out .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's 1 July speech adheres to the unity of the historical and current views , the unity of moving forward and developing Marxism and the unity of the theory and reality .  This important speech comprehensively , systematically and profoundly reveals the rich content , the scientific spirit and the mutual relationship among the " three represents " and explicitly points out the guiding and theoretical significance of the " three represents " on Party-building and the political , economic and cultural development of our country .  
The experiment on the reform of the state treasury centralized collection and payment system should be carried out in accordance with the guiding ideology and basic principles approved by the State Council , and the specific content of reform should be implemented step by step around core issues such as the establishment of single treasury accounts and the standardization of procedures for receipts , disbursements , payments and appropriations , with attention to the key areas of reform .  
As a matter of fact , the mainland has explained the content of the " one country , two systems " in the past through various channels .  But the analyst pointed out that this is the first time a very high senior official with the rank of vice premier of the State Council has talked specifically about the concrete content of the " one country , two systems " to be applied to Taiwan , and it has therefore attracted wide attention from overseas media .  
All levels of discipline inspection and supervision organs and all cadres involved in the discipline inspection and supervision work must have an in-depth understanding of the scientific content of the major thinking of the " Three Represents , " implement the " Three Represents " requirements in the entire process of the discipline inspection and supervision work , further intensify the party work style building and clean administration building and the anti-corruption work , and constantly score new results in the anti-corruption work and in the promotion of clean administration building .  
Enhancing socialist ideological and ethics building is a major content of developing an advanced culture , and one of the important things is to do well in ideological and ethics building among leading cadres , particularly among senior level cadres .  
The 16 November letter indicated that , " Your association 's representatives propose that at this working discussion , with the precondition of mutual understanding , each side will use the verbal statement method to express the one-China principle , and propose the specific content of the expression , and this will make it explicit that both sides of the strait support the one-China principle .  This content will thereafter be conveyed to Taiwan publications . "  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech , he pointed out , persisted in being guided by Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , applied the party 's ideological line of emancipating the minds and seeking truth from facts , systematically and comprehensively enunciated the scientific content of the " three represents " principle , provided profound answers to major issues to be resolved in order to enhance and improve party building under new historical conditions , and further clarified the party 's historical tasks and objectives of striving in the new century .  
It is understood that in light of the harmful social effects of false tabloid reports that deviate from correct opinion , exaggerate " hot spots of society , " and play up vulgarities , the SPPA issued the circular banning the press from publishing the following content :  
Mou went on : In the new century , we 're bound to see a faster flow of goods , services , information , capital , and personnel .  With global economic cooperation constantly renewed and upgraded in terms of content and mode , we 're also bound to witness endless drastic changes in global trade in terms of operational speed , operational mode , and enterprises ' production mode and operative mode as well .  
and penalty clauses and supplementary provisions .  The regulations clearly state that printing operators are required to abide by relevant laws and regulations and to set great store by social effects , and are prohibited from printing publications , tastefully packaged printed matter , and other printed matter containing reactionary , obscene , superstitious , and state-banned content .  
Wen Jiabao said , since 1998 , in view of the temporary excess of supply exceeding demand and the fall in market grain prices that have emerged in grain production , the CPC Central Committee and State Council have achieved marked results in implementing reforms of the grain circulation setup with " three policies and one reform " as the chief content ; this decision was based on the overall situation of protecting the peasants ' interests and consolidating the foundation status of agriculture .  
Li Rongrong , the chair of this meeting and Chairman of China 's Economic and Trade Commission , said that the meeting with its rich content and packed program produced fruitful results and completed all set agendas without a hitch .  The participating ministers and representatives exchanged their successful practices and experiences at the meeting , put forward many constructive suggestions and proposals , and achieved a common understanding on many issues .  These common understanding and proposals were given full embodiment in the Joint Statement .  
The main content of the program is as follows : emphasizing the conducting of high-tech development in concentrated manner , with the technologies to be developed capable of resulting in the locating and triggering the most effective economic growth points , so as to lay a foundation for fundamentally changing the economic structure , to make exports oriented toward final products with high technology contents , and to satisfy the demand of domestic markets with domestic products of high technological standards ;  
It has been disclosed that most of the A-Category group armies of Nanjing and Guangzhou theaters deployed along the southeast coastal frontline have been equipped with warships in their establishments .  In this connection , the crack troops which have been formed and carefully selected from the two theaters have been sent to the navy stage by stage and group by group to receive professional training with sea-crossing and landing operations as the content .  
The Chinese constitution stipulates that the citizens enjoyment of full and extensive human rights is the basic right and freedom making up the chief content of human rights ; the constitution stipulates that when the citizens execute their rights and freedoms , they can not harm the national , societal , or collective interests , nor impinge on the freedom and rights of other citizens ;

the multi-polarization trend in the world pattern is irreversible ; and the competition of comprehensive national strength with the economic , scientific , technological , and military strength as well as national cohesion as the main content is tending to become more acute .  Judging from the general situation , peace and development remain the theme of the times .  
The circular demanded : We should deepen theory study by taking the important thinking of " three represents " as a core content and should further deepen understanding of the basic theoretical view of " three stresses , " and invigorate and grasp study in a down-to-earth manner in light of the characteristics at the grass-roots level and in various forms . 
Enterprises should observe the formula and content as stipulated by the national unified accounting system and base on the correctly ratified account bookkeeping record and other related information to make accounting statement , so to make sure the content is complete , figures real , and calculation correct .  Under-reporting and random selection or omission are not allowed .  
The speech was one of great foresight , profound thinking , incisive exposition , and rich content , containing many new thoughts and new viewpoints .  It constitutes an important Marxist document of strategic , overall , and farsighted nature , and it has the important significance of providing guidance on strengthening and improving the party 's ideological and political work , on comprehensively strengthening party building , and on advancing the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
It is required by the " opinions " to regard safeguarding social security and stability as an important content of supporting the big west development , strengthen the fundamental functional education of our army , satisfactorily complete the tasks of defending territory and safeguarding frontiers , and provide a firm and forceful security guarantee for the big west development .  
In vigorously grasping implementation , it is necessary to enhance and improve the party 's ideological and political work , and carry out some tangible innovation and improvement in its content , form , method , and means , on the basis of inheriting and carrying forward its fine traditions ; in particular , it is necessary to make big efforts in increasing the sense of the era and enhancing appropriateness , effectiveness , and initiative ; this will become the key point in enhancing and improving ideological and political work in the future .  
Zhu Bangzao said , there is another important content of this statement , that is , non-strategic ABM defensive systems that are not banned under the ABM treaty , and international cooperation in this field , should not damage the security of other countries , should not lead to the establishment and strengthening of closed military and political blocs , and should not damage global and regional stability and security .  
The participants unanimously held that General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's speech was a brilliant exposition and very rich in content .  It was strongly political and theoretical in nature and it stressed the important position of theoretical work .  It put forward the tasks and demands on theoretical work , and explained a series of major theoretical and practical fundamental issues that concern the overall situation .  
The content of the revisions mainly comprises three aspects : First , we have revised section 2 of article 7 of the law in effect as follows : People 's governments at all levels should place under local management departments educational , medical , and security organs established in enterprises such as farms and forestry farms for the placement of returned overseas Chinese , and should make rational arrangements and adjustments according to need .

When the talks were about to conclude , the SEF representative proposed three more forms of expression and also produced the content of their final expression : " Although in the course of the common efforts of both sides in pursuing national reunification , both sides uphold the one China principle , they have different understanding regarding the meaning of one China .  
To be more specific , Internet police are mainly responsible for carrying out supervision , analyzing information content that flows through local communication systems or the Internet , fighting computer viruses , cracking down on Internet crimes , and stop the spread of harmful information .  
Looking at the long term , to ensure that Chinese products can truly advance on the international market , it is essential to enhance the technical content and added value of export commodities ; winning by quality is the effective way to deal with antidumping accusations .  
With respect to the reform of the circulation methods , we must put the emphasis on promoting chain operations , material circulation and allocation and delivery , multi-formatted through-transport , and other organizational forms and service formats .  Today , it is especially important to pay attention to developing material circulation and allocation and delivery and use modern management methods and service techniques to transform traditional commerce and increase the technological content and raise service standard to promote the rise in the overall standard of the circulation industry .  
In pushing forward the " five breakthroughs and one strengthening " in trade union work , we must not feel content simply because such work is under way in accordance with the procedure .  What is crucial is to see if such work has produced tangible results , i.e . , if the legitimate rights and interests of the employees have been successfully protected , whether or not the employees approve of it , and whether or not it is beneficial to the reform , development , and stability of enterprises .  
The " Report " accuses the Chinese Government of adopting legislation to control the Internet , babbling that " the new laws adopted on 26 September 2000 prohibit any material whose content is held to be subverting the state regime , supporting so-called cults , sabotaging reunification with Taiwan , and damaging China 's reputation " ; it also makes the accusation that " special Internet police have been established in about 20 provinces with the aim of removing information with sexual content .

We have to make the opening of administrative affairs an important content of the party leading cadre annual work exam and responsible system of the honest political structure of the party discipline , and use the results of the exam as the important fundamental of punishing and rewarding the cadres .  
At the same time we must make strengthening professional training the focal point for raising labor quality , at appropriate times moving technical and industrial training guidance onto the track with professional training as the mainstay .  We must forcefully develop professional education , reform training content , and strengthen the focused nature , practicality , and effectiveness of training .  
Finally , Zhang Zuoji said that actively promoting reform of the basic medical insurance system for urban and township professionals is also an important content for perfecting the social insurance system .  We must advance in equal measure reform of both the medical insurance system and the medical agency and pharmaceutical commodity circulation system , guiding all localities to step up implementation of medical insurance system reform programs , truly strengthening basic management , and stable expanding coverage .  
As briefed by public security organs , the content of the confiscated illegal publicity materials included materials to publicize false reasoning and heresies of " Falungong " heretical cult , to instigate people to violate laws and create disturbances , and to viciously spread rumors to slander against the government and state leaders .  
Li Hongzhi , however , who has thrown in his lot with western anti-China forces , has refused to give up his evil designs ; he has repeatedly disseminated his fallacies of " ascend to heaven on consummation , " " go beyond forbearance , " and " cause blood to flow , " and hoodwinked and incited " Falungong " diehards who are mentally controlled by him to make a reckless move , not even stinting to being content that " Falungong " addicts should die in order to reach his unspeakable political goals .  
China 's forthcoming accession to the WTO , economic globalization , and the country 's participation in the international division of labor in the economic field all require China to make drastic readjustments to its industrial structure , make best use of its advantages and bypass its disadvantages , and enhance its international competitiveness .  This explains why the 10th Five-Year Plan has made structural readjustment its main line .  Structural readjustment has a fairly extensive connotation , and industrial structural readjustment serves as its core content .  
In a chance meeting during the first spring of the new century , deputies of the National People 's Congress and members of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference attending the " two sessions " chatted to their heart 's content , held animated discussions , recalled the glorious milestones of the Ninth Five-Year Plan , commented on the current trend of events in the world , and looked ahead to the splendid prospects of the 10th Five-Year Plan .

Under the conditions of a socialist market economy , carrying forward and developing the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation , giving rise to a sound common practice of respecting , providing for , assisting the elderly in society , and building up a harmonious relationship between different generations is a major content for our current socialist spiritual civilization building .  
In conformity with the requirements for WTO accession , " local content , " " export performance " and other stipulations that are inconsistent with WTO rules will be removed from this basic law for foreign investment which paved the way for the rush of foreign investors into the country .  The present amendment is the biggest move made by China to date in its review and revision of foreign-related laws and regulations in anticipation of WTO accession .  
The deputies were of the opinion that the NPC standing committee 's work report delivered by NPC Chairman Li Peng has a substantive content , highlights priorities , focuses strongly on specific issues , is factual and truthful in its summary of the NPC standing committee 's work in the past year , and maps out inspiring plans for this year 's work .  
The conveying and study of this spirit must take as its main content the important remarks made in the report by Premier Zhu Rongji and the speech made by Chairman Jiang Zemin at the plenary session of the PLA delegation , combining these with and studying the remarks made by other leaders of the Military Commission and guiding the officers and men to recognize clearly the huge accomplishments made by our nation in national economic and social development during the " Ninth Five-Year Plan " and building confidence in the task of establishing socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
" As textbook is one of the resources to support teaching , its content should be impartial and factually correct to facilitate training of independent thinking and analytical skills amongst students .  " Thus , in December 1995 , basic principles and examples from a number of subjects were given to textbook publishers associations on textbook revision .  Those basic principles included ' revision should be kept to the minimum and complete revision of textbooks should be avoided ' .  
The Code lays down detailed requirements on how to handle obscene and indecent materials transmitted via the Internet . These include requiring members of the Association to take appropriate measures to prevent Internet users from placing or transmitting obscene material on the Internet and to block access to the problematic Web site if necessary .  Regarding indecent material suitable for adults only , the Code requires local content providers and distributors to include in the Web page concerned a warning that such material is not suitable for publication to persons under the age of 18 .  
Mr Kwong noted that harmonisation of internal codes for Chinese characters was not enough .  Equally important issues that demanded immediate attention included the provision of more sophisticated and user-friendly conversion tools capable of supporting the use of traditional and simplified Chinese characters ; the development of an efficient and effective mechanism for searching and retrieving information in either traditional and simplified Chinese characters on the Internet ; and above all the provision of content in Chinese .  
" A newspaper recently engaged the officially accreditated Acts Testing Lab to conduct water quality testings for the Council 's ten public swimming pools .  The results revealed that the bacterial count in the water samples of two swimming pools exceeded the standard limit ; the residual chlorine content in two swimming pools was on the high side and the same content in another two below the legally restricted level .  
( a ) according to the standard set by the Department of Health , the residual chlorine content in the pool water of a swimming pool which uses chlorine as primary disinfectant should be kept at a minimum of 1.0 part per million ( ppm ) . 
Will the Government inform this Council whether it conducts regular sample tests on the motor vehicle diesel imported to Hong Kong to ascertain if its sulphur content has exceeded the statutory maximum allowable sulphur content of 0.05 per cent ; if it conducts such tests , of the highest , lowest , average and medium sulphur contents in the samples tested in the past year ?  
" To foster safety culture in the younger generation and to enhance safety awareness amongst secondary school graduates , the Curriculum Development Council has agreed to enrich the existing curriculum in respect of basic knowledge of occupational safety and health .

The proposed presumption stipulates that light diesel oil found in the fuel tank of a motor vehicle with a sulphur content in excess of the maximum level prescribed under the Air Pollution Control ( Motor Vehicle Fuel ) Regulations , currently at 0.05% by weight , is presumed to be dutiable .  
" The presumption is reasonable because illicit fuel usually has a sulphur content higher than 0.05% by weight whereas light diesel oil from legitimate sources on which duty has been paid must have a sulphur content at or below 0.05% .  This is because the supply for vehicular use of light diesel oil with a sulphur content higher than 0.05% is prohibited under the Air Pollution Control ( Motor Vehicle Fuel ) Regulations .  
As for promoting technological entrepreneurship , the Small Entrepreneurship Research Assistance Programme under the ITF provides pre-venture capital funding on a matching basis to small , technology-based and entrepreneurship driven companies to undertake projects with innovative and technology content , thereby increasing their chance of successful development of new products , new processes or new services .  
Institutes funded by the UGC will establish close linkage with the industry through their respective consultative committees which comprise industry representatives .  Taking into account the needs of the industry and the community , the institutes will adjust the content and the number of places for individual courses to ensure that both the quality and the number of graduates can address the needs of Hong Kong 's economic development .  
Having examined the programme structure , design and content of individual courses , teaching and learning materials , the modes of teaching , the assessment methods , and other relevant aspects of course delivery , the HKCAA has concluded that the Springboard programme , in totality , can appropriately prepare students with a general level of knowledge and skills for employment purpose , which is comparable to the level of knowledge and skill expected of a graduate with five HKCEE passes .  
To ensure a reflection of the true pictures of the history , Museum staff conducted a series of dedicated exercises to collect relevant information after the content of each exhibit area had been decided on .  Besides consulting reference materials , local and overseas scholars , they also conducted site visits and interviews to enrich the contents of the exhibition .  
The open access regime we have created in Hong Kong will mean that it is not only the successful licensees who can provide innovative 3G services .  Other operators and providers of content will have the opportunity to provide exciting services over these networks at a fair price .  In particular , the regime should encourage capable small and medium enterprises to design and provide creative mobile applications .  So Hong Kong is well positioned to be a world centre for 3G innovation , * said Mr Anthony Wong , Telecommunications Authority .  
It has been reported that in the middle of last year the authorities in Shanghai conducted laboratory tests on samples drawn from 53 tea leaves products distributed by 36 enterprises and found that 18 samples contained a lead content exceeding the national standard .  
Relevant departments at present only request in the contracts with the cleansing contractors / providers to provide clean and hygienic toilet paper with no specific standard set for the bacterial content .  
It has been reported that the Government stated publicly some time ago that , after the implementation of the first stage of the Harbour Area Treatment Scheme , the water quality on the eastern side of Victoria Harbour had improved considerably , and the bacteria content therein had also dropped significantly to such a level that it was safe for people to swim in the water .  As such , it would actively consider resurrecting the cross-harbour swimming race that had been suspended for years in the Harbour .  
Only 3% considered their quality to be low or very low , and the most often cited reasons were the content being not meaningful ( 33% ) , crude language used by the programme hosts ( 24% ) and not enough educational and informational programmes ( 14% ) .  
It involves selecting a list of the major historical storms which had induced severe landslips or flooding , computing the rainfall amounts brought by these storms to areas of different sizes , and maximizing these rainfall amounts to those that would be obtained if the water vapour content in the storms attained the climatological maximum .  
The new e-newsletter features a clean and neat design and allows readers to have quick and easy access to its content .  The content of the online newsletter will be enriched with more stories about Hong Kong to keep readers abreast of its developments as Asia 's world city .  Latest policy initiatives of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government and recent business trends in Hong Kong will be covered .  
Should the ISSOs be the subject matter of legal proceedings decisive of an individual 's civil rights and obligations or criminal liability , the content of the relevant Orders will be the subject of argument and interpretation in a public hearing and published in a judgment made public , as required by Article 10 of the Hong Kong Bill or Rights Ordinance , Cap . 383 which implements Article 14 ( 1 ) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .  
His extensive use of the knife techniques creates simple but charming figures . His humble origin and diligent nature are apparent in the content of his art . His works radiate power and beauty . Ju Ming was born in Miaoli during the Second World War .  
The area is divided into two sections , separated with stainless steel netting to facilitate the disposal of the waste left by the fish . Thus , a delicate balance is kept between the acid and alkali content of the water , which helps to improve the growth of the abalone .  
In 1969 , an electricity generating plant was built on the island , and in 1978 an underwater cable was completed linking the island to electricity services in Pingtung County . At present , 97 percent of homes on the island are electrified . In the past , drinking water came from underground sources which were high in nitric acid content , and in the dry season , often inadequate .  
As well as texts , each entry in the work also comprises basic biographical information concerning the author ; complete bibliographical information concerning the first edition of the work ; a summary of the content , analysis or appraisal of the work ; and references to contemporary reviews , secondary works and translations into English .  
Variety shows are well designed to create illusory effects through special lighting effects , snazzy camerawork and dubbing to videotapes . Once young pop fans are swept up in all this , why should they worry about its content and meaning ?  
These two legends , which are almost identical in content , tell of a pious woman ( actually Ksitigharbha in a previous existence ) whose earthly mother often killed living things and committed sinful deeds .  
In that case , what do such marks and placings really represent ? In addition , newspaper opinion polls often do n't follow social science principles . Things like sampling procedure , model size , content of the questions and margin of error are vital indicators when deciding whether a poll is trustworthy . But polls can be distorted by neglecting certain aspects , either by cutting them out altogether or by burying them away in a brief comment near the end of the article .  
Those who finished high in the number of interpellations expressed satisfaction that their daily diligence at pursuing public policy is finally laid out for the public . Others are busy trying to defend themselves , patiently explaining to reporters why their numbers of interpellations are so low , or so biased in content toward a single side .  
The " Civil Service Performance Review Law " which has just passed its third reading in the Legislative Yuan is sending a little " red envelope " to all government employees in time for the new year : The content of the civil service performance review bonus has been changed from " base pay " to " full pay . " This will almost double the original amount , making civil servants ' wallets once again a subject of after-dinner discussion .  
This Chinese Hamlet is a story of emotional entanglements and moral dilemmas , because Chinese drama is strong on narrative , weak on emotional outpourings , and depends more on beautiful literary language than on philosophical content .  
This is because economic prosperity brought by industrial prosperity has led to luxuriant lives and long-term extravagant consumption of foods which are too rich and have too high a fat content , leading to overburdening the body 's organs , generating in turn obesity , high blood pressure , and diabetes .  
However there is the case of Taiwan 's only Hakka Bullfight team located in Wanluan Rural Township : While there is nothing unique about the content of their performances , after the bamboo bovine has finished in the temple , he must pass inspection from the temple Master who attaches an amulet before the animal is allowed to leave ; this adds the function of expelling evil .  
According to a survey done three years ago by Shao Li-fang , a lecturer at Shih Chien College , less than a third of unmarried people considered themselves " elite singles , " as a popular Chinese expression goes . Although most of them said they were content with their lot , half admitted they were lonely and missed having someone to take care of them .  
" A flat expansive land with neatly arranged dwellings , beautiful fields and lakes , mulberry and bamboo ; paths criss-cross the fields , cocks crow and dogs bark . . . aged and infants alike are happy and content . "  
Lin Ming-te says emphatically , " We are always calling for a Chinese cultural renaissance , and saying that modern architecture should be imbued with a traditional aesthetic . It 's a shame that one essential element is conspicuously missing from the vast majority of large public structures exhibiting a classical Chinese flavor - - the traditional poetic couplet . Most homes also give little thought to the content of their New Year 's couplets . "  
Film critic and dramatist Huang Chien-yeh lauds Stan Lai as an intelligent , expert creator with a strong sense of the social pulse who is a master at handling transitions , at propelling the action forward and at providing an abundance of content in a tightly knit structure . However , he only touches on the surface and reins himself in , stopping at a cheerful and upbeat level before delving into deeper concerns .  
On the software side , going into a modern theater meant the plot had to be tight and polished , not like the traditional outdoor stage with just a broad idea and the content left to the actors ' emotions to elaborate .  
The scrap metal dealers in Wanli in Tainan want to extract the most valuable metals , so they wash the scrap in acid . " Low-value " copper is washed out with the acid , and flows into the neighboring Er-jen River , both of whose banks are planted with the hollow green veggie . " The content of copper in the convolvulus is very high , " says Wang .  
They continually penetrate the soil , eating an amount of soil each day equal to their body weight , while their digestive system is like a factory line sucking in rough earth and waste and producing " night soil beads , " which are superior to bits of ordinary soil . Besides having greater air content , these " night soil beads " also have one third more water and microbes . Earthworm manure is excellent fertilizer .  
According to estimates of the scientific community , before a chlorine atom becomes inactive , its " power " is enough to destroy 10,000 ozone molecules . Add to this that mankind has continued to release vast amounts of CFCs into the atmosphere , and it 's no surprise that in the past few years the average ozone content at every latitude has fallen between one to ten percentage points . Further , at present the rate of loss is increasing 2-3% annually .  
The original content of the 24 Solar Terms was very simple , but over many years , they slowly developed into focal points for an extremely fertile cultural milieu . They are guides to farming life , reference dates for weather forecasting and holidays for all sorts of ceremonial activities . Almanacs , the weather , agriculture , the general life of the community - - all abide under the shadow of the Solar Terms !  
Meanwhile , China 's painters , living amidst domestic turmoil and foreign invasion , felt the pressure of disappearing traditions . Forced to absorb the creative techniques and methods of the West , China 's painters devoted their efforts to the reform of traditional painting , seeking an East-West fusion of technique . The content of their paintings abounded in themes of ethnic consciousness . Western painting thus followed completely different courses of development in China and Taiwan .  
When we chose the book labels as gifts , we simply thought they had an old-fashioned elegance and would be nice to collect . We never thought that the negative side of their content would lead to a misunderstanding . Because our paper-cut stories are mainly intended to be amusing and tell a story , many of them have a negative or ironic side to their meaning . This is true , for instance , of stories in recent issues such as " Both on the Losing End , " and " No Silver Buried Here . "  
Because the open style of our questions elicited a wide variety of opinions , expressed in an even greater variety of ways , for ease of statistical presentation we have combined the answers into various broad categories such as positive , negative or neutral , while reflecting the more detailed content in narrative form .  
Analyzing the content of the replies , in fact the positive and negative replies do not contradict each other . In other words , almost all our interviewees acknowledged that the Japanese army was both " brave and loyal " ( towards Japan ) and " cruel and ruthless " ( towards the countries they invaded ) . The only difference was in whether they personally tended to like the Japanese for this , or despise them .  
The situation was becoming intolerable , and after much thought one of Augustus ' courtiers , von Tschirnhausen , who was an amateur alchemist , concluded there were only two ways to solve this thorny problem : one was to find a way to transmute base metals into gold , so the emperor could buy porcelain to his heart 's content ; the other was to go to the root of the problem by finding the secret of making porcelain !  
As for dialogue content , in addition to those traditional scripts that still sound fresh after a hundred listenings , some people have begun to offer up new creations in step with current times . And the language employed is no longer Beijing Mandarin with its heavily retroflexed consonants . In recent years , comic dialogues have imperceptibly gone through an unprecedented metamorphosis - - they are now often recited in local dialects .  
When Hsiu Ping-shan " retired " from politics , he drew inspiration from the recently popular " all-you-can-eat " restaurants to establish his own " all-you-can-write " center . The store is replete with brushes , ink , paper and ink stone , as well as exemplary calligraphy from all the great masters . Air conditioning and tea are provided , and a teacher even gives free instruction . Customers can arrive empty-handed and write to their hearts ' content .  
I feel like a late 20th century George Catlin , who traveled the American West painting portraits of native Americans . Armed with a camera rather than a paintbrush , I have the chance to capture Yunnan 's minorities in all their happy glory , while they still feel content within their ancient cultural perimeters . What began as a documentary exercise evolved into something more personal .  
In terms of texture , the proportions of protein and fiber can be adjusted to produce different sensations . Thus , chicken is relatively coarse , so the substitute is made with a higher proportion of fiber . Fish is more tender , so the protein content is raised . Add to this that the dishes are processed using the same cooking techniques as for meat-frying in oil , roasting-and the result is that you can hardly tell the veggies from the real things .  
Ann Philips , a retired professor from the Spanish department at the University of Central Oklahoma , cited the example of how the Maya script was deciphered : for many years researchers could only puzzle over those exquisite human figures and other images , but could not interpret them ; in the end it was an " amateur " - the painter Linda Schele-who interpreted the script from the content of the images themselves , and thus solved many mysteries about the history of Mayan dynastic succession .  
In September 1994 the Cultural Committee of the Preparatory Committee began to formally discuss such matters as the names and emblems of government departments and agencies , arrangements for public holidays , the design and issue of postage stamps , the content of school textbooks , recognition of academic qualifications and so on , and also affirmed the principle of removing the visible trappings of colonial rule . Since then , wave after wave of actions to remove historical symbols has swept through both the public and private sectors .  
But a name can not be changed on a whim-the content of courses and research programs has to be planned beforehand . Chou is also aware how quickly times are changing : even the situation five years from now can not be predicted , and someone who is only familiar with one branch of knowledge can not respond to change . The orientation of systems science is for students to learn how to " integrate " knowledge of different fields such as materials science , thermal flux and nuclear engineering .  
Furthermore , in the past it was easy to start a business with little capital , and both blue and white collar workers would aim to set up on their own once they had saved some money . " No-one is content to remain a lowly member of the working classes - - everyone wants to better themselves .  
He also is " allergic " to abstract modern art . He feels that these artists merely want to express their individuality by doing something strange and different , but without putting in any real effort in terms of content or technique , so that they can not find resonance with the broad public .  
These periodicals and books are of a very high standard and have a respected position in international sinology . Their diverse content includes economics , literature ( both classical and modern ) , politics , history , philosophy and so on . These publications constitute a major textual resource for academic research .  
No taste like home Old Confucius was not the only one who was partial to raw fish . Poet Zhang Han of the Western Jin ( 265-317 ) was appointed an official in the capital Luoyang . But when the autumn winds began to blow he was so overcome with nostalgia for the thick watershield soup and sliced raw sea bass of his native Suzhou that he said : " What matters most in life is to be content .  
On the subject of differentiation of content , Wang Zhidong says that wherever a website is based , its content has to be decided by local users . For instance , in Taiwan and Hong Kong people are mainly interested in entertainment and leisure , spicy show business news and the stock market ; but in mainland China the most popular subject is sport , especially football . People from Beijing or Shanghai often fall out online over the teams they support .  
A further key element of the counter-pornography policy is the TV classification system introduced in January this year , similar to movie classifications , in which programs are graded and color-coded according to content : red for " restricted , " yellow for " parental guidance , " blue for " protected " and green for " general audience . "  
From today 's perspective we see that although the government has maintained a continuous , unbroken hold on Taiwan , it long since underwent significant changes : from the tight control over the country in the early years , when the national leader was supreme , to the no-holds-barred democracy of today ; from a reverential attachment to Confucian orthodoxy and the complete rejection of any notion that the leadership could content itself with ruling just a small fragment of the original country , to today 's chaotic national identity .  
In 1996 , the US Congress passed the Communications Decency Act in an attempt to regulate Internet content . The act made the creation , transmission or solicitation of materials lewd , obscene or harmful to minors via the Internet a crime punishable by up to two years imprisonment and / or a fine of up to US $ 25,000 . The bill faced continuous opposition from within legal circles throughout its approval process and prompted the American Civil Liberties Union to sue on constitutional grounds .  
With their relatively low moisture content , the woody structure of Formosan acacias possess just the right degree of firmness , not at all like the damp and spongy wood of the Okinawa pine or the gunpowder trees commonly seen in rural northern Taiwan . The lower moisture content makes the heartwood of the acacia resistant to parasitic insects , allowing it to remain standing long after the tree 's outer layers have rotted away .  
A few days ago my old friend Hsieh Chun-teh let me have a look at his most recent book , an experimental collection of 50 digital images that he has spent the last five years working on . Comparing it with the works he has published using conventional photographic techniques , I feel that , in terms of both form and content , he has gone beyond his old self , and he has also showed how photographers of the future can make use of digital imaging technology .  
For instance , the course content offered by his college 's Graduate Institute of Technology and Innovation Management is only suitable for postgraduate work . " But due to the regulations imposed by the Ministry of Education , if you set up only a graduate school the educational resources available from the government do not compare with those for a combined undergraduate department and graduate school . " Wu says that this results in institutions having to make a choice between " actual need " and " winning more resources . "  
In the past there was also an enormous difference between the simple content of elementary school courses and the difficult and dry content of junior high school courses . In future , courses will be designed with continuity from first to ninth grade , and there will no longer be such a break between elementary and junior high school .  
Also , in line with the general trend in education reform toward diversification of teaching materials , the integrated curriculum not only abolishes the current requirement for junior high schools to use the standard textbooks published by the National Institute for Compilation and Translation , allowing them to use any approved textbook instead , but it also allows county and city governments , schools , and teachers to produce their own teaching materials , and particularly encourages schools to form " curriculum development committees " to devise course content .  
With the current staffing structure in junior high schools , physics and chemistry teachers are not equipped to cross over and teach biology , and biology teachers can not teach information technology . Thus teaching in a single study field may be split between five different teachers , and pupils may be left to guess from the content of each unit which teacher will appear on any particular day . What kind of uncertainty will that introduce into the pupil-teacher relationship ?  
The team she leads took the theme of " family reunion at Mid-Autumn Festival " as the basis to ingeniously integrate content from earth science ( the movement of the tides and the waxing and waning of the moon ) , maths ( quadratic functions of Hou Yi shooting down the nine suns ) , history ( mid-autumn legends and the Mongol Empire ) , and counseling activities ( satisfactions and regrets in life ) , which they linked together in a set of thematic activities with a rich content .  
The more important question concerns how to achieve lateral and vertical integration between the content of different textbooks as quickly as possible . Curriculum development committees at schools everywhere have all zeroed in on this problem . Teachers may start running into problems when the science teacher in third and fourth grades uses textbooks from Nani Books , for example , while the science teacher in fifth and sixth grades uses something from Hanlin . Or students may find that some of the content in their science textbooks is repeated in social studies .  
On the day before national Children 's Day , Taipei Wanfang Hospital held a " Children 's Health Check-up Fair " in which different types of foods were assigned different colored " traffic lights " to indicate their relative calorie content . By making it into a game , children had fun while learning about healthy eating .  
The only thing they can do is control their weight by eating the proper foods . The hospital invented a game to teach children how to identify healthy snacks . Low-nutrition , high-calorie goodies such as cakes , chocolates , potato chips , and french fries are assigned a red light , indicating that they should not be eaten too often . Hamburgers , fried chicken , and milk shakes are basically healthy , but are high in fat content and are thus assigned a yellow light , indicating that children should eat these foods in moderation .  
In May of this year , the government formally declared " digital content " to be one of the " twin star " industries . It plans to pour NT $ 5 billion into the industry over the next four years , establish a " digital content college " that will cultivate IT skills among artists and writers , and encourage venture capitalists to invest also in the hope of growing the industry 's annual production value to more than NT $ 200 billion , four times its current value , in five years .  
If it is easy to find a free e-paper that is similar , or if the readers do n't really need the content , it is difficult to achieve the level of appeal required to collect fees , " says Hsu . But it can be done . Currently , e-papers at PChome that do the best with subscriber fees are for language learning and industrial reports . The publication with the most subscribers is iThome , a computer report , with about 10,000 .  
In the broad sense , an electronic book , or e-book , means published content that is stored in the form of digital data on any kind of electronic storage media , such as a hard disk , floppy disk , optical disk or IC card , and transmitted through a data network to the user 's digital reading equipment , such as a PC , notebook , PDA or even a mobile phone .  
In April 2001 , Culturecom and mainland China 's People 's Education Press ( PEP ) , which is under the control of the PRC education ministry , announced that they were launching a joint venture to set up Renwen E-Textbook Technology Company . Their aim is to develop the mainland 's primary and secondary school textbook market , which serves a student population numbering in the hundreds of millions . PEP will be responsible for course planning and content , while Culturecom will provide support with e-book technology .  
Chu Bong-foo says he first conceived Cosmic Drifter in 1998 . The ideas came from his previously published Nine Essays On Intelligence , in which he discusses thought , human nature and value in terms of energy conversion , the formation of matter , the nature of time and space , and the evolution of the universe . But the essays ' content was dry and dull , and nobody understood it . Therefore he wanted to turn his theories into a popular novel that ordinary people would understand .  
" As far as the explosive power of volcanoes goes , the lava eruption was much more moderate , " says Tsao Shuh-jong , section chief of the Division of Original Geology in the Central Geological Survey . In addition , basaltic lava has a relatively low silicon dioxide content , so it is correspondingly less sticky . Flowing basalt thus forms very different shapes from the lava of a typical volcanic eruption .  
The lava pushed up by volcanic activity around the main island of Taiwan was mainly composed of andesite . Molten andesite has a relatively higher content of silicon dioxide , so is more sticky . Thus it more readily forms into conical mountains such as the Tatun volcanic mountains of northern Taiwan . The basalt rocks of Penghu form a stark contrast to the geology of the main island of Taiwan .  
Chung Chiao , head of a drama company and also a judge for the poetry competition , analyzes the poems in terms of content : The Filipino poems subtly reveal the fervent culture of a tropical island colonized by the Spanish , a poetry filled with love of life and more socially conscious , because of the Filipino tradition of fighting for their rights ; Indonesian works tend to emphasize the micro details of human relationships , while the Vietnamese and Thai poems contain more advice and aphorisms .  
Sinorama has many times reported on the government 's intention to develop a " knowledge-based economy " and to foster the development of the so-called " twin star " industries-digital content and biotechnology . But relative to other countries , do these fields offer Taiwan the competitive advantage that a successful business strategy requires ?  
All types of fish that can be eaten raw have a fairly high fat content , but the bluefin is particularly famed for its fattiness . The Pacific bluefin that migrate through the waters east of Taiwan prefer lower water temperatures than other tuna , and usually stay north of the 18th parallel . To protect it from cold the Pacific bluefin has more fat than the yellowfin and albacore , which are distributed around the equator , or the southern bluefin , which lives in the southern hemisphere .  
But as things have developed , and with strong support from the Council for Cultural Affairs , it has become ever richer in content , and moved toward being an " all-new , all-round operatic production " that combines the beauty of Peking Opera and Western opera . A key role in this joint creation is played by performers from the opera troupe of the Fu Hsing Dramatic Arts Academy .  
This month 's cover story , " The New Star of the Post-Information Age-Digital Content , " analyzes the digital content industry , which is expected to be one of the next wave of key industries in Taiwan . It is an industry which requires unlimited creativity and rich content to come out on top . We also look at what steps the government is taking to utilize local cultural assets to create business opportunities , to make a knowledge-based contribution to the digital-era Chinese language market .  
" Perhaps digital content is no different in its basic nature from the writing , language , physical artifacts and images , and video programs we have long been familiar with , " explains Hwang Tai-yang . But once information of all kinds is digitized , and converted into virtual ones and zeros that can flow as an electric current , there will no longer be any obstacles to its crossing platforms to be transmitted , stored , accessed and used at will .  
The most impressive digital content appears as multimedia . A one-minute video clip only requires about ten seconds to download via broadband Internet , but using narrowband may require six to ten times that long . In order to ensure smooth downloading and broadcasting , computer hardware and software require continuous upgrading . In addition , monthly broadband service costs range from NT $ 600-1000 , which is too steep for some families .  
The eighth clause of the Basic Education Law , which was passed in June of the same year , puts it even more clearly : " During the period of compulsory education , parents are responsible for guiding and assisting their children . Moreover , parents have the legal right to select educational method and content on behalf of their children and to decide whether they enroll in a school . "  
Some months ago you ran a feature on digital content , and recently you also reported the development of nanotechnology in Taiwan . From these articles we can see how sensitive the government is to the development of new technologies , and how-whether by their own initiative or with government guidance-many large , medium and small enterprises are getting involved in R &amp; D or production related to these emerging technologies .  
There are records of the medicinal uses of alcohol in China even on ancient tortoise shells dating back to the Shang and Zhou dynasties . " Alcohol is a good natural solvent , enabling one to get a higher proportion of the therapeutic content out of the raw materials of Chinese medicine , " Chen Chun-che says .  
Amidst the concurrence of rising rice wine prices , initial licensing of private distilling operations , and bootleg poisonings , sales of standard rice wine-the former " red label , " now Daoxiang 40 proof ( i.e . 20% alcohol content ) - fell from 25 million dozen bottles two years ago to 400,000 last year .  
Many nutritionists have finally come round to telling the media that it is best not to eat too many instant noodles . The reasons are that they have a high salt content and can cause high blood pressure , they contain preservatives that may cause cancer . Also , some unscrupulous manufacturers make their noodles using waste cooking oil , and there are worries that eating this oil can lead to digestive tract disorders and other ailments .  
" The literary level of its readers has an influence on a publishing company 's ambition , " says Wu Hsing-wen , Beijing representative of Yuan-Liou Publishing and long-time observer of the publishing scene on both sides of the Taiwan Strait . Taiwanese readers are punctilious in their choices , but they are also very receptive , which is why local publishers can make bold and experimental market forays . It is also the reason Taiwanese books are successful in terms of content and set trends for the Chinese reading public around the world .  
As well as having these odd combinations of publishers and publications , content standards are also slipping . Take for example men 's magazines , the supposed symbols of the relaxing of societal restrictions . Casually laid out at the front of any newsstands one can see four or five such magazines , all proclaiming to be about health and fitness . But the cover pictures will undoubtedly be pushing the envelope as far as possible , attempting to be as revealing as they can get away with .  
Because financial magazines from Taiwan are still a touchy subject in the mainland , as well as concerns about the ability of mainland editors and reporters to live up to the Commonwealth standard , they have started a new magazine . Last year they started publishing Dongfang Qiyejia in Shanghai , sourcing their launch issue 's content from the senior staff of Commonwealth , to make absolutely certain to produce a magazine just as high in quality as its Taiwanese counterpart .  
At the end of November , the Legislative Yuan was buzzing as legislators rushed to get key bills affecting the nation 's future and the economy passed . Legislative assistants ( LAs ) , responsible for helping their respective party caucuses negotiate the content of legislation and then mobilize legislators to vote on it , lost track of time and many could be found wandering around enveloped in a haze of exhaustion .  
However , kitchen waste is the main source of the foul odors and disease vector proliferation in garbage . When kitchen wastes are mixed with other garbage for processing , landfills are inundated with noxious gases , polluting the air . If taken instead to incinerators , due to their high water content , much energy will be wasted in the burning process , and the lifespan of the incinerator will also be reduced . At the same time , concentrations of the toxin dioxin will be increased .  
HUF chairwoman Mary Chen points out that Taiwan 's traditional business groups have put economics first , neglecting an environment-friendly business culture , which does cause worry . However , through monitoring and testing mechanisms , compost content and quality problems can be reduced to a minimum . This is a direction that many environmental groups will be pursuing in the future .  
Although this winter Mingcheng 's Murcott production was not very high , the quality was excellent . Thanks to a high 13-degree sugar / acid ratio ( sugar content / free acid content ) and free media publicity thrown in by the home distribution company , the day after the ads appeared the borough head , Chang Jui-tuan , who was responsible for taking phone orders , spent the whole day on the phone .  
Liu Wei-kung , associate professor of sociology at Soochow University , says that rather than debate incessantly about the definition and scope of cultural and creative industries , it would be better to grasp the salient characteristic at their core , which is that content on its own is not enough . It 's extremely important that the product or service creates an appealing story that will pull people in , so as to give people a joyful experience in the process of consumption .  
The " content " of these cultural products has been rich and varied but Taiwan , with its many downstream industries , has been short of something very important in the development of its culture industry-intermediaries who will make the connection to an artistic source , then apply technology so that art is transformed into a commodity of a different kind , and intangible culture can become a tangible industry .  
With the rise of the Internet and the digitization of audiovisual content , technologies that were originally developed for the two different forms of transmission for video and telecommunications are using digital signal convergence to enable families to enjoy the interactive pleasures of video-on-demand through set-top boxes . Looking at the world as a whole , the spread of digital content is an unmistakable trend .  
It is expected that interactive services will change the public 's passive TV viewing habits , shifting them toward active choice and control over viewing times . They are also likely to allow audiences to pay for programming according to what they wish to watch . However , the key to success is that the content delivered must be varied and extensive .  
Later , due to my persistence , after they had considered things for some time , finally a letter arrived from the editorial department . It said that in consideration of my good reputation in the scientific community , they would publish the paper , despite being unable to find any evidence supportive of my conclusion . However , the text would include a special disclaimer , indicating that I was solely responsible for the content , and that the editors did not back up my claims in any way .  
Chou takes the nine-year integrated curriculum as an example . Neither the idea of a system integrating the content to be studied in Grades 1-9 , nor that of academic " fields , " are new . In fact , these things had been spelled out in previous curricular standards . In past decades , however , one saw the prevalent use of " contracting out " specialized tasks within Taiwan 's education system , so much so that now that things have been opened up , people can not imagine doing otherwise .  
Then the Hsinchu Science-Based Industrial Park came along some years later , attracting domestic and overseas tenants with its autonomous management , customs-bonded operations , and " deep processing " ( i.e . processing that yields a significant level of value-added content ) . This was the key to Taiwan 's successful transition to a new type of industry .  
After a while , the bent of his writing gradually turned towards science fiction , philosophy , and the exploration of the human psyche . A self-proclaimed eclectic , Chang is n't content to stay within established genres , but instead casts a wide literary net that encompasses history , philosophy , movies , and politics .  
During a three-day meeting on this respiratory tract disease , WHO endorsed the content of a research report , which indicated " strong political commitment , adequate financial resources and sound technology " have substantially reduced the burden of tuberculosis to India and China .  
Although statements were made at the rhetorical level , to his knowledge there had never been an operational attempt to give content to economic , social and cultural rights , nor to include them in overall strategies or specific objectives pursued .  
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work , by promoting broader and deeper international cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities , and by revitalizing its work and that of its subcommittees .  
The delegation of Egypt would like to avail itself of this opportunity to stress that whatever the linguistic formulas may be , its concept of the operative content of the paragraphs relating to reproductive and sexual health , especially paragraphs 56 , 57 and 58 , is that their implementation will take place in accordance with the legal system and the cultural and religious heritage of each society .  
The content of the statements made at the highest level during the debate at the Special Commemorative Meeting and the Declaration adopted on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations again demonstrated the need for the international community to give the economic and social development problems of developing countries the attention they deserve .  
Together with other countries , including Egypt , Malaysia supported Indonesia , which , speaking in its capacity as Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement , emphasized that the five declarations by the five nuclear Powers varied in terms of structure and content , as well as remaining devoid of any legal force .  
As we see it , a gradual and permanent expansion of contacts , primarily in the economic field and in environmental protection , scientific research , the transfer of technology , culture , education and tourism , could also bring about substantial changes in the qualitative content of the political dialogue .  
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles which deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , focusing on scientific literacy , moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic and multi-cultural societies . 
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles that deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , etc . focusing on scientific literacy , human moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic societies and pluri-cultural societies .  
They underscore in our view a basic need for the United Nations to be responsive to the demands of a changing international political landscape whose form and content are yet to be fully assessed and fully determined so that the continuing legitimacy of the United Nations can be assured .  
The paper proposed specific approaches to topics perceived as sensitive or controversial ; called for new ways to select key concepts and set priorities ; and stressed the importance of ensuring that course content was clear and appropriate to both the socio-cultural context of the country and the age level of the students .  
Asked about the specific content of the equality clause in the National Population Law and whether recourse was available in the event that national equality legislation was not applied at the local level , the representative said that the National Population Law established equality between men and women where family planning was concerned and provided recourse to courts .  
To summarize , the exact content and quantitative objectives of a Tunisian policy on sustainable human development , which will be reflected in the country strategy note , will emerge from the process of formulating Tunisia 's Agenda 21 and strategic studies conducted in the context of preparations for the ninth plan .  
Although NATCAP began without a coherent strategy and with a heavy reliance on external inputs , the current generation of NATCAP countries have evolved to a point where there is substantial national content with increased reliance on in-country task forces .  
Improvement in the overall quality of both primary and secondary education will require tackling the internal inefficiencies in the existing system and improving services in keeping with the nation 's need for an educational content responsive to the changes occurring in the national market economy .  
In circumstances in which the Belgrade Government is widely recognized as the champion of double standards , and the situation of Albanians living on their own lands in Kosovo is increasingly grave and alarming as a result of the Serbs ' repressive and truly genocidal activities , the entire content of the Serbian memorandum is simply ridiculous . 
The content of the reports was similar to that of others reviewed by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the former Yugoslavia and by the thematic rapporteurs of the Commission on Human Rights on the right to life and the physical integrity of persons , as well as by other United Nations organs and agencies that are attempting to devise a peaceful , just and lasting solution to the conflict and that are engaged in human rights or humanitarian relief activities .  
While it is true that the number of resolutions regarding UNRWA has been reduced in the past year from ten to seven , the content of these resolutions remains occupied with political issues irrelevant to the work for which UNRWA is responsible , and thus remains detached from the new reality .  
The content and complexity of these regulations must be appropriate to the existing degree of financial intermediation , neither so restrictive as to prevent competition and development of innovative institutions or practices , nor so permissive as to allow the establishment and operation of shadowy and shaky financial institutions .  
While it is true that the number of resolutions regarding UNRWA has been reduced in the past year from 10 to 7 , the content of these resolutions remains occupied with political issues irrelevant to the work for which UNRWA is responsible , and thus remains detached from the new reality .  
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles that deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , etc . focusing on scientific literacy , human moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic societies and pluri-cultural societies . 
Furthermore , these programme development activities , and the materials which result from them , provide an objective and publicly accessible record of the unbiased and universal content of the Centre 's assistance activities , which has the effect of increasing confidence in the programme while maximizing its utility and providing a means for its crucial and continuous improvement .  
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles that deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , etc . focusing on scientific literacy , human moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic societies and pluri-cultural societies . 
At the time of this reorganization , the head of the First Group had expressed his conviction that , although considerable promise of success was evident in the production of diffusion barriers , the technological content of the entire gaseous diffusion process was likely to be beyond Iraq 's short-term capabilities and had suggested that the gas centrifuge enrichment process was worthy of attention .  
Neither its drafting nor its content is commensurate with the gravity of the Israeli aggression and its serious consequences for the people of Lebanon , who have been subjected to killing and displacement , let alone with the destructive negative implications for Lebanon 's infrastructure and for its Government 's tenacious reconstruction efforts and ambitious reconstruction plans after long years of a destructive civil war .  
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work , by promoting broader and deeper international cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities , and by revitalizing its work and that of its subcommittees .  
It was also observed that while the text deserved to be kept on the Special Committee 's agenda , the heading and the content of the draft document should be more concise and clearly defined , its structure could be rationalized and its provisions dealing with the sources of funding for the relevant mechanisms should be based on a more realistic approach .  
There is no doubt that this singular situation , in which the creator of the rule of law is also its direct object , is less favourable to the development of a legal system which is balanced , whether as regards its normative scope or the material content of its rules .  
We feel that all the working papers submitted and statements made demonstrate the necessity of providing any eventual fourth special session with real and pragmatic content ; otherwise , we will merely be repeating a sterile exercise which , because of its content , would not enjoy consensus among the members of the international community .  
Any new concept needs to be accompanied by an information , education and communication ( IEC ) strategy to make people aware of its content and implications - all the more so if this new concept involves , as does the concept of reproductive rights and reproductive health , many aspects , ranging from sociocultural factors - cultural beliefs and practices , status of women , overall health and well-being , religious convictions and ethical values - to economic conditions .  
However , the Special Rapporteur indulged in an abstract political and legal analysis based on presumptions , allegations and misinformation with a view to emptying those decrees of their noble humanitarian content , seeking ways to exaggerate any shortcoming or weakness , presumed or real , in order to undermine the position of Iraq , thereby rendering his conclusions untrustworthy .  
The treaty bodies , based on six human rights conventions , have not only become effective structures monitoring the compliance by States with the human rights obligations resulting from those treaties : their impact in the field of human rights goes far beyond this function and extends , inter alia , to clarification of the content of human rights ; the functioning of the human rights machinery , including early warning and preventive measures ; cooperation of Governments with the United Nations ; protection of individuals in the framework of optional communications procedures ; and human rights education .  
Moreover , not content with falsely accusing Iraq in the tenth preambular paragraph of summary executions , arbitrary detention and torture , with the sole aim of tarnishing the country 's reputation , the sponsors had neglected to mention the positive developments that had occurred in Iraq , including amnesties granted to prisoners and initiatives to strengthen democracy , pluralism and respect for human rights , such as the right to free speech .  
Improvement in the overall quality of both primary and secondary education will require tackling the internal inefficiencies in the existing system and improving services in keeping with the nation 's need for an educational content responsive to the changes occurring in the national market economy .  
On 17 October 1995 , at hearings held by the subcommittee of the United States Congress for indigenous and western hemisphere affairs , the representative of the President of the United States , Mr .

While it is true that the number of resolutions regarding the United Nations Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) has been reduced in the past years from 10 to 7 , the content of these resolutions remains occupied with political issues irrelevant to the work for which UNRWA is responsible , and thus remains detached from the new reality .  
While it is true that the number of resolutions regarding the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East ( UNRWA ) has been reduced in the past years from 10 to 7 , the content of these resolutions remains occupied with political issues irrelevant to the work for which UNRWA is responsible , and thus remains detached from the new reality .  
The Ministers agreed to reduce dependence on the information and cultural media of the industrialized nations by initiating and supporting cooperative activities through fresh and dynamic approaches to programming , message content and networking in the media systems of non-aligned and other developing countries .  
Because the United Nations system plays a predominantly supporting and facilitating role in shelter and settlements development , the substantive content of the follow-up by the United Nations system to Habitat II will be guided by national and local priorities for assistance , as outlined in the national reports and as further developed by the national mechanisms recommended in the Habitat Agenda .

Since many questions and misunderstandings surround the definitions and content of the terminologies of sects , new religious movements and even formal religion and since in international practice confusion reigns and States may have diametrically opposed attitudes to the same group , raising it to formal religious status or pejoratively classifying it as a sect , the Special Rapporteur feels that an international high-level governmental conference should be held to study and decide upon a common approach to sects and religions that respects human rights . 
Further , the precise content of the freedom of transit has in each single case to be agreed upon by the transit State and the landlocked State concerned , and in the absence of agreement concerning the terms and modalities for exercising the right of access of persons and goods , transit through the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany is regulated only by national law , in particular with regard to ways and means of transport and the use of traffic infrastructure .

The economic crisis , on the one hand , and the identity crisis , on the other , are aggravated by the claims of people of French stock to ascendency over naturalized French citizens and immigrants ; hence the reference to the theme of national preference , with its xenophobic and even racist content , in political speeches .  
It looked forward to working with the Netherlands and the Russian Federation towards the development of the programme 's substantive content , and stressed the importance of developing activities to commemorate those occasions at the regional as well as the global level .

Their export earnings were hit particularly hard by their specialization in semiconductors and types of computer equipment that have relatively low technological content and that were subject to more pronounced downward price pressures when demand fell .  
One essential lesson learned in the HIV / AIDS epidemic is that universally recognized human rights standards should guide policy-makers in formulating the direction and content of HIV-related policy and form an integral part of all aspects of national and local responses to HIV / AIDS .  
Overall , the growing political awareness of the importance of information , the globalization of information content and accessibility , technological changes in the areas both of telecommunications and of information technologies , social trends such as public participation and popular demand for information , and support from major groups , the United Nations system , and other intergovernmental and international organizations have all had an impact on the phenomenal progress made in the area of the accessibility of information through electronic means .  
He noted that humanitarian law initially had been developed in response to ordinary international armed conflicts wherein organized regular armies faced each other , and the content of humanitarian law clearly reflected its origin .  
While the number of personnel requiring rations is lower than in the prior period , the increase is attributable to the higher cost of bottled water ( $ 0.57 ) than in the previous period ( $ 0.50 ) and the additional requirement for bottled water for the team sites for cooking purposes , consumption by visiting flight crews and its use for generators to prevent potential damage to the equipment by the high salt and mineral content of local water . ( e ) Daily allowance .  
Calls upon the Government of Guatemala , URNG and Guatemalan society as a whole to make every possible effort to familiarize the Guatemalan people with the content of the Peace agreements as quickly as possible , to ensure the full participation of the people in building the new multi _ ethnic , multicultural and plurilingual nation , establishing a democratic society with social justice , initiating a period of sustained and sustainable economic and social development and ensuring the pre _ eminence of civilian authority in national decision _ making ;  
Without educational content relevant to current needs , without preparation in the learning skills and new knowledge required for the future , and without efforts to improve learning achievement , access may neither serve the purposes intended nor provide the benefits expected .  Fortunately , serious reflection , more rigorous planning and a spirit of innovation have prepared the ground in many countries for important educational advances in the years ahead .  
At the national , regional and international levels , judicial human rights bodies continued to develop the legal framework of refugee protection , further defining the scope of obligations towards asylum-seekers and adding content to the rule of non-refoulement , also in respect of persons facing a substantial risk of torture .  
Thus the topic will be limited only to codification of secondary rules on the subject : while addressing the requirement of a violation of an international obligation of the State as a prerequisite , it will not address the specific content of those international legal obligations , whether under customary or treaty law .  
Improvement in the overall quality of both primary and secondary education would require tackling the internal inefficiencies in the existing system and improving services in keeping with the nations need for an educational content responsive to the changes occurring in the national market economy .

In developing countries with a weak industrial base , a rapid and sustained rise in the levels of income depends on increasing investment , which has a very high import content .  
To clarify the content of the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger , as stated in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and other relevant international and regional instruments , and to give particular attention to implementation and full and progressive realization of this right as a means of achieving food security for all .  
Calls upon the Government of Guatemala , URNG and Guatemalan society as a whole to make every possible effort to familiarize the Guatemalan people with the content of the Peace agreements as quickly as possible , to ensure the full participation of the people in building the new multi _ ethnic , multicultural and multilingual nation , establishing a democratic society with social justice , initiating a period of sustained and sustainable economic and social development and ensuring the pre _ eminence of civilian authority in national decision _ making ;

In many cases , those responsible for violations of economic , social and cultural rights and of the collective rights with an economic content such as the right to development or the right to a healthy environment , are sometimes international entities applying policies which constitute veritable sources of large-scale and serious violations of collective and individual rights in the countries with weak economies .

The content and application of competition law and policy , and its relationship with industrial and trade policies , have varied among different countries at different times , as countries have sought with mixed success to promote the technological capacity and international competitiveness of their industries , compensate for the effects of market failures or ease structural adjustment .

We suggest that the 661 Committee should conduct an objective , professional and administrative review of the manner in which the previous phase of the procurement and distribution plan has been implemented , with a view to eliminating all the negative aspects and procedures that led to the delay and dilatoriness by which it was characterized , and which all but emptied Security Council resolution 986 ( 1995 ) and the memorandum of understanding of their content and turned them into something to be exploited for political purposes that bear no relation to any humanitarian objective .

The potential hazard of radioactive material depends upon : the type of material ( i.e . , plutonium , uranium , thorium ) ; isotopic composition ( i.e . , content of fissile isotopes ) ; physical and chemical form ; degree of dilution ; radiation level ; and quantity .  
While UNESCO will be responsible for the conceptual aspects and educational content , ITU , which is developing the standards , will take primary responsibility for the technical implementation and choice of technological solutions .  
The meeting addressed the workshops logistic arrangements and its substantive content , including technical cooperation activities to be considered and proposed , and identified numerous issues of criminal procedure that the workshop could address , such as those relating to data storage , transaction and analysis , electronic communications , trans-border search and seizure , mutual legal assistance , human rights and safeguarding privacy rights .  
For that purpose , the Guide helps identify areas of law that are typically most relevant to private capital investment in public infrastructure projects and discusses the content of those laws which would be conducive to attracting private capital , national and foreign .  
Noting with grave concern the content of the report of the Commission of Inquiry of the International Labour Organization , [ 5 ] appointed in March 1997 in accordance with article 26 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organization , regarding the observance by Myanmar of the Forced Labour Convention , 1930 ( No .  29 ) , which indicates a widespread and systematic use of forced labour imposed by the military on the civilian population ,  
Negotiation of a free _ standing new legal instrument dealing exclusively with a transfer ban , even in a fully compatible way with the provisions of the Ottawa Convention , would raise a number of political and legal problems , such as lack of global vocation , setting a precedent by negotiating a partial ban after a clear majority of States has signed a comprehensive one , proliferation of legal instruments dealing with the same content , just to name a few .  
Reaffirm that the central decision _ making role in determining the content of the regional technical cooperation programme , evaluating the progress achieved and determining actions to be taken under the programme in the future will continue to be played by the annual intergovernmental workshop with the assistance of the open-ended team in Geneva comprising Geneva _ based representatives of the Governments of the Asian-Pacific region ;  
Areas that have been identified as involving legal issues relevant to electronic commerce include data protection , taxation , customs duties , security and authentication , intellectual property rights , liability of Internet service providers , illegal and harmful content , Internet governance ( more specifically , domain names ) , electronic payments systems , and consumer protection .  
Activities include coordination meetings and electronic discussions on the planning of cooperative activities and sharing of experience , support for subregional training courses , pilot projects on the application of telematics for development in sectors of public concern , and promotion of the African content of the World Wide Web for educational , scientific , social and cultural development .  
The content of adequacy is to some extent determined by prevailing social , economic , cultural , climatic , ecological and other conditions , but there are some core elements which are applicable under all circumstances and are spelled out in greater detail by the Committee .  
It sets out the normative content of the human right to adequate food , the corresponding obligations including State obligations at the national level and at the international level , the responsibilities of international organizations , and regulation of economic enterprises and other actors .  
These needs comprise both essential learning tools ( such as literacy , oral expression , numeracy and problem solving ) and the basic learning content ( such as knowledge , skills , values and attitudes ) required by human beings to be able to survive , to develop their full capacities , to live and work in dignity , to participate fully in development , to improve the quality of their lives , to make informed decisions and to continue learning ( art . 1 , para . 
As to the concept of circumstances precluding wrongfulness , the Special Rapporteur observed that the initial proposition was that the draft articles were not concerned with formulating the content of primary rules , but with the framework of secondary rules of responsibility , yet it was the primary rules which determined what was wrongful .  
This requires addressing difficult and controversial issues such as schoolgirl pregnancy , adaptation of the content of educational curricula and textbooks to the objective of equipping girls with the knowledge and skills necessary for them to avoid early pregnancy , and broadening the objectives and purposes of education to provide the future generations of women in Uganda with options unavailable to the past and current generations of women .  
The Special Rapporteur is therefore continuing his project for the formulation of an international educational strategy to prevent all forms of intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief , the matrix of which would be the organization in November 2001 of an international consultative conference on the content of curricula and textbooks for primary or elementary and secondary educational institutions with respect to freedom of religion and belief .  
Two aspects of Internet accessibility were addressed by the Gateway initiative : ( a ) user-friendly Web design based on universal principles to facilitate access by users with physical or sensorial disabilities and ( b ) text-based and low-intensity graphical content to facilitate access by users with low levels of information technology or communications capacities ( bandwidth ) .  
A critical task was joint determination of critical milestones for conceptual designs , for delivery of content by the concerned substantive specialists , for coordination with the concerned technical services and for systematic feedback on design options from beta testers representative of the specialized constituencies for the global social development programme of the United Nations .  
On the one hand , the multilateral framework of WTO rules has in certain cases narrowed the range of policy options for Governments : quantitative tools of protection are now largely ruled out , including production allocations and similar means ; tariffs are increasingly subject to binding commitments ; the transition period for national content and trade balancing requirements lapses at the end of 1999 ; and export subsidies will no longer be permitted for most developing countries after 2003 .  
Considering the content of the subject matter , the emergence of extreme poverty was examined from various angles taking into account both the domestic and international dimensions of the problem and the economic , political and social factors contributing to it .  
These benefits were exchanged for performance standards related to export targets , local content requirements , debt-equity ratio ceilings , national ownership floors , operating scale minima , investment timetable obligations , regional location criteria and , eventually , product quality specifications and environmental rules .  
Second , policy standards , which tie subsidies to the promotion of major national strategic priorities , such as maintaining price stability , increasing local content , raising the level of exports and not worsening income distribution .  
The representative of Cuba , speaking also on behalf of the delegations of Algeria , China , Egypt , Saudi Arabia , the Sudan and the Syrian Arab Republic , made a joint statement on their position paper submitted to the Chair regarding the preamble and articles 1 , 8 , 12 , 13 and X . They stated that starting from the preamble the content of the draft protocol should reflect clearly its cooperative , preventive , confidential , non-duplicative and advisory nature .  
The Declaration defines basic learning needs as : essential learning tools ( such as literacy , oral expression , numeracy , and problem solving ) and the basic learning content ( such as knowledge , skills , values , and attitudes ) required by human beings to be able to survive , to develop their full capacities , to live and work in dignity , to participate fully in development , to improve the quality of their lives , to make informed decisions , and to continue learning ( art .  1 ) .  
The diversity of national and regional paths of change , leading to a significant variety of post-socialist emerging capitalisms ( Magnin , 1999 ) , illustrates the role of idiosyncratic and evolving institutional configurations that represent the very content of systemic change .  
The change of rules in general institutional and organizational rules , constitutional and ordinary rules , and formal and informal rules represents the essential content of systemic change , hence the decisive role of law and the State in the process . 
According to Turkey , the content of fundamental standards of humanity should be limited to international human rights law and not include international humanitarian law , as they concerned situations of internal violence which did not reach the threshold of an armed conflict .  
Indeed , numerous unilateral acts , whatever their content , could be classified as political , while certain unilateral acts not originally intended to have legal effects at the international level could have such effects .  
Indeed , at its forty-ninth session in August 1997 , the Sub-Commission adopted resolution 1997-7 in which it requested one of its experts , Mr . Mustapha Mehedi , to prepare a working paper on the right to education with the purpose of explaining the content of the right to education , taking account , in particular , of its social dimension and the freedoms it includes and of its dual civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural character .  
Mr . Mehedi expressed the wish to see academic freedom added to the core content as defined above , insofar as primary , secondary or tertiary education was concerned .  
The Court ' s credibility in the eyes of the public and particularly in the eyes of the legal community has been weakened by the dismissal of three of its judges , who considered an interpretative provision of the Constitution with obvious political content to be unconstitutional . 
Lithium content means the mass of lithium in the anode of a lithium metal or lithium alloy cell , which for a primary cell is measured when the cell is in an undischarged state and for a rechargeable cell is measured when the cell is fully charged , except that in the case of a lithium-ion cell the lithium content is measured in terms of equivalent lithium content , which in grams is calculated to be 0.3 times the rated capacity in ampere-hours .  
For that purpose , the Guide helps identify areas of law that are typically most relevant to private capital investment in public infrastructure projects and discusses the content of those laws which would be conducive to attracting private capital , national and foreign.The Guide is not intended to provide advice on drafting agreements for the execution of privately financed infrastructure projects .  
In developing countries with a weak industrial base , a rapid and sustained rise in the levels of income depends on increasing investment , which has a very high import content .  
While UNESCO will be responsible for the conceptual aspects and educational content , ITU , which is developing the standards , will take primary responsibility for the technical implementation and choice of technological solutions .  
The MTR concluded that the programmes social communication and media component should contribute to cultural change through substantive messages with strong technical and legal content .  
In focusing on such key elements as promotion of awareness , advocacy and policy formulation ; connectivity ; institutional and human capacities ; and content and cultural diversity , UNDP currently operates global , regional and numerous countrylevel programmes .  
In the interests of preserving cultural diversity , the European Union also considered it essential that the local content of the Internet in the developing countries , and particularly in the least developed countries , should be enhanced and developed .  
The work of the Committee also addressed technical issues dealing with the content of SDI , including the definition of a common geodetic reference frame , the necessity of integrating cadastral and topographical data bases , the development of metadata and clearinghouse sites , and the employment of international standards ( ISO / TC 211 ) in the implementation of national and regional SDI .  
The overall experience reported above by HEUNI and the very limited number of responses received by the Centre for International Crime Prevention to the questionnaire on international technical cooperation in crime prevention and criminal justice suggest that the establishment of a centralized database is of very limited value and utility , in particular when one considers the overall quality and content of the responses .  
Notes with concern the late issuance of the report of the Board of Auditors on United Nations peacekeeping operations , 1 and requests the Board of Auditors and the Secretary-General to work together to implement ways to ensure its timely and simultaneous issuance in all six official languages of the United Nations , including streamlining the format and content of the report , as well as the related financial information contained in the performance reports .  
All the acts mentioned , in the context which concerns us , are formulated [ 62 ] through unilateral declarations , whether of individual or collective origin , and these declarations are subject to definite forms as far as their conditions of validity are concerned ; the rules apply to all of them regardless of their content or material classification .  
This happened in the case of Venezuela and Mexico , which appear to have developed a subsequent practice , the examination of which could help specify or clarify the content and scope of the unilateral commitment assumed by those countries in relation to the Central American countries through a joint communiqu which could be considered a unilateral act of collective origin . 
Notes with concern the late issuance of the financial report and audited financial statements for the twelve-month period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 and the report of the Board of Auditors on United Nations peacekeeping operations , 2 and requests the Board of Auditors and the Secretary-General to work together to implement ways to ensure its timely and simultaneous issuance in all six official languages of the United Nations , including streamlining the format and content of the report as well as the related financial information contained in the performance reports .  
The second week proved easier in terms of interpretation content and workload ( meetings started late , finished early or were interrupted and the Commission on Sustainable Development cancelled one meeting and devoted another one to informal drafting work without interpretation ) .  
Similar considerations apply as for completed and continuing wrongful acts in determining when a breach of international law exists ; the matter is dependent upon the precise facts and the content of the primary obligation .  
In fact , many applications being developed to benefit citizens , such as digital libraries , electronic museums , distance education and training , distance medical services and other public social services , must be based on the development of local content industry .  
In addition , a large number of public information systems such as local news and weather , entertainment , tourism , maps and sports are developed based on local content and will stimulate the development of the domestic information services industry and raise the living standard of the local people .  
Even though the right to development as set out in the 1986 Declaration was reaffirmed in the 1993 Vienna Declaration as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , several industrialized countries are now attempting to question and reformulate its content and scope , including the definition of the beneficiaries of the right .  
Moreover , a discussion was held on the suitability of developing an instrument specific to the energy services sector and comparable to the Reference Paper on Basic Telecommunications , and the possible content of such an instrument ( e.g . development concerns to link in a clear manner energy services and development including the achievement of public services goals and promotion of competition and of foreign investment in the energy sector consistent with development goals ) .  
Due to the increased harmonization and simplification of procedures , the reports of UNDP , UNFPA , UNICEF and WFP to their respective Executive Boards had a common format and were very similar in content ; the four agencies were therefore suggesting that reporting on the implementation of the triennial policy review and on United Nations reforms to the legislative bodies should be streamlined ; they looked forward to the Committees advice on that .  
Moreover , a discussion was held on the suitability of developing an instrument specific to the energy services sector and comparable to the Reference Paper on Basic Telecommunications , and the possible content of such an instrument ( e.g . development concerns to link in a clear manner energy services and development including the achievement of public services goals and promotion of competition and of foreign investment in the energy sector consistent with development goals ) .  
These included proposals for clarification of the scope of energy services and improvement of current classification , the development of a checklist which could be used as a tool to facilitate negotiations at the multilateral and regional levels , the suitability of developing an instrument specific to the energy services sector and comparable to the Reference Paper on Basic Telecommunications , and its possible content .  
Data received from the SAC-C satellite are used to study the terrestrial and marine environment , assess desertification , monitor flooding , forecast agricultural production , monitor the atmospheric temperature and vapour content of water with a view to determining the variability of the atmospheric structure , perform measurements of the geomagnetic field with the same level of accuracy attained by observatories , measure atmospheric space radiation and its effects on advanced electronic components , determine the migratory route of the southern right whale and verify methods used in determining satellite attitude and velocity .  
It must be stressed again that the articles do not purport to specify the content of the primary rules of international law , or of the obligations thereby created for particular States . [ 1 ] In determining whether given conduct attributable to a State constitutes a breach of its international obligations , the principal focus will be on the primary obligation concerned . 
Zhibang Jia , standing vice-director of the organizing committee of the negotiation conference and vice-governor of Shaanxi province , says that this negotiation conference will be based on the principle of " mutual benefit , cooperation , development , and comprehensively pushing cooperation between the east and the west towards the 21st century " .  It will highlight the horizontal links and co-operation of east and west areas as the main content .  It will carefully select a number of cooperative projects in accord with national industry policy to attract business from domestic and overseas markets .  
This meeting is named " the Urumchi external economy and trade negotiation meeting " , while the two previous meetings were called " Urumchi border local region negotiation meeting " .  Its merchant invitation scope extends from neighboring countries to nearly 100 countries and regions such as Europe and America , southeast Asia , western Asia , the Middle East , etc .  Negotiation content include not only barter trade , but have also added items such as cash trading , economic and technological co-operation and capital and technology introduction , etc .  
This is because the compilation and publication that comes out of the ISI 's citation indexing database is aimed at providing services for scientific and technical information , and the items cited do not all directly affect the concrete substance of articles ; so as a type of statistical analysis product , the influence itself of the data does not have an academic evaluative content and should not be deemed the authoritative data for evaluating academic publications .  
At present , many foreign academic journals , because they have established specialized web pages on the Internet , not only have provided weekly content for articles to be published , but some have even set up links to vast information databases . 
Those projects in which they have invested is large in scale , high in technological content , and strong in competition .  This has raised Shanghai 's entire level of using foreign capital and sped up the development of new and high-tech industries .  
These investment projects are large in scale , with high technological content and strong market competitiveness .  These projects have enhanced Shanghai 's overall level of utilizing foreign capital and accelerated the development of its advanced and new technological industry .  
At the same time , spurred by market forces and supported by bank loans , a number of new-style domestic electrical appliances , computers , mobile phones and so on , with high science and technology content , low energy consumption , and a variety of functions rapidly sprang up , thus further improving market supply .  The quality of China 's economic growth has gradually improved amid both protection and pressure .  
General Secretary Jiang Zemin sent a letter to the National Conference on Popularizing Science , pointing out : We must strengthen in real earnest the work of popularizing science by taking it as an important task aimed at implementing the strategy of " national rejuvenation through science and education " and as an important content of socialist spiritual civilization building ; should energetically popularize scientific knowledge in the whole society ; and should advocate the spirit of science ; publicize scientific thinking ; and disseminate scientific measures ;  
During study and discussion , these localities generally said that the speech made by General Secretary Jiang Zemin at Guangdong 's Gaozhou City and the speeches delivered by the six standing committee members of the Central Political Bureau in these six localities are profound , rich and realistic in content , out of an overall strategic consideration and in light of the actual situation of the building of the county ( city ) leading groups and the leading cadre ranks .  
He said : Proposals received since the Second Session of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee were broad in content .  They primarily concerned the following : Maintaining a sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy ; strengthening agriculture and doing well in rural work ;  
Qinghai is rich in petroleum , natural gas , salt , and nonferrous metal deposits , and it has special climatic conditions for the development of special agriculture and animal husbandry .  There are prospects for attaining development in a leaping-forward way [ kua yue shi de fa zhan 6421-6390-1709-4104-4099-1455 ] in a relatively short period of time , provided that we seize the opportunity , accelerate the progress of reform and opening up , enhance our concept of the market , and pay attention to the scientific and technological content in the exploitation and utilization of resources .  
the industrial structure is irrational , the total number of secondary and tertiary industries is not large enough , with low technological content and poor efficiency .  
Deputy Tian Chengzhong , secretary of Pingdingshan City CPC Committee in Henan , said that ideological and political work includes many aspects such as education content , ways and means , leadership system , operational mechanism , component force , and position carriers [ zhen di zai ti , 7109-0966-6528-7555 ] , and is closely lined with structural reform , the building of the legal system , and cultural construction .  
The content of the proposals is mainly : Maintaining sustained rapid and healthy national economic growth , expanding domestic demand , promoting strategic economic restructuring , continuing to push ahead with reform and strengthening management , speeding up the development of science and technology and education , opening wider to the outside world , intensifying the building of a social security system , stepping up environmental protection , and strengthening the building of spiritual civilization and an honest and clean government .  
The motions handled since the Second Session of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee , which are rich in content , have mainly included those aimed at maintaining sustained , rapid , and healthy national economic growth ; strengthening agriculture and doing a good job in rural work ; continually and energetically pressing ahead with the state-owned enterprise reform ; guarding against and alleviating the financial crisis ; expanding domestic demand ; continually implementing the principle of opening up to the outside world and vigorously opening up the international market ;  
The forum maintained that the forms applied to conduct the education on the legal system for youngsters should be suitable to the youngsters ' cognitive features , and efforts should be made to make the education rich in content and to conduct it in a lively and varied manner .  
The PLA and armed police units are treating the campaign of learning from Lei Feng and Li Xiangqun as an important content of their ideological and political education , organizing the officers and men to learn from the advanced deeds of Lei Feng and Li Xiangqun in light of the realities of army building in the new period , and help the officers and men further their understanding of Lei Feng 's and Li Xiangqun 's lofty spirit .  
The " three representations " is the scientific summary of the Party 's character and aim , is the centralized requirements of maintaining the Party 's advancement , is the creative utilization and development of Theory of Marxism Party building , and is the fundamental guiding ideology of strengthening Party building under new circumstances , which has strong ideological content , theoretical content and distinctive character of the day .  
Schools of different types and at all levels should strive to explore new paths for conducting young people 's and students ' ideological education in the new period , reform and enrich the content of the ideological education courses taught at primary and middle schools and at colleges , actively support and help students to engage in extracurricular activities that are healthy in content , rich and colorful , and loved by them .  
The leaders of the two countries have reached consensus on the 16-character principle of " maintaining long-term stability , gearing to the needs of the future , maintaining good neighborly and friendly relations , and engaging in an all-round cooperation , " and have defined a framework for the future growth of relations between our two countries in the new century .  This has served to enhance mutual understanding and enrich the content of relations between our two parties and two countries .  
Centered on making breakthroughs in the reconnaisance and early warning problems in " striking at three things " and on " bottleneck " problems such as in guarding information in " defending against three things , " we should fully exploit the wisdom and talent of the officers and men , launch extensive mass innovation activities , combine indigenous with foreign things , continually tap the combat potential of the existing armament , and enhance the new technology content .  
In order to raise the strategizing competence of captains in the context of modern naval warfare , this detachment adjusted the content of training and took its vessel formation from yellow waters into blue waters , from training under general inshore conditions to rapid-reaction training under complex conditions in the coastal waters .  
The overall concept and content of human rights are indivisible and unchangeable .  The firm stride of the Chinese people walking toward domestic prosperity is unstoppable .  
some people , seeing others getting rich ahead of them , become mentally unbalanced , are no longer content with the salaried way of life of civil servants , stay aloof from the workers and peasants , draw close to " big money , " and gradually change from small fishing to big corruption .  
Today , with the reforms and opening to the outside , only when leading cadres at all levels possess noble values , strive to become pure people , noble people , people detached from base interests , people benefiting the people , thinking what the masses think , feeling the anxiety of the masses , suffering first , enjoying later , content to live an austere life , and having far-reaching ambitions , can they unite and lead the masses to approach common prosperity sooner .  
This important thinking , with rich content , profound thought and prominent characteristics of the current era , being highly theoretical and practicable , is a new summary of the Party 's nature , of its essential principles and of its historic mission , is a new development in Marxist theory on Party construction and is a new requirement of the Party organizations and cadres at all levels in the new situation .  
As in-depth changes in the military fields in the world are caused by the development of modern science and technology , especially high technology , the scientific and technological content of army building and modern warfare has been increased to an unprecedentedly high level .  This has put ever higher demands on the scientific and cultural qualities of our officers and men .  
After the new technologies and new methods of operation produced through the academy and troops ' joint effort in tackling key problems were popularized and applied in the various relevant units , the scientific and technological content of army training have greatly increased .  As a result , troop training through science and technology , in which the troops under training strike extreme low-altitude , high-speed targets with air defense missiles , has gotten over its " bottleneck " and is developing in the direction of high quality and greater depth .  
In line with a civilian market having abundant technology and products that are suited to the requirements of military equipment , many civilian-use technologies such as electronics technology , information technology , production technology , and materials technologies , all of which have developed rapidly , our army has instituted several " joint logistics reforms " and logistics reforms with " socialized support " as the main content , thus decreasing the burden and lengthening the strides forward .  
In theoretical study , they emphasized the need to grasp the basic content and essence of the " three represents . "  They paid special attention to finding where they lagged behind in practicing the " three represents " and improving rules and regulations based on the " three represents " in their efforts to improve work .  In this way , the study and implementation of the " three represents " has become a major part of the teaching by positive example in the " three stresses " education .  
Studying and understanding the important thinking of the Three Represents should be the key content in such study programs as Party committees central groups , theoretical learning programs for cadres ranked above regiment level and the education through Party 's lectures .  
For illegal publications whose content was not pornographic or criminal , but which had not gone through the approval process , this judicial explanation made it clear that seriously lurid publications and the disruption of orderly markets could be punished as " illegal business operations " .  
The rich ideological content of those songs realizes the spirit of Chairman Jiang 's major instructions on enhancing the Army 's ideological and political education , warmly eulogizes the nature and purposes of the people 's army and the glorious chapters of unity and struggle under the Party leadership , and displays the spiritual outlook of the vigorous and high-fighting spirit contemporary military personnel .  Songs are varied in style .  
With the introduction of modern information technology and with some units hit by an " online craze " , there arises the problem of " deviation " in the content of the ideological and political education , that is , neglect in employing advanced methods to conduct basic indoctrination of basic theories , and unsystematic , incomplete , and even fragmentary expounding of basic principles related to enhance convictions and to conduct oneself .  
Adopting advanced scientific means is meant to serve for ideological and political education .  First of all , content of political education must meet the needs of the times .  Political education content should be colorful and knowledge-based or it will not only not be conducive to solving ideological problems but also will produce negative impacts and cancel out the results of ideological and political education .  
He said : In our professional work , we must always set a high standard and strict demands .  We must acquire superior technique , increase the technology content of training , deep reform , and make constant efforts to explore and sum up new training methods and approaches .  
After being formed into an armored infantry array , " Special Contribution Company No . 5 " equipped itself with new equipment , and its training content has also been changed from a unitary infantry profession into a comprehensive training which integrated armored training with communications and crew training .  
In addition to making great efforts to strengthen ideological and political construction , all military colleges and universities should face modernization , face the world and face the future .  All military colleges and universities should be motivated to update their concepts of education , further update curricular content and methodology , continuously add new aspects to existing theories , knowledge , technology and tactics , and form a curriculum oriented toward the 21st century .  
During recent years , they " sharpened " themselves with the tasks of dealing with the priorities and difficulties in information operations and electronic countermeasures , established more than 20 tasks to tackle difficult problems in science-technology military training , including acquiring new knowledge , mastering new equipment , studying new military tactics and training high-quality personnel .  Through taking specific measures such as fixing the training content , measures , levels , and steps , they institutionalized and standardized science-technology military training .  
Instead of confining the research of the network offensive and defensive operation to leading organs and laboratories , this army unit has incorporated the subject into the training of its troops as a training content ; and this has enabled its troops to initially master the ability of conducting a network offensive and defensive operation .  
At the Central Committee Ideological and Political Work Conference , Comrade Jiang Zemin emphasized that , in the face of the new circumstances and new situation , ideological and political work must make efforts to carry out innovation and improvement on a foundation of carrying on and developing superior traditions and in such areas as content , form , method , means , and mechanisms .  In particular , he stressed , efforts must be made to heighten the sense of the times and strengthen direction , effectiveness , and initiative .  
Educational activities directed at certain targets , defining certain content , and organized around a relative focus , such as winter training for Party members , basic level Party schools , political schools for workers , night schools for peasants , theory study groups for young people , local educational institutes , and various types of training groups , etc .  
To effectively solve this problem , the division has conducted research on simulated high-plateau oxygen-deficient training in light of training troops with science and technology in recent years , and has summed up a complete set of methods for physical training .  As a result , routine training has basically produced the actual results of similar training in places over 4,500 m above the sea level , where only half of the normal oxygen content is in the air .  
Japanese-US joint military exercises have seen great changes in content , form and scale in recent years .  Their advance combat planning has been perfected and their combat capability and level of coordination have been further improved .  The trend of the two sides joining forces in military intervention in the security affairs of the Asia-Pacific region and in the handling of the surrounding situation is becoming more obvious , and this is bound to become a new destabilizing factor in security of the Asia-Pacific region .  
His subjective dynamic role is subject to the restriction of his own scientific and cultural level as well as scientific and technological content . 
This means shifting our civil air defense focus from service to winning high-tech wars , our civil air defense priority to higher high-tech content and establishing quality and better organizational command and emergency rescue capabilities , our civil air defense guidance to construction and management in accordance with law , and our civil air defense efficiency to the real achievement of a good cycle of war readiness , social , and economic efficiency .  
- - - Equipment training system for combat readiness : In the training system , this department adopted a training system which organically combines education in institutions with training in the base and troop training , persisted in conducting complete and united individual training , unit training , training for chiefs and organs , and comprehensive drills , basically built an orderly , regular , and well-coordinated equipment training system for combat readiness , which has a perfect structure and content .  
New scientific theories are the results of summarizing newly verified scientific facts , but we can not ignore the original verified scientific facts ( unless we can scientifically verify that the original beliefs were neither complete nor accurate ) .  We can not repudiate all the scientific content in the original theories that have been scientifically tested .  The evolution of old theories into new theories is not a matter of total repudiation .  
At the same time , the division also scientifically adjusted the content of its training , actively reformed the training methods and approaches , and built a number of simulated supplementary training laboratories .  As a result , the new armament 's automation , information , and combination functions are fully utilized and quickly transformed into combat strength .  
With the growing high-tech content in modern armaments , there are increasingly high requirements on our armed forces ' officers and soldiers in connection with scientific and cultural knowledge and military technological qualities .  
Only thus can we avoid making subjective judgments and acting blindly .  Only by persisting in seeking truth from facts can the content of arduous struggle be unceasingly renewed , the hardworking spirit be passed on to future generations , and the banner of arduous struggle attract , amass , and inspire the people .  
Some anti-chemical warfare equipment with high technological content have been successively developed and produced .  A modern anti-chemical warfare system being capable of observation , detection , cleanup , diffusing smoke and burning has been formed .  The main battle outfit is capable of defense against the three kinds of attacks .  
Starting in the late 1980 ' s and the early 1990 ' s , the US military has stepped up studies and practice in joint training , carried out exploration in the structure , content , order , rules , and means of joint training , and gradually formed a complete set of joint training structures with marked characteristics .  
They have achieved marked S &amp; T troop training results , sharply cultivating high-quality military talent , daring to reform and innovate , adhering to scientific objectivity , reforming training content , improving training methods , and creating innovative training means , to have made a prominent contribution to the in-depth development of S &amp; T troop training throughout the PLA .  
The five kinds of spirit proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin are a new development and summation of various kinds of lofty spirit that have emerged in a long process of the party 's cause of uniting with and fighting together with the people .  They have carried forward and nurtured our national spirit .  They have a rich ideological content and distinct characteristics of the times .  
The main contradiction plaguing the western regional garrisons ' logistical construction is the low standard of scientific and technological innovations and the key logistics elements ' low scientific and technological content .  There is a serious lack of qualified science and technology and well-educated personnel .

However there is the case of Taiwan 's only Hakka Bullfight team located in Wanluan Rural Township : While there is nothing unique about the content of their performances , after the bamboo bovine has finished in the temple , he must pass inspection from the temple Master who attaches an amulet before the animal is allowed to leave ; this adds the function of expelling evil .  
According to a survey done three years ago by Shao Li-fang , a lecturer at Shih Chien College , less than a third of unmarried people considered themselves " elite singles , " as a popular Chinese expression goes . Although most of them said they were content with their lot , half admitted they were lonely and missed having someone to take care of them .  
" A flat expansive land with neatly arranged dwellings , beautiful fields and lakes , mulberry and bamboo ; paths criss-cross the fields , cocks crow and dogs bark . . . aged and infants alike are happy and content . "  
Lin Ming-te says emphatically , " We are always calling for a Chinese cultural renaissance , and saying that modern architecture should be imbued with a traditional aesthetic . It 's a shame that one essential element is conspicuously missing from the vast majority of large public structures exhibiting a classical Chinese flavor - - the traditional poetic couplet . Most homes also give little thought to the content of their New Year 's couplets . "  
Film critic and dramatist Huang Chien-yeh lauds Stan Lai as an intelligent , expert creator with a strong sense of the social pulse who is a master at handling transitions , at propelling the action forward and at providing an abundance of content in a tightly knit structure . However , he only touches on the surface and reins himself in , stopping at a cheerful and upbeat level before delving into deeper concerns .  
On the software side , going into a modern theater meant the plot had to be tight and polished , not like the traditional outdoor stage with just a broad idea and the content left to the actors ' emotions to elaborate .  
The scrap metal dealers in Wanli in Tainan want to extract the most valuable metals , so they wash the scrap in acid . " Low-value " copper is washed out with the acid , and flows into the neighboring Er-jen River , both of whose banks are planted with the hollow green veggie . " The content of copper in the convolvulus is very high , " says Wang .  
They continually penetrate the soil , eating an amount of soil each day equal to their body weight , while their digestive system is like a factory line sucking in rough earth and waste and producing " night soil beads , " which are superior to bits of ordinary soil . Besides having greater air content , these " night soil beads " also have one third more water and microbes . Earthworm manure is excellent fertilizer .  
According to estimates of the scientific community , before a chlorine atom becomes inactive , its " power " is enough to destroy 10,000 ozone molecules . Add to this that mankind has continued to release vast amounts of CFCs into the atmosphere , and it 's no surprise that in the past few years the average ozone content at every latitude has fallen between one to ten percentage points . Further , at present the rate of loss is increasing 2-3% annually .  
The original content of the 24 Solar Terms was very simple , but over many years , they slowly developed into focal points for an extremely fertile cultural milieu . They are guides to farming life , reference dates for weather forecasting and holidays for all sorts of ceremonial activities . Almanacs , the weather , agriculture , the general life of the community - - all abide under the shadow of the Solar Terms !  
Meanwhile , China 's painters , living amidst domestic turmoil and foreign invasion , felt the pressure of disappearing traditions . Forced to absorb the creative techniques and methods of the West , China 's painters devoted their efforts to the reform of traditional painting , seeking an East-West fusion of technique . The content of their paintings abounded in themes of ethnic consciousness . Western painting thus followed completely different courses of development in China and Taiwan .  
When we chose the book labels as gifts , we simply thought they had an old-fashioned elegance and would be nice to collect . We never thought that the negative side of their content would lead to a misunderstanding . Because our paper-cut stories are mainly intended to be amusing and tell a story , many of them have a negative or ironic side to their meaning . This is true , for instance , of stories in recent issues such as " Both on the Losing End , " and " No Silver Buried Here . "  
Because the open style of our questions elicited a wide variety of opinions , expressed in an even greater variety of ways , for ease of statistical presentation we have combined the answers into various broad categories such as positive , negative or neutral , while reflecting the more detailed content in narrative form .  
Analyzing the content of the replies , in fact the positive and negative replies do not contradict each other . In other words , almost all our interviewees acknowledged that the Japanese army was both " brave and loyal " ( towards Japan ) and " cruel and ruthless " ( towards the countries they invaded ) . The only difference was in whether they personally tended to like the Japanese for this , or despise them .  
The situation was becoming intolerable , and after much thought one of Augustus ' courtiers , von Tschirnhausen , who was an amateur alchemist , concluded there were only two ways to solve this thorny problem : one was to find a way to transmute base metals into gold , so the emperor could buy porcelain to his heart 's content ; the other was to go to the root of the problem by finding the secret of making porcelain !  
As for dialogue content , in addition to those traditional scripts that still sound fresh after a hundred listenings , some people have begun to offer up new creations in step with current times . And the language employed is no longer Beijing Mandarin with its heavily retroflexed consonants . In recent years , comic dialogues have imperceptibly gone through an unprecedented metamorphosis - - they are now often recited in local dialects .  
When Hsiu Ping-shan " retired " from politics , he drew inspiration from the recently popular " all-you-can-eat " restaurants to establish his own " all-you-can-write " center . The store is replete with brushes , ink , paper and ink stone , as well as exemplary calligraphy from all the great masters . Air conditioning and tea are provided , and a teacher even gives free instruction . Customers can arrive empty-handed and write to their hearts ' content .  
I feel like a late 20th century George Catlin , who traveled the American West painting portraits of native Americans . Armed with a camera rather than a paintbrush , I have the chance to capture Yunnan 's minorities in all their happy glory , while they still feel content within their ancient cultural perimeters . What began as a documentary exercise evolved into something more personal .  
In terms of texture , the proportions of protein and fiber can be adjusted to produce different sensations . Thus , chicken is relatively coarse , so the substitute is made with a higher proportion of fiber . Fish is more tender , so the protein content is raised . Add to this that the dishes are processed using the same cooking techniques as for meat-frying in oil , roasting-and the result is that you can hardly tell the veggies from the real things .  
Ann Philips , a retired professor from the Spanish department at the University of Central Oklahoma , cited the example of how the Maya script was deciphered : for many years researchers could only puzzle over those exquisite human figures and other images , but could not interpret them ; in the end it was an " amateur " - the painter Linda Schele-who interpreted the script from the content of the images themselves , and thus solved many mysteries about the history of Mayan dynastic succession .  
In September 1994 the Cultural Committee of the Preparatory Committee began to formally discuss such matters as the names and emblems of government departments and agencies , arrangements for public holidays , the design and issue of postage stamps , the content of school textbooks , recognition of academic qualifications and so on , and also affirmed the principle of removing the visible trappings of colonial rule . Since then , wave after wave of actions to remove historical symbols has swept through both the public and private sectors .  
But a name can not be changed on a whim-the content of courses and research programs has to be planned beforehand . Chou is also aware how quickly times are changing : even the situation five years from now can not be predicted , and someone who is only familiar with one branch of knowledge can not respond to change . The orientation of systems science is for students to learn how to " integrate " knowledge of different fields such as materials science , thermal flux and nuclear engineering .  
Furthermore , in the past it was easy to start a business with little capital , and both blue and white collar workers would aim to set up on their own once they had saved some money . " No-one is content to remain a lowly member of the working classes - - everyone wants to better themselves .  
He also is " allergic " to abstract modern art . He feels that these artists merely want to express their individuality by doing something strange and different , but without putting in any real effort in terms of content or technique , so that they can not find resonance with the broad public .  
These periodicals and books are of a very high standard and have a respected position in international sinology . Their diverse content includes economics , literature ( both classical and modern ) , politics , history , philosophy and so on . These publications constitute a major textual resource for academic research .  
No taste like home Old Confucius was not the only one who was partial to raw fish . Poet Zhang Han of the Western Jin ( 265-317 ) was appointed an official in the capital Luoyang . But when the autumn winds began to blow he was so overcome with nostalgia for the thick watershield soup and sliced raw sea bass of his native Suzhou that he said : " What matters most in life is to be content .  
On the subject of differentiation of content , Wang Zhidong says that wherever a website is based , its content has to be decided by local users . For instance , in Taiwan and Hong Kong people are mainly interested in entertainment and leisure , spicy show business news and the stock market ; but in mainland China the most popular subject is sport , especially football . People from Beijing or Shanghai often fall out online over the teams they support .  
A further key element of the counter-pornography policy is the TV classification system introduced in January this year , similar to movie classifications , in which programs are graded and color-coded according to content : red for " restricted , " yellow for " parental guidance , " blue for " protected " and green for " general audience . "  
From today 's perspective we see that although the government has maintained a continuous , unbroken hold on Taiwan , it long since underwent significant changes : from the tight control over the country in the early years , when the national leader was supreme , to the no-holds-barred democracy of today ; from a reverential attachment to Confucian orthodoxy and the complete rejection of any notion that the leadership could content itself with ruling just a small fragment of the original country , to today 's chaotic national identity .  
In 1996 , the US Congress passed the Communications Decency Act in an attempt to regulate Internet content . The act made the creation , transmission or solicitation of materials lewd , obscene or harmful to minors via the Internet a crime punishable by up to two years imprisonment and / or a fine of up to US $ 25,000 . The bill faced continuous opposition from within legal circles throughout its approval process and prompted the American Civil Liberties Union to sue on constitutional grounds .  
With their relatively low moisture content , the woody structure of Formosan acacias possess just the right degree of firmness , not at all like the damp and spongy wood of the Okinawa pine or the gunpowder trees commonly seen in rural northern Taiwan . The lower moisture content makes the heartwood of the acacia resistant to parasitic insects , allowing it to remain standing long after the tree 's outer layers have rotted away .  
A few days ago my old friend Hsieh Chun-teh let me have a look at his most recent book , an experimental collection of 50 digital images that he has spent the last five years working on . Comparing it with the works he has published using conventional photographic techniques , I feel that , in terms of both form and content , he has gone beyond his old self , and he has also showed how photographers of the future can make use of digital imaging technology .  
For instance , the course content offered by his college 's Graduate Institute of Technology and Innovation Management is only suitable for postgraduate work . " But due to the regulations imposed by the Ministry of Education , if you set up only a graduate school the educational resources available from the government do not compare with those for a combined undergraduate department and graduate school . " Wu says that this results in institutions having to make a choice between " actual need " and " winning more resources . "  
In the past there was also an enormous difference between the simple content of elementary school courses and the difficult and dry content of junior high school courses . In future , courses will be designed with continuity from first to ninth grade , and there will no longer be such a break between elementary and junior high school .  
Also , in line with the general trend in education reform toward diversification of teaching materials , the integrated curriculum not only abolishes the current requirement for junior high schools to use the standard textbooks published by the National Institute for Compilation and Translation , allowing them to use any approved textbook instead , but it also allows county and city governments , schools , and teachers to produce their own teaching materials , and particularly encourages schools to form " curriculum development committees " to devise course content .  
With the current staffing structure in junior high schools , physics and chemistry teachers are not equipped to cross over and teach biology , and biology teachers can not teach information technology . Thus teaching in a single study field may be split between five different teachers , and pupils may be left to guess from the content of each unit which teacher will appear on any particular day . What kind of uncertainty will that introduce into the pupil-teacher relationship ?  
The team she leads took the theme of " family reunion at Mid-Autumn Festival " as the basis to ingeniously integrate content from earth science ( the movement of the tides and the waxing and waning of the moon ) , maths ( quadratic functions of Hou Yi shooting down the nine suns ) , history ( mid-autumn legends and the Mongol Empire ) , and counseling activities ( satisfactions and regrets in life ) , which they linked together in a set of thematic activities with a rich content .  
The more important question concerns how to achieve lateral and vertical integration between the content of different textbooks as quickly as possible . Curriculum development committees at schools everywhere have all zeroed in on this problem . Teachers may start running into problems when the science teacher in third and fourth grades uses textbooks from Nani Books , for example , while the science teacher in fifth and sixth grades uses something from Hanlin . Or students may find that some of the content in their science textbooks is repeated in social studies .  
On the day before national Children 's Day , Taipei Wanfang Hospital held a " Children 's Health Check-up Fair " in which different types of foods were assigned different colored " traffic lights " to indicate their relative calorie content . By making it into a game , children had fun while learning about healthy eating .  
The only thing they can do is control their weight by eating the proper foods . The hospital invented a game to teach children how to identify healthy snacks . Low-nutrition , high-calorie goodies such as cakes , chocolates , potato chips , and french fries are assigned a red light , indicating that they should not be eaten too often . Hamburgers , fried chicken , and milk shakes are basically healthy , but are high in fat content and are thus assigned a yellow light , indicating that children should eat these foods in moderation .  
In May of this year , the government formally declared " digital content " to be one of the " twin star " industries . It plans to pour NT $ 5 billion into the industry over the next four years , establish a " digital content college " that will cultivate IT skills among artists and writers , and encourage venture capitalists to invest also in the hope of growing the industry 's annual production value to more than NT $ 200 billion , four times its current value , in five years .  
If it is easy to find a free e-paper that is similar , or if the readers do n't really need the content , it is difficult to achieve the level of appeal required to collect fees , " says Hsu . But it can be done . Currently , e-papers at PChome that do the best with subscriber fees are for language learning and industrial reports . The publication with the most subscribers is iThome , a computer report , with about 10,000 .  
In the broad sense , an electronic book , or e-book , means published content that is stored in the form of digital data on any kind of electronic storage media , such as a hard disk , floppy disk , optical disk or IC card , and transmitted through a data network to the user 's digital reading equipment , such as a PC , notebook , PDA or even a mobile phone .  
In April 2001 , Culturecom and mainland China 's People 's Education Press ( PEP ) , which is under the control of the PRC education ministry , announced that they were launching a joint venture to set up Renwen E-Textbook Technology Company . Their aim is to develop the mainland 's primary and secondary school textbook market , which serves a student population numbering in the hundreds of millions . PEP will be responsible for course planning and content , while Culturecom will provide support with e-book technology .  
Chu Bong-foo says he first conceived Cosmic Drifter in 1998 . The ideas came from his previously published Nine Essays On Intelligence , in which he discusses thought , human nature and value in terms of energy conversion , the formation of matter , the nature of time and space , and the evolution of the universe . But the essays ' content was dry and dull , and nobody understood it . Therefore he wanted to turn his theories into a popular novel that ordinary people would understand .  
" As far as the explosive power of volcanoes goes , the lava eruption was much more moderate , " says Tsao Shuh-jong , section chief of the Division of Original Geology in the Central Geological Survey . In addition , basaltic lava has a relatively low silicon dioxide content , so it is correspondingly less sticky . Flowing basalt thus forms very different shapes from the lava of a typical volcanic eruption .  
The lava pushed up by volcanic activity around the main island of Taiwan was mainly composed of andesite . Molten andesite has a relatively higher content of silicon dioxide , so is more sticky . Thus it more readily forms into conical mountains such as the Tatun volcanic mountains of northern Taiwan . The basalt rocks of Penghu form a stark contrast to the geology of the main island of Taiwan .  
Chung Chiao , head of a drama company and also a judge for the poetry competition , analyzes the poems in terms of content : The Filipino poems subtly reveal the fervent culture of a tropical island colonized by the Spanish , a poetry filled with love of life and more socially conscious , because of the Filipino tradition of fighting for their rights ; Indonesian works tend to emphasize the micro details of human relationships , while the Vietnamese and Thai poems contain more advice and aphorisms .  
Sinorama has many times reported on the government 's intention to develop a " knowledge-based economy " and to foster the development of the so-called " twin star " industries-digital content and biotechnology . But relative to other countries , do these fields offer Taiwan the competitive advantage that a successful business strategy requires ?  
All types of fish that can be eaten raw have a fairly high fat content , but the bluefin is particularly famed for its fattiness . The Pacific bluefin that migrate through the waters east of Taiwan prefer lower water temperatures than other tuna , and usually stay north of the 18th parallel . To protect it from cold the Pacific bluefin has more fat than the yellowfin and albacore , which are distributed around the equator , or the southern bluefin , which lives in the southern hemisphere .  
But as things have developed , and with strong support from the Council for Cultural Affairs , it has become ever richer in content , and moved toward being an " all-new , all-round operatic production " that combines the beauty of Peking Opera and Western opera . A key role in this joint creation is played by performers from the opera troupe of the Fu Hsing Dramatic Arts Academy .  
This month 's cover story , " The New Star of the Post-Information Age-Digital Content , " analyzes the digital content industry , which is expected to be one of the next wave of key industries in Taiwan . It is an industry which requires unlimited creativity and rich content to come out on top . We also look at what steps the government is taking to utilize local cultural assets to create business opportunities , to make a knowledge-based contribution to the digital-era Chinese language market .  
" Perhaps digital content is no different in its basic nature from the writing , language , physical artifacts and images , and video programs we have long been familiar with , " explains Hwang Tai-yang . But once information of all kinds is digitized , and converted into virtual ones and zeros that can flow as an electric current , there will no longer be any obstacles to its crossing platforms to be transmitted , stored , accessed and used at will .  
The most impressive digital content appears as multimedia . A one-minute video clip only requires about ten seconds to download via broadband Internet , but using narrowband may require six to ten times that long . In order to ensure smooth downloading and broadcasting , computer hardware and software require continuous upgrading . In addition , monthly broadband service costs range from NT $ 600-1000 , which is too steep for some families .  
The eighth clause of the Basic Education Law , which was passed in June of the same year , puts it even more clearly : " During the period of compulsory education , parents are responsible for guiding and assisting their children . Moreover , parents have the legal right to select educational method and content on behalf of their children and to decide whether they enroll in a school . "  
Some months ago you ran a feature on digital content , and recently you also reported the development of nanotechnology in Taiwan . From these articles we can see how sensitive the government is to the development of new technologies , and how-whether by their own initiative or with government guidance-many large , medium and small enterprises are getting involved in R &amp; D or production related to these emerging technologies .  
There are records of the medicinal uses of alcohol in China even on ancient tortoise shells dating back to the Shang and Zhou dynasties . " Alcohol is a good natural solvent , enabling one to get a higher proportion of the therapeutic content out of the raw materials of Chinese medicine , " Chen Chun-che says .  
Amidst the concurrence of rising rice wine prices , initial licensing of private distilling operations , and bootleg poisonings , sales of standard rice wine-the former " red label , " now Daoxiang 40 proof ( i.e . 20% alcohol content ) - fell from 25 million dozen bottles two years ago to 400,000 last year .  
Many nutritionists have finally come round to telling the media that it is best not to eat too many instant noodles . The reasons are that they have a high salt content and can cause high blood pressure , they contain preservatives that may cause cancer . Also , some unscrupulous manufacturers make their noodles using waste cooking oil , and there are worries that eating this oil can lead to digestive tract disorders and other ailments .  
" The literary level of its readers has an influence on a publishing company 's ambition , " says Wu Hsing-wen , Beijing representative of Yuan-Liou Publishing and long-time observer of the publishing scene on both sides of the Taiwan Strait . Taiwanese readers are punctilious in their choices , but they are also very receptive , which is why local publishers can make bold and experimental market forays . It is also the reason Taiwanese books are successful in terms of content and set trends for the Chinese reading public around the world .  
As well as having these odd combinations of publishers and publications , content standards are also slipping . Take for example men 's magazines , the supposed symbols of the relaxing of societal restrictions . Casually laid out at the front of any newsstands one can see four or five such magazines , all proclaiming to be about health and fitness . But the cover pictures will undoubtedly be pushing the envelope as far as possible , attempting to be as revealing as they can get away with .  
Because financial magazines from Taiwan are still a touchy subject in the mainland , as well as concerns about the ability of mainland editors and reporters to live up to the Commonwealth standard , they have started a new magazine . Last year they started publishing Dongfang Qiyejia in Shanghai , sourcing their launch issue 's content from the senior staff of Commonwealth , to make absolutely certain to produce a magazine just as high in quality as its Taiwanese counterpart .  
At the end of November , the Legislative Yuan was buzzing as legislators rushed to get key bills affecting the nation 's future and the economy passed . Legislative assistants ( LAs ) , responsible for helping their respective party caucuses negotiate the content of legislation and then mobilize legislators to vote on it , lost track of time and many could be found wandering around enveloped in a haze of exhaustion .  
However , kitchen waste is the main source of the foul odors and disease vector proliferation in garbage . When kitchen wastes are mixed with other garbage for processing , landfills are inundated with noxious gases , polluting the air . If taken instead to incinerators , due to their high water content , much energy will be wasted in the burning process , and the lifespan of the incinerator will also be reduced . At the same time , concentrations of the toxin dioxin will be increased .  
HUF chairwoman Mary Chen points out that Taiwan 's traditional business groups have put economics first , neglecting an environment-friendly business culture , which does cause worry . However , through monitoring and testing mechanisms , compost content and quality problems can be reduced to a minimum . This is a direction that many environmental groups will be pursuing in the future .  
Although this winter Mingcheng 's Murcott production was not very high , the quality was excellent . Thanks to a high 13-degree sugar / acid ratio ( sugar content / free acid content ) and free media publicity thrown in by the home distribution company , the day after the ads appeared the borough head , Chang Jui-tuan , who was responsible for taking phone orders , spent the whole day on the phone .  
Liu Wei-kung , associate professor of sociology at Soochow University , says that rather than debate incessantly about the definition and scope of cultural and creative industries , it would be better to grasp the salient characteristic at their core , which is that content on its own is not enough . It 's extremely important that the product or service creates an appealing story that will pull people in , so as to give people a joyful experience in the process of consumption .  
The " content " of these cultural products has been rich and varied but Taiwan , with its many downstream industries , has been short of something very important in the development of its culture industry-intermediaries who will make the connection to an artistic source , then apply technology so that art is transformed into a commodity of a different kind , and intangible culture can become a tangible industry .  
With the rise of the Internet and the digitization of audiovisual content , technologies that were originally developed for the two different forms of transmission for video and telecommunications are using digital signal convergence to enable families to enjoy the interactive pleasures of video-on-demand through set-top boxes . Looking at the world as a whole , the spread of digital content is an unmistakable trend .  
It is expected that interactive services will change the public 's passive TV viewing habits , shifting them toward active choice and control over viewing times . They are also likely to allow audiences to pay for programming according to what they wish to watch . However , the key to success is that the content delivered must be varied and extensive .  
Later , due to my persistence , after they had considered things for some time , finally a letter arrived from the editorial department . It said that in consideration of my good reputation in the scientific community , they would publish the paper , despite being unable to find any evidence supportive of my conclusion . However , the text would include a special disclaimer , indicating that I was solely responsible for the content , and that the editors did not back up my claims in any way .  
Chou takes the nine-year integrated curriculum as an example . Neither the idea of a system integrating the content to be studied in Grades 1-9 , nor that of academic " fields , " are new . In fact , these things had been spelled out in previous curricular standards . In past decades , however , one saw the prevalent use of " contracting out " specialized tasks within Taiwan 's education system , so much so that now that things have been opened up , people can not imagine doing otherwise .  
Then the Hsinchu Science-Based Industrial Park came along some years later , attracting domestic and overseas tenants with its autonomous management , customs-bonded operations , and " deep processing " ( i.e . processing that yields a significant level of value-added content ) . This was the key to Taiwan 's successful transition to a new type of industry .  
After a while , the bent of his writing gradually turned towards science fiction , philosophy , and the exploration of the human psyche . A self-proclaimed eclectic , Chang is n't content to stay within established genres , but instead casts a wide literary net that encompasses history , philosophy , movies , and politics .  
During a three-day meeting on this respiratory tract disease , WHO endorsed the content of a research report , which indicated " strong political commitment , adequate financial resources and sound technology " have substantially reduced the burden of tuberculosis to India and China .  
Although statements were made at the rhetorical level , to his knowledge there had never been an operational attempt to give content to economic , social and cultural rights , nor to include them in overall strategies or specific objectives pursued .  
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work , by promoting broader and deeper international cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities , and by revitalizing its work and that of its subcommittees .  
The delegation of Egypt would like to avail itself of this opportunity to stress that whatever the linguistic formulas may be , its concept of the operative content of the paragraphs relating to reproductive and sexual health , especially paragraphs 56 , 57 and 58 , is that their implementation will take place in accordance with the legal system and the cultural and religious heritage of each society .  
The content of the statements made at the highest level during the debate at the Special Commemorative Meeting and the Declaration adopted on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations again demonstrated the need for the international community to give the economic and social development problems of developing countries the attention they deserve .  
Together with other countries , including Egypt , Malaysia supported Indonesia , which , speaking in its capacity as Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement , emphasized that the five declarations by the five nuclear Powers varied in terms of structure and content , as well as remaining devoid of any legal force .  
As we see it , a gradual and permanent expansion of contacts , primarily in the economic field and in environmental protection , scientific research , the transfer of technology , culture , education and tourism , could also bring about substantial changes in the qualitative content of the political dialogue .  
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles which deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , focusing on scientific literacy , moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic and multi-cultural societies . 
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles that deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , etc . focusing on scientific literacy , human moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic societies and pluri-cultural societies .  
They underscore in our view a basic need for the United Nations to be responsive to the demands of a changing international political landscape whose form and content are yet to be fully assessed and fully determined so that the continuing legitimacy of the United Nations can be assured .  
The paper proposed specific approaches to topics perceived as sensitive or controversial ; called for new ways to select key concepts and set priorities ; and stressed the importance of ensuring that course content was clear and appropriate to both the socio-cultural context of the country and the age level of the students .  
Asked about the specific content of the equality clause in the National Population Law and whether recourse was available in the event that national equality legislation was not applied at the local level , the representative said that the National Population Law established equality between men and women where family planning was concerned and provided recourse to courts .  
To summarize , the exact content and quantitative objectives of a Tunisian policy on sustainable human development , which will be reflected in the country strategy note , will emerge from the process of formulating Tunisia 's Agenda 21 and strategic studies conducted in the context of preparations for the ninth plan .  
Although NATCAP began without a coherent strategy and with a heavy reliance on external inputs , the current generation of NATCAP countries have evolved to a point where there is substantial national content with increased reliance on in-country task forces .  
Improvement in the overall quality of both primary and secondary education will require tackling the internal inefficiencies in the existing system and improving services in keeping with the nation 's need for an educational content responsive to the changes occurring in the national market economy .  
In circumstances in which the Belgrade Government is widely recognized as the champion of double standards , and the situation of Albanians living on their own lands in Kosovo is increasingly grave and alarming as a result of the Serbs ' repressive and truly genocidal activities , the entire content of the Serbian memorandum is simply ridiculous . 
The content of the reports was similar to that of others reviewed by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the former Yugoslavia and by the thematic rapporteurs of the Commission on Human Rights on the right to life and the physical integrity of persons , as well as by other United Nations organs and agencies that are attempting to devise a peaceful , just and lasting solution to the conflict and that are engaged in human rights or humanitarian relief activities .  
While it is true that the number of resolutions regarding UNRWA has been reduced in the past year from ten to seven , the content of these resolutions remains occupied with political issues irrelevant to the work for which UNRWA is responsible , and thus remains detached from the new reality .  
The content and complexity of these regulations must be appropriate to the existing degree of financial intermediation , neither so restrictive as to prevent competition and development of innovative institutions or practices , nor so permissive as to allow the establishment and operation of shadowy and shaky financial institutions .  
While it is true that the number of resolutions regarding UNRWA has been reduced in the past year from 10 to 7 , the content of these resolutions remains occupied with political issues irrelevant to the work for which UNRWA is responsible , and thus remains detached from the new reality .  
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles that deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , etc . focusing on scientific literacy , human moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic societies and pluri-cultural societies . 
Furthermore , these programme development activities , and the materials which result from them , provide an objective and publicly accessible record of the unbiased and universal content of the Centre 's assistance activities , which has the effect of increasing confidence in the programme while maximizing its utility and providing a means for its crucial and continuous improvement .  
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles that deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , etc . focusing on scientific literacy , human moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic societies and pluri-cultural societies . 
At the time of this reorganization , the head of the First Group had expressed his conviction that , although considerable promise of success was evident in the production of diffusion barriers , the technological content of the entire gaseous diffusion process was likely to be beyond Iraq 's short-term capabilities and had suggested that the gas centrifuge enrichment process was worthy of attention .  
Neither its drafting nor its content is commensurate with the gravity of the Israeli aggression and its serious consequences for the people of Lebanon , who have been subjected to killing and displacement , let alone with the destructive negative implications for Lebanon 's infrastructure and for its Government 's tenacious reconstruction efforts and ambitious reconstruction plans after long years of a destructive civil war .  
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work , by promoting broader and deeper international cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities , and by revitalizing its work and that of its subcommittees .  
It was also observed that while the text deserved to be kept on the Special Committee 's agenda , the heading and the content of the draft document should be more concise and clearly defined , its structure could be rationalized and its provisions dealing with the sources of funding for the relevant mechanisms should be based on a more realistic approach .  
There is no doubt that this singular situation , in which the creator of the rule of law is also its direct object , is less favourable to the development of a legal system which is balanced , whether as regards its normative scope or the material content of its rules .  
We feel that all the working papers submitted and statements made demonstrate the necessity of providing any eventual fourth special session with real and pragmatic content ; otherwise , we will merely be repeating a sterile exercise which , because of its content , would not enjoy consensus among the members of the international community .  
Any new concept needs to be accompanied by an information , education and communication ( IEC ) strategy to make people aware of its content and implications - all the more so if this new concept involves , as does the concept of reproductive rights and reproductive health , many aspects , ranging from sociocultural factors - cultural beliefs and practices , status of women , overall health and well-being , religious convictions and ethical values - to economic conditions .  
However , the Special Rapporteur indulged in an abstract political and legal analysis based on presumptions , allegations and misinformation with a view to emptying those decrees of their noble humanitarian content , seeking ways to exaggerate any shortcoming or weakness , presumed or real , in order to undermine the position of Iraq , thereby rendering his conclusions untrustworthy .  
The treaty bodies , based on six human rights conventions , have not only become effective structures monitoring the compliance by States with the human rights obligations resulting from those treaties : their impact in the field of human rights goes far beyond this function and extends , inter alia , to clarification of the content of human rights ; the functioning of the human rights machinery , including early warning and preventive measures ; cooperation of Governments with the United Nations ; protection of individuals in the framework of optional communications procedures ; and human rights education .  
Moreover , not content with falsely accusing Iraq in the tenth preambular paragraph of summary executions , arbitrary detention and torture , with the sole aim of tarnishing the country 's reputation , the sponsors had neglected to mention the positive developments that had occurred in Iraq , including amnesties granted to prisoners and initiatives to strengthen democracy , pluralism and respect for human rights , such as the right to free speech .  
Improvement in the overall quality of both primary and secondary education will require tackling the internal inefficiencies in the existing system and improving services in keeping with the nation 's need for an educational content responsive to the changes occurring in the national market economy .  
On 17 October 1995 , at hearings held by the subcommittee of the United States Congress for indigenous and western hemisphere affairs , the representative of the President of the United States , Mr . Geoffrey L . Farrow , who was also the co-chairman of the inter-agency working group on Puerto Rican affairs , had stated that the current impasse would continue until the Federal Government faced up to its responsibilities in the matter and gave real content to its policy of support for the self-determination of Puerto Ricans .  
Before commencement of the questioning , the suspect shall be informed in detail of the acts of which he is accused , along with all available background information relating to them , a summary of the content of the existing pieces of evidence and the applicable criminal laws .  
While it is true that the number of resolutions regarding the United Nations Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) has been reduced in the past years from 10 to 7 , the content of these resolutions remains occupied with political issues irrelevant to the work for which UNRWA is responsible , and thus remains detached from the new reality .  
While it is true that the number of resolutions regarding the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East ( UNRWA ) has been reduced in the past years from 10 to 7 , the content of these resolutions remains occupied with political issues irrelevant to the work for which UNRWA is responsible , and thus remains detached from the new reality .  
The Ministers agreed to reduce dependence on the information and cultural media of the industrialized nations by initiating and supporting cooperative activities through fresh and dynamic approaches to programming , message content and networking in the media systems of non-aligned and other developing countries .  
Because the United Nations system plays a predominantly supporting and facilitating role in shelter and settlements development , the substantive content of the follow-up by the United Nations system to Habitat II will be guided by national and local priorities for assistance , as outlined in the national reports and as further developed by the national mechanisms recommended in the Habitat Agenda .  
In addition to the Central Analysis and Testing Laboratory , the Government has established the National Institute for Research into Physical and Chemical Analysis , in order to equip the country with suitable means of providing accurate information about the composition of a substance and ensuring efficient and effective control of the content of products brought into use , thus preventing the circulation of products having invisible effects on human or animal health or harmful effects on the environment , and with a view to the issue of international certificates of conformity .  
The proposal was made by the Commission in its report on its forty-seventh session in 1995 , 1 / in which the Commission notes that the topic could be considered as part of its long-term programme of work and could , inter alia , cover the content and scope of the rule of exhaustion of local remedies , the rule of nationality of claims as applied to both natural and juristic persons , problems of stateless persons and dual nationals , and the effect of dispute settlement clauses on domestic remedies and on the exercise of diplomatic protection .  
However , CPC had been unable to reach agreement on the content of that document at its session in June 1996 and had recommended that the Secretary-General be asked to present to the current session of the General Assembly , through CPC at its September session , a short and concise document to be considered for inclusion in the proposed medium-term plan based on relevant resolutions and decisions of intergovernmental bodies and taking into account the views expressed by the members of CPC .  
In order to better review the promotion and practical realization of the Declaration , the Working Group decided to collect information on the constitutions and legislation of States in respect of the protection and promotion of the rights of minorities , and to commission the preparation of short studies on the content and scope of the core principles contained in the Declaration , including the formulation of specific and concrete recommendations for their application in different countries and regions of the world .  
Since many questions and misunderstandings surround the definitions and content of the terminologies of sects , new religious movements and even formal religion and since in international practice confusion reigns and States may have diametrically opposed attitudes to the same group , raising it to formal religious status or pejoratively classifying it as a sect , the Special Rapporteur feels that an international high-level governmental conference should be held to study and decide upon a common approach to sects and religions that respects human rights . 
Further , the precise content of the freedom of transit has in each single case to be agreed upon by the transit State and the landlocked State concerned , and in the absence of agreement concerning the terms and modalities for exercising the right of access of persons and goods , transit through the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany is regulated only by national law , in particular with regard to ways and means of transport and the use of traffic infrastructure .  
Part one of the chapter covered a wide range of issues relating to the origins of international responsibility ; part two dealt with various aspects of the content , forms and degrees of international responsibility ; part three concerned the settlement of disputes ; and two annexes contained provisions relating to the Conciliation Commission and the Arbitral Tribunal envisaged in part three .  Part one had been completed in 1980 , and since then the Commission had concentrated on parts two and three .  
Since its address to the Sixth Committee at the previous session , ICRC had continued its work to clarify the content of international humanitarian law and to ensure its continued adaptation to the conditions of modern warfare , with particular emphasis on its applicability to United Nations peacekeeping and enforcement operations , on rules applicable to war at sea , and on the prohibition of anti-personnel mines and blinding laser weapons .  
The economic crisis , on the one hand , and the identity crisis , on the other , are aggravated by the claims of people of French stock to ascendency over naturalized French citizens and immigrants ; hence the reference to the theme of national preference , with its xenophobic and even racist content , in political speeches .  
It looked forward to working with the Netherlands and the Russian Federation towards the development of the programme 's substantive content , and stressed the importance of developing activities to commemorate those occasions at the regional as well as the global level .  
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work and by promoting broader and deeper international and regional cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities .  
Their export earnings were hit particularly hard by their specialization in semiconductors and types of computer equipment that have relatively low technological content and that were subject to more pronounced downward price pressures when demand fell .  
One essential lesson learned in the HIV / AIDS epidemic is that universally recognized human rights standards should guide policy-makers in formulating the direction and content of HIV-related policy and form an integral part of all aspects of national and local responses to HIV / AIDS .  
Overall , the growing political awareness of the importance of information , the globalization of information content and accessibility , technological changes in the areas both of telecommunications and of information technologies , social trends such as public participation and popular demand for information , and support from major groups , the United Nations system , and other intergovernmental and international organizations have all had an impact on the phenomenal progress made in the area of the accessibility of information through electronic means .  
He noted that humanitarian law initially had been developed in response to ordinary international armed conflicts wherein organized regular armies faced each other , and the content of humanitarian law clearly reflected its origin .  
While the number of personnel requiring rations is lower than in the prior period , the increase is attributable to the higher cost of bottled water ( $ 0.57 ) than in the previous period ( $ 0.50 ) and the additional requirement for bottled water for the team sites for cooking purposes , consumption by visiting flight crews and its use for generators to prevent potential damage to the equipment by the high salt and mineral content of local water . ( e ) Daily allowance .  
Calls upon the Government of Guatemala , URNG and Guatemalan society as a whole to make every possible effort to familiarize the Guatemalan people with the content of the Peace agreements as quickly as possible , to ensure the full participation of the people in building the new multi _ ethnic , multicultural and plurilingual nation , establishing a democratic society with social justice , initiating a period of sustained and sustainable economic and social development and ensuring the pre _ eminence of civilian authority in national decision _ making ;  
Without educational content relevant to current needs , without preparation in the learning skills and new knowledge required for the future , and without efforts to improve learning achievement , access may neither serve the purposes intended nor provide the benefits expected .  Fortunately , serious reflection , more rigorous planning and a spirit of innovation have prepared the ground in many countries for important educational advances in the years ahead .  
At the national , regional and international levels , judicial human rights bodies continued to develop the legal framework of refugee protection , further defining the scope of obligations towards asylum-seekers and adding content to the rule of non-refoulement , also in respect of persons facing a substantial risk of torture .  
Thus the topic will be limited only to codification of secondary rules on the subject : while addressing the requirement of a violation of an international obligation of the State as a prerequisite , it will not address the specific content of those international legal obligations , whether under customary or treaty law .  
Improvement in the overall quality of both primary and secondary education would require tackling the internal inefficiencies in the existing system and improving services in keeping with the nations need for an educational content responsive to the changes occurring in the national market economy .  
In the light of the continued high prevalence of protein-energy malnutrition , UNICEF and WFP plan to enhance the protein content of monthly rations through the inclusion of UNIMIX and high protein biscuits , thus increasing supplementary feeding rations to 77 per cent of the daily needs of the beneficiary .  
To that end , the Government is strongly encouraged to consider taking appropriate steps to develop a legal and institutional framework for public broadcasting to ensure that the State-financed broadcasting media can operate effectively as a public service broadcaster , with full guarantees of editorial and operational independence from Government and all other political influence on programming content .  
In the view of Argentina , before deciding to convene the special session , and after having carefully studied its financial implications , it would be advisable to ensure the proper preparation of the session and provide it with some real content so that we do not repeat past mistakes .  
In the face of the increasing power of private global actors to determine the distribution of income and production and the content of economic and social policies , outside the political process , it is important to broaden participation in decision-making and to strengthen political accountability by means of increased transparency of decision-making in existing regional and international institutions . 
In developing countries with a weak industrial base , a rapid and sustained rise in the levels of income depends on increasing investment , which has a very high import content .  
To clarify the content of the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger , as stated in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and other relevant international and regional instruments , and to give particular attention to implementation and full and progressive realization of this right as a means of achieving food security for all .  
Calls upon the Government of Guatemala , URNG and Guatemalan society as a whole to make every possible effort to familiarize the Guatemalan people with the content of the Peace agreements as quickly as possible , to ensure the full participation of the people in building the new multi _ ethnic , multicultural and multilingual nation , establishing a democratic society with social justice , initiating a period of sustained and sustainable economic and social development and ensuring the pre _ eminence of civilian authority in national decision _ making ;  
A design workshop for review of the substantive issues and content of modules being developed and testing them ; four inter-agency training-of-trainers workshops ; two workshops for resident and humanitarian coordinators at the regional and interregional levels ; and four field-level workshops in selected countries for personnel of the United Nations system , donor community , non-governmental organizations and local partners .  
In many cases , those responsible for violations of economic , social and cultural rights and of the collective rights with an economic content such as the right to development or the right to a healthy environment , are sometimes international entities applying policies which constitute veritable sources of large-scale and serious violations of collective and individual rights in the countries with weak economies .  
Thus the topic will be limited to codification of secondary rules : 5 / while addressing the requirement of an internationally wrongful act of the State as a prerequisite , it will not address the specific content of the international legal obligation which has been violated , whether under customary or treaty law .  
The content and application of competition law and policy , and its relationship with industrial and trade policies , have varied among different countries at different times , as countries have sought with mixed success to promote the technological capacity and international competitiveness of their industries , compensate for the effects of market failures or ease structural adjustment .  
Fourth , the content of international development cooperation must be constantly revised in the light of the new characteristics and needs of the world economy , and the effective participation of developing countries in macroeconomic policies must be strengthened . 
We suggest that the 661 Committee should conduct an objective , professional and administrative review of the manner in which the previous phase of the procurement and distribution plan has been implemented , with a view to eliminating all the negative aspects and procedures that led to the delay and dilatoriness by which it was characterized , and which all but emptied Security Council resolution 986 ( 1995 ) and the memorandum of understanding of their content and turned them into something to be exploited for political purposes that bear no relation to any humanitarian objective . 
There is considerable agreement on the conceptual content of the right to adequate food , including relevant health and nutrition aspects , and future efforts in this regard need to be directed primarily at fine-tuning existing concepts .  
The potential hazard of radioactive material depends upon : the type of material ( i.e . , plutonium , uranium , thorium ) ; isotopic composition ( i.e . , content of fissile isotopes ) ; physical and chemical form ; degree of dilution ; radiation level ; and quantity .  
While UNESCO will be responsible for the conceptual aspects and educational content , ITU , which is developing the standards , will take primary responsibility for the technical implementation and choice of technological solutions .  
The meeting addressed the workshops logistic arrangements and its substantive content , including technical cooperation activities to be considered and proposed , and identified numerous issues of criminal procedure that the workshop could address , such as those relating to data storage , transaction and analysis , electronic communications , trans-border search and seizure , mutual legal assistance , human rights and safeguarding privacy rights .  
For that purpose , the Guide helps identify areas of law that are typically most relevant to private capital investment in public infrastructure projects and discusses the content of those laws which would be conducive to attracting private capital , national and foreign .  
Noting with grave concern the content of the report of the Commission of Inquiry of the International Labour Organization , [ 5 ] appointed in March 1997 in accordance with article 26 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organization , regarding the observance by Myanmar of the Forced Labour Convention , 1930 ( No .  29 ) , which indicates a widespread and systematic use of forced labour imposed by the military on the civilian population ,  
Negotiation of a free _ standing new legal instrument dealing exclusively with a transfer ban , even in a fully compatible way with the provisions of the Ottawa Convention , would raise a number of political and legal problems , such as lack of global vocation , setting a precedent by negotiating a partial ban after a clear majority of States has signed a comprehensive one , proliferation of legal instruments dealing with the same content , just to name a few .  
Reaffirm that the central decision _ making role in determining the content of the regional technical cooperation programme , evaluating the progress achieved and determining actions to be taken under the programme in the future will continue to be played by the annual intergovernmental workshop with the assistance of the open-ended team in Geneva comprising Geneva _ based representatives of the Governments of the Asian-Pacific region ;  
Areas that have been identified as involving legal issues relevant to electronic commerce include data protection , taxation , customs duties , security and authentication , intellectual property rights , liability of Internet service providers , illegal and harmful content , Internet governance ( more specifically , domain names ) , electronic payments systems , and consumer protection .  
Activities include coordination meetings and electronic discussions on the planning of cooperative activities and sharing of experience , support for subregional training courses , pilot projects on the application of telematics for development in sectors of public concern , and promotion of the African content of the World Wide Web for educational , scientific , social and cultural development .  
The content of adequacy is to some extent determined by prevailing social , economic , cultural , climatic , ecological and other conditions , but there are some core elements which are applicable under all circumstances and are spelled out in greater detail by the Committee .  
It sets out the normative content of the human right to adequate food , the corresponding obligations including State obligations at the national level and at the international level , the responsibilities of international organizations , and regulation of economic enterprises and other actors .  
These needs comprise both essential learning tools ( such as literacy , oral expression , numeracy and problem solving ) and the basic learning content ( such as knowledge , skills , values and attitudes ) required by human beings to be able to survive , to develop their full capacities , to live and work in dignity , to participate fully in development , to improve the quality of their lives , to make informed decisions and to continue learning ( art . 1 , para . 
As to the concept of circumstances precluding wrongfulness , the Special Rapporteur observed that the initial proposition was that the draft articles were not concerned with formulating the content of primary rules , but with the framework of secondary rules of responsibility , yet it was the primary rules which determined what was wrongful .  
This requires addressing difficult and controversial issues such as schoolgirl pregnancy , adaptation of the content of educational curricula and textbooks to the objective of equipping girls with the knowledge and skills necessary for them to avoid early pregnancy , and broadening the objectives and purposes of education to provide the future generations of women in Uganda with options unavailable to the past and current generations of women .  
The Special Rapporteur is therefore continuing his project for the formulation of an international educational strategy to prevent all forms of intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief , the matrix of which would be the organization in November 2001 of an international consultative conference on the content of curricula and textbooks for primary or elementary and secondary educational institutions with respect to freedom of religion and belief .  
Two aspects of Internet accessibility were addressed by the Gateway initiative : ( a ) user-friendly Web design based on universal principles to facilitate access by users with physical or sensorial disabilities and ( b ) text-based and low-intensity graphical content to facilitate access by users with low levels of information technology or communications capacities ( bandwidth ) .  
A critical task was joint determination of critical milestones for conceptual designs , for delivery of content by the concerned substantive specialists , for coordination with the concerned technical services and for systematic feedback on design options from beta testers representative of the specialized constituencies for the global social development programme of the United Nations .  
On the one hand , the multilateral framework of WTO rules has in certain cases narrowed the range of policy options for Governments : quantitative tools of protection are now largely ruled out , including production allocations and similar means ; tariffs are increasingly subject to binding commitments ; the transition period for national content and trade balancing requirements lapses at the end of 1999 ; and export subsidies will no longer be permitted for most developing countries after 2003 .  
Considering the content of the subject matter , the emergence of extreme poverty was examined from various angles taking into account both the domestic and international dimensions of the problem and the economic , political and social factors contributing to it .  
These benefits were exchanged for performance standards related to export targets , local content requirements , debt-equity ratio ceilings , national ownership floors , operating scale minima , investment timetable obligations , regional location criteria and , eventually , product quality specifications and environmental rules .  
Second , policy standards , which tie subsidies to the promotion of major national strategic priorities , such as maintaining price stability , increasing local content , raising the level of exports and not worsening income distribution .  
The representative of Cuba , speaking also on behalf of the delegations of Algeria , China , Egypt , Saudi Arabia , the Sudan and the Syrian Arab Republic , made a joint statement on their position paper submitted to the Chair regarding the preamble and articles 1 , 8 , 12 , 13 and X . They stated that starting from the preamble the content of the draft protocol should reflect clearly its cooperative , preventive , confidential , non-duplicative and advisory nature .  
The Declaration defines basic learning needs as : essential learning tools ( such as literacy , oral expression , numeracy , and problem solving ) and the basic learning content ( such as knowledge , skills , values , and attitudes ) required by human beings to be able to survive , to develop their full capacities , to live and work in dignity , to participate fully in development , to improve the quality of their lives , to make informed decisions , and to continue learning ( art .  1 ) .  
The diversity of national and regional paths of change , leading to a significant variety of post-socialist emerging capitalisms ( Magnin , 1999 ) , illustrates the role of idiosyncratic and evolving institutional configurations that represent the very content of systemic change .  
The change of rules in general institutional and organizational rules , constitutional and ordinary rules , and formal and informal rules represents the essential content of systemic change , hence the decisive role of law and the State in the process . 
According to Turkey , the content of fundamental standards of humanity should be limited to international human rights law and not include international humanitarian law , as they concerned situations of internal violence which did not reach the threshold of an armed conflict .  
Indeed , numerous unilateral acts , whatever their content , could be classified as political , while certain unilateral acts not originally intended to have legal effects at the international level could have such effects .  
Indeed , at its forty-ninth session in August 1997 , the Sub-Commission adopted resolution 1997-7 in which it requested one of its experts , Mr . Mustapha Mehedi , to prepare a working paper on the right to education with the purpose of explaining the content of the right to education , taking account , in particular , of its social dimension and the freedoms it includes and of its dual civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural character .  
Mr . Mehedi expressed the wish to see academic freedom added to the core content as defined above , insofar as primary , secondary or tertiary education was concerned .  
The Court ' s credibility in the eyes of the public and particularly in the eyes of the legal community has been weakened by the dismissal of three of its judges , who considered an interpretative provision of the Constitution with obvious political content to be unconstitutional . 
Lithium content means the mass of lithium in the anode of a lithium metal or lithium alloy cell , which for a primary cell is measured when the cell is in an undischarged state and for a rechargeable cell is measured when the cell is fully charged , except that in the case of a lithium-ion cell the lithium content is measured in terms of equivalent lithium content , which in grams is calculated to be 0.3 times the rated capacity in ampere-hours .  
For that purpose , the Guide helps identify areas of law that are typically most relevant to private capital investment in public infrastructure projects and discusses the content of those laws which would be conducive to attracting private capital , national and foreign.The Guide is not intended to provide advice on drafting agreements for the execution of privately financed infrastructure projects .  
In developing countries with a weak industrial base , a rapid and sustained rise in the levels of income depends on increasing investment , which has a very high import content .  
While UNESCO will be responsible for the conceptual aspects and educational content , ITU , which is developing the standards , will take primary responsibility for the technical implementation and choice of technological solutions .  
The MTR concluded that the programmes social communication and media component should contribute to cultural change through substantive messages with strong technical and legal content .  
In focusing on such key elements as promotion of awareness , advocacy and policy formulation ; connectivity ; institutional and human capacities ; and content and cultural diversity , UNDP currently operates global , regional and numerous countrylevel programmes .  
In the interests of preserving cultural diversity , the European Union also considered it essential that the local content of the Internet in the developing countries , and particularly in the least developed countries , should be enhanced and developed .  
The work of the Committee also addressed technical issues dealing with the content of SDI , including the definition of a common geodetic reference frame , the necessity of integrating cadastral and topographical data bases , the development of metadata and clearinghouse sites , and the employment of international standards ( ISO / TC 211 ) in the implementation of national and regional SDI .  
The overall experience reported above by HEUNI and the very limited number of responses received by the Centre for International Crime Prevention to the questionnaire on international technical cooperation in crime prevention and criminal justice suggest that the establishment of a centralized database is of very limited value and utility , in particular when one considers the overall quality and content of the responses .  
Notes with concern the late issuance of the report of the Board of Auditors on United Nations peacekeeping operations , 1 and requests the Board of Auditors and the Secretary-General to work together to implement ways to ensure its timely and simultaneous issuance in all six official languages of the United Nations , including streamlining the format and content of the report , as well as the related financial information contained in the performance reports .  
All the acts mentioned , in the context which concerns us , are formulated [ 62 ] through unilateral declarations , whether of individual or collective origin , and these declarations are subject to definite forms as far as their conditions of validity are concerned ; the rules apply to all of them regardless of their content or material classification .  
This happened in the case of Venezuela and Mexico , which appear to have developed a subsequent practice , the examination of which could help specify or clarify the content and scope of the unilateral commitment assumed by those countries in relation to the Central American countries through a joint communiqu which could be considered a unilateral act of collective origin . 
Notes with concern the late issuance of the financial report and audited financial statements for the twelve-month period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 and the report of the Board of Auditors on United Nations peacekeeping operations , 2 and requests the Board of Auditors and the Secretary-General to work together to implement ways to ensure its timely and simultaneous issuance in all six official languages of the United Nations , including streamlining the format and content of the report as well as the related financial information contained in the performance reports .  
The second week proved easier in terms of interpretation content and workload ( meetings started late , finished early or were interrupted and the Commission on Sustainable Development cancelled one meeting and devoted another one to informal drafting work without interpretation ) .  
Similar considerations apply as for completed and continuing wrongful acts in determining when a breach of international law exists ; the matter is dependent upon the precise facts and the content of the primary obligation .  
In fact , many applications being developed to benefit citizens , such as digital libraries , electronic museums , distance education and training , distance medical services and other public social services , must be based on the development of local content industry .  
In addition , a large number of public information systems such as local news and weather , entertainment , tourism , maps and sports are developed based on local content and will stimulate the development of the domestic information services industry and raise the living standard of the local people .  
Even though the right to development as set out in the 1986 Declaration was reaffirmed in the 1993 Vienna Declaration as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , several industrialized countries are now attempting to question and reformulate its content and scope , including the definition of the beneficiaries of the right .  
Moreover , a discussion was held on the suitability of developing an instrument specific to the energy services sector and comparable to the Reference Paper on Basic Telecommunications , and the possible content of such an instrument ( e.g . development concerns to link in a clear manner energy services and development including the achievement of public services goals and promotion of competition and of foreign investment in the energy sector consistent with development goals ) .  
Due to the increased harmonization and simplification of procedures , the reports of UNDP , UNFPA , UNICEF and WFP to their respective Executive Boards had a common format and were very similar in content ; the four agencies were therefore suggesting that reporting on the implementation of the triennial policy review and on United Nations reforms to the legislative bodies should be streamlined ; they looked forward to the Committees advice on that .  
Moreover , a discussion was held on the suitability of developing an instrument specific to the energy services sector and comparable to the Reference Paper on Basic Telecommunications , and the possible content of such an instrument ( e.g . development concerns to link in a clear manner energy services and development including the achievement of public services goals and promotion of competition and of foreign investment in the energy sector consistent with development goals ) .  
These included proposals for clarification of the scope of energy services and improvement of current classification , the development of a checklist which could be used as a tool to facilitate negotiations at the multilateral and regional levels , the suitability of developing an instrument specific to the energy services sector and comparable to the Reference Paper on Basic Telecommunications , and its possible content .  
Data received from the SAC-C satellite are used to study the terrestrial and marine environment , assess desertification , monitor flooding , forecast agricultural production , monitor the atmospheric temperature and vapour content of water with a view to determining the variability of the atmospheric structure , perform measurements of the geomagnetic field with the same level of accuracy attained by observatories , measure atmospheric space radiation and its effects on advanced electronic components , determine the migratory route of the southern right whale and verify methods used in determining satellite attitude and velocity .  
It must be stressed again that the articles do not purport to specify the content of the primary rules of international law , or of the obligations thereby created for particular States . [ 1 ] In determining whether given conduct attributable to a State constitutes a breach of its international obligations , the principal focus will be on the primary obligation concerned .
