Explaining these four aims , Justice Minister Ma Ying-jeou says that making people afraid to be corrupt takes strict laws ; making them unable to be corrupt takes comprehensive preventive measures ; the way to make them unwilling to be corrupt is to instil in public servants a sense of honor in uprightness and shame in corruption ; and for civil servants to have no need to be corrupt depends on giving then adequate salaries , so that they can afford to stay clean , and do not need to rely on ill-gotten gains .  
" We ca n't know if this was right or not , " admits Wu Tsung-neng . No one knows if the slowing of the epidemic was due to human effort or was a natural trend . However , from the fact that over the same time period other communicable diseases also were reduced , it can be assumed that the preventive measures taken against the enterovirus were effective .  
Hence , although TCM is seen as having tremendous potential as a source from which to develop new drugs to treat cancer , in clinical practice in Taiwan it is assigned to the auxiliary role of alleviating the side effects of cancer therapies , assisting post-operative recovery and promoting general good health , in particular by preventive means . This role is consistent with the consensus among TCM practitioners and doctors qualified in both traditions on how Chinese and Western medicine should be used together to combat cancer .  
At the tenth anniversary of Tiananmen , preventive measures by the mainland authorities made substantive attacks against the government impossible . But participants in a symposium on " The May Fourth Movement and 20th-Century China " at Peking University in early May could scarcely fail to expand on the stated theme , to touch on the currently most sensitive topics of democracy , human rights and freedom which were the issues behind Tiananmen . Hence the symposium was full of the sense that " all history is contemporary history . "  
Composed of doctors and medical students from Yangming University , this group campaigns across Taiwan , north and south , against their declared enemy : chronic illnesses in remote or poor locations that lack the resources to cope . For the last two decades , this battalion of doctors has criss-crossed Taiwan 's 21 counties and cities , and even served in Kinmen . Having started out with a simple mission to conduct pap smears , they now target chronic illnesses and do preventive community medicine , leaving ineradicable traces of their passing .  
These jokers just stand out in storms , posing in front of the camera and talking a bunch of unscientific nonsense . " Liu asserts that important industrial facilities throughout Taiwan need trained meteorologists to monitor atmospheric conditions where expensive equipment is installed , otherwise they will be unprepared to take preventive measures before sudden power outages , storms , or floods occur , and they wo n't be able to seek compensation afterward .  
They include the medical teams of the International Cooperation and Development Fund , young men doing " overseas duty " as a substitute for military service , religious organizations , and individual doctors . They are performing a wide range of medical assistance activities not just limited to simple humanitarian aid , including donation of medical supplies , technical exchange in the field of public health , education and training , promotion of preventive medicine against epidemic illnesses , and " matchmaking " between people with certain medical needs and those who can provide what is needed .  
The Department of Health advises citizens that the most practical preventive measures involve old standbys : careful washing of hands , keeping surroundings clean and well ventilated , avoiding locations that are crowded or have poor ventilation , avoiding unnecessary trips to the doctor or hospital , eating a balanced diet , and getting appropriate amounts of rest and exercise .  
A doctor from a health center located in a southern county , who wishes to remain anonymous , says that when SARS hit , because the center had been converted into a treatment center , more than half their time was spent in examining patients rather than doing general epidemic prevention work . Indeed , even now the government lacks a clear focus for future tasks such as promoting cervical examinations , encouraging neighborhood environmental hygiene , or taking preventive measures against chronic diseases .  
The precautionary principle requires authorities at entrepreneurial , national , regional and international levels to take preventive action when there is a risk of severe and irreversible damage to human beings by technology .

While the United Nations can not realistically manage all the crises occurring world wide , because of its unique role and responsibility in the maintenance of international peace and security , it should seek to strengthen global political consensus on the principles of the Charter , assist , through its preventive capacity , in the formulation of regional strategies and efforts and take decisive action when regional or global security is seriously challenged .  
With renewed waves of human rights violations occurring worldwide , mostly in internal conflicts or ethnic strife , our Organization has to step up its early-warning and preventive capacities , develop an integrated response mechanism encompassing field visits and monitors , a closer integration of the human rights element in peace-keeping activities and ensuring effective interaction in the implementation of political , peace-keeping , human rights and humanitarian mandates .  
Let us learn from our successes , as from our failures , by developing preventive diplomacy at the regional level and by increasing the rapid response capability of our Organization in the humanitarian and military spheres .  
Proceeding from this , it is only by improving the collective capabilities of the international community to face up to the urgent and most intolerable injustices that a true meaning could be given to preventive efforts of diplomacy , to peace-keeping operations and to the elaboration of a genuine structure of international cooperation .  
In that regard , the Summit called for increased funding for foreign assistance by governmental and non-governmental donors and multilateral financial institutions to specific programmes in primary education for girls , preventive health care and political participation and encouraged developing countries to use the 20 / 20 concept in planning and funding their human development priorities .

This calls for the strengthening of preventive diplomacy , including developing adequate early warning capacities , dispatching field missions , and utilizing the good offices of Governments , international or regional organizations or eminent personalities in order to get to the source of an imminent conflict and safeguard the security , well-being and human rights of the affected civilian population .  
That Department has since passed through successive phases of restructuring and is now organized to follow political developments worldwide , so that it can provide early warning of impending conflicts and analyse possibilities for preventive action by the United Nations , as well as for action to help resolve existing conflicts .

The explanatory memorandum annexed to document A / 50 / 145 presumptuously claims that the examination by the United Nations of Taiwan 's " exceptional situation in the international context " " completely conforms with the principles and spirit of preventive diplomacy " .

The " ethnic cleansing " of ethnic Croats and Bosniacs in these regions , which has been occurring for many months , continues unabated and without any real attempt by the United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia ( UNCRO ) and the United Nations Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) in Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as international humanitarian and other organizations to take effective preventive measures .  
One of the main reasons for the failure is the palliative attitude towards the difficult situation in the Balkans and marginal attention dedicated to preventive actions and to the development of good-neighbourly relations based on mutual respect and equality .

Since the focus of attention should be on the strengthening of the Organization 's capacity for the early prevention of conflicts , rather than on measures for their subsequent settlement , his delegation believed that the functions of the Department of Peace-keeping Operations and of other divisions of the Secretariat involved in observing political developments in potential conflict areas , in early warning and in analysing the possibility of preventive action should be strengthened .  
the agreement signed on 22 September 1994 by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Government of Burundi on the implementation of a major programme of technical assistance and advisory services in the field of human rights , the various components of which form part of preventive action supported by the international community ,

The adoption of the draft resolution will affirm that the international community has actually derived benefit from the lessons of the recent past and is convinced that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure : had we moved at the right time within the ambit of preventive diplomacy , we could have prevented catastrophes such as those that have afflicted the Great Lakes region of Africa for about two years now , with Rwanda still suffering their scourge .

The treaty bodies , based on six human rights conventions , have not only become effective structures monitoring the compliance by States with the human rights obligations resulting from those treaties : their impact in the field of human rights goes far beyond this function and extends , inter alia , to clarification of the content of human rights ; the functioning of the human rights machinery , including early warning and preventive measures ; cooperation of Governments with the United Nations ; protection of individuals in the framework of optional communications procedures ; and human rights education .

Whether its mandate is still required gives rise to the question posed in paragraph 25 of my report of 30 January 1996 ( S / 1996 / 65 ) : how does one measure the success of a preventive operation and judge that if it is reduced or withdrawn peace and stability will continue to hold , threats and tensions that have so far been contained will disappear and channels or institutions for defusing them will continue to be built or consolidated ? 
According to both foreign observers and residents , the leading causes of continuing lawlessness in the region are the lack of an adequate professional police presence and the Croatian authorities ' unwillingness to take firm preventive action against human rights violators .

As the Secretary-General pointed out in his annual report to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session , 1 preventive measures are highly cost-effective , as the sums they require are paltry by comparison with the huge costs in human suffering and material damage which war always brings , and they also compare favourably " with the less huge , but nevertheless substantial , cost of deploying a peacekeeping operation after hostilities have broken out " .  
A deep understanding of the effects on the physical , mental and psychological health of children who are the subject of commercial sexual exploitation would also underscore the importance and the desirability of preventive rather than remedial measures .  
The priorities pursued , which the Special Rapporteur would like to endorse , include a multidisciplinary approach , involving social services and mental health workers , to interviewing and investigation , special treatment in court settings which are child-friendly and appropriate to age and status , and continuing care in order to address the lingering effects of commercial sexual exploitation .  Measures are to be reinforced through education systems which provide children with skills and opportunities as a preventive strategy .  
It has also become clear that the problems created for countries by organized transnational crime may be solved only through the adoption and implementation of measures that could comprise up-to-date legislation to deal with this criminal phenomenon ; increased capacity of criminal justice systems to enforce existing legislation and control organized transnational crime ; strengthened ability to gather and analyse reliable information on organized crime activities , with a view to devising preventive and control policies ; and more effective inter-state cooperation when investigating , prosecuting or judging organized transnational crime offences .

Noting with concern the absence in the countries concerned of specific legislation to govern offences committed by minor children , the absence of preventive and educational measures for their reintegration into society which would enable minor detainees to become rehabilitated and no longer marginalized , as well as the very limited number of children 's magistrates capable of understanding the problems of delinquent children and seeing that they are cared for ,  
In this context , the international community should explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries and monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact on the international financial system .

As the Secretary-General pointed out in his annual report to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session , 11 preventive measures are highly cost-effective , as the sums they require are paltry by comparison with the huge costs in human suffering and material damage which war always brings , and they also compare favourably ' with the less huge , but nevertheless substantial , cost of deploying a peacekeeping operation after hostilities have broken out ' .  
In this respect , the special session of the General Assembly devoted to international drug control , which is to be held in June 1998 , will provide us with an excellent opportunity to renew our political commitment by closing our ranks against illegal drug trafficking and striving jointly for progress in preventive efforts .  
More attention should be given to appropriate and timely preventive measures , because we believe that early measures adopted by the international community are the ideal way to avert the outbreak of conflicts and wars and to avoid taking the necessary political and military measures in the aftermath of the conflict let alone imposing half solutions that are often unfair .  
The debate justifies the conclusion that an adequate response to these and other issues is to be delivered through a continuing process of negotiations ; a resolute policy of disarmament , both of weapons of mass destruction and of conventional weapons ; the promotion of sustainable development ; the further strengthening of human rights machinery ; and the gradual reorientation of the United Nations peacekeeping activities toward preventive diplomacy .  
This Assembly is abundant in priorities identified by the recent round of global conferences , particularly in the areas of good governance , human rights , democratization , international economic cooperation and sustainable development , development operations , preventive diplomacy , peaceful settlement of disputes and disarmament , as well as humanitarian action and peacekeeping and post-conflict peace-building .

In addition to taking preventive action , the High Commissioner is seeking to take action regarding durable solutions , such as attempting to create an environment viable for return in post-conflict societies through initiatives such as the rehabilitation of the justice system , the creation of national institutions capable of defending human rights , broad-based programmes of human rights education , as well as the strengthening of local non-governmental organizations .  
Recognizing further that the international community at large and , in particular , international institutions involved in providing economic and financial assistance should continue to take into account and address in a more effective manner the special economic problems of affected third States arising from the carrying out of preventive or enforcement measures taken by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter , in view of their magnitude and of the adverse impact on the economy of those States ,
