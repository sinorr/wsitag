It is also worth mentioning that the private companies under Chen ostensibly included some joint ventures with Hong Kong businesses , some joint ventures with banks , and also some joint ventures with the Yuhu Prefectural Government . As such , public ownership were intermixed with private ownership to give people many false impressions and make it difficult for people to discern their nature off-hand .  This was to make it easy for them to profit from confusion and to slip away unpunished in the event of an exposure of their offenses .  
Capital flow will have a greater influence and impact on a country 's economy , particularly the great circulation and speculation of short-term capital .

To maintain economic growth , Taiwan must spur its domestic demand , although a large increase over a short time will not be easy .

Changes in internal secretions within the mother 's body during pregnancy are the cause , making it rather easy to develop swelling of the gums . Expectant mothers often have a poor appetite and abnormal eating habits . If they neglect oral hygiene , they may easily develop cavities and inflamed gums .

This is especially true for mid-level officials , who do n't get so much ' value-added ' - - chauffeured automobiles , high social status , power , a sense of accomplishment - - as high level officials . On the contrary , they have complex duties , low pay , and slow advancement . It is easy for business to steal away these mid-level officials who have vast administrative experience , " says one civil servant . In recent years , the turnover rate for this type of person has been quite high .

It 's not like a lot of magazines that just skim over things superficially and after you 're done you ca n't remember a word you 've read . That two seasoned reporters spent three hours of their time interviewing for an article of something over l , 000 words with two photographs shows admirable dedication .

It is as though our image of a Korea with high foreign debts , political turmoil and wife-beating machismo has not changed for over ten years , " says Jing Ker-yi , Korea expert at the Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research .

However , the ownership of the publishing rights overseas is rather complex . Sometimes the rights belong to the writer , sometimes to the publishing house , and sometimes to an agent .

At the end a scholar in official mandarin dress and a female character with a powdered face came out and bowed to each other and the audience , thanking them for watching .

Unfortunately , " R &amp; D is the easy part , sharing is hard . " The notebook computer alliance , organized by 46 firms , produced alliance product types in the brief space of half a year , and won considerable attention at international exhibitions . But after the technology was transferred , the manufacturers who took it over began a flurry of little maneuvers , and the price-cutting situation was " ruthless . "  
Realism easy - - art from life hard : Today native culture is increasingly receiving more attention , and people are concerned about indigenous bird species . In science , great emphasis is placed on exact breeds and species , and painters strive to portray Mikado pheasants or other precise species of birds . What must be aspired to in painting birds , apart from aesthetic enjoyment , must still be to let spectators understand birds at a glance . The challenge for artists is very great . "  
An irreplaceable part of modern living : CFCs have many advantages . They are non-toxic , odorless , cheap , stable , non-combustible , and non-corrosive . They are also easy to put to use , and do not leave polluting residues on the surface environment .  
Because Ilan is at a low altitude and has many springs , the roots find it easy to quench their thirst and the trees ' crowns grow lush and full . Full of springs and developed by man relatively late , the areas where the mountains meet the plain have most of the remaining banyans .  
Because people have greater contact with the outside world and easy access to information and because everyone , particularly the middle class , is paying increasing attention to quality of life , when people see that consumer goods in Taiwan are of low quality and high price , they seek happier shopping grounds abroad . This is one method of obtaining more reasonable consumer quality .  
Shen Hsiaoling observes that most salaried women have no lack of colleagues with whom they may chat . Housewives can have a leisurely talk with their neighbors , too , when they are at rest . But the boss wife is in charge of the company , and she spends most of her time together with the employees . She is faced with the barrier of being the manager and being labeled a " capitalist " ; it is not easy to build close friendships with employees .  
Because of the rising and falling of geological strata and the alluviation of rivers , most dinosaur skeletons exist only in fragments ; very few are complete . But it is easy to imagine that the ancient Chinese were no less astonished by finding a " dragon skeleton " than their scientifically enlightened descendants are today when finding a dinosaur fossil .  
Furthermore , in the spirit of " If I do n't enter hell , who will ? " he has courageously infiltrated the heart of the system . Perhaps on the surface it appears that he can gain status and honored treatment . But , on the outside , he must fend off vicious attacks from right and left , and , on the inside , must constantly be thinking about how to maintain his judgement and not become confused . This is certainly no easy process !  
" In mainland China in the past , most ordinary people were very poor , and if they got a little money they would buy land or gold . Especially during the war with Japan , when there was roaring inflation and paper money lost its worth within days , there was no choice but to buy things of value , " says economist Wang Tso-jung . Rice takes up a lot of space , while by comparison gold is portable and easy to store , so that many people preferred to buy gold .  
After this , the craft of rush weaving quickly became widespread . Forty years later , another Peipo woman had the clever idea of splitting the rushes into thin strips to make bed mats for sleeping on in summer . The mats are cool and fragrant , and can also be folded up making them easy to carry .  
He was unexpectedly called back to China to attend to his mother 's burial , and found himself ground to a halt in Jimei for two years , not a particularly easy base for launching foreign ventures . Then surprisingly his father 's enterprise went bankrupt , squandered into a penniless state by his father 's second wife . Tan had no choice but to start from scratch , running a rice store and a pineapple factory .  
Major infrastructure projects cost a lot of money and are not easy to bring on line , but when all is said and done these ravenous monsters will steadily leave the stage , or will become of only secondary importance , and leave most of the budgetary pie to others . What really seems " an unending drain that can never be controlled " is that part of the budget which elicits the most extreme emotions both for and against , social welfare .  
In 1985 , the mission began collaborating with the University of Costa Rica 's experimental station to perform various surveys and cultivation management experiments on more than 80 existing varieties of grape vines . Observation and gradual selection over four or five years of cultivation showed that a variety named Ruby Seedless performed best : not only is it high-yielding and consistent , with a thin skin , firm flesh and an excellent flavor , it is also easy to grow and manage and is highly resistant to disease .  
After having seen many such examples , NGO leaders are not unaware that criticizing is easier than doing the actual work . " The government is n't going to ask me to come serve in the public sector . If they did ask me , I 'm afraid it would n't be easy to do a good job , " admits one leader of an educational reform group . Once he switched roles from offense to defense , it would also be hard for him to escape " being vulnerable to attack . "  
They have had nowhere to turn because traditionally " the law ends at the family threshold . " There was a widespread social taboo on even discussing the issue . But after the case broke of a woman , Teng Ju-wen , who murdered her abusive husband , women 's groups went into action and began researching legislation designed to reduce domestic violence . Yet success has not always come easy , and there have been many setbacks .  
At the most basic level , people can get away with this when representing deceased heroes of the past for whom there is no photographic record . But for modern subjects whose photos are available , such inferior work is an insult to viewers , bringing to mind the expression , " It 's easy to portray a ghost , hard to portray a man . "  
We are surrounded by good things to eat in our prosperous society , and the need to carry heavy things , walk long distances , or perform manual labor is greatly reduced . Our bodies take in more energy than they expend , and while the food is easy to eat , it 's hard to get rid of . So it 's difficult to avoid accumulating fat .  
The scale model in the ancestral altar roomAfter several consultations , the house which Huang Sheng-yuan designed combines a traditional sloping-roofed courtyard dwelling with a two-storey concrete house in the square box style . " This echoes the style of existing residences in the Lanyang area . " To meet Mother Yu 's requirement of easy access on all sides , the house has a total of seven outside doorways .  
He wrote that " it is easy to move from frugality to luxury , but difficult to move from luxury to frugality . " It is impossible for even the most disciplined and fortunate families to achieve high rank in every generation , not to mention those families in which profligate playboys undo the accumulated achievements of their ancestors .  
In the US , for example , residential and agricultural areas are clearly separate , and huge areas of agricultural land are often devoted to a single crop , so it is easy to differentiate the objects in the satellite image .  
" Multi-cinema theater houses are the trend of the future . Big theaters are only a promotional gimmick , the attraction of a huge screen , " says Robert Chen , associate professor of communication arts at Fujen Catholic University . During the 100-year development of the movie , it has evolved from an art form into a small-group social activity . It is easy to comprehend why empty echoes are often heard in the larger cinemas .  
A dam is an enormous engineering structure , and an investment which has to be paid in all at once-it can not be built in easy installments . To construct a reservoir today takes an investment of over NT $ 10 billion , and Taiwan is not a good place to build reservoirs , so the return on the investment falls far short of that achieved in continental countries . Thus we should not be using reservoirs as " normal " water resources .  
She had less than US $ 10,000 in the bank , but it would be enough for her to " rough it " on a backpack trip through Asia . She was n't worried about her future . She was young and healthy , and had heard that it would be easy to find a job teaching English . With her Berkeley degree and pleasant appearance , she figured it would not be difficult to find such a job .  
When ball games become staged , players are victims too . While pro baseball players may have better financial prospects than other ROC athletes , the golden years of their prime last only about a decade , and many find the chance to earn some extra money in their youth hard to pass up . They make easy prey for the underworld , which brings with it violence , threats and bribery . Once having started down that slippery slope , it 's hard to turn back .  
On the maritime extreme of Europe , England had always been saturated by the arts of Italy and France . It was not easy to work out how to create a " natural garden " and it was hardly desirable to give half the credit to the far-away Chinese .  
They quickly discovered that while she looked elegant and refined , she was broad-minded , direct and easy to get along with . Though she could n't speak Hakka , she could chat away half the day with them using signs and gestures . Though an artist , she spent her days working in the fields . Running up and down the mountain , she was soon as tan and as strong as the local farming wives .  
Having studied at an agricultural high school , Li thought she was fully prepared to farm . But facing it firsthand , she quickly discovered that farm work was n't as easy or as laid back as she had imagined . And after becoming more closely involved with Chiungchiao Keng 's people , she gradually came to understand the town 's problems as well .  
Haucha elder Kuo Chin-ting says that in the past , people usually avoided swamps , which were overgrown with plants and easy to get lost in . Over time , by oral tradition ( the equivalent of tribal law ) , these became taboo areas .  
This is true enough , but : " To have children learn from a negative example is not as simple as presenting exemplary figures and saying ' do as they did . ' It means spending more time and effort interpreting the stories for the children and discussing them with them , and in the current situation where moral education is only a subsidiary subject with inadequate teaching resources , this is no easy matter , " says Hsieh Li-hung with regret .  
Their movements are sultry and mysterious-how easy it is to imagine a cat creeping stealthily atop a stone wall , cast in silhouette against a full moon . Their almond-shaped pupils , which change shape in shifting light , are eerie enough , without even considering that their eyes may give off a green luminescence ( from reflected light ) . And the screeches they make to attract mates , cutting through the night , are hair-raising .  
In an industrial society , as extended families living under one roof have given way to smaller and smaller nuclear families , the family can no longer serve the same functions it once did in supporting the needs of all segments of the population . Yet traditional Eastern attitudes , morality and values rooted in thousands of years of history are not easy to change , and they have a big effect on how policy toward the elderly is set .  
Furthermore , in the past it was easy to start a business with little capital , and both blue and white collar workers would aim to set up on their own once they had saved some money . " No-one is content to remain a lowly member of the working classes - - everyone wants to better themselves .  
Indeed , as far as he is concerned , " It seems like the film makers were all being ' politically correct , ' acting as if documentaries were only good for filming ' disadvantaged ' groups in society . These subjects and people inevitably become documentary material , and the film makers just use them because they make easy subject matter , " says Wang with sharp frankness .  
But the distorted value systems on these other shows , in which truth becomes inseparable from fiction , are even more insidious . " Kuo says that most people already find it difficult to extract meaning from reality in all its complexity and suffer information overload . People usually take the easy way out , and turn to television . The uninterrupted flow of dubiously " re-constructed , " or outright fictional , information can temporarily offer solace to their tired souls .  
If we feel old , as if we are not respected and are incapable of doing anything , we quickly find ourselves on the road to depression . If we feel aged , it is easy to become the stereotype of an elderly person-self-absorbed , dissatisfied and inflexible . This is likely to make us still more depressed .  
Another new style is " taiji-daoyin , " a 12-movement routine refined from traditional taijiquan by the well-known practitioner Hsiung Wei . Taiji-daoyin , which is easy to begin learning and requires a minimal amount of space for practice , has already been adopted as a keep-fit exercise by major corporations such as Acer , as well as being extended into modern dance and applied as a surprising new form of " Chinese-style dance workout . "  
Setting up in a foreign country was no easy task , particularly given that before BMI was established , the Bank of Hawaii and the Bank of Guam had already divided up the local financial market between them . Because the local savings rate was low but the borrowing rate was high , Chen decided that the only way to gain the upper hand as a latecomer was to offer more efficient lending operations .  
Lu Tien-yen , head of the Taipei Modern Painters Group and a participant in the Hong Kong show , explains that traditional art is based largely on feeling , and it is easy to appreciate its aesthetic . Modern art , on the other hand , is rational and logical , and the theoretical background to a work is vital .  
Modern doctors have to pass exams to get into medical school , and study hard for many years before they can begin their professional lives . It is not easy to become an indigenous shaman either . One must be selected by the ancestral souls . Although one may go on her own to become an acolyte to a practicing shaman , there 's no guarantee that she will " graduate " and win " certification . "  
And so she moved in a short time from perusing a few thin standardized teachers ' guides , to having a muddled understanding of Chinese grammar and history , to introducing China-that vast and distant land-to students who were even more ignorant of it than her . It was no easy feat .  
" A child deciding to become a monk or nun is no easy matter , " says Abbot Wei-chueh . Children are like blank slates and can easily be tarnished if exposed to filth . It is best that they wait until they have graduated from junior high , he argues . If they 're not wild , and their hearts and minds are pure , they can then talk about joining a monastery .  
I do n't have any plans to pose for a racy photo album . If I were in a movie and they wanted me to do a scene in the nude , it would n't be a problem . But I do n't think that a photo album would a way to express the ideal of male beauty . Maybe the Japanese pop idol Miyazawa Rie can express her own pure esthetic appeal through a photo album , but for a man to convey that kind of natural feeling through still photos is not an easy thing .  
Wu Hui-mei , a teacher at Chengcheng Junior High also sees many shortcomings in multiple-track admissions . She says the top schools are very competitive and hard to get into , whereas vocational senior high schools are easy to get into and often short of students . The result is that the schools in the middle end up getting overloaded .  
Looking to the future , as DSL and other broadband technology matures , large amounts of visual and audio information can also be transmitted through high-speed fiber-optic cable .

For instance , it 's not easy to eat when the joints in your hand are stiff , so buying a special spoon will be of assistance to you and at the same time reduce the burden on your family , while not detracting from your self respect ; walking is a problem for old people , so buying a safety cane minimizes the chances of falling and breaking a bone , thus saving a considerable sum in medical expenses .  
It 's not like a lot of magazines that just skim over things superficially and after you 're done you ca n't remember a word you 've read . That two seasoned reporters spent three hours of their time interviewing for an article of something over l , 000 words with two photographs shows admirable dedication . Competition overseas must be intense , and it 's not easy for a magazine to be held in esteem both at home and abroad .  
It is as though our image of a Korea with high foreign debts , political turmoil and wife-beating machismo has not changed for over ten years , " says Jing Ker-yi , Korea expert at the Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research . " At present Korea has incredibly overtaken us in a number of industries . This includes their high-profile automobiles and domestic appliances . It 's not very easy for people to realize , but they have made startling achievements in petrochemicals , steel , upper and mid-stream primary products and components .  
But in more than a few ways , cab drivers are also the object of criticism - - for refusing to ride short distances , for finding the longest distance between two points , for illegally raising fares during rush hour , for acting rudely , etc . And because it is easy for undesirables to become drivers , as public security has deteriorated , illegal behavior by a few drivers has tarnished the image of the industry . As the Chinese expression goes , " A single mouse dropping ruins the pot of congee . "  
However , the ownership of the publishing rights overseas is rather complex . Sometimes the rights belong to the writer , sometimes to the publishing house , and sometimes to an agent . " If you 're not familiar with the terrain , for publishers without any experience negotiating international publishing rights , it is very easy to look in the wrong places for partners , " says Luc Kwanten , executive vice president of the Big Apple Tuttle-Mori Agency , which has been operating for five years .  
Then there are those harshly judgmental types in " little theater " who feel the groups like Ping-Fong Acting Troupe and the Performance Workshop are practically commercial in nature and that they make use of superficial political clich ? s and catchwords to create an " overripe , saturated urban space " that 's pretty to look at and easy to digest but lacking in substance .  
A . With any kind of historical research , especially recent or contemporary , for which many of the people involved are still alive , it is comparatively easy to be coolly objective . Yet it is also , therefore , difficult to get a true picture and description .  
" Some patients have succumbed completely to the myth of a pretty face or a good physiognomy and think an operation is an easy solution to big problems like a husband having an extramarital affair , a failed career or the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune , " says Chiang Hsiao-shan , pointing out that people who are unwilling to face reality and given over to fantasy are apt to blame the doctor for their eventual disappointment , creating unhappiness on both sides .  
Lee Tung-liang , a Changhua County Councilor and a leader in the anti-Dupont environmental movement , says that if the water quality does not improve he is thinking about calling on the farmers to let all their land go to waste , and appeal to the county magistrate . " But , that would probably be very hard , and I 'm afraid it would n't be easy to get a positive response from the farmers . "  
At the end a scholar in official mandarin dress and a female character with a powdered face came out and bowed to each other and the audience , thanking them for watching . Only this counts as a full performance . After the evil spirits were expelled and thanks given to the gods , with easy hearts people returned to the normal order of their lives .  
Unfortunately , " R &amp; D is the easy part , sharing is hard . " The notebook computer alliance , organized by 46 firms , produced alliance product types in the brief space of half a year , and won considerable attention at international exhibitions . But after the technology was transferred , the manufacturers who took it over began a flurry of little maneuvers , and the price-cutting situation was " ruthless . "  
Realism easy - - art from life hard : Today native culture is increasingly receiving more attention , and people are concerned about indigenous bird species . In science , great emphasis is placed on exact breeds and species , and painters strive to portray Mikado pheasants or other precise species of birds . What must be aspired to in painting birds , apart from aesthetic enjoyment , must still be to let spectators understand birds at a glance . The challenge for artists is very great . "  
An irreplaceable part of modern living : CFCs have many advantages . They are non-toxic , odorless , cheap , stable , non-combustible , and non-corrosive . They are also easy to put to use , and do not leave polluting residues on the surface environment .  
Because Ilan is at a low altitude and has many springs , the roots find it easy to quench their thirst and the trees ' crowns grow lush and full . Full of springs and developed by man relatively late , the areas where the mountains meet the plain have most of the remaining banyans .  
Because people have greater contact with the outside world and easy access to information and because everyone , particularly the middle class , is paying increasing attention to quality of life , when people see that consumer goods in Taiwan are of low quality and high price , they seek happier shopping grounds abroad . This is one method of obtaining more reasonable consumer quality .  
Shen Hsiaoling observes that most salaried women have no lack of colleagues with whom they may chat . Housewives can have a leisurely talk with their neighbors , too , when they are at rest . But the boss wife is in charge of the company , and she spends most of her time together with the employees . She is faced with the barrier of being the manager and being labeled a " capitalist " ; it is not easy to build close friendships with employees .  
Because of the rising and falling of geological strata and the alluviation of rivers , most dinosaur skeletons exist only in fragments ; very few are complete . But it is easy to imagine that the ancient Chinese were no less astonished by finding a " dragon skeleton " than their scientifically enlightened descendants are today when finding a dinosaur fossil .  
Furthermore , in the spirit of " If I do n't enter hell , who will ? " he has courageously infiltrated the heart of the system . Perhaps on the surface it appears that he can gain status and honored treatment . But , on the outside , he must fend off vicious attacks from right and left , and , on the inside , must constantly be thinking about how to maintain his judgement and not become confused . This is certainly no easy process !  
" In mainland China in the past , most ordinary people were very poor , and if they got a little money they would buy land or gold . Especially during the war with Japan , when there was roaring inflation and paper money lost its worth within days , there was no choice but to buy things of value , " says economist Wang Tso-jung . Rice takes up a lot of space , while by comparison gold is portable and easy to store , so that many people preferred to buy gold .  
After this , the craft of rush weaving quickly became widespread . Forty years later , another Peipo woman had the clever idea of splitting the rushes into thin strips to make bed mats for sleeping on in summer . The mats are cool and fragrant , and can also be folded up making them easy to carry .  
He was unexpectedly called back to China to attend to his mother 's burial , and found himself ground to a halt in Jimei for two years , not a particularly easy base for launching foreign ventures . Then surprisingly his father 's enterprise went bankrupt , squandered into a penniless state by his father 's second wife . Tan had no choice but to start from scratch , running a rice store and a pineapple factory .  
Major infrastructure projects cost a lot of money and are not easy to bring on line , but when all is said and done these ravenous monsters will steadily leave the stage , or will become of only secondary importance , and leave most of the budgetary pie to others . What really seems " an unending drain that can never be controlled " is that part of the budget which elicits the most extreme emotions both for and against , social welfare .  
In 1985 , the mission began collaborating with the University of Costa Rica 's experimental station to perform various surveys and cultivation management experiments on more than 80 existing varieties of grape vines . Observation and gradual selection over four or five years of cultivation showed that a variety named Ruby Seedless performed best : not only is it high-yielding and consistent , with a thin skin , firm flesh and an excellent flavor , it is also easy to grow and manage and is highly resistant to disease .  
After having seen many such examples , NGO leaders are not unaware that criticizing is easier than doing the actual work . " The government is n't going to ask me to come serve in the public sector . If they did ask me , I 'm afraid it would n't be easy to do a good job , " admits one leader of an educational reform group . Once he switched roles from offense to defense , it would also be hard for him to escape " being vulnerable to attack . "  
They have had nowhere to turn because traditionally " the law ends at the family threshold . " There was a widespread social taboo on even discussing the issue . But after the case broke of a woman , Teng Ju-wen , who murdered her abusive husband , women 's groups went into action and began researching legislation designed to reduce domestic violence . Yet success has not always come easy , and there have been many setbacks .  
At the most basic level , people can get away with this when representing deceased heroes of the past for whom there is no photographic record . But for modern subjects whose photos are available , such inferior work is an insult to viewers , bringing to mind the expression , " It 's easy to portray a ghost , hard to portray a man . "  
We are surrounded by good things to eat in our prosperous society , and the need to carry heavy things , walk long distances , or perform manual labor is greatly reduced . Our bodies take in more energy than they expend , and while the food is easy to eat , it 's hard to get rid of . So it 's difficult to avoid accumulating fat .  
The scale model in the ancestral altar roomAfter several consultations , the house which Huang Sheng-yuan designed combines a traditional sloping-roofed courtyard dwelling with a two-storey concrete house in the square box style . " This echoes the style of existing residences in the Lanyang area . " To meet Mother Yu 's requirement of easy access on all sides , the house has a total of seven outside doorways .  
He wrote that " it is easy to move from frugality to luxury , but difficult to move from luxury to frugality . " It is impossible for even the most disciplined and fortunate families to achieve high rank in every generation , not to mention those families in which profligate playboys undo the accumulated achievements of their ancestors .  
In the US , for example , residential and agricultural areas are clearly separate , and huge areas of agricultural land are often devoted to a single crop , so it is easy to differentiate the objects in the satellite image .  
" Multi-cinema theater houses are the trend of the future . Big theaters are only a promotional gimmick , the attraction of a huge screen , " says Robert Chen , associate professor of communication arts at Fujen Catholic University . During the 100-year development of the movie , it has evolved from an art form into a small-group social activity . It is easy to comprehend why empty echoes are often heard in the larger cinemas .  
A dam is an enormous engineering structure , and an investment which has to be paid in all at once-it can not be built in easy installments . To construct a reservoir today takes an investment of over NT $ 10 billion , and Taiwan is not a good place to build reservoirs , so the return on the investment falls far short of that achieved in continental countries . Thus we should not be using reservoirs as " normal " water resources .  
She had less than US $ 10,000 in the bank , but it would be enough for her to " rough it " on a backpack trip through Asia . She was n't worried about her future . She was young and healthy , and had heard that it would be easy to find a job teaching English . With her Berkeley degree and pleasant appearance , she figured it would not be difficult to find such a job .  
When ball games become staged , players are victims too . While pro baseball players may have better financial prospects than other ROC athletes , the golden years of their prime last only about a decade , and many find the chance to earn some extra money in their youth hard to pass up . They make easy prey for the underworld , which brings with it violence , threats and bribery . Once having started down that slippery slope , it 's hard to turn back .  
On the maritime extreme of Europe , England had always been saturated by the arts of Italy and France . It was not easy to work out how to create a " natural garden " and it was hardly desirable to give half the credit to the far-away Chinese .  
They quickly discovered that while she looked elegant and refined , she was broad-minded , direct and easy to get along with . Though she could n't speak Hakka , she could chat away half the day with them using signs and gestures . Though an artist , she spent her days working in the fields . Running up and down the mountain , she was soon as tan and as strong as the local farming wives .  
Having studied at an agricultural high school , Li thought she was fully prepared to farm . But facing it firsthand , she quickly discovered that farm work was n't as easy or as laid back as she had imagined . And after becoming more closely involved with Chiungchiao Keng 's people , she gradually came to understand the town 's problems as well .  
Haucha elder Kuo Chin-ting says that in the past , people usually avoided swamps , which were overgrown with plants and easy to get lost in . Over time , by oral tradition ( the equivalent of tribal law ) , these became taboo areas .  
This is true enough , but : " To have children learn from a negative example is not as simple as presenting exemplary figures and saying ' do as they did . ' It means spending more time and effort interpreting the stories for the children and discussing them with them , and in the current situation where moral education is only a subsidiary subject with inadequate teaching resources , this is no easy matter , " says Hsieh Li-hung with regret .  
Their movements are sultry and mysterious-how easy it is to imagine a cat creeping stealthily atop a stone wall , cast in silhouette against a full moon . Their almond-shaped pupils , which change shape in shifting light , are eerie enough , without even considering that their eyes may give off a green luminescence ( from reflected light ) . And the screeches they make to attract mates , cutting through the night , are hair-raising .  
In an industrial society , as extended families living under one roof have given way to smaller and smaller nuclear families , the family can no longer serve the same functions it once did in supporting the needs of all segments of the population . Yet traditional Eastern attitudes , morality and values rooted in thousands of years of history are not easy to change , and they have a big effect on how policy toward the elderly is set .  
Furthermore , in the past it was easy to start a business with little capital , and both blue and white collar workers would aim to set up on their own once they had saved some money . " No-one is content to remain a lowly member of the working classes - - everyone wants to better themselves .  
Indeed , as far as he is concerned , " It seems like the film makers were all being ' politically correct , ' acting as if documentaries were only good for filming ' disadvantaged ' groups in society . These subjects and people inevitably become documentary material , and the film makers just use them because they make easy subject matter , " says Wang with sharp frankness .  
But the distorted value systems on these other shows , in which truth becomes inseparable from fiction , are even more insidious . " Kuo says that most people already find it difficult to extract meaning from reality in all its complexity and suffer information overload . People usually take the easy way out , and turn to television . The uninterrupted flow of dubiously " re-constructed , " or outright fictional , information can temporarily offer solace to their tired souls .  
If we feel old , as if we are not respected and are incapable of doing anything , we quickly find ourselves on the road to depression . If we feel aged , it is easy to become the stereotype of an elderly person-self-absorbed , dissatisfied and inflexible . This is likely to make us still more depressed .  
Another new style is " taiji-daoyin , " a 12-movement routine refined from traditional taijiquan by the well-known practitioner Hsiung Wei . Taiji-daoyin , which is easy to begin learning and requires a minimal amount of space for practice , has already been adopted as a keep-fit exercise by major corporations such as Acer , as well as being extended into modern dance and applied as a surprising new form of " Chinese-style dance workout . "  
Setting up in a foreign country was no easy task , particularly given that before BMI was established , the Bank of Hawaii and the Bank of Guam had already divided up the local financial market between them . Because the local savings rate was low but the borrowing rate was high , Chen decided that the only way to gain the upper hand as a latecomer was to offer more efficient lending operations .  
Lu Tien-yen , head of the Taipei Modern Painters Group and a participant in the Hong Kong show , explains that traditional art is based largely on feeling , and it is easy to appreciate its aesthetic . Modern art , on the other hand , is rational and logical , and the theoretical background to a work is vital .  
Modern doctors have to pass exams to get into medical school , and study hard for many years before they can begin their professional lives . It is not easy to become an indigenous shaman either . One must be selected by the ancestral souls . Although one may go on her own to become an acolyte to a practicing shaman , there 's no guarantee that she will " graduate " and win " certification . "  
And so she moved in a short time from perusing a few thin standardized teachers ' guides , to having a muddled understanding of Chinese grammar and history , to introducing China-that vast and distant land-to students who were even more ignorant of it than her . It was no easy feat .  
" A child deciding to become a monk or nun is no easy matter , " says Abbot Wei-chueh . Children are like blank slates and can easily be tarnished if exposed to filth . It is best that they wait until they have graduated from junior high , he argues . If they 're not wild , and their hearts and minds are pure , they can then talk about joining a monastery .  
I do n't have any plans to pose for a racy photo album . If I were in a movie and they wanted me to do a scene in the nude , it would n't be a problem . But I do n't think that a photo album would a way to express the ideal of male beauty . Maybe the Japanese pop idol Miyazawa Rie can express her own pure esthetic appeal through a photo album , but for a man to convey that kind of natural feeling through still photos is not an easy thing .  
Wu Hui-mei , a teacher at Chengcheng Junior High also sees many shortcomings in multiple-track admissions . She says the top schools are very competitive and hard to get into , whereas vocational senior high schools are easy to get into and often short of students . The result is that the schools in the middle end up getting overloaded .  
Looking to the future , as DSL and other broadband technology matures , large amounts of visual and audio information can also be transmitted through high-speed fiber-optic cable . As WAP equipment becomes widely available , you will be able to get important Internet information anywhere , condensed by transcoding technology into a form suitable for display on small devices . The open-source Linux operating system , which has appeared in the last several years , will make it easy for all types of platforms to be conveniently connected to one another .  
In Professor Tseng 's opinion , " It 's not easy to create a more transparent formula . Due to current political realities , the proportion of the Tax Redistribution Fund allocated to the wealthier local governments ca n't be cut too drastically . Disputes are inevitable , but if this constant arguing yields a better system , then it will have been worth the trouble . "  
For example , Chang Ta-chun rejects the idea that My Kid Sister and Wild Child are representative of his oeuvre . These were selected for translation mainly because the themes were more comprehensible to a foreign audience . " My other works , " he explains , " are about events or are set against backdrops peculiar to China or Taiwan , and would n't be easy to translate , much less be accessible to most American readers . "  
With their powerful wings , insects of the order Odonata can spread far and wide . Hence , compared with other insects , which have differentiated in response to specific environments , the proportion of endemic species among Taiwan 's dragonflies is not high . The island has only a third as many dragonfly species as butterfly species , and most were recorded by the middle of the 20th century . Lively dragonflies are easy to spot , but observing their lives in detail is more difficult .  
" It 's been no easy task searching for a suitable place to live , and we eventually had to make the leap all the way from western Taiwan to Hualien here in the eastern part , " says Chang . They lived in Lukang before , but when that place started to become affected by industrial pollution , they moved to Meilun in Hualien , where they rented a house .  
The resulting melange , sung in the local Minnan dialect , came to be known as gezai xi , or Taiwanese Opera , a very easy and enjoyable opera form that grew within 20 years into the most popular opera genre in Minnan-speaking areas . Troupes in Taiwan that had specialized in Beiguan , Gaojia , and Liyuan Opera switched over to Taiwanese Opera , and thanks to the close ties between Taiwan and Fujian , Taiwanese Opera took southern Fujian by storm in the 1920s and 30s .  
While greenhouse gases are perceived to be one of the major causes of global warming , climate is subject to a number of complex influences , including levels of solar radiation , evaporation of seawater and airflows between different latitudes . On a short-term , regional level , topography , bodies of water and even air pollution and the volume of airborne particles influence climate . Therefore , establishing the precise impact of greenhouse gases on climate is no easy task .  
If it is easy to find a free e-paper that is similar , or if the readers do n't really need the content , it is difficult to achieve the level of appeal required to collect fees , " says Hsu . But it can be done . Currently , e-papers at PChome that do the best with subscriber fees are for language learning and industrial reports . The publication with the most subscribers is iThome , a computer report , with about 10,000 .  
The crested serpent eagle 's whole body is covered in gray and brown feathers , but striking bands of white run across the wings and the middle of the tail feathers of the adult birds , making them easy to identify from the ground when they circle in the skies .  
At left are pictured conventional ( above ) and " earth bull " ( below ) tops . Though different in shape ( the former are conical and solid , the latter tubular ) , they share one thing in common : it 's not that easy to use them well !  
That very night he departed from the world without a warning or farewell . His passage was free and easy , but those whom he left behind were reluctant to let go . Liu 's biographer Yang Meng-yu once asked Liu whether he worried about not being able to wrap up loose ends should something befall him during one of his romps through some remote corner of the world .  
With these two types of sustenance , one material and one spiritual , naturally one can live a long time , " says Lu . In fact , as long ago as the Song dynasty , Su Dongpo had identified three major advantages of eating zhou : " It brings peace of mind , which contributes to well-being , it is easy on the stomach , which contributes to physical energy , and it saves money , which contributes to becoming wealthy . "  
Fang notes that the firm 's target market remains professional women . Modern women require clothes that are highly functional and presentable , but also comfortable , practical and easy to clean . For example , knitwear that can be machine-washed is a product that is both popular and practical .  
Moreover , Taiwan has an extremely comprehensive economic structure , from agriculture and textiles from the early period of industrialization to later-stage petrochemical and precision-machinery industries to the current information technology , optical electronics , and communications sectors . We have a dense web of up - and downstream economic activities . Moreover , Taiwan 's many small enterprises have organizational structures as flexible and adaptable as changelings , so peripheral support industries and core industries can develop together , and it is very easy to subcontract out work .  
According to many environmental groups , experience with kitchen waste recycling in rural communities shows that during the initial stages , residents were unclear about what was to be recycled , and as a result kitchen wastes were provided without first draining them , or items such as stray toilet paper , chopsticks , and plastic bags were often found mixed in . This type of front-end problem with the collection system is relatively easy to correct using instruction and appropriate adjustments . The real headache turns out to be with the downstream processes .  
Tang Yaw-chung , professor in the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering , National Taiwan University , says that modern technology makes it very easy to copy sound and image data . The more personal data criminals are able to lay their hands on , the harder it is for ordinary people to differentiate between the genuine and the bogus , and the easier it is for them to be taken in .  
He does n't rest easy until his ink has finished drying . In Taiwan , the best time of year for making ink runs from the eighth month of the lunar calendar through the second month of the following year , when the weather is relatively cool and there is little rain . The best ink is made in the winter because the ink blocks shrink in the cold , dry quickly , and keep their shape .  
While these newer materials were easy to use and quick to apply , they constituted a heavy outer layer that caused the temple to lose its original , classical feel . Furthermore , these materials stifled the original wood so that the resulting build-up of humidity encouraged termite infestations .  
Chen explains that in the earlier times most of these were made from bamboo pulp and sheets of strawboard , but those were n't water repellent and were easily damaged when it rained . Today they use cardboard or thick construction paper . The white paper surface makes it easy to apply colors and the pleats are more obvious and beautiful .  
We know that , even with the mineral wealth with which South Africa has been blessed , it will be no easy task for the new Government to correct the social and economic injustices of the past while maintaining the country on a sound financial footing .  
In these circumstances , the Russianspeaking population of Latvia is becoming an easy target for radical nationalist bureaucrats performing arbitrary and lawless acts with the secret but , in fact , direct connivance of the political leadership .  
However , our conscience can not rest easy in view of a reality that we can not ignore : the fact that one-fifth of mankind still lives in abject poverty , and the challenges posed by the enormous gap between the annual per capita gross national product for the least developed countries less than $ 200 and that of advanced industrialized countries , which is more than a-hundred times higher . 
The national euphoria resulting from the overthrow of a tyrannic dictatorship or from a deliberate choice , through legal processes , to change a form of government is , in most cases , as we have observed in the last few years , soon dissipated by a realization that making a democracy work is not as easy as proclaiming a democratic Government .  
Although endowed with more sophisticated capacity and resources than others , the Institute has found it difficult at this late stage to adapt quickly to the needs of the land programme , especially as most of its previous experience related to titling of housing in urban areas in which there was a fairly reliable registry and census of properties and relatively easy access .  
It is easy to understand , in view of the difficulties of the alternative assessment methods discussed above , the aforementioned trend in international practice to limit reparation of environmental damage to the payment of costs of restoration , the replacement or damaged or destroyed resources or the introduction of equivalent resources where the court deems this to be reasonable .  
The challenge we face is therefore enormous because it is quick , easy and cheap to lay mines , whereas clearing them is expensive , difficult and dangerous .  
The United Nations International Drug Control Programme reported that it collected national drug control laws and regulations , published them to ensure mutual disclosure among parties and prepared an annual analytical index of such legislation allowing for easy retrieval of the laws ' contents .  
Factors such as deprivation of education , limited meaningful human contact and easy access to sophisticated weapons , coupled with the experience of the cruelties of war , destroy the value system of many young people , resulting in a failure to discourage them from participating in violent activities .  
The transition from a centrally planned economy and a centralized public administration with the State directly involved in the production of goods and services , to a fully developed public and private sector is not easy to achieve ; it takes time and is expensive .  
The true dimensions of this problem can clearly be seen when it is set against the background of the technical and material restrictions on demining that prevent any easy or rapid implementation and when we consider the risks and costs that make it prohibitive to individual countries .  
That principle created a presumption in favour of national jurisdiction for the reasons contained in the report of the Ad Hoc Committee , namely that the parties concerned would work within existing bilateral and multilateral arrangements , applicable law would be more certain , criminal actions would be less costly and the penalties involved would be clearly defined and easy to enforce .  
Because it is not always easy in Tajikistan to distinguish between political violence , violent crime and violence arising from private disagreements , UNMOT personnel located at team sites endeavour , in the exercise of their good offices , to resolve minor incidents at the local level while keeping their superior at headquarters informed . 
At the international level , at least three activities are needed to improve coordination : ( a ) harmonization of coordination and cooperation between policy and planning frameworks at the country level to avoid confusion and overlap , ( b ) critical evaluation of emerging approaches to facilitate speedy adoption of feasible solutions and ( c ) easy access to information at international , regional , country and project levels .  
It is desirable for the information systems to be Internet-based for this would allow easy access and information-sharing among multilateral agencies , countries ' institutions , non-governmental organizations and other interested parties .  The Panel may wish to invite relevant multilateral forest agencies and international organizations to review and initiate the development of improved information systems that support activities for sustainable forest management , particularly so as to facilitate private sector investment , speed up technology transfer to developing countries and improve coordination in financial assistance .  
The effects on the mental and psychological health of children subject to commercial sexual exploitation are not easy to diagnose , and can be healed only through expensive and prolonged treatment .  
His delegation recognized that it would not be easy to reach agreement on a 20 per cent ceiling , but in recent years Portugal and Greece had both voluntarily agreed to increase their peacekeeping rates and numerous countries had joined the consensus two years previously on a regular scale that increased their rates . 
It was not easy to conclude from the report of the Secretary-General on human resources management ( A / C . 5 / 51 / 1 ) whether the Office of Human Resources Management ( OHRM ) had developed the specific guidelines required to translate the universal rules established by the General Assembly for use by programme managers and whether any monitoring mechanism had been put in place to ensure proper implementation at the departmental level of the relevant General Assembly decisions and resolutions .  
Contents of reports , notes and confidential letters should be easy to understand ; be free of vagueness or ambiguity ; include only information which is supported by competent , valid and relevant evidence ; take into account new publishing technologies ; and be independent , objective , fair , constructive , short and concrete .  
However , the easy availability of weapons , the high incidence of armed criminal activity and the fact that the first police officers graduated only 18 months ago are clear indications that the HNP faces formidable challenges in its efforts to maintain a secure and stable environment .  
Despite concerns that Internet access may be creating a new social strata of haves and have-nots , electronic communications have the potential to increase the exchange of knowledge rapidly around the world in an open , easy and relatively democratic manner , which is not only useful for linking scientists and scientific centres with each other but also for opening up available information to ordinary citizens instantly on demand , reducing their intellectual distance from scientific information .  
In actual fact the authorities were combating the development of a militant Sikh terrorist movement campaigning for a separate and autonomous Sikh state , which had first appeared in 1978 ; it was financed by the Sikh diaspora ( and even by Pakistan ) and was using religion to secure the support of Sikhs and as an easy means of whipping up their passions in favour of a purely political cause .  
Against this background it is easy to understand the huge significance of the study completed by Mrs . Nicole Questiaux in 1982 , [ 1 ] which determined the conditions and requirements on which the legality of a state of emergency depended and which ensured that proper application thereof is compatible with respect for human rights and with democratic forms of government .  
It should be easy to understand why the Government of the Republic of Burundi objects to the talks being held in the United Republic of Tanzania , the fundamental reason for this objection being the current tension resulting from the problems caused by the refugee camps set up all along the shared border by the United Republic of Tanzania , just a dozen or so kilometres from Burundi , which are regularly used as bases for bloody incursions into Burundi territory . 
Compared with exporters from developed countries , who can have easy access to specialized trade-finance facilities , exporters from developing countries , particularly exporters of non-traditional goods , are disadvantaged as they usually can not offer long-term credits to overseas buyers or obtain at an affordable cost insurance coverage against the commercial and political risks involved for such exports .  
Furthermore , this is a concrete , effective security mechanism that is relatively easy to implement and helps avoid misunderstandings and errors while fostering in-depth , constructive dialogue that enhances mutual understanding and alerts the international community to the excessive stockpiling of weapons .  
The world has witnessed fundamental economic changes , such as the end of State control of economic life in many States , the withering away of numerous restraints on international trade , the easy transfer of capital and huge investments across the world .  
Contents of reports , notes and confidential letters should be easy to understand ; be free of vagueness or ambiguity ; include only information which is supported by competent , valid and relevant evidence ; take into account new publishing technologies ; and be independent , objective , fair , constructive , short and concrete .  
In addition to being flexible , any new system of desirable ranges should meet a number of operational requirements ; such a system , inter alia , should produce predictable and verifiable results , be easy to administer and be transparent .
