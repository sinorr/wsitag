Practice proves that this round of the " three stresses " education is a creative exploration in strengthening and improving party building in the new period , especially in ideological and political building of leading bodies and cadres .  It carries forward and enriches in the period the Yanan rectification spirit and the party 's " three great styles , " and is an important measure in promoting and implementing the principle that " the party must manage itself " and the principle of " sternly governing the party . "  
So , improving the quality of creative works and offering a larger quantity of excellent works involving producers ' great efforts is the most important task among important tasks of the military 's literary and artistic work in the future period .  
Strengthening the study of the creative professions , the study and discussion of works , commentaries on literary and artistic works and focusing on the association of professional and amateur creative works are also effective ways to improve the quality of creative works and offer more excellent works .  
Because amateur creative works have a wide base of experience from the lives of the rank and file , professional literary and artistic workers must be good at absorbing nutrients from amateur works to enrich their own base of experience from the lives of the rank and file and broaden their own sources of materials from the lives of rank and file .  
The " three representations " is the scientific summary of the Party 's character and aim , is the centralized requirements of maintaining the Party 's advancement , is the creative utilization and development of Theory of Marxism Party building , and is the fundamental guiding ideology of strengthening Party building under new circumstances , which has strong ideological content , theoretical content and distinctive character of the day .  
The above facts show that Shenzhen has rapidly grown from a small border town to a modern city in a short period of 20 years , an essential factor of which is attributable to our party 's policy decision on the construction of Shenzhen and the creative practice of the vast numbers of cadres and masses that represent the demands of the development of advanced social productive forces .  
This important policy decision contains a scientific summing-up of our army 's practice in qualified personnel cultivation in last several decades , a creative exploration of a way to attain the grand objective of cross-century development in our army 's modernization , and a farsightedness which has a bearing on whether or not our army can march in the front ranks of the world military development in the future .  
The second signal company of a garrison district of a navy unit stationed in Shantou has often carried out " letting everyone talk " activities in promoting ideological work and encouraged fighters to mount on the stage of self-education .  Everyone can offer his opinions on specific topics and on methods to solve problems and make contributions .  In this way , the unit has promoted the " appropriate , systematic and creative nature " of ideological and political work through mass work .  
" fundamental " means that once the scientific method is established , it will become the soul of the individual , the nation and the people .  It will stimulate the people to love life , to pursue truth , and to be intelligent and sharp , to be fair and unselfish , to be self-confident , not cocky , to be rigorous , not picky , to be upright and outspoken , calm and unhurried , to be filled with the spirit of creativity and creative vitality .  
Through making efforts over the last 20 years or so , we have eventually opened up a most lively , active , and creative ideological and political situation in the history of our party and country and the ideological level and understanding capability of the masses of people have been greatly increased .  
The creative spirit of the masses of people is respected , the spirit of daring to think and act and be pioneers is recommended and admired in the society , and the new experiences acquired by the masses at the grass-roots level have become a powerful base for the party to formulate policies .  
In diplomatic work , Comrade Geng Biao was firm on matters of principle and flexible on matters of tactics .  He put forward his unique viewpoints and creative ideas in light of the developing and changing situation .  He displayed very strong grasp of policy and strong mastery of the art of struggle .  
These leaders should pay attention to study characteristics of these units , meticulously review positive experiences drawn from practice , and enthusiastically explore new issues and new problems that arise in the condition of reforming , opening up and developing a socialist market economy .  These leaders should closely associate the essence of the five-sentence general requirement and the " Program " with the reality of these " small , remote , scattered and directly administered " units , work in a creative manner and continuously improve the quality and efficiency of our work .  
As China is a large country , with an uneven distribution of demobilized military cadres and regional differences in economic development , governments at all levels may face new issues and new problems in carrying out and implementing interim procedures .  This requires we pay attention to the fundamental interests of the Party and the country , correctly handle the relationship between regions and the overall situation , work in a creative manner and ensure solid implementation of every resettlement policy .  
Wu Yi pointed out : Cities are situated in a central position in economic and social development , and play a strong influential and leading role in their peripheral areas .  It is necessary to do creative work in accordance with the actual conditions , give full play to their advantages in science , technology , education , and human resources , and more quickly advance the implementation of the strategy of promoting trade with science and technology .  
He further hoped that the quality education base for youths and the science and technology hall will extend the quality education of schools and allow every middle and elementary school student to be trained and nurtured in creative thinking , willpower and moral character , physical health , environmental protection sense , and capability in practical living .  
They should associate strategies and policies issued by the central government with realities in their own region and department , combine needs with possibilities , unite the spirit of forging ahead with that of seeking the truth and being realistic .  They should align working enthusiasm with being scientific .  All comrades in the Party , particularly leading cadres , should work in a creative manner and use innovations in their leadership styles and skills to look toward a new horizon in building the Party and socialist modernization construction .  
Second , we should bring the role of universities and scientific research institutes into full play , make great efforts to carry out strategic advanced technology research and creative and basic research .  We should enhance our sustained innovation capability in science and technology .  We should strive to realize rapid development in technology in the domain that we have relative advantages or in the domain that is strategically important .  
Fourth , carry forward the spirit of science and democracy , enliven academic thinking .  Continue to carry out the " double-hundred policy , " encourage creative thinking , create a benign academic environment , discover and foster a large batch of outstanding young scientists , build a strong contingent of scientists and technologists with sufficient quantity and high quality , encourage them to scale up the peaks of science and technology and to occupy a position for our country in the high-tech realm of the world .  
Particularly since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Party , our Party has reviewed positive and negative experiences in socialist construction , successfully created a way of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics and enabled scientific socialism to be energetic , vigorous and creative in this vast land .  
We must further liberate thinking , renew ideas , persist in regarding development as the theme , structural readjustment as the base line , liberalized reforms and scientific and technological progress as the driving force , and improvement of the people 's standard of living as the fundamental starting point , use creative thinking to resolve the prominent issues arising in the process of economic and social development in Tibet , and put into place good cycles in Tibet work .  
Marxism-Leninism and its creative development in China have fundamentally enhanced the spirit of the Chinese nation , greatly strengthened the historical initiative of the Chinese communists and the Chinese people to push forward China 's social development and make the great cause of ours to constantly forge ahead toward the lofty objectives along with the steps of the times .  
To raise the ideological and ethical standards and scientific and cultural levels of the workers , peasants , intellectuals , and other laboring people and the entire population and improve their work skills and creativity and give full scope to their enthusiasm , initiative , and creative power - - these should remain the tasks of primary importance that our party should perform in representing China 's advanced productive forces .  
Through study and discussion , all people attending the meeting deeply realized that the important thinking on " three represents " set forth by Comrade Jiang Zemin is a creative application of the basic theory of historical materialism , which is practiced in contemporary China . It greatly enrich people 's understanding of the party 's character , basic principle , and task .  
It is like water pouring off a steep roof , has tremendous momentum , has full and abundant connotation and profound thinking , and is a creative utilization and development of Marxism , Mao Zedong thought , and Deng Xiaoping theory .  It symbolizes the fact that our party has reached new heights , new levels , and new boundaries in its understanding of the rules of governance and construction ; in its understanding of the rules for socialist construction ;  
emphasizing priority areas of scientific and technological development , an approach under which the state should give priority support to strategically significant technologies , support production enterprises with high and new technologies , and support , on a priority basis , the work of developing techniques with high technological levels which lead the world in the relevant research fields , which contain creative elements capable of establishing new scientific and technological bases , and which have been generally recognized at home and abroad .

Young people are in their prime , their thinking is quick , they readily accept new things , and they have an abundance of creative spirit , but the spirit of science must be firmly established , they must work hard to dig into scientific knowledge , and they must have the far-sighted aspiration of contributing their own youth and knowledge to the motherland and the people .  
Correctly understanding their distinctive mentalities and behaviors is the basis for setting the goals , assignments , and requirements and developing the methods for ideological and political construction .  It is also the premise for making ideological and political work more relevant , systematic , and creative .  
By grasping the four " new " things , upholding the four " close connections , " and carrying out work in a creative way , ideological and political work will be closer to the era , the masses , and daily life , will be effectively intensified and improved , and will also be able to give fuller play to its role as spiritual motive force and political guarantee .  
The rational use and protection of nature , supporting world peace and promoting mutual development , and raising the standard of living in every country , especially the developing countries , will require even more talented engineers and technicians with creative spirits , and it will also require that the engineers and technicians of every country further strengthen their exchanges and cooperation .  
tell the truth , engage ourselves in solid work , and lay stress on practical results ; carry out the line , principles , and policies established by the central authorities with unremitting efforts ; and fulfill our duties in a creative manner in light of the realistic conditions of our work .  
We should seize the two major opportunities where the state is implementing the strategy of actively developing China 's west regions and where Tibet is stable socially .  Furthermore , we should apply creative concepts and systems as well as innovative science and technology to attain economic and social progress by leaps and bounds .  To constantly represent the orientation for the progress of China 's advanced culture , we have to carry out the following tasks : We should establish a Marxist cultural concept .  
Cohen , a political figure who has published many poetry books , mentioned that he said on the Shanghai Stock Exchange that as the middle class on the Chinese mainland grows , their middle class will do " what every middle class has done throughout history " : it will seek a greater voice in governing , it will suggest new and creative approaches to national challenges , and it will push for peaceful solutions to international disputes and stable commerce with its neighbors .  
The proposed Film Development Fund would promote innovation by supporting projects aimed at enhancing the industry 's professional and technological capabilities ; stimulating the growth of creative productions ; facilitating the use of advanced special effects techniques ; and improving the skills of employees .  
We expect our educational systems and policies to bring up creative and adaptive young people who are ready to take up their responsibilities towards our society and our country .  We also expect to train up talents with an international outlook as well as a wide scope of knowledge and skills .  They must take pride in their lifelong zeal for learning , seek pleasure in enriching themselves and share the virtues of human beings , " Mr Tung said .

In its fourth year , the response to the Scheme had been overwhelming and a total of 63 proposals on different art forms were received .  Start from September 1999 , the resident arts groups are going to launch creative activities ranging from training courses , workshops , seminars , exhibitions and performances at the Council 's civic centres in Sai Wan Ho , Sheung Wan and Ngau Chi Wan , as well as the Ko Shan Theatre .  
We need a workforce who have a strong sense of purpose ; who are knowledgeable and competent in the work they do ; capable of independent and critical thinking ; sensitive and responsive to change ; positive and resilient in the face of setbacks ; and creative in problem-solving .  
The principal credit must go to the front line staff for their precise execution , the middle management for their meticulous supervision , as well as the senior directorate for their ingenious policy formulation .  As the head of department , I have taken the role of facilitator building a proper environment to nurture creative , constructive and co-operative behaviour within the Department .  
Sponsored by the Beat Drugs Fund , and co-produced by the Outstanding Young Persons ' Association and the Media Evangelism Ltd . , an anti-drug film entitled " The Final Turn " is now on show until August . The film is based on true case stories provided by Long Ke Treatment and Rehabilitation Centre operated by Wu Oi Christian Centre and is considered a very powerful and creative medium to get across the anti-drug messages to the public . 
The open access regime we have created in Hong Kong will mean that it is not only the successful licensees who can provide innovative 3G services .  Other operators and providers of content will have the opportunity to provide exciting services over these networks at a fair price .  In particular , the regime should encourage capable small and medium enterprises to design and provide creative mobile applications .  So Hong Kong is well positioned to be a world centre for 3G innovation , * said Mr Anthony Wong , Telecommunications Authority .  
The main objectives of the Scheme are to invite performing artists to establish their presence at a civic center over a period of time , to enable them to understand the inclination and appreciation ability of a local audience with whom artists can develop their artistic exchange , creative work and experimentation .  At the same time , the general public is able to come into contact with performing artists and develop an understanding , interest and appreciation of the arts .  
To make thorough researches on local customs and culture , the creative team paid seven visits to Tibet . Several hundreds sets of costumes of different Tibetan nationalities are specially designed for this production .  On the source of music , sounds from real environment are collected like sound of one hundred revolving scripts at Dazhao Temple , sound of water flowing from Yarlung Zangbo River , sound of chiming of script by over one hundred lamas , singing of herdsmen , and many more .

Speaking at the workshops is an experienced teacher in teaching children with special educational needs , Mrs Colette Wong , who has her training in specific learning difficulties at the Hornsby International Dyslexia Centre in London . At the workshops , Mrs Wong will share with participating teachers her practical experience and the teaching strategies to help students with specific learning difficulties in the areas of speech sound awareness , word recognition , reading strategies , information processing , memory skills and creative thinking .  
The aim of the Scheme is to encourage students to visit performing arts venues , museums and libraries under LCSD during school hours in the school year and to take part in cultural programmes specifically designed for them by special arrangement between the participating schools and the Department . It is hoped that through the Scheme , students would be encouraged to cultivate an actively creative mind and regard arts , history and science as part of their learning process and an integral part of everyday life .  
He attained an impressive international reputation , in particular for his unparalleled talent in flower-and-bird paintings , however , Professor Chao was also a master at landscapes .  He devoted much creative effort to this genre , finally arriving at a unique style and recording extraordinary achievements .  
This performance of Mongolian song and dance is an inside look at the customs , habits and cultural identity of the Mongolian people .  It comprises of rich living habits , colourful ethnic culture , unique individualistic aesthetic quality and the use of creative and innovative presentation style .  It embraces both the traditional and contemporary aspects of Mongolian artistic culture .  
He will meet authorities responsible for arts and cultural development and the promotion of creative industries and will hold discussions on how authorized soccer betting , in particular the treatment of pathological gamblers , is handled there .  
" We are confident that the new structure will continue to provide a unified chain of command from policy formulation through implementation and as committed in the 2003 / 04 Corporate Plan also endorsed today , the HA will strive to help all families in need gain access to adequate and affordable housing , " Dr Cheng added .  A total of 59 key initiatives and 19 key performance indicators are covered in the Corporate Plan , embracing the HA 's four core values : caring , customer-focused , creative and committed .  
" Given proper conservation and creative use , the Site has great potential to be developed into a heritage tourism attraction that would enable local residents and overseas visitors to appreciate the unique cultural heritage of Hong Kong . "  
The refined stage manner and sophisticated commentary of the master and mistress of ceremonies , and the smooth organization of the three-hour program helped to give a new image of the Chinese in the 1980s as being humorous , vigorous , talented and creative .  
The scenic surroundings of the university campus inspired her creative writing , and she often contributed to literary journals . Wang has written hundreds of short stories in which a trend away from the vague earlier works to the current contemporary social dramas is apparent .  
Fine arts professor at the Fu Jen Catholic University , Chuang Po-ho , explained : " When I was in college I was told that even garbage could be beautiful , but I did n't understand this until it was pointed out to me how to discover its attractive side " Prof . Hsieh adds that one must cultivate a sensitive mind , be observant , imaginative and creative , then you will be able to have pictures that are moving and lively .  
The first performance in 1978 was well-received . By showing their creative and expressive talents , the deaf performers gave the public a new impression , and exposed it to their own silent language . In 1981 the Ministry of Education went a step further to promote a unified sign language .  
Chinoiserie , the vogue for Chinese-style interior decoration , furniture , porcelain and textiles that swept Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , has sometimes been explained as blatant imitation of Chinese products , as freely creative art with China as its inspiration , or even as the product of commercial protectionism aimed at keeping Chinese exports out of contemporary markets .  
As for Hong kong , it is also a center of capitalism , has a special culture brought about by the mix of Orient and Occident , has highly developed communications and access to a wealth of information ; it is very free and people do n't interfere in each other 's lives ; it is very liberal , and no one cares about your political position ; already thirty percent of its broadcasting is Mandarin music , and it will take at least five years before its creative capabilities catch up to Taiwan .  
Basically speaking , we use a collage or cut-and-paste postmodern method , using the technique to strengthen a consumer 's impression of a commercial , " explains Hsu Shun-ying , who is creative director at the Yi Shi Hsing Tai Agency , which is responsible for Stimoral 's ads . The choice of Taiwanese as a piece of the collage was done in the hope of fostering identification with the product through using the current way young people talk . " Are n't young people today all part of a bilingual Mandarin-Taiwanese generation ? "  
But what they have in common is a deep love of the photographic image , which leads them to choose photography for their creative work . When their works appear , they almost always break with accepted ideas that a photograph creates a record , is decided in an instant , is immutable and is capable of unlimited reproduction .  
As I stated above , she does n't have any advantages in her creative environment and subject matter . And she has failed to pursue an even higher quality of creative style , and her intellectual offspring are naturally less than ideal . Almost all the stories collected here are too brief , and the exposi tion of her plots and characters is too sketchy .  
Meanwhile , China 's painters , living amidst domestic turmoil and foreign invasion , felt the pressure of disappearing traditions . Forced to absorb the creative techniques and methods of the West , China 's painters devoted their efforts to the reform of traditional painting , seeking an East-West fusion of technique . The content of their paintings abounded in themes of ethnic consciousness . Western painting thus followed completely different courses of development in China and Taiwan .  
Ho Te-lai , born ten years after Liu , resisted the formulaic paintings of the competitions and for the greater part of his life shut himself up in Japan , where he joined the Shinkozo-Sha ( the " New Structure Society " ) school characterized by freedom and unrestricted direction . He remained faithful to his own thoughts , and to his personal creative device of inserting words into his paintings .  
Wu was ahead of her at school , so she has witnessed his long-term development . Back in school , Wu was a well-behaved child with a special classical quality to him . Then Chung saw him dancing in a loin cloth for the Cloud Gate Dance Theater , establishing the experimental Contemporary Legend Theater , and acting in movies and on television . His creative ability and experience made her feel that he was the best choice for Ah-Q .  
For the past eight years working in Hong Kong as a lecturer in Art and Design , I have believed quality of creative thinking has to be developed from awareness of our environment . Thus , I decided to come back to Malaysia to set up a children 's creative learning program . The main objective is to cultivate quality of thinking in children when they are still young .  
Grass huts offer people numerous advantages-they are convenient , flexible , simple , and can be made entirely from materials readily at hand . Li Juei-tsung , an associate professor of architecture and environmental design at the Chung-Hua Polytechnic Institute , suggests , " Thatched houses are the single greatest expression of the culture of ordinary people , and they are one of the great creative products of man and nature . It 's too bad they have been ignored in architectural history . "  
Hsu Yi-hsiung , the head of the graduate physical education program at National Taiwan Normal University , is unequivocal in stating that foreign research shows that children who are physically active and athletic are highly creative and more intelligent than average .  
In Western music , perhaps it 's only the composer who is creative , while all the rest are interpreters . In Chinese music , the creators are at every level , and the performers are especially important creators . It is " homogeneous evolution , " " looking for difference in homogeneity , looking for similarity in difference , " " common appreciation of the elite and the popular , stressing commonality over difference . " These seem to be simple , ordinary descriptions , but this is its real nature .  
They had a low level of culture and knowledge , thinking only to gain the maximum they could in the minimum amount of time . In his book 100 Years Ago , the author John Warner writes that they were ' conservative , vulgar , lacking creative abilities in literature , science , or art . ' Members of the British middle class who failed at home , they came to Hong Kong determined to either get rich or go bust . "  
" There does not need to be a conflict between the needs of urban development and historical building preservation , " says Tseng Shu-cheng , an assistant professor in Tamkang University 's Architecture Department . Preserving historic buildings or spaces is not intended to stop time and halt development . On the contrary it is intended to use their historical essence to make a new and creative use of the space .  
However , many artists are unwilling to let this 800-year-old Chinese folk tradition wither and die . In 1985 the Council for Cultural Planning and Development began an annual competition to select the best New Year 's prints . Each year many creative submissions combining tradition and contemporary styles are received , reflecting today 's actual mass culture .  
Shih himself has applied the right-brain concept to the commercial sphere . In the ideas about " business culture " that Shih put forward a number of years ago , he suggested that people are changed by emotional stimuli , not rational argument . This is very much in keeping with the right-brain concept . And in his " right-brain leadership " concept , put forward two years ago , Shih takes his approach a step further , proposing EQ-based , creative management .  
Whether you are making a film or making glass , the creative process can easily make you tense and worried , and this is likely to be reflected in the way you get along with others . So other people often used to find me irritable or restless . It was not until a few years ago , when I produced a series of modern Buddha figures in glass , that I gained an entirely new insight .  
Buddhism and Taoism seemed less useful than Confucianism in resolving worldly problems . Confucianism thus entered a period of creative transformation in order to meet external challenges to the state . Zhu Xi 's influence proved greater than that of other philosophers because of his work integrating various schools of thought , doing textual research , and annotating the classics . For example , prior to the Song dynasty , The Great Learning was not a very influential work in China .  
In the last few years , Buddhist music-in various guises ranging from traditional chanting to folk , rock and dance music-has made itself heard in every corner of Taiwan life . There is now even a Religious Music category at the annual Golden Melody Awards . But concern has been expressed that as Buddhist music extends its creative scope , the form is failing in its essential function of promoting salvation .  
But another music industry professional , MTV Taiwan 's programming and creative department supervisor Dennis Yang , has a different point of view . " It 's impossible to change the commercialization and unsophisticated taste of pop music , " he says . As for awards being given to Pur-dur and other similar artists , he feels it is good to encourage the creation of works with different creative perspectives . " But it 's still impossible to create a popular demand in the market for works that have lost contact with commercial taste . "  
However , Columbia University professor and literary critic Wang Dewei feels that Gao Xingjian is a highly innovative writer with original ideas , and that a combination of factors including his fame overseas , his literary status , his creative style and his accessibility surely make him a fitting choice to receive the prize , whether on behalf of Chinese authors or of writers in exile .  
Says Lin , " Because of the way the pieces are selected and the fact that most online readers are students , almost all the online works that get published in book format offer very realistic descriptions of school romance . I think these novels give young authors a chance to achieve a sense of closure in real-life romances gone wrong , and to use their experiences as a source of creative energy . " Lin feels that the popularity of such works is natural , since both the authors and readers are everyday people .  
Take Citicorp , for example . Although it has a good image , offers comprehensive financial services , and is creative with its management methods , it has been frustrated to find that its business has remained limited to foreign firms and members of the economic elite . It has continued to be unsuccessful in entering the mass market .  
His boss 's faith in his talents proved well founded , as Huang quickly injected wonderful creative touches to the small traditional ornaments that he carved . The proportions , expressions , and poses of his rendered subjects were always accurate , detailed , and lively , and never fell into the typical ruts . As a result , his boss began to let him design new products . Huang began to acquire a small reputation within the industry .  
And so , apart from designing and carving , when his fellow workers were off work and at leisure , Huang busied himself attending exhibitions and doing relevant research in the field . " I wanted , " Huang says , describing his individual creative aspirations , " to create my own creative vocabulary for jade carving that was suited to this brilliant , expansive and constantly evolving age . And I 've never wavered from working to accomplish this . "  
But chief editor Chuang Hui-chiu has done a masterful job of just that , spinning a broad tapestry that shows the interplay between individual emotions and collective experience . This she achieves by inviting contributions from over 30 persons from all walks of life who have played prominent roles in the gay movement over the past decade . By allowing each writer their own individual perspective , the book avoids the difficulties of historiography while providing students of social movements with a rigorous yet creative presentation of the facts .  
The participants were managers of publishing companies from Europe , the United States , and Japan . Speaking from direct experience , they emphasized that company size was not relevant to survival . Small companies have much greater room to publish creative publications . The operating principles that will always hold true for publishing houses are selecting the right works for publication and producing high quality books .  
Art critic Wang Chia-chi points out that Installation Art in Taiwan is basically written from the creative perspective of the artist , expressing both sympathy and empathy for the subject matter covered . As such , when Yao explains works , he strives to fathom the original creative intent of each artist . In consequence , the book has some commentary but is bereft of any clear , forceful critiques .  
Wang Dan 's identity gives his creative writing a free pass to the public , and even more to the mainstream media . But at the same time this also is a problem for him . It makes it unnecessary for him to pursue perfection in his literary life , and his obscure and emotional essay style readily reveals a literary technique that is not yet mature , and indeed a character that is equally childlike .  
Yet , while his improvements on traditional designs were meeting with great approval , they were n't satisfying his creative desires . From an early age he had been a great lover of painting and very familiar with historical folktales , so he decided to leave the ranks of craftsmen , breaking free from the shackles of tradition , and to adopt innovative styles using Western realism to create new works that more richly displayed a purely artistic creativity .  
" It 's the plainness of rice straw that attracts people to it , " says Kao Hsi-lin . " It gives rise to a desire for a natural , rustic life . " Kao is a vibrant man who builds installations , paints and studies creative media . After several years spent working on community building , he is now giving new life to rice straw , a material that the people of Jenju had previously thought of as a waste product .  
After finding the right tool , and keeping in mind that " it 's all a matter of controlling the force , " after countless broken eggs due to squeezing or pushing too hard , Kuan Chun-mai eventually developed his own creative " knife withdrawal technique " whereby an even , well distributed pressure is applied when withdrawing the knife point from the cut . The principle is roughly similar to the " cue withdrawal technique " used in billiards .  
Fortunately , after a decade of fighting the good fight , the kinds of books for women now available in mainstream bookstores are no longer limited to childcare and cooking . Moreover , now that there are so many venues for artistic and intellectual events , Fembooks is no longer indispensable for the spread of the ideas and creative work that it has long promoted . It seems that the bookshop 's mission , particular to its specific time and place in the history of feminism in Taiwan , has been accomplished .  
Perhaps the most common ceramic product was the teapot . After Taiwan 's economy started growing by leaps and bounds in the 1970s , enjoyment of fine teas became a popular pastime , and one for which the teapot was indispensable . A number of outstanding teapot masters appeared on the scene to meet the demand . Consciousness of the existence of pottery as an art , however , has led potters since the 1990s to look beyond the teapot and explore the other creative possibilities open to them .  
People doing modern ceramic art have always played down local culture , so I decided to seek creative motifs in my ethnic background . That fits in well with today 's emphasis on things rooted specifically in Taiwanese culture . " After embarking on his new path , Li at first made heavy use of the motifs appearing in traditional paintings used for celebrating Chinese New Year .  
Having decided to use gold as his creative medium , Wu set to work , using 99.99% pure gold that lacked the silver or copper that goldsmiths traditionally add to make welding easier ( but that in time cause oxidation , with the silver turning black and the copper green ) .  
Korea has seized the magic wand of the new economy-the cultural and creative industries-transforming its national image from that of the world 's most diligent and unbending people to that of the liveliest , most innovative and most adept at packaging cultural products .  
Liu Wei-kung , associate professor of sociology at Soochow University , says that rather than debate incessantly about the definition and scope of cultural and creative industries , it would be better to grasp the salient characteristic at their core , which is that content on its own is not enough . It 's extremely important that the product or service creates an appealing story that will pull people in , so as to give people a joyful experience in the process of consumption .  
Wu Se-hwa states that capital for cultural creative industries includes the following : copyrighted music , literature , fine arts and animation ; locations that can serve as the background for creativity , such as historic sites and natural scenery ; creative talent ; and language or customs that reveal the special flavor of an area .  
Chen Chi-nan , a minister without portfolio who is a leading figure in the push for cultural and creative industries , says that from inside to outside there are three key layers to cultural production : at the core are the arts ( the fine arts , theater , music , literature and so forth ) ; the second circle includes advertising design , architecture , the media and so forth ; and the outer circle represents extended services and tourism-this is the most easily commercialized portion .  
What 's more , various kinds of economic assistance , loans and insurance require real estate to be put up as collateral , but for creative and cultural industries , for which creativity and talented personnel represent their true capital , these requirements are entirely inappropriate .  
" In the past some licensing companies just did n't care and forced artists to sign licensing agreements that covered ' all ' of their works . And you know , this ' all ' included creative work done in the past , present and future . They really strongarmed them , " says Ivan Fan , deeply upset at this unfair treatment of the artists .

The refined stage manner and sophisticated commentary of the master and mistress of ceremonies , and the smooth organization of the three-hour program helped to give a new image of the Chinese in the 1980s as being humorous , vigorous , talented and creative .  
The scenic surroundings of the university campus inspired her creative writing , and she often contributed to literary journals . Wang has written hundreds of short stories in which a trend away from the vague earlier works to the current contemporary social dramas is apparent .  
Fine arts professor at the Fu Jen Catholic University , Chuang Po-ho , explained : " When I was in college I was told that even garbage could be beautiful , but I did n't understand this until it was pointed out to me how to discover its attractive side " Prof . Hsieh adds that one must cultivate a sensitive mind , be observant , imaginative and creative , then you will be able to have pictures that are moving and lively .  
The first performance in 1978 was well-received . By showing their creative and expressive talents , the deaf performers gave the public a new impression , and exposed it to their own silent language . In 1981 the Ministry of Education went a step further to promote a unified sign language .  
Chinoiserie , the vogue for Chinese-style interior decoration , furniture , porcelain and textiles that swept Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , has sometimes been explained as blatant imitation of Chinese products , as freely creative art with China as its inspiration , or even as the product of commercial protectionism aimed at keeping Chinese exports out of contemporary markets .  
As for Hong kong , it is also a center of capitalism , has a special culture brought about by the mix of Orient and Occident , has highly developed communications and access to a wealth of information ; it is very free and people do n't interfere in each other 's lives ; it is very liberal , and no one cares about your political position ; already thirty percent of its broadcasting is Mandarin music , and it will take at least five years before its creative capabilities catch up to Taiwan .  
Basically speaking , we use a collage or cut-and-paste postmodern method , using the technique to strengthen a consumer 's impression of a commercial , " explains Hsu Shun-ying , who is creative director at the Yi Shi Hsing Tai Agency , which is responsible for Stimoral 's ads . The choice of Taiwanese as a piece of the collage was done in the hope of fostering identification with the product through using the current way young people talk . " Are n't young people today all part of a bilingual Mandarin-Taiwanese generation ? "  
But what they have in common is a deep love of the photographic image , which leads them to choose photography for their creative work . When their works appear , they almost always break with accepted ideas that a photograph creates a record , is decided in an instant , is immutable and is capable of unlimited reproduction .  
As I stated above , she does n't have any advantages in her creative environment and subject matter . And she has failed to pursue an even higher quality of creative style , and her intellectual offspring are naturally less than ideal . Almost all the stories collected here are too brief , and the exposi tion of her plots and characters is too sketchy .  
Meanwhile , China 's painters , living amidst domestic turmoil and foreign invasion , felt the pressure of disappearing traditions . Forced to absorb the creative techniques and methods of the West , China 's painters devoted their efforts to the reform of traditional painting , seeking an East-West fusion of technique . The content of their paintings abounded in themes of ethnic consciousness . Western painting thus followed completely different courses of development in China and Taiwan .  
Ho Te-lai , born ten years after Liu , resisted the formulaic paintings of the competitions and for the greater part of his life shut himself up in Japan , where he joined the Shinkozo-Sha ( the " New Structure Society " ) school characterized by freedom and unrestricted direction . He remained faithful to his own thoughts , and to his personal creative device of inserting words into his paintings .  
Wu was ahead of her at school , so she has witnessed his long-term development . Back in school , Wu was a well-behaved child with a special classical quality to him . Then Chung saw him dancing in a loin cloth for the Cloud Gate Dance Theater , establishing the experimental Contemporary Legend Theater , and acting in movies and on television . His creative ability and experience made her feel that he was the best choice for Ah-Q .  
For the past eight years working in Hong Kong as a lecturer in Art and Design , I have believed quality of creative thinking has to be developed from awareness of our environment . Thus , I decided to come back to Malaysia to set up a children 's creative learning program . The main objective is to cultivate quality of thinking in children when they are still young .  
Grass huts offer people numerous advantages-they are convenient , flexible , simple , and can be made entirely from materials readily at hand . Li Juei-tsung , an associate professor of architecture and environmental design at the Chung-Hua Polytechnic Institute , suggests , " Thatched houses are the single greatest expression of the culture of ordinary people , and they are one of the great creative products of man and nature . It 's too bad they have been ignored in architectural history . "  
Hsu Yi-hsiung , the head of the graduate physical education program at National Taiwan Normal University , is unequivocal in stating that foreign research shows that children who are physically active and athletic are highly creative and more intelligent than average .  
In Western music , perhaps it 's only the composer who is creative , while all the rest are interpreters . In Chinese music , the creators are at every level , and the performers are especially important creators . It is " homogeneous evolution , " " looking for difference in homogeneity , looking for similarity in difference , " " common appreciation of the elite and the popular , stressing commonality over difference . " These seem to be simple , ordinary descriptions , but this is its real nature .  
They had a low level of culture and knowledge , thinking only to gain the maximum they could in the minimum amount of time . In his book 100 Years Ago , the author John Warner writes that they were ' conservative , vulgar , lacking creative abilities in literature , science , or art . ' Members of the British middle class who failed at home , they came to Hong Kong determined to either get rich or go bust . "  
" There does not need to be a conflict between the needs of urban development and historical building preservation , " says Tseng Shu-cheng , an assistant professor in Tamkang University 's Architecture Department . Preserving historic buildings or spaces is not intended to stop time and halt development . On the contrary it is intended to use their historical essence to make a new and creative use of the space .  
However , many artists are unwilling to let this 800-year-old Chinese folk tradition wither and die . In 1985 the Council for Cultural Planning and Development began an annual competition to select the best New Year 's prints . Each year many creative submissions combining tradition and contemporary styles are received , reflecting today 's actual mass culture .  
Shih himself has applied the right-brain concept to the commercial sphere . In the ideas about " business culture " that Shih put forward a number of years ago , he suggested that people are changed by emotional stimuli , not rational argument . This is very much in keeping with the right-brain concept . And in his " right-brain leadership " concept , put forward two years ago , Shih takes his approach a step further , proposing EQ-based , creative management .  
Whether you are making a film or making glass , the creative process can easily make you tense and worried , and this is likely to be reflected in the way you get along with others . So other people often used to find me irritable or restless . It was not until a few years ago , when I produced a series of modern Buddha figures in glass , that I gained an entirely new insight .  
Buddhism and Taoism seemed less useful than Confucianism in resolving worldly problems . Confucianism thus entered a period of creative transformation in order to meet external challenges to the state . Zhu Xi 's influence proved greater than that of other philosophers because of his work integrating various schools of thought , doing textual research , and annotating the classics . For example , prior to the Song dynasty , The Great Learning was not a very influential work in China .  
In the last few years , Buddhist music-in various guises ranging from traditional chanting to folk , rock and dance music-has made itself heard in every corner of Taiwan life . There is now even a Religious Music category at the annual Golden Melody Awards . But concern has been expressed that as Buddhist music extends its creative scope , the form is failing in its essential function of promoting salvation .  
But another music industry professional , MTV Taiwan 's programming and creative department supervisor Dennis Yang , has a different point of view . " It 's impossible to change the commercialization and unsophisticated taste of pop music , " he says . As for awards being given to Pur-dur and other similar artists , he feels it is good to encourage the creation of works with different creative perspectives . " But it 's still impossible to create a popular demand in the market for works that have lost contact with commercial taste . "  
However , Columbia University professor and literary critic Wang Dewei feels that Gao Xingjian is a highly innovative writer with original ideas , and that a combination of factors including his fame overseas , his literary status , his creative style and his accessibility surely make him a fitting choice to receive the prize , whether on behalf of Chinese authors or of writers in exile .  
Says Lin , " Because of the way the pieces are selected and the fact that most online readers are students , almost all the online works that get published in book format offer very realistic descriptions of school romance . I think these novels give young authors a chance to achieve a sense of closure in real-life romances gone wrong , and to use their experiences as a source of creative energy . " Lin feels that the popularity of such works is natural , since both the authors and readers are everyday people .  
Take Citicorp , for example . Although it has a good image , offers comprehensive financial services , and is creative with its management methods , it has been frustrated to find that its business has remained limited to foreign firms and members of the economic elite . It has continued to be unsuccessful in entering the mass market .  
His boss 's faith in his talents proved well founded , as Huang quickly injected wonderful creative touches to the small traditional ornaments that he carved . The proportions , expressions , and poses of his rendered subjects were always accurate , detailed , and lively , and never fell into the typical ruts . As a result , his boss began to let him design new products . Huang began to acquire a small reputation within the industry .  
And so , apart from designing and carving , when his fellow workers were off work and at leisure , Huang busied himself attending exhibitions and doing relevant research in the field . " I wanted , " Huang says , describing his individual creative aspirations , " to create my own creative vocabulary for jade carving that was suited to this brilliant , expansive and constantly evolving age . And I 've never wavered from working to accomplish this . "  
But chief editor Chuang Hui-chiu has done a masterful job of just that , spinning a broad tapestry that shows the interplay between individual emotions and collective experience . This she achieves by inviting contributions from over 30 persons from all walks of life who have played prominent roles in the gay movement over the past decade . By allowing each writer their own individual perspective , the book avoids the difficulties of historiography while providing students of social movements with a rigorous yet creative presentation of the facts .  
The participants were managers of publishing companies from Europe , the United States , and Japan . Speaking from direct experience , they emphasized that company size was not relevant to survival . Small companies have much greater room to publish creative publications . The operating principles that will always hold true for publishing houses are selecting the right works for publication and producing high quality books .  
Art critic Wang Chia-chi points out that Installation Art in Taiwan is basically written from the creative perspective of the artist , expressing both sympathy and empathy for the subject matter covered . As such , when Yao explains works , he strives to fathom the original creative intent of each artist . In consequence , the book has some commentary but is bereft of any clear , forceful critiques .  
Wang Dan 's identity gives his creative writing a free pass to the public , and even more to the mainstream media . But at the same time this also is a problem for him . It makes it unnecessary for him to pursue perfection in his literary life , and his obscure and emotional essay style readily reveals a literary technique that is not yet mature , and indeed a character that is equally childlike .  
Yet , while his improvements on traditional designs were meeting with great approval , they were n't satisfying his creative desires . From an early age he had been a great lover of painting and very familiar with historical folktales , so he decided to leave the ranks of craftsmen , breaking free from the shackles of tradition , and to adopt innovative styles using Western realism to create new works that more richly displayed a purely artistic creativity .  
" It 's the plainness of rice straw that attracts people to it , " says Kao Hsi-lin . " It gives rise to a desire for a natural , rustic life . " Kao is a vibrant man who builds installations , paints and studies creative media . After several years spent working on community building , he is now giving new life to rice straw , a material that the people of Jenju had previously thought of as a waste product .  
After finding the right tool , and keeping in mind that " it 's all a matter of controlling the force , " after countless broken eggs due to squeezing or pushing too hard , Kuan Chun-mai eventually developed his own creative " knife withdrawal technique " whereby an even , well distributed pressure is applied when withdrawing the knife point from the cut . The principle is roughly similar to the " cue withdrawal technique " used in billiards .  
Fortunately , after a decade of fighting the good fight , the kinds of books for women now available in mainstream bookstores are no longer limited to childcare and cooking . Moreover , now that there are so many venues for artistic and intellectual events , Fembooks is no longer indispensable for the spread of the ideas and creative work that it has long promoted . It seems that the bookshop 's mission , particular to its specific time and place in the history of feminism in Taiwan , has been accomplished .  
Perhaps the most common ceramic product was the teapot . After Taiwan 's economy started growing by leaps and bounds in the 1970s , enjoyment of fine teas became a popular pastime , and one for which the teapot was indispensable . A number of outstanding teapot masters appeared on the scene to meet the demand . Consciousness of the existence of pottery as an art , however , has led potters since the 1990s to look beyond the teapot and explore the other creative possibilities open to them .  
People doing modern ceramic art have always played down local culture , so I decided to seek creative motifs in my ethnic background . That fits in well with today 's emphasis on things rooted specifically in Taiwanese culture . " After embarking on his new path , Li at first made heavy use of the motifs appearing in traditional paintings used for celebrating Chinese New Year .  
Having decided to use gold as his creative medium , Wu set to work , using 99.99% pure gold that lacked the silver or copper that goldsmiths traditionally add to make welding easier ( but that in time cause oxidation , with the silver turning black and the copper green ) .  
Korea has seized the magic wand of the new economy-the cultural and creative industries-transforming its national image from that of the world 's most diligent and unbending people to that of the liveliest , most innovative and most adept at packaging cultural products .  
Liu Wei-kung , associate professor of sociology at Soochow University , says that rather than debate incessantly about the definition and scope of cultural and creative industries , it would be better to grasp the salient characteristic at their core , which is that content on its own is not enough . It 's extremely important that the product or service creates an appealing story that will pull people in , so as to give people a joyful experience in the process of consumption .  
Wu Se-hwa states that capital for cultural creative industries includes the following : copyrighted music , literature , fine arts and animation ; locations that can serve as the background for creativity , such as historic sites and natural scenery ; creative talent ; and language or customs that reveal the special flavor of an area .  
Chen Chi-nan , a minister without portfolio who is a leading figure in the push for cultural and creative industries , says that from inside to outside there are three key layers to cultural production : at the core are the arts ( the fine arts , theater , music , literature and so forth ) ; the second circle includes advertising design , architecture , the media and so forth ; and the outer circle represents extended services and tourism-this is the most easily commercialized portion .  
What 's more , various kinds of economic assistance , loans and insurance require real estate to be put up as collateral , but for creative and cultural industries , for which creativity and talented personnel represent their true capital , these requirements are entirely inappropriate .  
" In the past some licensing companies just did n't care and forced artists to sign licensing agreements that covered ' all ' of their works . And you know , this ' all ' included creative work done in the past , present and future . They really strongarmed them , " says Ivan Fan , deeply upset at this unfair treatment of the artists .  
Going from creative ideas to practical applications takes very pragmatic skills , like patient experimentation and testing , requiring total focus and concentration . As the classical poet Tao Yuan-ming declared , " When swept by a thought , I gladly forget to eat . " And Thomas Edison is said to have once absent-mindedly cooked his own watch rather than the egg he intended .  
Fifty thousand people came to the just-completed Science Exhibition Center during the three days of the exhibition . Adults and children alike personally experienced all kinds of dynamic and static activities , including small-scale interactive simulations , inventions , camps for creative exchanges between urban and rural students , and forums on the process of creative practice .  
Because of this , creative education has been established as a four-year pilot project with an annual budget of NT $ 60 million . In spirit , it will encourage diversification , differentiation , and maybe even a little rebellion and mischief . In practical terms , whether in innovation in educational methods , reform in educational materials , innovation in student performance or in reforming and restructuring campus spaces , any good ideas will receive support . And because this effort is a local , piecemeal , gradual bottom-up process , it will not encounter much opposition .  
Gourds would become a way of life , a creative lynchpin , and the foundation for making the village self-sufficient . Over the years , Kung Yi-fang has used his amazing imagination and selfless attitude to develop and teach his craft , successfully bringing art out of the constrictive world of glass display cases and into the real world . Through Kung 's works , more and more people are coming to appreciate the beauty inherent in even something as simple as a gourd .  
We live in an era of aesthetic sensibil-ity . The cultural economy and creative industries hold sway , and aesthetic sensibility has become a key determinant in individual , business , and national achievement .  
Based on these two criteria , the CEPD has compiled a list of 12 critical service industries for future development . These are : financial services ; research and development ; design ; cultural and creative services ; telecommunications and media ; medical , health care and caregiving ; engineering consulting ; information services ; distribution and transportation ; manpower training , manpower services and property management ; tourism , sporting and recreational services ; and environmental protection .  
In the era of the knowledge-based economy , ideas are the ultimate source of profits . However , Hsu has observed that Taiwanese children growing up under the rigid educational system have lost out on many opportunities for hands-on learning and learning by doing , making it very difficult to spark creative ideas .  
The United Nations system has proven to be a major mechanism at the international level , creative enough to put a common vision and a common approach into effect through multilateral cooperation combining collective action with respect for national sovereignty .  
The poverty alleviation programme aims to enable every Malawian to have access to basic necessities and to be able to develop and exploit his or her full potential to lead a productive , dignified and creative life through social , economic and political empowerment .  
The changes of the last decade in economic and political conditions and new consensuses reached during the recent series of conferences offer a unique opportunity to develop an intensified , strengthened and more realistic approach to such cooperation , but the opportunity may go to waste if we fail to shape a more efficient , creative and forward-looking United Nations . 
This implies the need for the development of creative partnerships among nations and between the public and private sectors , by means of which nations and institutions can establish collaborative ventures for technology transfer ; technology can then be acquired and adapted through conventional programmes , such as training , information exchange and access to patent information .  
In particular , the more economically advanced developing countries are in a position to transfer to other developing countries the skills and experience , including new and innovative techniques of industrial organization and production and the creative application of technology , that have proved so successful in increasing the productivity and competitiveness of their own economies .  
Political will , a flexible and gradual approach , a favourable economic environment , the involvement of the private sector and relevant sectors of civil society , appropriate institutional and physical infrastructure as well as creative networking were among the factors contributing to such success .  
Initiatives of the Group have included : the cost-sharing venture to finance a multi-sectoral AIDS study tour for concerned Cambodian government officials in Thailand ; encouragement to the Ministry of Information to take a more active and creative approach in its efforts to inform the Cambodian public ; and improving the coordination between the different United Nations agencies involved in combating the spread of the virus .  
The Group considered that the percentage of resources spent on the salaries of the skilled staff of ECLAC was fully justified , since at a time when great importance was attached to intellectual and creative work , the analytical and forward-looking studies undertaken by ECLAC were valuable and the data which it processed useful .

Mindful of the necessity to avoid a political impasse , it is essential that we all approach the process we are engaged in in a positive manner and continue to actively explore creative and constructive ideas on how to meet the various concerns involved .  
We agree to support ongoing and new creative partnerships , recognizing that indigenous people , youth and other disadvantaged and vulnerable groups possess in common the potential for diverse realization of full human development .  
Since the freedom of creative activity is regarded as a fundamental condition for the development of human rights in science and technology , the national research system , inspired by the Declaration of 7 November 1987 , has endeavoured to encourage the exercise of this freedom by means of an array of legal , administrative , jurisdictional and trade-union measures .  
The chairpersons further recommend that consideration be given to more creative approaches whereby several of the various procedural amendments to the human rights treaties could be packaged together in a single , comprehensive document to be transmitted to the States parties to allow them the option of invoking their constitutional amendment procedures only once for all the amendments .

He considered the creative freedom for women to express themselves , to create and nourish culture and to bring into the light suffering that stays hidden because of societal taboos an essential means to overcome the many manifestations of the use of violence against women , which can negatively affect their enjoyment of the right of freedom of opinion and expression .  
Public programming explicitly designed to reduce stigma has been shown to help create a supportive environment which is more tolerant and understanding .  [ 1 ] / The reach of such programming should be a mixture of general and focused programmes using various media , including creative and dramatic presentations , compelling ongoing information campaigns for tolerance and inclusion and interactive educational workshops and seminars .  
Against this background , allow me to defend the global approach which offers us the advantage of being more rational because it avoids piecemeal perceptions , wiser because it allows for the establishment of the balances necessary in any negotiations , and finally fairer because it does not marginalize anyone ; quite the contrary , it rejects measures that are not lasting and calculations that are narrow and brings all those involved together in the same creative synergy .

After extensive consultations , the Minister for Foreign Affairs informed me that , since no additional resources had been authorized under resolution 1111 ( 1997 ) , the needs of vulnerable groups would be met outside the framework of the resolution .  I am glad to report that the United Nations has been creative in preparing the plan for the three northern governorates and was able to increase the resources for some key sectors through reallocations within the total amount of funds available .  
Since governmental and non-governmental organizations and individuals have important roles to play in ensuring that human rights are respected , national human rights education strategies and plans of action should be developed and implemented by a creative mixture of all of such entities .  These Guidelines are not intended as a blueprint for a nationally coordinated effort in human rights education .

Anyone who visits the famous museums in Europe and the Americas will see many works of art and valuable manuscripts exquisitely wrought by the artistic creative hands of Arab Libyans , who left behind a great historical heritage which was looted and scattered around the world by the colonial Powers , which stripped away many of its most important features .  The Arab Libyans laid the foundations of ancient , prehistoric civilizations .  
Bearing in mind those facts and the requirements of our national societies in an international context that is marked by globalization and the interdependence of the phenomena affecting it , and recognizing that it is difficult for the Central American countries to deal with them individually , we must be more creative in order to ensure that our political and economic integration at the international level will be positive in terms of our goals of democratization and sustainable development .  
The international community has acknowledged the extraordinary foresight of the authors of the Tlatelolco Treaty , who responded , in an intelligent and creative manner , to the challenge posed by the danger of nuclear proliferation by drafting an international legal instrument that has become an inspiration and a model for other countries wishing to establish nuclear-weapon-free zones .  
Also requests the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization to extend appropriate assistance to Governments in designing and setting up programmes to encourage the creative , artistic and intellectual potential of children with disabilities , and through its regional offices , to conduct seminars and workshops to provide appropriate training in those fields to teachers , parents , social workers and others concerned ;

Given the difficult financial situations faced by many Member States , however , he called on UNRWA to explore creative measures to alleviate its financial difficulties through alternative sources of income such as contributions from the private sector and expanded joint programmes with international organizations .  
Scientific and technical progress is never used for purposes that are incompatible with the enjoyment of any human rights , including every individual 's right to life , health , liberty of person and privacy .  On the contrary , full support and encouragement is given to every materially and mentally creative innovator through the organization of annual specialized exhibitions for this purpose .

The internal movement of the capitalist economy was stressed by Marx and Schumpeter alike , who shared the idea of the ambivalent effects of such perpetual change , that appeared as both creative and destructive ( although they differed as to its causes and in their evaluation of the balance between creation and destruction ) .  
The ambivalence in capitalist development analysed by great theoreticians has in general been confirmed by historical experience : positive and negative , creative and destructive , beneficial and detrimental features are combined in this system , and their relative weights have been changing at different times and in different national and international contexts .  
The formation of a global information space , which is transforming information into a precious strategic resource , unquestionably opens up broad horizons for increasing the creative potential of mankind and presents favourable circumstances and conditions for the harmonious development of world civilization .
