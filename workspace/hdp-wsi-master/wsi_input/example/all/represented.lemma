The cold war , represented by the zero-sum game mentality , where some gain at the expense of others , is giving way to more positive trends and constructive attitudes , driven by the realities of an increasingly interdependent world based on advancing the interests of all .  
The assignment of costs for the Qana incident to one Member State represented an unwelcome departure from established principles as it attributed political responsibility , although the relevant political bodies of the Organization had not done so ; moreover , it ran contrary to the principle of collective responsibility .  
That occupation represented one of the ugliest forms of occupation in contemporary history , involving expansionist policies and practices , especially in East Jerusalem ; illegal Israeli colonial settlements ; usurpation and exploitation of Palestinian natural resources ; and the building of infrastructure separate from that available to the Palestinian people , all of which represented a unique mixture of colonialism and apartheid-like arrangements .  
Given the serious consequences of the problem as described above , this is a promising time to analyse the small arms and light weapons in use in recent conflicts , the nature and causes of their accumulation and transfer , as well as to recommend to Member States , regional organizations and the international community as a whole , particularly as represented by the United Nations , practical measures to prevent and reduce the excessive and destabilizing accumulation and transfer of such weapons , with a view to diminishing their role in exacerbating conflicts .  
It guided the substantive preparations for the twentieth special session of the General Assembly on the world drug problem , held in New York from 8 to 10 June 1998 , which represented a major landmark in international efforts to achieve a drug-free world .  
Such assistance represented 8.4 per cent of its gross national product , one of the highest rates in the world , and reflected its concern to raise the standard of living of the developing countries by helping to strengthen their economic infrastructure .  
The statement in the World Drug Report that the trade in illicit drugs represented approximately 8 per cent of total international trade and constituted one of the most profitable ways of becoming wealthy , was alarming .  
It was now possible to face the future with a degree of realistic optimism , especially as the economic indicators during the current decade represented a clear improvement over previous decades in terms of growth , trade and direct foreign investment .  
The Department had given special attention to the emerging role of civilian police in peacekeeping operations , which represented a new dimension of the efforts to respond effectively to the complex problems posed by civil conflict .  
What is being sought is for the international community , represented by the Conference on Disarmament and the NPT , to have focused deliberations on the practical steps for systematic and progressive efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons .  
The democratic process is not being paralysed by the war : it was already paralysed and the constitutional drafts that have been prepared are not satisfactory to the large majorities which are still represented in the National Sovereign Conference and are , of course , likely to be changed by another authentic national agreement .  
Concerning external debt , the agreed formulations on problems relating to debt workouts by countries hit by financial crisis and on the slow progress in the implementation of the World Bank / IMF HIPC initiative represented a significant advance in international consensus on the subject .  
As a result , a considerable proportion of the biological diversity most in need of protection has not been protected ; existing data on the worlds protected areas suggests that evergreen sclerophyllous , temperate and boreal forests are generally poorly represented .  
His country therefore welcomed the outcome of the intensive negotiations held in September and October 1998 and was convinced that the current draft convention represented a positive development with respect to the international communitys endeavours to prepare a universally accepted instrument to curb or eliminate the threat of nuclear terrorism .

Second , it was important to understand that , in addition to international instruments , the value systems of individual societies represented another basic means of protecting children in armed conflicts , since one of the main objectives of any society had always been the protection of children , who were its most vulnerable members .  
Since an international organization , represented by its highest-ranking administrative officer , can in most cases conclude treaties with one or more States or with another international organization , it must be assumed that such an organization , represented by such an officer , can , in accordance with its internal rules , formulate unilateral legal acts which would no doubt be considered to belong to the category of acts that the Commission is now studying .  
In many countries , the United Nations ( resident coordinator / UNDP resident representative ) , the World Bank or often the two together convene meetings with donor and national government representatives to exchange information on current and planned programmes and discuss critical policy issues .  In some countries which use the consultative group mechanism , the resident coordinator chairs regular meetings of locally represented donors , while the World Bank convenes the consultative group itself .  
However , even the view that considered unilateral acts conflicting with any norm of general international law as invalid , maintained that unilateral acts designed to bring about a change in existing international law - President Trumans declaration on the continental shelf in 1946 being one example - represented a separate problem that the Special Rapporteur ought perhaps to consider .  
It was agreed that the informal consultations between the focal points of small island developing States and prospective donors represented in New York that had been initiated prior to the meeting should continue with a view to discussing the issues raised during the meeting .

Mr . Wehbe ( Syrian Arab Republic ) said that his delegation viewed draft resolution A / C . 3 / 54 / L . 8 , which advocated abolition of the death penalty , as a flagrant violation of the principle of mutual respect for the sovereignty of States and of non-interference in their internal affairs .  It represented an attempt to force other States to change their political , judicial , social and cultural structures .  
Governments had expressed their determination to advance the negotiations , but the political will had been insufficient to put aside the purely economic and commercial interests and give priority to the potential risks that living modified organisms represented for health and for the conservation of the planets biological diversity .  
Socialism had different related meanings : it represented an intellectual trend based on the critique of the developing bourgeois society ; it was the expression of a political and social movement aiming at reforms , influence or power ; and it referred to an ideal economic and social system intended to replace and overcome capitalism and its perceived flaws .  
The importance of Cairo + 5 has been underscored by the intensive preparatory process for this special session , which notably involved very active participation by civil society through non-governmental organizations and , specifically , many which represented adolescents , one of the main social groups that are beneficiaries of the Cairo Programme of Action .

They represented a suitable codification of customary law on the subject , while including innovative elements aimed at ensuring that the regime governing State responsibility was fair in the light of new realities in international relations .  
The true impact of the meeting would become apparent in the months ahead , but UNDP was confident that the meeting represented a major step towards regaining for its work the political support and attention that it deserved .  
It was a memorable occasion , but it was not complete or conclusive , because a very important issue was left pending , which is what brings us together today and what Mexico warmly welcomes : the adoption by the General Assembly of the Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms , Their Parts and Components and Ammunition , an instrument that completes the legal body represented by the Convention and its additional Protocols .  
The view was expressed that the consideration of this regular item represented an innovation that had opened the door for an increased interest in the work of the Subcommittee of international organizations engaged in space activities and their active contribution to the progressive development of space law .  
In total , the Organization owned , or leased at nominal cost , some 175 hectares of land and 1.1-million square metres of building floor area , which represented a major physical asset , since their replacement value was more than $ 5 billion .  
They represented a broad range of strategic approaches to UNICEF cooperation , and reflected and incorporated major national priorities and often the strategic goals of the United Nations system as expressed through the UNDAF , where it existed .  
The Subcommittee agreed that the draft Unidroit convention on international interests in mobile equipment and the preliminary draft protocol thereto on matters specific to space property represented an important initiative that was of considerable interest to member States .

The representative of Venezuela stated that the points of view expressed during the Seminar provided an important reference for the Special Committee since they represented a key source of up-to-date knowledge and information that demonstrated the close relationship between the political , economic and social variables in every territory under consideration .  
Synergy and complementarity of the action taken by the various agencies will be decisive in mobilizing sufficient funds both to meet the challenges represented by the problems of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to seize the opportunities offered by the new political , economic and military situation .  The strategy for ending the crisis itself must combine humanitarian action and intervention for the purpose of rehabilitation and development .  
The end of the internal armed conflict and of an institutional policy that violated human rights represented a qualitative and quantitative improvement .  
On a prior occasion , the Republic of Panama , by means of a note dated 10 September 1998 , signed by its then Permanent Representative to the United Nations , Ambassador Aquilino E . Boyd , stated to you that the Republic of China acquires rights and contracts obligations under international law , is subject to universal norms on numerous subjects and acts in the international arena in the same manner as States represented in the United Nations system .

Beyond the escalation represented by the legislation known as the Torricelli and the Helms-Burton acts , together with the additional measures adopted towards the end of 2000 as part of the Cuba blockade policy , the fact that a new Administration with recognized ties to the Miami terrorist groups has taken office has only increased the danger that the unilateral measures and the brutal war directed against the Cuban people will be intensified .
