Amid a wave of criticisms , Tang Yao-ming , chief of the general staff of the Taiwan military , had no choice but to hold an urgent news conference on 7 July .

Only evaluating " horses " will be tantamount to give the power of initiative on personnel training to history , making the difficult process of personnel training a process of living or dying without external interference .

P'an Chia-yu , instructor of Taiwan 's " Armed Forces University " , pointed out : If the PLA adopts the sudden attack strategy against Taiwan , the United States can respond only with its current cambat capability .  Without long-ranch fighters and forward bases , the United States has very limited capability to counter the PLA 's attack on Taiwan . In a modern war that emphasizes quick decision , US rescue to Taiwan would be too slow to meet the urgent need when the PLA launches an attack on Taiwan .

Following the growth of the DPP in Taiwan 's political arena , " Taiwan independence " thinkers seem to have felt that the simple slogan of " democracy and human rights " is rather of the grass roots , not comprehensive and profound enough , and difficult to attain the purpose of " winning maximum popular support . "  Besides , an extremely urgent matter for Chen Shui-bian after his inauguration is the debate over reunification and independence , which " democracy and human rights " seem unable to eliminate .  
He said : While globalization is developing rapidly , the global management system is obviously lagging behind .

But this is not direct " three links " in a true sense and can not satisfy the strong wish and urgent demand of the public on both sides .  Furthermore , it lags behind the objective situation where the exchange of visits , economic interaction , and trade between the two sides have been steadily growing .  
Shortly after the Taiwan authorities started their so-called " mini three links , " the Kuomintang and the New Party separately dispatched their " three links " delegations to visit Beijing and expressed their discontent at the Taiwan authorities ' dilatory and perfunctory practice toward the " three links . "  This also shows that only complete and direct " three links " can really satisfy the urgent needs of the people on both sides of the strait .

"  This was not direct " three links " in real terms , and could not meet the strong desire and the urgent need of the people on both sides of the strait .

At the same time , recent scientific findings , as contained in the Second Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , confirmed that the global climate was undergoing changes as a result of human activities and that it was increasingly urgent to take consistent precautionary action .  
In the short term , there was an urgent need for additional financial resources to alleviate human suffering and environmental damage and to find solutions to the political problems that caused population displacements .

Bangladesh strongly felt that the independent status of major information centres should be maintained and where necessary restored , and expected the Department of Public Information to take urgent action in respect of the Centre in Dhaka and nominate a director for the Centre . 89 .  Bangladesh attached the highest priority to freedom of speech and the media , in the belief that democracy , development and peace were integrally related and that the free flow of information was an essential component of democracy .  
The fourth preambular paragraph should read " Commending the High Commissioner and her staff for the competent , courageous and dedicated manner in which they discharge their responsibilities , " and a new fifth preambular paragraph should be inserted , to read : " Paying tribute to those staff members who had endangered or lost their lives , and emphasizing the urgent need for effective measures to ensure the security of staff engaged in humanitarian operations , " .

The Heads of State again emphasize the special importance of developing and extracting the rich natural resources of their countries , in the first instance natural gas , petroleum and hydro-energy resources , and called for urgent measures to conduct joint projects for laying pipelines and electricity transmission lines to deliver energy to world markets , with the involvement in these projects of the States concerned , international financial institutions and State and private structures .  
Notes that the recent heavily indebted poor countries initiative represents a step towards assisting countries with substantial debt problems , while stressing the urgent need to ensure an expeditious , flexible , constructive and full implementation of the initiative that is in line with the need for comprehensive approaches ;  
Reaffirms the pressing need of developing countries for official development assistance and the urgent need for the industrialized countries to substantially increase that assistance so as to reach the internationally agreed target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for official development assistance as soon as possible ;

I had specified , however , that this plan was being seriously jeopardized by the total economic embargo imposed against Burundi , and I had stressed the urgent need to lift this embargo to allow our country to participate in this important humanitarian operation in many ways , such as by making available the Bujumbura international airport , the hospitals and modern hotels of the capital , the social centres and other reception facilities , the road networks and , especially , hospital and medical personnel .  
Recalling also that , in order to promote development , equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Considering in particular the fact that , in order to respond to those urgent humanitarian needs , the Government of the Comoros , in the absence of other resources , had to reallocate as a matter of great urgency a major part of the budget required for the functioning of the State and the financial resources normally devoted to vital economic and social programmes ,  
In order to address these concerns and to reach the goal of economically efficient , socially balanced and ecologically sound sustainable forest management , the experts call upon the Governments , private sector and investment community , multilateral international organizations , non-governmental organizations and the voluntary sector to recognize their shared responsibility and to take urgent action as follows :  
Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island developing States and landlocked countries ,

Stresses the urgent need to continue trade liberalization in developed and developing countries , including liberalization through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries , and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;

Reaffirms the urgent need for the international community to strive for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , an increase in the share of funding for social development programmes commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development ;  
Closely related to the follow-up and implementation of this Agenda is the urgent need for an integrated , interrelated and coherent implementation and follow-up at the national , subregional , regional , and international levels of the recommendations and commitments of recent United Nations major conferences and agreements on development .  
That desire becomes even more urgent given that the boundless mind of man has produced numerous miraculous inventions , opening up a new era called the post-industrial era or the information age , while more than a quarter of the developing world 's population still lives in poverty , some 840-million go hungry or face food insecurity , and even in industrial countries more than 100-million people live below the poverty line and 37-million are jobless . 
The need for that assistance and support remains urgent amid the current difficult circumstances faced by the Palestinian people of the occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip , in view of the stagnation of the peace process and Israeli coercive measures , including closures and restrictions on the movement of workers and commodities to and from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip which represent an additional burden increasing the suffering of the Palestinian people .  
The ICRC is particularly concerned with emergency situations arising from armed conflict and internal violence , which are often marked by widespread and urgent needs among the civilian population and by the breakdown of political , economic and civic institutions .  
And for peace to be truly meaningful it must also be translated into concrete improvements in the living conditions of the long-suffering Palestinian people ; hence , there is an urgent need for economic , financial and technical assistance by the international community .  
The latest initiative to Judaize East Jerusalem with the building of a new Jewish settlement on Arab land in Jebel Abu Ghneim , in a highly symbolic place , is a deliberate provocation in the light of the relevant resolutions adopted by overwhelming majority of the international community at the two urgent meetings of the General Assembly and at its emergency special session .  
It bears in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and achieving national reconciliation in Tajikistan and the ability of the country to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to take effective steps towards the rapid revitalization of the economy .  It reaffirms the urgent need to assist Tajikistan in its efforts to restore basic services and the infrastructure of the country .  
While my delegation is deeply concerned about the problem of nuclear disarmament , at a practical level it is also convinced of the need for urgent and decisive action to curtail the illicit trafficking in small arms .  
Bearing in mind paragraph 50 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , 8 the first special session devoted to disarmament , calling for the urgent negotiation of agreements for the cessation of the qualitative improvement and development of nuclear-weapon systems , and for a comprehensive and phased programme with agreed time-frames , wherever feasible , for progressive and balanced reduction of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery , leading to their ultimate and complete elimination at the earliest possible time ,  
The urgent appeal procedure is not per se accusatory , but essentially preventive in nature and purpose .  The Government concerned is merely requested to look into the matter and to take steps aimed at protecting the right to physical and mental integrity of the person concerned , in accordance with the international human rights standards .  
The Committee considers that it is urgent , as a preventive measure , to change the gender selective approach in the law ; to develop educational courses to empower women ; to educate police personnel ; to introduce gender sensitive courses for judges , public prosecutors and lawyers ; to increase the number of shelters for battered women with children ; and to mobilize the media to introduce regular programmes on the negative consequences of violence .  
Considering the long lead times involved in the implementation of energy efficiency measures and in the effective penetration of renewable energy sources in the global energy supply mix , the current trends in power-market restructuring and liberalization worldwide , and the long lifetime of capital equipment , a reappraisal of energy systems with an emphasis on modern technologies is an urgent priority .  
At the Workshop , which was held in the form of a free discussion , the participants agreed on the urgent need to protect those who were exposed to extreme suffering resulting from a lack of sufficient protection .  
With a view to finding durable and concrete solutions to the problem of the sale and commercial sexual exploitation of children , the Special Rapporteur is making an urgent appeal to Governments , non-governmental organizations , and all concerned agencies and individuals , to keep her informed on a regular and sustained basis of developments in matters under her mandate , including specific situations of child abuse in any country .  
Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island developing States and landlocked countries ,  
Those topics should be related to the most urgent problems , demanding concerted action of particular importance , such as the struggle against transnational organized crime and terrorism , which had a detrimental impact on the full enjoyment of human rights and constituted a serious danger to peace and security , at both the national and international levels .  
Stresses the urgent need to continue trade liberalization in developed and developing countries , including liberalization through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Reaffirms the urgent need for the international community to strive for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , an increase in the share of funding for social development programmes commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development ;  
This should include appropriate delegation of authority , enhancement of the capacity of the staff through training and the provision of a stable resource base to ensure the continuous presence of an institutional critical mass .  A first step in that direction would be for Headquarters to provide urgent assistance by assigning to Nairobi for one month a senior administrator with proven experience in the establishment and functioning of United Nations common services outputs ( SP-96-001-19 ) .  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Recalling also that , in order to promote development , equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
We are greatly encouraged by the fact that the member countries of the European Union are fully committed to this goal and that the United Nations General Assembly , with 150 votes in favour and none against , adopted last fall a resolution in which urgent and vigorous measures for the conclusion of an effective , legally binding international agreement leading to a comprehensive ban on the use , stockpiling , production and transfer of APLMs are called for .  
There is an urgent need to strengthen democratic and participatory processes for planning and implementing sustainable development so as to involve all concerned social groups at the local , national , regional and international levels .  
There is an urgent need to increase economic incentives for sustainable development based on full and comprehensive pricing that reflects all economic , social and environmental externalities , with targeted and explicit subsidies , where necessary , to prevent social dislocations and hardships for the disadvantaged .  
The Commission stressed the urgent need for renewed efforts at both national and international levels to make trade and environmental policies mutually supportive and , more generally , to promote sustainable development , including by designing and implementing positive measures and by providing effective economic incentives .  
This concern has found expression at the meetings , seminars and study groups held in various parts of the world that have considered the grievous suffering caused by the sanctions and by the embargo and that have addressed urgent appeals to the United Nations and the international community as a whole for action to lift the sanctions imposed on the Iraqi people and to enable that people , through the use of its own resources and capacities , to secure the provision of its basic civilian needs . 
Taking into consideration the modest financial capabilities of the State , in this short period it has been impossible to supply the appropriate equipment and arms for the armed forces of the Republic of Macedonia at a level that would provide for an appropriate initial reaction or a possible urgent military action ;  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , economic and sexual exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance and disability , and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Also calls upon the Government of Guatemala to continue , on the basis of the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace and in accordance with its timetable , to adopt and develop concrete measures against extreme poverty , using national resources and with international support , with a view to enabling the population to attain better living standards , giving priority to economic and social development programmes which respond adequately to the most urgent needs of the Guatemalan people in general and the indigenous communities in particular ;  
They have done so in the context of the urgent need for understanding by non-indigenous societies of the spiritual , social , cultural , economic and political significance of lands , territories and resources to the continued survival and vitality of indigenous societies .  
In most cases , the Committee determined that merely to report the adoption of urgent security measures ( implying severe restrictions on the functioning of institutions and the exercise of human rights ) , on the ground of the alleged existence of a state of emergency , was not sufficient , in conformity with the terms of article 4 of the Covenant , to invoke the right of derogation provided for in strictly defined cases .  
The Secretary stressed that the urgent need for , and potential costs of , additional office space would be among the most important matters to be addressed during the remainder of 1997 and in the long-term concept paper on administrative arrangements to be presented to the Board in 1998 .  31 .  The Secretary also indicated that the inevitable result of changing significantly the administrative arrangements between the Fund and the United Nations would be a substantial increase in the administrative expenses to be charged against the resources of the Fund .  
Recognizing the profound spiritual , cultural , social and economic relationship that indigenous peoples have to their total environment and the urgent need to respect and recognize the rights of indigenous peoples to their lands , territories and resources ,  
Natural disasters , which brought devastation to the small island States in particular , also had a severe impact at the global level and required urgent action by the international community and the transfer of adequate technical and scientific knowledge .  
It had also urged all countries , particularly the developed countries , to strengthen their efforts to create a more favourable international economic environment , in particular a more open agricultural trading system which would stimulate food production and productivity in developing countries , and in that context had stressed the importance of the urgent and full implementation of the agreements contained in the Final Act of the Uruguay Round . 50 .  The world currently had the ability to produce enough food for all of humanity .  
His delegation wished to reiterate that in order to achieve global food security , sustainable productive agriculture and the alleviation and eradication of poverty , developed and developing countries alike must cooperate with a view to the urgent and full implementation of the agreements contained in the Uruguay Round , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 49 / 103 .  
Concerted efforts are therefore required by all forces that believe in peace so as to thwart those hostile to peace and prepare on an urgent basis for the resumption of negotiations on all tracks in accordance with the terms of reference accepted by international consensus , approved by all the parties concerned without exception and based on the steps taken thus far with the blessing of the peoples of the region . 
Following the rapid and massive return of refugees in late 1996 and early 1997 , UNICEF focused on quickly expanding essential services in Rwanda , such as health , nutrition , education and social services , to meet the urgent needs of returning children . 
Africa now needs to address three main requirements : first , the striving for the peaceful settlement of conflicts occurring in a number of its regions , as well as for urgent solutions to the problems of refugees ; secondly , the achievement of economic and social development and the enhancement of integration , both at the level of the continent as a whole and on the level of subregional groupings ; and thirdly , the turn to democratization and to the respect for human rights by African communities .

Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Further recalling that in order to promote development equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and achieving national reconciliation in Tajikistan and the ability of the country to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to take effective steps towards the rapid revitalization of the economy , and reaffirming the urgent need to assist Tajikistan in its efforts to restore basic services and the infrastructure of the country ,  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations , and which contravene the basic principles of the multilateral trading system ;  
To respond to those urgent humanitarian needs , the Government , lacking other resources , had to redeploy , on an emergency basis , a major part of the State budget and financial resources normally devoted to vital economic and social programmes .  
We continue to draw vital sustenance from what is , after all , a West Indian partnership rooted in a shared love for , and practice of , democracy , a democracy that is not resting on its laurels , but that is engaged now in a process of revitalization based on the urgent search for collective economic security and social advance .  
In the context of these changes , and more than half a century after the United Nations was established , there is an urgent need for the Organization to undergo drastic reforms , both structural and functional , so as to establish rules and principles for a new international order free of double standards .  
The interdependence of the situation emerging in Central Asia , the common European security system taking shape and the outlook for developing situations within the vast Asian continent means there is an urgent need for the international community to take measures to ensure durable peace and stability in this region along with its sustainable development .  
In this spirit , it is essential and urgent that the international community strive for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , and an increase in the share of funding for social development programmes commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development . 
Based on a comprehensive analysis of the social situation at the global level as the reason for convening the Summit , the Declaration reckoned that there existed an urgent need to address profound social problems , especially poverty , unemployment and social exclusion , and that our societies must respond more effectively to the material and spiritual needs of individuals , their families and their communities .  
For the East Asian region , which has been subjected to extreme volatility of currency and stock markets , the urgent need for critical regulatory safeguards in respect of international financial markets is unambiguous .  
This situation calls for urgent legal and humanitarian measures to establish a comprehensive global legal system banning all kinds of anti-personnel mines and to allay the pain and suffering caused to innocent civilians by the mines , which impede the social and economic activities of these peoples .  
The urgent appeal addressed to States in operative paragraph 1 must be clearly focused on the specific objective of eliminating the irresponsible and indiscriminate use of anti-personnel landmines , which , in the final analysis , is the real cause of the problems regarding such weapons .  
In Japan , the urgent need to reduce fiscal deficits , given the sharp increase in public debt and the future obligations of the Government to finance burgeoning social security payments , is likely to prevent the fiscal authorities from adopting any new major measures to stimulate demand ; but , even if the Government were to attempt to stimulate demand , the long-term effects of public spending increases would not be expected to be high .  
Although the international community seems to be slowly becoming more understanding concerning the need to clarify the fate and whereabouts of missing persons by means of exhuming and identifying mortal remains , and therefore more responsive to the fund raising appeals , there is still an urgent need for considerably greater contributions to finance the comprehensive programme of forensic activities requested by the Commission on Human Rights in paragraph 34 ( a ) of resolution 1996 / 71 .  
The Government of Mexico , given the incidents in Riverside County , California , in March and April 1996 when Mexican nationals were beaten and some lost their lives , has expressed its indignation to its United States counterpart and forcefully condemned violations of its nationals ' human rights , stating that the clear abuse of authority displayed in those incidents confirms the urgent need for determined action to stamp out discriminatory attitudes which spill over into acts of institutional violence .  
When substantial amounts of money are embezzled by dishonest officials , there is an indirect effect on the economic , social and cultural rights of the people , whose urgent needs might have been partially met with the unlawfully appropriated sums .

Given that many countries , particularly in the developing world , lack adequate institutional capacity in hazardous waste management and in monitoring illegal imports of chemical and hazardous wastes , there is an urgent need for strengthening national capacity for the effective management of such wastes .  
The Workshop strongly recommends that a regional technical cooperation programme be designed and implemented as a matter of urgent priority in partnership with the Centre for Human Rights of the United Nations , under its technical cooperation programme , with a view to facilitating the sharing of experience , expertise and best practices within the region to further enhance national and regional human rights capacities .  
Considering , in particular , that in order to respond to those urgent humanitarian needs the Government of the Comoros , in the absence of other resources , had to reallocate as a matter of great urgency the major part of the budget required for the functioning of the State and the financial resources normally devoted to vital economic and social programmes ,

All human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ; equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
The Commission stressed the urgent need for renewed efforts at both the national and international levels to make trade and environmental policies mutually supportive and , more generally , to promote sustainable development , including by designing and implementing positive measures and by providing effective economic incentives .  
I would just like to mention several items deserving of careful consideration at this essential stage of the preparations : the urgent installation of the independent Electoral Commission and the reconstituted Supreme Court ; the registration of voters ; and the return of refugees and I would like to stress that this is indispensable for the credibility of the entire electoral process .

P'an Chia-yu , instructor of Taiwan 's " Armed Forces University " , pointed out : If the PLA adopts the sudden attack strategy against Taiwan , the United States can respond only with its current cambat capability .

Following the growth of the DPP in Taiwan 's political arena , " Taiwan independence " thinkers seem to have felt that the simple slogan of " democracy and human rights " is rather of the grass roots , not comprehensive and profound enough , and difficult to attain the purpose of " winning maximum popular support . "  Besides , an extremely urgent matter for Chen Shui-bian after his inauguration is the debate over reunification and independence , which " democracy and human rights " seem unable to eliminate .  
He said : While globalization is developing rapidly , the global management system is obviously lagging behind .

They still obstinately insisted on Lee Teng-hui 's [ Li Denghui ] " no haste , be patient " policy , saying one thing about cross-strait direct " three links " and meaning another , completely lacking sincerity .  
Recently , compelled by the situation , they lifted the ban on direct cargo shipping and visitor traffic between Kinmen-Matsu and the coastal areas of Fujian . But this is not direct " three links " in a true sense and can not satisfy the strong wish and urgent demand of the public on both sides .  Furthermore , it lags behind the objective situation where the exchange of visits , economic interaction , and trade between the two sides have been steadily growing .  
Shortly after the Taiwan authorities started their so-called " mini three links , " the Kuomintang and the New Party separately dispatched their " three links " delegations to visit Beijing and expressed their discontent at the Taiwan authorities ' dilatory and perfunctory practice toward the " three links . "  This also shows that only complete and direct " three links " can really satisfy the urgent needs of the people on both sides of the strait .  
Being forced by the development of the situation , the Taiwan authorities could not but make such an " opening . "  This was not direct " three links " in real terms , and could not meet the strong desire and the urgent need of the people on both sides of the strait .  Such an action lagged far behind the objective situation in which personnel exchanges and economic and trade exchanges between the two sides are increasing drastically day by day .
