Chen Jianwen , the researcher responsible for this research explained that X-ray computerized tomography ( CT ) is usually used in clinical medicine to determine the pathology of a biological tissue .  Nonetheless , compared with a normal tissue , the difference of absorbing the X-ray by an initial cancerous tissue is extremely small , making it impossible to reflect the absorption on an image .  Thus , it is very difficult to diagnose an initial stage cancer .  
It is said there was one hour of heavy rainfall over the airport between 8:00-9:00am on the 10th , accompanied by thunderstorm and strong wind .  It was impossible to guarantee normal taking off and landing of flights with such weather .  Affected by this , over 2,000 passengers in total were held up on that day .  
If any grave turn occurs in Taiwan leading to the separation of Taiwan from China in any name , if Taiwan is invaded and occupied by a foreign country , and if the Taiwan authorities refuse , sine die , the peaceful settlement of cross-strait reunification through negotiation , it will then be impossible to have peaceful reunification and the Chinese Government will only be forced to adopt necessary measures to smash the separatist scheme for " Taiwan independence " and safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
Deputy Wang Yumei , 26-year-old " king breeder of rabbits " and general manager of the Jinan Lushe Rabbit Breeding Corporation , expressed a compassion of innocence in her remarks : " Without the party 's policy on encouraging the people to attain prosperity and the relaxed environment that encourages the development of various economic undertakings under different types of ownership , it would be impossible for me to transform , within 10 years , a small breeding farm with a few workers into a corporation whose current assets are worth 56 million yuan . "  
It seems that the United States is only accustomed to a relationship in which it gives the orders and other countries obey , and is not yet accustomed to living on equal terms with other countries ; it is only accustomed to living in an impossible uniform world regulated by itself , and is not yet accustomed to living in the real pluralistic world .  
But with unfavorable terrain and weather conditions , it was impossible to effectively attack mobile tactical targets and concealed targets at such altitudes , let alone tell genuine and false targets apart .  
The number one men of the party and government occupy the key position in the leadership groups and shoulder heavy responsibilities ; if supervision over them is lost , they will become privileged figures without control or constraint , which will result in suggestions being stifled , criticism being suppressed , and healthy trends suffering setbacks , and it will be impossible to curb the phenomena of corruption .  
They are satisfied only with their selfish desire and small farmer 's mentality .  They merely keep a close watch on the little bit of interests before their eyes , and set themselves against cadres .  It is outright impossible to carry forward undertakings at the grass-roots level . "  
The ossified " Soviet model " took the experience and development course of socialist construction under a special historical condition as something absolute and sacred without regard to the need to make continuous innovations inside socialism across different stages of development .  As a result , this seriously hindered the development of productivity , made it impossible to improve the people 's living conditions over a long time , and went against the requirements determined by the nature of socialism .  
Today , as the world economy has become increasingly globalized , with all countries prospering or declining as one , the rich countries of the north will ultimately get themselves burnt and find it impossible to maintain " lasting prosperity " if they allow the widening digital gap and disregard the extreme misery of the vast numbers of countries in the south .  
By saying that we should dare to say something new not mentioned by the old ancestors , he meant that as the times are moving ahead and practice is developing , new conditions and new issues will emerge in an endless stream , and it is impossible to find ready-made answers and solutions for our current issues from the works of the old ancestors .  We must work out solutions by ourselves by integrating the universal principles of Marxism with our current conditions and practice through studying new conditions , answering new questions , and blazing new trails .  
Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " cult constantly spread rumors to confuse the people and make trouble in violation of the law .  Their evil intention is to create chaos in China and to undermine social stability , making it impossible for the masses of the people to work , study , and live normally , disrupting economic construction , which is a central task , and then proceeding to realize their political scheme of overthrowing the CPC leadership and changing the socialist system in China .  
In recent years , he has rounded up practitioners through this organizational system and has instigated his followers to carry out illegal activities , to willingly act as political tools for western anti-China forces , to try and execute impossible missions for these hostile foreign forces , and to severely interfere with proper social order .  In doing so , he has created a significant political backlash , and has fully exposed his vicious ulterior scheme to create social chaos .  
In the face of the ever-changing international situation and intense international competition , without a lofty idea , firm conviction and powerful spiritual mainstay , it is impossible for comrades of the entire party and people throughout the country to make our country powerful , invigorate our nation and basically realize our socialist modernization in the middle of this century .  Without a strong rallying power and brilliant creativity , it is impossible for them to do so .  Without an indomitable will and concerted efforts , it is also impossible for them to do so .  
The Interim Procedures are more all-compassing , standardized and reasonable than the previous procedures , but since each national and military reform must advance step by step , the establishment and completion of the socialist market economy takes time and the Interim Procedures should be implemented in an enthusiastic , reliable and gradual manner .  It is impossible to thoroughly resolve all contradictions and problems at once that have arise since the implementation of reform and opening up .  
Since atat present and for a certain present and in a given period of the future , our country will continuously focus on the economic construction , it is impossible for our country to substantially increase its investment in the military spending while the military faces complex and arduous tasks in the military modernization construction which does require an increased of the investment in the military spending .  The contradiction between the affordable practicality of and the need for demanded mmilitary spending will exist for a long time .  
It was impossible for the bumped pilot to respond in a flash .  Assuming the pilot could respond in an instant , it would be impossible for him to complete the whole process of changing the plane 's flying position from the moment he began to act .  Under this situation , the collision was inevitable .  
Tang Jiaxuan said : At the present , along with the accelerating development of political multi-polarization and economic globalization , calls for democratization of international relations are running high with each passing day , while attempts to build a unipolar world have become increasingly unpopular and impossible .  
For example , insofar as fighting opportunities are concerned , a belligerent will have to strike at the enemy at its weak points , with unusual tactics , at a time , in a zone , and in a way detrimental to the enemy , thereby rendering it impossible for the enemy to concentrate its " capability " within a short period of time .  
Similarly , it is impossible for Hong Kong to turn a blind eye to Falungong , which has been increasingly involved in political and international affairs and has disturbed the normal living order of citizens .  The HKSAR Government must assume responsibility for the security and stability of Hong Kong . Hence , the government 's stance and methods are totally reasonable and necessary .  
Without enhancing the level of productive forces , it is impossible to consolidate the political power , maintain social stability , improve the living standards of the people , and develop the spiritual civilization and the democratic and legal system .  
Mu Xiudong , political commissar of a missile brigade of the Second Artillery Corps , said during a discussion that without emancipating its mind and seeking truth from facts - - a spirit of exploring a scientific theory in an in-depth manner - - the party would have been unable to acquire major theoretical innovations , the Chinese nation would have been unable to achieve independence and liberation , building socialism with Chinese characteristics would have been impossible , and there would not have been such powerful national defense as we have today .  
It is impossible to successfully organize such a colossal and complicated support by relying on the army 's logistic department alone .  The only way to meet the operational needs is to rely on the economic strength of the state as a whole to blend operational logistics support into the " vast logistics " for society to effect an army-civilian integral support .  
However , because of the poor quality of the pilots of the communist troops , it was impossible for them to understand more difficult tactics .  Therefore , the communist troops developed a set of pithy formula , which the pilots recited whenever they were followed by a rattlesnake missile .  After reciting the formula , they turned a sharp angle to try to shake off the missile .  
However , it was utterly impossible for China , overwhelmed by a dark political situation and turmoil and chaos of war , with the masses living in dire poverty and in a miserable state , to catch up with the advanced trend of developing science and technology in the world .  
On the decisive factors in the outcome of war , he said : Taiwan 's weaknesses in terms of political , geographical , climatic , war potential and other factors are things that no advanced weaponry can make up .  Take its geographical conditions for an example .  Taiwan 's geographical environment is such that it is impossible to bring the maximum capability of high-performance weapons into play .  
Even the F-16 is just a light aircraft , and what Taiwan has bought are the basic A and B models .  The improved C and D models are not sold to Taiwan because the Americans think that these planes are too powerful in their ability to hit ground targets .  As for the F-15 which is even more powerful in its air control and attack capabilities , it is all the more impossible for the Taiwan authorities to lay hands on in spite of the fact that they have expressed their interest time and again .

Second , our country 's economic restructuring has entered a crucial stage , and industries are in a historical stage of large-scale readjustment .  If we do not set up and improve the social security system , it will be impossible to realize the fundamental reform of state-owned enterprises , there will be no way to readjust the industrial structure , and it will be difficult to maintain social stability .  
Wang Chiaying , who was in charge of conducting the poll , warned the Hong Kong Government that , popular discontent is extremely deep and the prospects of the economy is also bleak at a time when prices are dropping on the housing market and stock market and there are frequent cases of shoddy construction work and bureaucratic malfeasance , it is entirely impossible for Tung Chee-hwa to dodge these problems .  He said : " It is not a packaging problem now .  
Right now , our party is ruling in a large nation with a population of more than 1.2 billion , Jiang Zemin pointed out .  Without a large number of leading cadres that combine political integrity with professional ability , it is definitely impossible to lead the people of all nationalities throughout the country to push forward our arduous cause of modernization under the complex international and domestic situation .  
As a matter of fact , it is impossible for the Chinese enterprises to head for the entire world without choice now .  We should first proceed from our own comparative advantages to select those regions that have their own comparative advantages , and make investment and set up factories there .  For instance , we should first gain access to the developing countries , the states of the former Soviet Union , the regions adjacent to West China , and so on .  
As regards human rights , Li Peng has stressed and pointed out : It is impossible to demand that various countries follow the same viewpoint or mechanically transplant the same mode on the question of human rights , for human rights is an integral concept , and complete and common human rights should include not only the political rights of citizens but also the economic , social , and cultural rights , especially the right of survival and the right of development . 
As the social systems , historical backgrounds , cultural traditions , economic levels , living quality , religious beliefs , senses of value , and so on of all countries in the world differ in thousands of ways and it is impossible to ask every country to indiscriminately copy one model and one system .  
Zhu Rongji pointed out that according to the experience in cracking down on smuggling last year , without improving and using advanced technical means and modern information technology , it is impossible to effectively crack down on the cunning criminal gangs and safeguard the economic legal system and national interests .  Therefore , at present , we must seize the time to improve the " golden customs project " and the " golden taxation project . "  
However , it is expected to be nearly impossible that the two sides will sign any substantive agreement on forming free trade ties in the near future , and even less probable they will establish a " China-ASEAN free trade zone , " because that will involve a lot of complicated issues .  
After Federal Associate Justice Stephens was defeated in the partisan struggle in the Federal Supreme Court , he said helplessly : " Although it is impossible for us to be one hundred percent sure who will be the real winner in this year 's presidential election , but who is the failure is very clear , that is , the people have lost their confidence in the justices ' position of being just and selfless defenders of laws and are worried about the partisan struggle . "  
3 .  The faction that thinks it is impossible to maintain the status quo , but readjustment should be made gradually : Japan 's demand to become a political and military big country will become an irresistible trend in Japan 's political arena in the future .  The United States can only pay attention to the regional power structure and the popular will at home , and readjust bilateral relations step by step in accordance with such demand .  
If there is a long-term drop off in grain prices , the readjustment of the agricultural structure will be delayed , the shift of the surplus rural workforce will be impeded , and it will be impossible to boost the income of the farmers , which may result in a setback to the enthusiasm of the farmers and shake the agricultural foundation , thus jeopardizing the entire national economy .  
Although it is impossible to make a concrete judgment before the detailed rules for the implementation of the policy are promulgated , yet the fact that foreign and domestic investors compete with one another to trade B shares in the same markets and their profits and losses are inevitably reflected in the balance of international payments in foreign exchange shows that , after all , extremely important progress has been made even though we can not say that the free convertibility of renminbi is right under our noses . 
The department concerned said that the incident broke out after some staff and workers found it impossible to adapt to new production requirements introduced in the wake of the factory 's technological transformation , and learned that the factory had decided to lay them off or divert them to other posts .  
In stipulating the safety requirements for a petrol filling station , the Government , in accordance with international standards , will divide the station into three zones , i.e . zones where accumulation of inflammable vapour is common , possible or impossible .  In the first two zones , all electrical installations , e.g . pumps , fluorescent tubes , etc . , must be explosion-proof , fireproof and safe in themselves .  
He perfectly choreographed to wonderful music together with his masterful sleight of hands into fast-paced magic show , taking his audience to his wondrous magical world .  He is at all times faithful to the principle " The magician 's secret lies in the art of uniting dream and reality " and that " nothing is impossible " .  
As far as some other A-level practical subjects , such as technical and computer subjects are concerned , the practical examinations have been abolished after the introduction of TAS . This is because of the short duration and more complex nature of the practical tests involved and hence it is impossible to fully assess the candidates ' performance in the application of technical skills in one single practical examination .  
The Marre Report on the Future of the English legal profession , published in 1988 , stated that " It is extremely difficult to define the need for legal services .  Unmet need is impossible to quantify . . .  It would be hard to develop research techniques which would give a reliable profile of unmet legal need broken down by type of problem and geographical area " .  
Mixing skylines from both cities form an imaginary chart .  The " City Cookie " goes one step further to allow people to have a bite of this crispy sky , and the " Sky-Eaters " will then experience how to make the impossible possible .  For Ho Siu-kee , the locus of cultural and spiritual identity is situated within one 's own bodies .  At the site of the body , knowledge of the world may be tested and even elaborated into myths .  
Almost all the edible things found on earth , be they livestock , poultry , seafood or fruit and vegetables , have been incorporated into delicious dishes by skilled Chinese chefs . Recently , however , the rapid growth of a modern commercial society has made it impossible for most people to go home to eat their mid-day meal .  
The next day the crowds of people were replaced by piles of trash , and the sugary white beaches had changed color , littered with bits of exploded firecrackers that were impossible to clean up .  
Nevertheless , although it is impossible to fully articulate the original cultural environment , still , the ultimate meaning behind the culture on the psychological level can transcend time and space and be expressed on the stage .  
Exercise : The Stepping Stone to Rehabilitation : Taking sufferers from infantile paralysis as an example , Wu says that if no rehabilitation treatment is administered , lower limbs are too weak to support the body and normal walking is impossible . Excessive joint friction , ineffectual muscles , and numbness are common consequences , resulting in " second-degree disability . " Some cerebral palsy victims sometimes reach the point where their entire bodies need rehabilitative treatment , Wu explains .  
When instant noodles first appeared on the market in Taiwan more than 20 years ago - - convenient , tasty and suited to the rapid pace of industrial society as they are - - they were an instant success . But their uniformity of flavor and inability to " fill you up " made it impossible for modern-day people who are pressed for time but still picky about their food to make them a staple of their diet .  
It was not long before they came to accept this as natural - - if you wanted to get ahead then you had to actively take part in the League , national mass study organizations and social work . Moreover , there could be no questioning of communist thinking ; otherwise one would be seen as a rebel and expelled from the League , making further study impossible .  
It 's Not a Battle Between Ecology and Development ! : Huang Ta-pang , who has worked in the PBM for over 40 years , states that the marble now imported from Italy , which has excellent color , superior quality , and few cracks or fissures and is easily processed , is already the finest available material . And it is n't expensive . The costs of mining in Taiwan are high , and even if you just figure in the best mines , it is still impossible to compete .  
Besides Premier Hau , there are a few others Teng has sworn to give up , such as legislator Lin Cheng-chieh , whose voice Teng describes as " splitting bamboo " ; former DPP Secretary-General Chang Chun-hung , who always has a " tragic " or " concerned " expression on his brow , and " is n't humorous in the least " ; or the " too handsome " vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council Ma Ying-jeou . All of them are impossible to imitate because of " innate limits . "  
Inviting trouble : As industry developed and the surrounding environment gradually became polluted , it became nearly impossible to find delicious fresh water fish and shrimp in low-lying areas . Thus the clean , ku-producing upstream portion of the Tsengwen River and its tributary the Tanayiku River became coveted by poachers .  
The price of falconry : If you want the hawks to have glossy and healthy-looking plumage , be vigorous and formidable , fly high , and aim sure , as they do in the wild , it takes a lot of time and effort . Given modern lifestyles , it 's impossible for most people to find the patience or time to take care of the " troublesome , " tempestuous animals from morning to night .  
In that age when medical care was scarce , it was often impossible to do anything for people infected by disease . In addition , workers in the mines often faced unpredictable dangers , and there was periodic havoc wrought by fire or flood .  
Perhaps he concentrated too intently on the glottal , natural style of traditional singing . When receiving Western style vocal training at the Institute of Art , for a while Buhe could not sing at all . The contradictions made him ponder whether it was not impossible to express traditional songs using the abdominal singing techniques of the West .  
Perhaps a philosophy of life and death can be free from objectivity , formality , and rigidity , but it has the opposite critical problem of becoming personalized , and freely verified only in one 's own mind , so it is impossible to come to a common spiritual consensus .  
His eldest daughter Chung Yu-ching retorts that there is less and less field work to be done , and at home appliances have taken over many tasks formerly done by hand , so it 's impossible to insist that modern women live like those in the past . In Taiwan , young people share a common backdrop to their upbringings , a common language , and a great deal of information . The impact of traditional family education is waning , and can not overcome social values , schooling , and peer interactions .  
For example , in 1964 the MOP stated that in order to develop science and technology , if it proved impossible to find qualified persons at home , foreign nationals could be hired on a contract basis for scientific or technical posts which did not involve national secrets . In 1984 the MOE declared that secondary and tertiary institutions could employ foreign nationals .  
Since , Chen argued , it is impossible to be completely loyal to two separate entities at the same time , it is only proper that parliamentarians should give up dual nationality . Following this logic , the government stipulated in the 1991 amendments to the Election and Recall Law that those elected as representatives must give up foreign citizenship before they are sworn into office .  
In Kaohsiung , factories in the industrial district begin spewing out smoke of a strange color . In office buildings in the city 's commercial district , air conditioning units large and small come to a halt . It becomes impossible for more than 300,000 households in the Kaohsiung-Pingtung area to generate the enticing smells of food being cooked . . . .  
Folk popular , doctor disdainedBecause the Taiwanese medical establishment now follows mainstream Western medicine , many doctors say that hypnosis is " a mysterious art that is impossible to understand and hard to make sense of . " They regard such folk practices as spells , charms to calm people shocked by ghosts , and the trances of jitongs , as just plain superstitious and ridiculous . And as for meditation , yoga and Zen contemplation , these they view as the realm of religion , completely distinct from the domain of science .  
But after many years of development , densely populated Hong Kong has a shortage of living space , and the developed area of the colony has steadily expanded . It has been impossible for Rennie 's Mill to avoid being drawn into these changes . And things get even more complicated when you consider what the coming of 1997 means , given the town 's political orientation .  
Having been busy for a while , by the time they got set up for a formal takeoff they noticed the sky darkening . But it proved impossible for them to resist the seduction of flying . "  
He wrote that " it is easy to move from frugality to luxury , but difficult to move from luxury to frugality . " It is impossible for even the most disciplined and fortunate families to achieve high rank in every generation , not to mention those families in which profligate playboys undo the accumulated achievements of their ancestors .  
It is the dangers posed to juvenile deer by wild dogs that causes concern . Nevertheless , today with human footsteps covering every stretch of the land , it is impossible to let the deer go completely wild . Not wanting to put all their eggs in one basket , project personnel hope to select repopulation locales in northern , eastern and southern Taiwan . Since they have been operating in Kenting ( in the south ) for 12 years now , Yangming-shan National Park ( in the north ) is being considered as the second locale .  
The opium that undermined China more than a century ago arrived through transnational trade , and the same thing is true of modern narcotics . In advanced countries drug production is strictly controlled , and it is virtually impossible to cultivate poppies ( for opium or heroin ) , coca ( for cocaine ) , or cannabis on a huge scale . Given the high demand for narcotics in these societies , the result is that supplies are inadequate , naturally forcing prices up .  
Against this background , Huang advises that it is inappropriate for students , lacking experience in society and with immature minds , to be allowed to participate in long-termed , closed activities like the summer camp . Moreover , he suggests , the government should regulate all religious activities that do not follow general practice or common sense . Otherwise , it is not impossible that similar crises of family and social ethics will again occur .  
She says frankly that the thing a judge fears most is breaking a big case " in an ugly way , " when the physical evidence at the scene has been destroyed in rescuing the survivors , making it impossible to take samples which could be submitted for scientific analysis ( for example , DNA matching for bloodstains ) . In such cases , there are only the court witnesses and the eyewitnesses ' indirect evidence , which are much less persuasive .  
Although the surveyors were very hesitant to reopen the dispute , in order to complete their duties as civil servants they just put their heads down and plowed ahead , notifying the two to come out and identify their boundary . As expected , each of the two had his own version . But at least now there was a formal record that could be taken to a mediation committee for a compromise solution , thus allowing the surveyors to get through this risky " mission impossible . "  
It was discovered that in maledominated jobs-the military and police , construction workers , machinists-men use various roundabout methods to " mark their territory . " Thus posters of naked women , impossible to avoid seeing , are put up in factories . Or construction workers will urinate openly right in front of passing women . It even happens that women scholars doing field research or female students supporting labor rights may find themselves in dangerous situations in such environments .  
Music critic Wang Hen only partly agrees with this assessment . He thinks Wong is a quite outstanding conductor , and that this year in particular he raised his game a notch . Moreover , his ability to coordinate each section of musicians is rare indeed ; otherwise it would be impossible to bring together musicians from different places , of different ages , and with different habits , and produce a quality sound in only a short rehearsal period .  
If the scope of liberalization is too broad , problems will result . If there is total liberalization , then future owners need not actually farm the land . Given that illegal use of farmland for non-agricultural purposes is already widespread , it would be almost impossible to regulate future use at all if land need not be owned by farmers themselves . Rampant speculation , a food crisis , or other severe problems might ensue .  
However , it was often impossible for more distant locales , like Fujian and Guangdong , to receive the official almanac in a timely fashion . Attracted by economic incentives , local practitioners of the occult began privately publishing their own books ; these included much additional material on the rules for occult calculations .  
Zhuangzi ( Chuang-tzu ) states that if one 's view of the world is clouded by preconceptions and expectations , then it is impossible to live beyond the physical limitations faced by ordinary human beings , for one is not living in harmony with the " Dao " of the universe .  
Kuo says that it is impossible to see how Diamond Stage had real respect for these low-status people . Most of the time in the " social concern segments " was spent in bantering among the hosts ( who got their start doing vulgar " dinner shows " ) and the guest star . Was it supposed to express respect just because the hosts bowed and said something like " that looked like hard work " at the end ?  
Nevertheless , it was only in the 1990s that homosexual writing really became prominent in literary circles in Taiwan and became a fad . G &amp; L Magazine founder James An points out that in recent years there has been a flurry of Chinese-language homosexual literature . Works of gay literaure have won lucrative prizes in all categories-novels , novellas , and short stories . It is impossible to deny the achievements of this body of work .  
For the whole global village to be improved into an enormous " aseptic chamber " is surely impossible , but what we can predict is that if humans do not change their attitudes towards the environment and nature , and if they continue to pay scant regard to safe practice in medical treatment and the use of drugs , new viruses and infectious diseases will never stop appearing .  
A Miss Chou , who works for a publisher , recalls that when her mother-in-law was close to death , they shoved a thick tube down her throat to keep her breathing , which not only made it impossible for her to give instructions but also twisted her mouth into hideous shapes . It was such a contrast from her usual calm and peaceful visage , and made her look both scared and in pain .  
Studies abroad suggest that adult sexual problems such as exposure , fetishes , impotence , or premature ejaculation are all related to repression of sexuality in early childhood . Sufferers of these problems find it impossible to have normal adult sexual relationships , which leads to a terrible loss of happiness over their entire lives .  
Council for Cultural Affairs vice chairman Wu Chung-li says that in the future , traditional theater will be incorporated into the overall project . In the future , will Taiwan produce a true celebrity of the theater ? And will young people become avid fans of theatrical stars ? Though these questions are impossible to answer , many students have already discovered the bountiful universe that is the theater .  
At the tenth anniversary of Tiananmen , preventive measures by the mainland authorities made substantive attacks against the government impossible . But participants in a symposium on " The May Fourth Movement and 20th-Century China " at Peking University in early May could scarcely fail to expand on the stated theme , to touch on the currently most sensitive topics of democracy , human rights and freedom which were the issues behind Tiananmen . Hence the symposium was full of the sense that " all history is contemporary history . "  
She explains : " Kaohsiung 's industrial structure has long stagnated around the petrochemical and steel industries . Not only is output value low , the environmental costs are very high , and it is almost impossible to raise the quality of life for local citizens . " Upgrading the local industrial structure , she believes , requires devoting more attention to technology . Therefore she hired experts in electronic commerce from Taiwan and from abroad and founded her own company , through which she hopes to improve the e-commerce capabilities of Kaohsiung companies .  
As a result of this dramatic flux there was a wholesale and merciless reshuffling of national wealth , which widened the gap between rich and poor , made it impossible for most people to afford their own homes and severely penalized those who had blindly invested in the stockmarket . These factors , along with ballooning consumer prices and a general sense of restless anxiety , seriously undermined the traditional work ethics of practicality and diligence .  
Because past surveys of Taiwan faults were mostly limited to examinations of surface geology , with no money to obtain more precise results by digging or drilling under the surface , major mistakes were common . Particularly in metropolitan areas where high real estate prices mean that all the land is covered by buildings , ruptures are impossible to see .  
The problem was eventually fixed through the combined efforts of a number of American computer scientists . Realizing that the increasing size and complexity of computer networks made it impossible for any individual to discover all the holes within them , these scientists established the Computer Emergency Response Team ( CERT ) at Carnegie-Mellon University . They hoped that by working together , network security issues could be predicted and resolved .  
In 1996 , President Lee Teng-hui was far ahead of his rivals all the way , and the election was lopsided . This year , the most prominent feature of the campaign is exactly the opposite : The three main candidates are running neck-and-neck , and the election battle is fierce . It is impossible right now to say who might win , and will probably remain so right up to the finish .  
But it is only actual governing that tests one 's true staying power . Scholars have stated that the 2000 election in Taiwan has three special characteristics : For one thing , this is the first time the opposition has a very real possibility of taking the reins of government . Secondly , the three leading candidates are so close it is impossible to tell who will win . And third , whatever the outcome , this is the beginning of Taiwan 's post-strongman era .  
But another music industry professional , MTV Taiwan 's programming and creative department supervisor Dennis Yang , has a different point of view . " It 's impossible to change the commercialization and unsophisticated taste of pop music , " he says . As for awards being given to Pur-dur and other similar artists , he feels it is good to encourage the creation of works with different creative perspectives . " But it 's still impossible to create a popular demand in the market for works that have lost contact with commercial taste . "  
In particular , the group lambasted the government for the NT $ 200 million it had spent in vain on a reconstruction plan designed by academics that was impossible to implement . They argued that the new government 's chief concerns should instead be with practical measures such as instituting work management controls and tracking down how reconstruction money was embezzled after the quake . It called upon the government to put an end to the tradition of plans that are unfeasible and good for nothing but creating a lot of hot air .  
Q : As you yourself have mentioned , underworld figures often launder their public image by getting involved in politics , and it is extremely difficult to do anything about it . Previous Justice Ministers Liao Cheng-hao and Ma Ying-jeou both had excellent reputations as able and incorruptible men , yet neither was able to overcome the influence of black gold . It almost looks like " mission impossible . " Do you feel confident of your ability to carry out this mission ?  
Later , because strong winds and heavy seas made landing impossible , the camera team 's plans were delayed . The next time they were able to land on the islet where the birds were filmed , the Chinese crested terns had already moved on , so the team missed the opportunity to observe them more closely .  
Many family pedigrees in the local area also provide evidence of the fearsome loss of life that occurred . The deluge even came to the attention of the emperor himself , who ordered the imperial granary to ship emergency rice supplies . It was impossible to dig separate graves for each of the victims , so they ended up laid to rest in four large pits . Expressing deep sorrow over the disaster , the emperor declared that the " spirits of the victims would all end up in heaven just like the rest of us . "  
But Liu 's father by no means encouraged Arthur to go into this field , and so he studied agricultural chemistry at National Taiwan University . But it proved impossible to resist his natural inclinations , and he ended up in the broadcast world anyway . Liu attended National Taiwan Normal University Affiliated High School , which had a relatively lively , open atmosphere .  
As Kung analyzes the situation , traditionally banks made their income from the differential between the interest paid on deposits and interest earned on loans ( this is called the " interest rate margin " ) . However , with competition as intense as it is today , banks have had to offer higher interest on deposits and lower-interest loans , so that over the last three years the differential has been , on average , only about two percent . It is virtually impossible for a bank to cover its operating costs with such a narrow margin .  
From the moment they say " I do , " they should be ready in their hearts and willing to take the bad along with the good . Why is it , then , that today 's couples , free to choose their partners , find it so difficult to honor their vows ? Some find it impossible to deal with hardship , and others , even after struggling to make it through a difficult stretch , are somehow unable to enjoy the sweet yields of their struggle .  
Of particular importance are these few sentences that capture the essence of Dan 's thinking : " It 's naturally difficult to search for nothing , yet when the substance is clearly defined you see the emptiness . It 's impossible to paint the spirit , yet when reality is reduced to its essence the spirit will be revealed . A painting that is chaotic and busy is largely superfluous . Only when emptiness and reality are arranged properly will the idea of the picture extend beyond the painting . "  
Apart from uneven levels of quality , the main reason why alternative medicine is not welcomed by the regulatory authorities or mainstream medical practitioners is that it is difficult or impossible to test the effectiveness of alternative treatments by scientific methods .  
While promoting his film in Taiwan , Zhang and local director Hou Hsiao-hsien engaged in a lengthy chat about their " ideal " martial arts film at Taipei Film House . Zhang pointed out that his film was set in the time immediately before the first Qin emperor had unified all of China . At that moment in history , it would have been impossible for people to foresee his eventual transformation into a tyrant ; therefore , the assassin is able to place trust in the emperor .  
Bambooware is made from lightweight materials , yet the finished product must be sturdy . But while sturdy , it must also be flexible . Unless all the bamboo strips are of the exact same thickness and width , it is virtually impossible to achieve a symmetrically shaped product . And the interstices must be of uniform dimension for a piece of bambooware to present attractive geometric patterns no matter what angle it is viewed from .  
It 's just that in comparison with the enormously powerful TNCs , domestic companies are still the runts of the litter , and only venture into relatively mature directions in their R &amp; D . Because it is impossible to alter this " hand-me-down-ism " in the short run , it is in Taiwan 's interest that foreign R &amp; D pace-setters are here , because future international industrial trends will be clearer , and local R &amp; D centers can avoid unnecessary detours .  
During the 80s , in conjunction with extensive land development , the capital costs of salt making and the quality of the final product made it impossible to compete with imported salt for market share . Furthermore , those willing to do the backbreaking work of exposing the salt to the sun were becoming harder to find .  
In the mid-1990 ' s , Taiwan 's IT industry began to take off , and every major company was fighting for the ever-decreasing , prime property at Hsinchu , making it nigh-on impossible to secure a spot there . Then , in July 1996 , after considering the levels of industrial development in the north and the south of Taiwan , the government began formulating a plan for a " Southern Taiwan Science Park " .  
When word got around about the teachers , Overseas Chinese rushed to sign up , so that the number of enrollments increased sharply to a figure far above that anticipated . Liu Shu-hui , principal of the Frankfurt Chinese School , who was in charge of organizing the event , began to worry that there would be too many students , so it would be impossible to give each the care and attention desired , thereby affecting the quality of the camp , and she began to refuse people .  
Last year , a group of teachers from all over Taiwan jointly authored a book entitled Pieces on Education Reform . The book 's main author , Lin Jung-tzu , explains that education reform has been led by officials , academics , and experts ; classroom teachers have been asked to simply follow along . But when the policies have proven impossible to implement , it has been the teachers who have been blamed for being unprogressive and conservative . In response , this group of teachers decided to give expression to their own genuine feelings .  
" This type of flexible class would have been impossible before the nine-year integrated curriculum , " says Li . Of course , she also does as is required and teaches three formal biology classes . While these classes may be rigid , she says , they must be attended to , since " if test scores are n't good , students will feel frustrated , and parents will protest . "  
The two suspects base this move on the obvious fact that there has been widespread advance media condemnation , which would make it impossible to select an impartial and uninfluenced jury in either country .  
If the present generation is unable to defeat growing poverty and secure employment opportunities for the already vast global army of the indigent , it will be impossible to ensure the peace and wellbeing in the developed regions of the world .  
In the absence of alternative hospital facilities readily accessible to refugees at more economical costs , the continual increase in the cost of services at private contracted hospitals made it impossible for the Agency to maintain its existing level of services without application of strict measures , including rationalization of referrals , reduction of the number of bed-days contracted and introduction of a system of cost-sharing for specialized hospital care .  
Unless management is given the ability and freedom to recruit professional staff of the highest calibre , from anywhere in the world and this can be done only if remuneration is internationally competitive and if Governments refrain from interfering in a fair selection process it will be hard , if not impossible , to achieve the continuous improvement in quality and efficiency that is rightly called for in the secretariats of United Nations organizations .  
Today , it is impossible to deny the existence of private entities and public bodies which , under a legal cover , conduct clandestine criminal operations as a parallel activity by hiring people who , in exchange for payment , agree to participate in the commission of unconscionable and illegal acts .  
Major pharmaceutical firms and suppliers of medical equipment and medical equipment spare parts , which had historically maintained trade links with Cuba , recently informed the Cuban authorities officially that since their products either contained United States components or were manufactured under United States technological licences which were affected by the ban imposed by the United States federal authorities , it was impossible to proceed with the deliveries .  
A people deprived of an entire pre-war self-sufficient economy and forced by the lack of farmland into a humiliating dependence on the administering Power was now faced with the well-nigh impossible task of absorbing the loss of thousands of jobs and resisting certain economic decline .  
As soon afterwards as 1968 the Proclamation of Tehran drew attention to the danger of this dissociation of human rights by proclaiming that : " Since human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible , the full realization of civil and political rights without the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights is impossible " .  
Very often the economic model on which structural adjustment programmes are based has made it impossible to overcome the particularly serious social problems of the countries concerned , especially poverty , and in some cases has increased the concentration of wealth , exclusion and marginalization .  
Indeed , it is impossible to conceive of global and sustainable economic and social progress based on fairness and solidarity without a comprehensive and coherent concept of cooperation for development including , as the Secretary-General has recalled , a vital ethical element and without conception and coordination here in the United Nations in way that is not disjointed , scattered and possibly inconsistent .  How can we give the United Nations sufficient authority and credibility to consider effectively in this forum major global economic issues ?  
It is needless to stress that the elimination of poverty and the attainment of the broader goal of sustainable development will remain impossible to achieve unless nations show renewed political resolve to implement policies aimed at enabling humankind to better manage and live with its environment , as agreed to at the Rio de Janeiro summit and at subsequent Conferences .  
Therefore , it is incumbent upon the international community and in particular the developed countries , to give the required attention and adequate assistance to help solve this crucial equation , because it is impossible to accept , in the context of interdependence , a world in which affluence is concentrated in a small number of countries while the majority of countries continue to struggle against increasing poverty and the gap between the rich and the poor grows inexorably wider .  
However , numerous social development projects have been discontinued and it has become apparent that it is impossible for us to make steady progress towards social development without an international environment conducive to our economic growth and overall development .  
The Working Group entrusted with this issue should also strive to reach an understanding on the possibility of harmonizing legal norms and existing national administrative procedures in the area of domestic control of weapons and in the import and export of arms , in order to establish a common and effective international arms control system that would make it impossible for arms to be diverted through clandestine or illicit channels .  
I believe that it would be a grievous setback for the Organization if , because of the current financial debate , it became impossible to retain MICIVIH , whose presence is essential to consolidate the Organization 's and Members States ' remarkable achievements in Haiti , and MINUGUA , whose presence is fundamental to realization of the best prospects that have ever existed to bring to an end the armed confrontation which has afflicted the people of Guatemala for 35 years .  
In other words , if the tax rules for various types of investment vehicles were not completely consistent , taxpayers could use derivatives to choose the tax treatment that they most desired ; moreover , achieving complete consistency was difficult if not impossible because various instruments differed in ways that were traditionally considered highly relevant to taxation , such as the predictable returns of a debt instrument versus the unpredictable returns on most equity investments . 
When repatriation proved impossible , local or regional integration was the most desirable solution , in particular when strong ethnic and cultural ties existed between refugees and their host country .  
Traditionally , technical assistance has been provided in the context of economic and social development , with the main emphasis on building and strengthening physical infrastructure and the executive arm of the Government ; assistance in governance beyond that was made virtually impossible by the political climate throughout most of the United Nations history .  
There can be no doubt that in adopting such provocative and extremist measures , which run radically counter to the will and direction of the international community , the Netanyahu Government is in fact pursuing a premeditated and programmed policy designed to demolish the forthcoming negotiations with the Palestinians , collapse the peace efforts of the United States of America and fabricate a climate of escalation that will make saving the peace process desperately difficult , if not impossible .  
However , objective reasons relating to shortage of time and staff made it impossible , at this stage , to produce a list of the countries and transnational corporations engaged in the illicit dumping of toxic and harmful products and wastes in the developing countries , particularly as the communications that were examined seemed to refer to only a very small proportion of the transboundary flow of toxic wastes and dangerous products . 
Taking into consideration the modest financial capabilities of the State , in this short period it has been impossible to supply the appropriate equipment and arms for the armed forces of the Republic of Macedonia at a level that would provide for an appropriate initial reaction or a possible urgent military action ;  
On the occasion of the fifteenth anniversary of the Israeli decision to annex the Golan on 14 December 1981 , the people of the Golan adopted a statement saying that they regarded the decision as null and void ; that they rejected it ; that they found it impossible to accept ; that it was incompatible with international law ; and that it ignored the fact that the manifest truth could not be misrepresented .  
With regard to the law that is applicable 29 , the commission held that the general principle that emerges , both from national practice and from international custom , is based on the presumption that the non _ fulfilment of a legal obligation is not justified , except to the extent that it may be demonstrated that it is impossible to proceed othewise than in a manner contrary to the law .  
It believed that the Secretary-General 's statement that it would be possible to absorb the additional cost of $ 2,841,300 gross within the total revised appropriation of $ 2,603,280,900 for the biennium 1996-1997 given the fact that the United States dollar had appreciated to a significant extent since December 1996 was premature , since it was impossible to make precise forecasts of currency movements in the last six months of 1997 . 
The main lesson that we should draw from the limited success of past efforts in this regard is that the legal , political and practical complexity of the issues involved makes it impossible to apply ready-made , generalized solutions .  
I have the honour to transmit to you herewith decision 001 / 97 , dated 19 July 1997 , whereby the Constitutional Council of the Republic of the Congo , noting that it was impossible for the Government to organize the presidential elections scheduled for 27 July 1997 , decided to postpone such elections and , accordingly , to extend the mandate of the current President of the Republic until the proclamation of a successor elected by universal suffrage , in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Constitution in force in the Republic of the Congo .  
Similarly , the international community 's assertions of true partnership with Africa in the face of failing official development assistance and impossible debt repayments to mention just two major constraints may soon sound hollow unless that partnership manifests itself in concrete programmes of action .  
In view of the fact that conditions for its entry into force are not subject to revision , we have to consider seriously a set of measures to provide for the timely implementation of the Treaty , since it is not impossible that a technologically perfect , though expensive , CTBT verification system will be established and ready to function while the Treaty itself is still not operational .  
In the context of nuclear disarmament , it is the indispensable prerequisite for the further advancement of nuclear disarmament , because it is impossible to move forward with the dismantlement of nuclear weapons unless the safe and effective management of resultant fissile material is secured .  
In this respect the 1996 report of the World Bank notes that the burden of debt in many of the least developed countries has reached such a level that it is virtually impossible for them to continue with their economic reforms , which are of crucial importance ; and that this situation is exacerbated by the fact that in 1996 official development assistance , which can reduce the effect of indebtedness , fell to its lowest level in real terms in 23 years .  
If we do not create an international environment favourable to economic growth and sustainable and comprehensive development , it will be almost impossible , particularly for the large majority of third world countries , to make steady progress along the road to social development .  
It has become quite obvious that true comprehensive reforms aimed at rendering the Security Council more efficient and more effective are impossible without resolving the problems of its size and equitable composition .  
This scepticism has sprung from a variety of sources : that high unemployment represents a voluntary economic equilibrium that is impossible to reduce without triggering off accelerating inflation ; that rapid labour-saving technological change has ushered in an era of " jobless growth " and " the end of work " ; and that heightened economic competition in the wake of the globalization of the world economy has emasculated the capacity of Governments to influence the level and quality of employment .  
A complex process was transforming the world economy and international relations , even though it was impossible to formulate a complete and unified theory of the process and its impact on the economic , social and even political behaviour patterns that had served as the basis of the international order in recent decades .  
Basic space science is a key to the prosperity of a nation and it is almost impossible to expect a country to have significant economic and social development without a sound educational and research base in the field of basic space science .  
Since it was impossible to consider social development separately from economic , political and cultural development , the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia had set itself the goal of successful integration into the common European social system .

The view was expressed that the draft articles seemed to be premised upon a highly centralized State with comprehensive regulatory powers ; it would be difficult or even impossible to implement those principles effectively in federal States , where regulatory authority was shared .  
Obviously , however , development of the private sector was impossible without support at the public level , which should include , inter alia , demonopolization , the introduction of tax incentives , a sound legal environment and the promotion of domestic and foreign investment .  
First , in the light of what we heard during our mission to Cambodia , even from some high official sources , the level of corruption in the court system and the routine subjection of judicial decisions to political influence would make it nearly impossible for prosecutors , investigators and judges to be immune from such pressure in the course of what would undoubtedly be very politically charged trials .  
During the period of the United Nations Security Council sanctions , it was very difficult , or even impossible , for FRY to import medicaments , raw materials for medicaments , medical supplies , instruments and their spare parts , materials for personal protection of workers , measuring instruments and their spare parts , various chemicals which are required for various analyses in health care and micro-climate tests of working conditions , scientific and technical books , etc .  
Emphasizes that mediation and restorative justice measures can lead to satisfaction for victims as well as to the prevention of future illicit behaviour and can represent a viable alternative to short terms of imprisonment and to fines , which are in certain cases practically impossible to collect ;  
Lacking such a review , it would be impossible for him to assess whether or not treaty-making ( again , in the broadest sense of this term ) can be considered as an appropriate juridical tool to improve the situation of indigenous peoples in general , to set the pattern for eradicating any discriminatory treatment against them and to gradually put an end to the present _ day antagonistic nature of the relationship between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples living together in many countries .

The independent expert encourages all the actors involved to pursue the political dialogue that they have already begun , but he can not insist enough on the current priority : the holding of free , democratic and transparent elections , without which it will be impossible to ensure the institutional stability that is essential if the innumerable challenges facing the Government and people of Haiti are to be met . 
Without an increase in development assistance funding , it would be impossible to meet all the current major challenges ranging from international debt , education and health to access to knowledge for the promotion of economic and social development .  
The Governments of these countries , faced as many of them are with heavy debt burdens and severe structural adjustment programmes , will find it difficult if not impossible to bear the costs of adequate social measures .  
The blockade has created countless obstacles to Cubas economic development ; it has made it impossible for Cuba to acquire products , equipment , goods , services and technology ; it has deprived it of funding and credits ; it has inflicted severe damage on its foreign trade by depressing the prices of what we sell and raising the costs of imports and transportation ; it has affected every sector of the national economy , with severe consequences for the living conditions of our people .  
While in future United Nations peacekeeping operations great importance would be attached to national reconciliation as a basis for lasting peace , a situation in which reconciliation and national healing were impossible in the existing circumstances should also be foreseen .

There is a consensus that without democratic and topquality education it is impossible to the secure economic , social , scientific , technological , cultural or political changes to which the Panamanian State and society aspire .  
At such times , it might not be known whether organized crime was involved or it might be impossible to meet any basic standard of proof as a prerequisite to obtaining assistance under the Protocol .  
The redrawing of borders in the Balkans in an attempt to meet the impossible demands of exclusivist nationalists pursuing a mono-ethnic ideal that can be realized only on a remote island leads only to more killing and to prolonged international engagement .  
He had concluded that that was not necessary either for practical reasons ( it would be extremely difficult , if not impossible , to establish a clear-cut violation of internal law in respect of reservations ) or for technical reasons ( the internal procedure in respect of reservations is often empirical and difficult of access ) ; there , too , the Commissions opinion would be valuable to him . 
On prospects for fundamental reform of the international financial architecture , the panellists said that enthusiasm had given way to the perception that it was virtually impossible to reach consensus on such reform , and that second-best solutions in the form of do-it-yourself approaches to crisis prevention and management at both the regional and national levels currently appeared to be the only politically feasible alternative .  
We are aware that it would have been impossible to take on the problems that have concerned us without facing up to the complexity of the history of mankind in terms both of its own interpretation of the repeated suffering of millions of beings and of the constantly renewed hopes of the prospect of equality and justice and of the ongoing attempt by women and men to build a better material and spiritual life .  
Chen Jianwen , the researcher responsible for this research explained that X-ray computerized tomography ( CT ) is usually used in clinical medicine to determine the pathology of a biological tissue .  Nonetheless , compared with a normal tissue , the difference of absorbing the X-ray by an initial cancerous tissue is extremely small , making it impossible to reflect the absorption on an image .  Thus , it is very difficult to diagnose an initial stage cancer .  
It is said there was one hour of heavy rainfall over the airport between 8:00-9:00am on the 10th , accompanied by thunderstorm and strong wind .  It was impossible to guarantee normal taking off and landing of flights with such weather .  Affected by this , over 2,000 passengers in total were held up on that day .  
If any grave turn occurs in Taiwan leading to the separation of Taiwan from China in any name , if Taiwan is invaded and occupied by a foreign country , and if the Taiwan authorities refuse , sine die , the peaceful settlement of cross-strait reunification through negotiation , it will then be impossible to have peaceful reunification and the Chinese Government will only be forced to adopt necessary measures to smash the separatist scheme for " Taiwan independence " and safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
Deputy Wang Yumei , 26-year-old " king breeder of rabbits " and general manager of the Jinan Lushe Rabbit Breeding Corporation , expressed a compassion of innocence in her remarks : " Without the party 's policy on encouraging the people to attain prosperity and the relaxed environment that encourages the development of various economic undertakings under different types of ownership , it would be impossible for me to transform , within 10 years , a small breeding farm with a few workers into a corporation whose current assets are worth 56 million yuan . "  
It seems that the United States is only accustomed to a relationship in which it gives the orders and other countries obey , and is not yet accustomed to living on equal terms with other countries ; it is only accustomed to living in an impossible uniform world regulated by itself , and is not yet accustomed to living in the real pluralistic world .  
But with unfavorable terrain and weather conditions , it was impossible to effectively attack mobile tactical targets and concealed targets at such altitudes , let alone tell genuine and false targets apart .  
The number one men of the party and government occupy the key position in the leadership groups and shoulder heavy responsibilities ; if supervision over them is lost , they will become privileged figures without control or constraint , which will result in suggestions being stifled , criticism being suppressed , and healthy trends suffering setbacks , and it will be impossible to curb the phenomena of corruption .  
They are satisfied only with their selfish desire and small farmer 's mentality .  They merely keep a close watch on the little bit of interests before their eyes , and set themselves against cadres .  It is outright impossible to carry forward undertakings at the grass-roots level . "  
The ossified " Soviet model " took the experience and development course of socialist construction under a special historical condition as something absolute and sacred without regard to the need to make continuous innovations inside socialism across different stages of development .  As a result , this seriously hindered the development of productivity , made it impossible to improve the people 's living conditions over a long time , and went against the requirements determined by the nature of socialism .  
Today , as the world economy has become increasingly globalized , with all countries prospering or declining as one , the rich countries of the north will ultimately get themselves burnt and find it impossible to maintain " lasting prosperity " if they allow the widening digital gap and disregard the extreme misery of the vast numbers of countries in the south .  
By saying that we should dare to say something new not mentioned by the old ancestors , he meant that as the times are moving ahead and practice is developing , new conditions and new issues will emerge in an endless stream , and it is impossible to find ready-made answers and solutions for our current issues from the works of the old ancestors .  We must work out solutions by ourselves by integrating the universal principles of Marxism with our current conditions and practice through studying new conditions , answering new questions , and blazing new trails .  
Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " cult constantly spread rumors to confuse the people and make trouble in violation of the law .  Their evil intention is to create chaos in China and to undermine social stability , making it impossible for the masses of the people to work , study , and live normally , disrupting economic construction , which is a central task , and then proceeding to realize their political scheme of overthrowing the CPC leadership and changing the socialist system in China .  
In recent years , he has rounded up practitioners through this organizational system and has instigated his followers to carry out illegal activities , to willingly act as political tools for western anti-China forces , to try and execute impossible missions for these hostile foreign forces , and to severely interfere with proper social order .  In doing so , he has created a significant political backlash , and has fully exposed his vicious ulterior scheme to create social chaos .  
In the face of the ever-changing international situation and intense international competition , without a lofty idea , firm conviction and powerful spiritual mainstay , it is impossible for comrades of the entire party and people throughout the country to make our country powerful , invigorate our nation and basically realize our socialist modernization in the middle of this century .  Without a strong rallying power and brilliant creativity , it is impossible for them to do so .  Without an indomitable will and concerted efforts , it is also impossible for them to do so .  
The Interim Procedures are more all-compassing , standardized and reasonable than the previous procedures , but since each national and military reform must advance step by step , the establishment and completion of the socialist market economy takes time and the Interim Procedures should be implemented in an enthusiastic , reliable and gradual manner .  It is impossible to thoroughly resolve all contradictions and problems at once that have arise since the implementation of reform and opening up .  
Since atat present and for a certain present and in a given period of the future , our country will continuously focus on the economic construction , it is impossible for our country to substantially increase its investment in the military spending while the military faces complex and arduous tasks in the military modernization construction which does require an increased of the investment in the military spending .  The contradiction between the affordable practicality of and the need for demanded mmilitary spending will exist for a long time .  
It was impossible for the bumped pilot to respond in a flash .  Assuming the pilot could respond in an instant , it would be impossible for him to complete the whole process of changing the plane 's flying position from the moment he began to act .

Tang Jiaxuan said : At the present , along with the accelerating development of political multi-polarization and economic globalization , calls for democratization of international relations are running high with each passing day , while attempts to build a unipolar world have become increasingly unpopular and impossible .  
For example , insofar as fighting opportunities are concerned , a belligerent will have to strike at the enemy at its weak points , with unusual tactics , at a time , in a zone , and in a way detrimental to the enemy , thereby rendering it impossible for the enemy to concentrate its " capability " within a short period of time .  
Similarly , it is impossible for Hong Kong to turn a blind eye to Falungong , which has been increasingly involved in political and international affairs and has disturbed the normal living order of citizens .  The HKSAR Government must assume responsibility for the security and stability of Hong Kong . Hence , the government 's stance and methods are totally reasonable and necessary .

It is impossible to successfully organize such a colossal and complicated support by relying on the army 's logistic department alone .  The only way to meet the operational needs is to rely on the economic strength of the state as a whole to blend operational logistics support into the " vast logistics " for society to effect an army-civilian integral support .  
However , because of the poor quality of the pilots of the communist troops , it was impossible for them to understand more difficult tactics .  Therefore , the communist troops developed a set of pithy formula , which the pilots recited whenever they were followed by a rattlesnake missile .  After reciting the formula , they turned a sharp angle to try to shake off the missile .  
However , it was utterly impossible for China , overwhelmed by a dark political situation and turmoil and chaos of war , with the masses living in dire poverty and in a miserable state , to catch up with the advanced trend of developing science and technology in the world .  
On the decisive factors in the outcome of war , he said : Taiwan 's weaknesses in terms of political , geographical , climatic , war potential and other factors are things that no advanced weaponry can make up .  Take its geographical conditions for an example .  Taiwan 's geographical environment is such that it is impossible to bring the maximum capability of high-performance weapons into play .  
Even the F-16 is just a light aircraft , and what Taiwan has bought are the basic A and B models .  The improved C and D models are not sold to Taiwan because the Americans think that these planes are too powerful in their ability to hit ground targets .  As for the F-15 which is even more powerful in its air control and attack capabilities , it is all the more impossible for the Taiwan authorities to lay hands on in spite of the fact that they have expressed their interest time and again .

Second , our country 's economic restructuring has entered a crucial stage , and industries are in a historical stage of large-scale readjustment .

Wang Chiaying , who was in charge of conducting the poll , warned the Hong Kong Government that , popular discontent is extremely deep and the prospects of the economy is also bleak at a time when prices are dropping on the housing market and stock market and there are frequent cases of shoddy construction work and bureaucratic malfeasance , it is entirely impossible for Tung Chee-hwa to dodge these problems .  He said : " It is not a packaging problem now .  
Right now , our party is ruling in a large nation with a population of more than 1.2 billion , Jiang Zemin pointed out .  Without a large number of leading cadres that combine political integrity with professional ability , it is definitely impossible to lead the people of all nationalities throughout the country to push forward our arduous cause of modernization under the complex international and domestic situation .  
As a matter of fact , it is impossible for the Chinese enterprises to head for the entire world without choice now .  We should first proceed from our own comparative advantages to select those regions that have their own comparative advantages , and make investment and set up factories there .  For instance , we should first gain access to the developing countries , the states of the former Soviet Union , the regions adjacent to West China , and so on .  
As regards human rights , Li Peng has stressed and pointed out : It is impossible to demand that various countries follow the same viewpoint or mechanically transplant the same mode on the question of human rights , for human rights is an integral concept , and complete and common human rights should include not only the political rights of citizens but also the economic , social , and cultural rights , especially the right of survival and the right of development . 
As the social systems , historical backgrounds , cultural traditions , economic levels , living quality , religious beliefs , senses of value , and so on of all countries in the world differ in thousands of ways and it is impossible to ask every country to indiscriminately copy one model and one system .  
Zhu Rongji pointed out that according to the experience in cracking down on smuggling last year , without improving and using advanced technical means and modern information technology , it is impossible to effectively crack down on the cunning criminal gangs and safeguard the economic legal system and national interests .  Therefore , at present , we must seize the time to improve the " golden customs project " and the " golden taxation project . "  
However , it is expected to be nearly impossible that the two sides will sign any substantive agreement on forming free trade ties in the near future , and even less probable they will establish a " China-ASEAN free trade zone , " because that will involve a lot of complicated issues .  
After Federal Associate Justice Stephens was defeated in the partisan struggle in the Federal Supreme Court , he said helplessly : " Although it is impossible for us to be one hundred percent sure who will be the real winner in this year 's presidential election , but who is the failure is very clear , that is , the people have lost their confidence in the justices ' position of being just and selfless defenders of laws and are worried about the partisan struggle . "  
3 .  The faction that thinks it is impossible to maintain the status quo , but readjustment should be made gradually : Japan 's demand to become a political and military big country will become an irresistible trend in Japan 's political arena in the future .  The United States can only pay attention to the regional power structure and the popular will at home , and readjust bilateral relations step by step in accordance with such demand .  
If there is a long-term drop off in grain prices , the readjustment of the agricultural structure will be delayed , the shift of the surplus rural workforce will be impeded , and it will be impossible to boost the income of the farmers , which may result in a setback to the enthusiasm of the farmers and shake the agricultural foundation , thus jeopardizing the entire national economy .  
Although it is impossible to make a concrete judgment before the detailed rules for the implementation of the policy are promulgated , yet the fact that foreign and domestic investors compete with one another to trade B shares in the same markets and their profits and losses are inevitably reflected in the balance of international payments in foreign exchange shows that , after all , extremely important progress has been made even though we can not say that the free convertibility of renminbi is right under our noses . 
The department concerned said that the incident broke out after some staff and workers found it impossible to adapt to new production requirements introduced in the wake of the factory 's technological transformation , and learned that the factory had decided to lay them off or divert them to other posts .  
In stipulating the safety requirements for a petrol filling station , the Government , in accordance with international standards , will divide the station into three zones , i.e . zones where accumulation of inflammable vapour is common , possible or impossible .  In the first two zones , all electrical installations , e.g . pumps , fluorescent tubes , etc . , must be explosion-proof , fireproof and safe in themselves .  
He perfectly choreographed to wonderful music together with his masterful sleight of hands into fast-paced magic show , taking his audience to his wondrous magical world .  He is at all times faithful to the principle " The magician 's secret lies in the art of uniting dream and reality " and that " nothing is impossible " .  
As far as some other A-level practical subjects , such as technical and computer subjects are concerned , the practical examinations have been abolished after the introduction of TAS . This is because of the short duration and more complex nature of the practical tests involved and hence it is impossible to fully assess the candidates ' performance in the application of technical skills in one single practical examination .  
The Marre Report on the Future of the English legal profession , published in 1988 , stated that " It is extremely difficult to define the need for legal services .  Unmet need is impossible to quantify . . .  It would be hard to develop research techniques which would give a reliable profile of unmet legal need broken down by type of problem and geographical area " .  
Mixing skylines from both cities form an imaginary chart .  The " City Cookie " goes one step further to allow people to have a bite of this crispy sky , and the " Sky-Eaters " will then experience how to make the impossible possible .  For Ho Siu-kee , the locus of cultural and spiritual identity is situated within one 's own bodies .  At the site of the body , knowledge of the world may be tested and even elaborated into myths .  
Almost all the edible things found on earth , be they livestock , poultry , seafood or fruit and vegetables , have been incorporated into delicious dishes by skilled Chinese chefs . Recently , however , the rapid growth of a modern commercial society has made it impossible for most people to go home to eat their mid-day meal .  
The next day the crowds of people were replaced by piles of trash , and the sugary white beaches had changed color , littered with bits of exploded firecrackers that were impossible to clean up .  
Nevertheless , although it is impossible to fully articulate the original cultural environment , still , the ultimate meaning behind the culture on the psychological level can transcend time and space and be expressed on the stage .  
Exercise : The Stepping Stone to Rehabilitation : Taking sufferers from infantile paralysis as an example , Wu says that if no rehabilitation treatment is administered , lower limbs are too weak to support the body and normal walking is impossible . Excessive joint friction , ineffectual muscles , and numbness are common consequences , resulting in " second-degree disability . " Some cerebral palsy victims sometimes reach the point where their entire bodies need rehabilitative treatment , Wu explains .  
When instant noodles first appeared on the market in Taiwan more than 20 years ago - - convenient , tasty and suited to the rapid pace of industrial society as they are - - they were an instant success . But their uniformity of flavor and inability to " fill you up " made it impossible for modern-day people who are pressed for time but still picky about their food to make them a staple of their diet .  
It was not long before they came to accept this as natural - - if you wanted to get ahead then you had to actively take part in the League , national mass study organizations and social work . Moreover , there could be no questioning of communist thinking ; otherwise one would be seen as a rebel and expelled from the League , making further study impossible .  
It 's Not a Battle Between Ecology and Development ! : Huang Ta-pang , who has worked in the PBM for over 40 years , states that the marble now imported from Italy , which has excellent color , superior quality , and few cracks or fissures and is easily processed , is already the finest available material . And it is n't expensive . The costs of mining in Taiwan are high , and even if you just figure in the best mines , it is still impossible to compete .  
Besides Premier Hau , there are a few others Teng has sworn to give up , such as legislator Lin Cheng-chieh , whose voice Teng describes as " splitting bamboo " ; former DPP Secretary-General Chang Chun-hung , who always has a " tragic " or " concerned " expression on his brow , and " is n't humorous in the least " ; or the " too handsome " vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council Ma Ying-jeou . All of them are impossible to imitate because of " innate limits . "  
Inviting trouble : As industry developed and the surrounding environment gradually became polluted , it became nearly impossible to find delicious fresh water fish and shrimp in low-lying areas . Thus the clean , ku-producing upstream portion of the Tsengwen River and its tributary the Tanayiku River became coveted by poachers .  
The price of falconry : If you want the hawks to have glossy and healthy-looking plumage , be vigorous and formidable , fly high , and aim sure , as they do in the wild , it takes a lot of time and effort . Given modern lifestyles , it 's impossible for most people to find the patience or time to take care of the " troublesome , " tempestuous animals from morning to night .  
In that age when medical care was scarce , it was often impossible to do anything for people infected by disease . In addition , workers in the mines often faced unpredictable dangers , and there was periodic havoc wrought by fire or flood .  
Perhaps he concentrated too intently on the glottal , natural style of traditional singing . When receiving Western style vocal training at the Institute of Art , for a while Buhe could not sing at all . The contradictions made him ponder whether it was not impossible to express traditional songs using the abdominal singing techniques of the West .  
Perhaps a philosophy of life and death can be free from objectivity , formality , and rigidity , but it has the opposite critical problem of becoming personalized , and freely verified only in one 's own mind , so it is impossible to come to a common spiritual consensus .  
His eldest daughter Chung Yu-ching retorts that there is less and less field work to be done , and at home appliances have taken over many tasks formerly done by hand , so it 's impossible to insist that modern women live like those in the past . In Taiwan , young people share a common backdrop to their upbringings , a common language , and a great deal of information . The impact of traditional family education is waning , and can not overcome social values , schooling , and peer interactions .  
For example , in 1964 the MOP stated that in order to develop science and technology , if it proved impossible to find qualified persons at home , foreign nationals could be hired on a contract basis for scientific or technical posts which did not involve national secrets . In 1984 the MOE declared that secondary and tertiary institutions could employ foreign nationals .  
Since , Chen argued , it is impossible to be completely loyal to two separate entities at the same time , it is only proper that parliamentarians should give up dual nationality . Following this logic , the government stipulated in the 1991 amendments to the Election and Recall Law that those elected as representatives must give up foreign citizenship before they are sworn into office .  
In Kaohsiung , factories in the industrial district begin spewing out smoke of a strange color . In office buildings in the city 's commercial district , air conditioning units large and small come to a halt . It becomes impossible for more than 300,000 households in the Kaohsiung-Pingtung area to generate the enticing smells of food being cooked . . . .  
Folk popular , doctor disdainedBecause the Taiwanese medical establishment now follows mainstream Western medicine , many doctors say that hypnosis is " a mysterious art that is impossible to understand and hard to make sense of . " They regard such folk practices as spells , charms to calm people shocked by ghosts , and the trances of jitongs , as just plain superstitious and ridiculous . And as for meditation , yoga and Zen contemplation , these they view as the realm of religion , completely distinct from the domain of science .  
But after many years of development , densely populated Hong Kong has a shortage of living space , and the developed area of the colony has steadily expanded . It has been impossible for Rennie 's Mill to avoid being drawn into these changes . And things get even more complicated when you consider what the coming of 1997 means , given the town 's political orientation .  
Having been busy for a while , by the time they got set up for a formal takeoff they noticed the sky darkening . But it proved impossible for them to resist the seduction of flying . "  
He wrote that " it is easy to move from frugality to luxury , but difficult to move from luxury to frugality . " It is impossible for even the most disciplined and fortunate families to achieve high rank in every generation , not to mention those families in which profligate playboys undo the accumulated achievements of their ancestors .  
It is the dangers posed to juvenile deer by wild dogs that causes concern . Nevertheless , today with human footsteps covering every stretch of the land , it is impossible to let the deer go completely wild . Not wanting to put all their eggs in one basket , project personnel hope to select repopulation locales in northern , eastern and southern Taiwan . Since they have been operating in Kenting ( in the south ) for 12 years now , Yangming-shan National Park ( in the north ) is being considered as the second locale .  
The opium that undermined China more than a century ago arrived through transnational trade , and the same thing is true of modern narcotics . In advanced countries drug production is strictly controlled , and it is virtually impossible to cultivate poppies ( for opium or heroin ) , coca ( for cocaine ) , or cannabis on a huge scale . Given the high demand for narcotics in these societies , the result is that supplies are inadequate , naturally forcing prices up .  
Against this background , Huang advises that it is inappropriate for students , lacking experience in society and with immature minds , to be allowed to participate in long-termed , closed activities like the summer camp . Moreover , he suggests , the government should regulate all religious activities that do not follow general practice or common sense . Otherwise , it is not impossible that similar crises of family and social ethics will again occur .  
She says frankly that the thing a judge fears most is breaking a big case " in an ugly way , " when the physical evidence at the scene has been destroyed in rescuing the survivors , making it impossible to take samples which could be submitted for scientific analysis ( for example , DNA matching for bloodstains ) . In such cases , there are only the court witnesses and the eyewitnesses ' indirect evidence , which are much less persuasive .  
Although the surveyors were very hesitant to reopen the dispute , in order to complete their duties as civil servants they just put their heads down and plowed ahead , notifying the two to come out and identify their boundary . As expected , each of the two had his own version . But at least now there was a formal record that could be taken to a mediation committee for a compromise solution , thus allowing the surveyors to get through this risky " mission impossible . "  
It was discovered that in maledominated jobs-the military and police , construction workers , machinists-men use various roundabout methods to " mark their territory . " Thus posters of naked women , impossible to avoid seeing , are put up in factories . Or construction workers will urinate openly right in front of passing women . It even happens that women scholars doing field research or female students supporting labor rights may find themselves in dangerous situations in such environments .  
Music critic Wang Hen only partly agrees with this assessment . He thinks Wong is a quite outstanding conductor , and that this year in particular he raised his game a notch . Moreover , his ability to coordinate each section of musicians is rare indeed ; otherwise it would be impossible to bring together musicians from different places , of different ages , and with different habits , and produce a quality sound in only a short rehearsal period .  
If the scope of liberalization is too broad , problems will result . If there is total liberalization , then future owners need not actually farm the land . Given that illegal use of farmland for non-agricultural purposes is already widespread , it would be almost impossible to regulate future use at all if land need not be owned by farmers themselves . Rampant speculation , a food crisis , or other severe problems might ensue .  
However , it was often impossible for more distant locales , like Fujian and Guangdong , to receive the official almanac in a timely fashion . Attracted by economic incentives , local practitioners of the occult began privately publishing their own books ; these included much additional material on the rules for occult calculations .  
Zhuangzi ( Chuang-tzu ) states that if one 's view of the world is clouded by preconceptions and expectations , then it is impossible to live beyond the physical limitations faced by ordinary human beings , for one is not living in harmony with the " Dao " of the universe .  
Kuo says that it is impossible to see how Diamond Stage had real respect for these low-status people . Most of the time in the " social concern segments " was spent in bantering among the hosts ( who got their start doing vulgar " dinner shows " ) and the guest star . Was it supposed to express respect just because the hosts bowed and said something like " that looked like hard work " at the end ?  
Nevertheless , it was only in the 1990s that homosexual writing really became prominent in literary circles in Taiwan and became a fad . G &amp; L Magazine founder James An points out that in recent years there has been a flurry of Chinese-language homosexual literature . Works of gay literaure have won lucrative prizes in all categories-novels , novellas , and short stories . It is impossible to deny the achievements of this body of work .  
For the whole global village to be improved into an enormous " aseptic chamber " is surely impossible , but what we can predict is that if humans do not change their attitudes towards the environment and nature , and if they continue to pay scant regard to safe practice in medical treatment and the use of drugs , new viruses and infectious diseases will never stop appearing .  
A Miss Chou , who works for a publisher , recalls that when her mother-in-law was close to death , they shoved a thick tube down her throat to keep her breathing , which not only made it impossible for her to give instructions but also twisted her mouth into hideous shapes . It was such a contrast from her usual calm and peaceful visage , and made her look both scared and in pain .  
Studies abroad suggest that adult sexual problems such as exposure , fetishes , impotence , or premature ejaculation are all related to repression of sexuality in early childhood . Sufferers of these problems find it impossible to have normal adult sexual relationships , which leads to a terrible loss of happiness over their entire lives .  
Council for Cultural Affairs vice chairman Wu Chung-li says that in the future , traditional theater will be incorporated into the overall project . In the future , will Taiwan produce a true celebrity of the theater ? And will young people become avid fans of theatrical stars ? Though these questions are impossible to answer , many students have already discovered the bountiful universe that is the theater .  
At the tenth anniversary of Tiananmen , preventive measures by the mainland authorities made substantive attacks against the government impossible . But participants in a symposium on " The May Fourth Movement and 20th-Century China " at Peking University in early May could scarcely fail to expand on the stated theme , to touch on the currently most sensitive topics of democracy , human rights and freedom which were the issues behind Tiananmen . Hence the symposium was full of the sense that " all history is contemporary history . "  
She explains : " Kaohsiung 's industrial structure has long stagnated around the petrochemical and steel industries . Not only is output value low , the environmental costs are very high , and it is almost impossible to raise the quality of life for local citizens . " Upgrading the local industrial structure , she believes , requires devoting more attention to technology . Therefore she hired experts in electronic commerce from Taiwan and from abroad and founded her own company , through which she hopes to improve the e-commerce capabilities of Kaohsiung companies .  
As a result of this dramatic flux there was a wholesale and merciless reshuffling of national wealth , which widened the gap between rich and poor , made it impossible for most people to afford their own homes and severely penalized those who had blindly invested in the stockmarket . These factors , along with ballooning consumer prices and a general sense of restless anxiety , seriously undermined the traditional work ethics of practicality and diligence .  
Because past surveys of Taiwan faults were mostly limited to examinations of surface geology , with no money to obtain more precise results by digging or drilling under the surface , major mistakes were common . Particularly in metropolitan areas where high real estate prices mean that all the land is covered by buildings , ruptures are impossible to see .  
The problem was eventually fixed through the combined efforts of a number of American computer scientists . Realizing that the increasing size and complexity of computer networks made it impossible for any individual to discover all the holes within them , these scientists established the Computer Emergency Response Team ( CERT ) at Carnegie-Mellon University . They hoped that by working together , network security issues could be predicted and resolved .  
In 1996 , President Lee Teng-hui was far ahead of his rivals all the way , and the election was lopsided . This year , the most prominent feature of the campaign is exactly the opposite : The three main candidates are running neck-and-neck , and the election battle is fierce . It is impossible right now to say who might win , and will probably remain so right up to the finish .  
But it is only actual governing that tests one 's true staying power . Scholars have stated that the 2000 election in Taiwan has three special characteristics : For one thing , this is the first time the opposition has a very real possibility of taking the reins of government . Secondly , the three leading candidates are so close it is impossible to tell who will win . And third , whatever the outcome , this is the beginning of Taiwan 's post-strongman era .  
But another music industry professional , MTV Taiwan 's programming and creative department supervisor Dennis Yang , has a different point of view . " It 's impossible to change the commercialization and unsophisticated taste of pop music , " he says . As for awards being given to Pur-dur and other similar artists , he feels it is good to encourage the creation of works with different creative perspectives . " But it 's still impossible to create a popular demand in the market for works that have lost contact with commercial taste . "  
In particular , the group lambasted the government for the NT $ 200 million it had spent in vain on a reconstruction plan designed by academics that was impossible to implement . They argued that the new government 's chief concerns should instead be with practical measures such as instituting work management controls and tracking down how reconstruction money was embezzled after the quake . It called upon the government to put an end to the tradition of plans that are unfeasible and good for nothing but creating a lot of hot air .  
Q : As you yourself have mentioned , underworld figures often launder their public image by getting involved in politics , and it is extremely difficult to do anything about it . Previous Justice Ministers Liao Cheng-hao and Ma Ying-jeou both had excellent reputations as able and incorruptible men , yet neither was able to overcome the influence of black gold . It almost looks like " mission impossible . " Do you feel confident of your ability to carry out this mission ?  
Later , because strong winds and heavy seas made landing impossible , the camera team 's plans were delayed . The next time they were able to land on the islet where the birds were filmed , the Chinese crested terns had already moved on , so the team missed the opportunity to observe them more closely .  
Many family pedigrees in the local area also provide evidence of the fearsome loss of life that occurred . The deluge even came to the attention of the emperor himself , who ordered the imperial granary to ship emergency rice supplies . It was impossible to dig separate graves for each of the victims , so they ended up laid to rest in four large pits . Expressing deep sorrow over the disaster , the emperor declared that the " spirits of the victims would all end up in heaven just like the rest of us . "  
But Liu 's father by no means encouraged Arthur to go into this field , and so he studied agricultural chemistry at National Taiwan University . But it proved impossible to resist his natural inclinations , and he ended up in the broadcast world anyway . Liu attended National Taiwan Normal University Affiliated High School , which had a relatively lively , open atmosphere .  
As Kung analyzes the situation , traditionally banks made their income from the differential between the interest paid on deposits and interest earned on loans ( this is called the " interest rate margin " ) . However , with competition as intense as it is today , banks have had to offer higher interest on deposits and lower-interest loans , so that over the last three years the differential has been , on average , only about two percent . It is virtually impossible for a bank to cover its operating costs with such a narrow margin .  
From the moment they say " I do , " they should be ready in their hearts and willing to take the bad along with the good . Why is it , then , that today 's couples , free to choose their partners , find it so difficult to honor their vows ? Some find it impossible to deal with hardship , and others , even after struggling to make it through a difficult stretch , are somehow unable to enjoy the sweet yields of their struggle .  
Of particular importance are these few sentences that capture the essence of Dan 's thinking : " It 's naturally difficult to search for nothing , yet when the substance is clearly defined you see the emptiness . It 's impossible to paint the spirit , yet when reality is reduced to its essence the spirit will be revealed . A painting that is chaotic and busy is largely superfluous . Only when emptiness and reality are arranged properly will the idea of the picture extend beyond the painting . "  
Apart from uneven levels of quality , the main reason why alternative medicine is not welcomed by the regulatory authorities or mainstream medical practitioners is that it is difficult or impossible to test the effectiveness of alternative treatments by scientific methods .  
While promoting his film in Taiwan , Zhang and local director Hou Hsiao-hsien engaged in a lengthy chat about their " ideal " martial arts film at Taipei Film House . Zhang pointed out that his film was set in the time immediately before the first Qin emperor had unified all of China . At that moment in history , it would have been impossible for people to foresee his eventual transformation into a tyrant ; therefore , the assassin is able to place trust in the emperor .  
Bambooware is made from lightweight materials , yet the finished product must be sturdy . But while sturdy , it must also be flexible . Unless all the bamboo strips are of the exact same thickness and width , it is virtually impossible to achieve a symmetrically shaped product . And the interstices must be of uniform dimension for a piece of bambooware to present attractive geometric patterns no matter what angle it is viewed from .  
It 's just that in comparison with the enormously powerful TNCs , domestic companies are still the runts of the litter , and only venture into relatively mature directions in their R &amp; D . Because it is impossible to alter this " hand-me-down-ism " in the short run , it is in Taiwan 's interest that foreign R &amp; D pace-setters are here , because future international industrial trends will be clearer , and local R &amp; D centers can avoid unnecessary detours .  
During the 80s , in conjunction with extensive land development , the capital costs of salt making and the quality of the final product made it impossible to compete with imported salt for market share . Furthermore , those willing to do the backbreaking work of exposing the salt to the sun were becoming harder to find .  
In the mid-1990 ' s , Taiwan 's IT industry began to take off , and every major company was fighting for the ever-decreasing , prime property at Hsinchu , making it nigh-on impossible to secure a spot there . Then , in July 1996 , after considering the levels of industrial development in the north and the south of Taiwan , the government began formulating a plan for a " Southern Taiwan Science Park " .  
When word got around about the teachers , Overseas Chinese rushed to sign up , so that the number of enrollments increased sharply to a figure far above that anticipated . Liu Shu-hui , principal of the Frankfurt Chinese School , who was in charge of organizing the event , began to worry that there would be too many students , so it would be impossible to give each the care and attention desired , thereby affecting the quality of the camp , and she began to refuse people .  
Last year , a group of teachers from all over Taiwan jointly authored a book entitled Pieces on Education Reform . The book 's main author , Lin Jung-tzu , explains that education reform has been led by officials , academics , and experts ; classroom teachers have been asked to simply follow along . But when the policies have proven impossible to implement , it has been the teachers who have been blamed for being unprogressive and conservative . In response , this group of teachers decided to give expression to their own genuine feelings .  
" This type of flexible class would have been impossible before the nine-year integrated curriculum , " says Li . Of course , she also does as is required and teaches three formal biology classes . While these classes may be rigid , she says , they must be attended to , since " if test scores are n't good , students will feel frustrated , and parents will protest . "  
The two suspects base this move on the obvious fact that there has been widespread advance media condemnation , which would make it impossible to select an impartial and uninfluenced jury in either country .  
If the present generation is unable to defeat growing poverty and secure employment opportunities for the already vast global army of the indigent , it will be impossible to ensure the peace and wellbeing in the developed regions of the world .  
In the absence of alternative hospital facilities readily accessible to refugees at more economical costs , the continual increase in the cost of services at private contracted hospitals made it impossible for the Agency to maintain its existing level of services without application of strict measures , including rationalization of referrals , reduction of the number of bed-days contracted and introduction of a system of cost-sharing for specialized hospital care .  
Unless management is given the ability and freedom to recruit professional staff of the highest calibre , from anywhere in the world and this can be done only if remuneration is internationally competitive and if Governments refrain from interfering in a fair selection process it will be hard , if not impossible , to achieve the continuous improvement in quality and efficiency that is rightly called for in the secretariats of United Nations organizations .  
Today , it is impossible to deny the existence of private entities and public bodies which , under a legal cover , conduct clandestine criminal operations as a parallel activity by hiring people who , in exchange for payment , agree to participate in the commission of unconscionable and illegal acts .  
Major pharmaceutical firms and suppliers of medical equipment and medical equipment spare parts , which had historically maintained trade links with Cuba , recently informed the Cuban authorities officially that since their products either contained United States components or were manufactured under United States technological licences which were affected by the ban imposed by the United States federal authorities , it was impossible to proceed with the deliveries .  
A people deprived of an entire pre-war self-sufficient economy and forced by the lack of farmland into a humiliating dependence on the administering Power was now faced with the well-nigh impossible task of absorbing the loss of thousands of jobs and resisting certain economic decline .  
As soon afterwards as 1968 the Proclamation of Tehran drew attention to the danger of this dissociation of human rights by proclaiming that : " Since human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible , the full realization of civil and political rights without the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights is impossible " .  
Very often the economic model on which structural adjustment programmes are based has made it impossible to overcome the particularly serious social problems of the countries concerned , especially poverty , and in some cases has increased the concentration of wealth , exclusion and marginalization .  
Indeed , it is impossible to conceive of global and sustainable economic and social progress based on fairness and solidarity without a comprehensive and coherent concept of cooperation for development including , as the Secretary-General has recalled , a vital ethical element and without conception and coordination here in the United Nations in way that is not disjointed , scattered and possibly inconsistent .  How can we give the United Nations sufficient authority and credibility to consider effectively in this forum major global economic issues ?  
It is needless to stress that the elimination of poverty and the attainment of the broader goal of sustainable development will remain impossible to achieve unless nations show renewed political resolve to implement policies aimed at enabling humankind to better manage and live with its environment , as agreed to at the Rio de Janeiro summit and at subsequent Conferences .  
Therefore , it is incumbent upon the international community and in particular the developed countries , to give the required attention and adequate assistance to help solve this crucial equation , because it is impossible to accept , in the context of interdependence , a world in which affluence is concentrated in a small number of countries while the majority of countries continue to struggle against increasing poverty and the gap between the rich and the poor grows inexorably wider .  
However , numerous social development projects have been discontinued and it has become apparent that it is impossible for us to make steady progress towards social development without an international environment conducive to our economic growth and overall development .  
The Working Group entrusted with this issue should also strive to reach an understanding on the possibility of harmonizing legal norms and existing national administrative procedures in the area of domestic control of weapons and in the import and export of arms , in order to establish a common and effective international arms control system that would make it impossible for arms to be diverted through clandestine or illicit channels .  
I believe that it would be a grievous setback for the Organization if , because of the current financial debate , it became impossible to retain MICIVIH , whose presence is essential to consolidate the Organization 's and Members States ' remarkable achievements in Haiti , and MINUGUA , whose presence is fundamental to realization of the best prospects that have ever existed to bring to an end the armed confrontation which has afflicted the people of Guatemala for 35 years .  
In other words , if the tax rules for various types of investment vehicles were not completely consistent , taxpayers could use derivatives to choose the tax treatment that they most desired ; moreover , achieving complete consistency was difficult if not impossible because various instruments differed in ways that were traditionally considered highly relevant to taxation , such as the predictable returns of a debt instrument versus the unpredictable returns on most equity investments . 
When repatriation proved impossible , local or regional integration was the most desirable solution , in particular when strong ethnic and cultural ties existed between refugees and their host country .  
Traditionally , technical assistance has been provided in the context of economic and social development , with the main emphasis on building and strengthening physical infrastructure and the executive arm of the Government ; assistance in governance beyond that was made virtually impossible by the political climate throughout most of the United Nations history .  
There can be no doubt that in adopting such provocative and extremist measures , which run radically counter to the will and direction of the international community , the Netanyahu Government is in fact pursuing a premeditated and programmed policy designed to demolish the forthcoming negotiations with the Palestinians , collapse the peace efforts of the United States of America and fabricate a climate of escalation that will make saving the peace process desperately difficult , if not impossible .  
However , objective reasons relating to shortage of time and staff made it impossible , at this stage , to produce a list of the countries and transnational corporations engaged in the illicit dumping of toxic and harmful products and wastes in the developing countries , particularly as the communications that were examined seemed to refer to only a very small proportion of the transboundary flow of toxic wastes and dangerous products . 
Taking into consideration the modest financial capabilities of the State , in this short period it has been impossible to supply the appropriate equipment and arms for the armed forces of the Republic of Macedonia at a level that would provide for an appropriate initial reaction or a possible urgent military action ;  
On the occasion of the fifteenth anniversary of the Israeli decision to annex the Golan on 14 December 1981 , the people of the Golan adopted a statement saying that they regarded the decision as null and void ; that they rejected it ; that they found it impossible to accept ; that it was incompatible with international law ; and that it ignored the fact that the manifest truth could not be misrepresented .  
With regard to the law that is applicable 29 , the commission held that the general principle that emerges , both from national practice and from international custom , is based on the presumption that the non _ fulfilment of a legal obligation is not justified , except to the extent that it may be demonstrated that it is impossible to proceed othewise than in a manner contrary to the law .
