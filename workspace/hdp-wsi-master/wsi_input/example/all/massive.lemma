"  
Now the western region should firmly seize the good opportunity for massive development , formulate a preferential policy , improve working conditions , and step up its efforts to bring in and use qualified personnel ; not only should it fully develop and utilize its own human resources but it should be able to retain qualified personnel and use them creatively ; moreover , it should make positive efforts to attract a large number of qualified personnel from developed areas and even from abroad to work for the massive development of the western region .  
As technological innovation is an important guarantee for enhancing competitiveness and achieving internationalization , Chinese household electrical appliance enterprises have not relaxed in technological innovation even for a moment after making it into the international market , investing massive human , material , and financial resources in technological innovation as well as marketizing , internationalizing , and commercializing it .  
In 1999 , various localities had , in line with the CPC Central Committee 's unified arrangements , conscientiously implemented the principle of " singing aloud the major theme song and of seizing well initiative , served the overall situation by concentrating efforts on the central task of economic construction , done a massive amount of meticulous work , and scored marked success .  
This time , in a seemingly serious manner , Cohen once again spread the word : " The Gulf area is confronted with the threat of ceaseless proliferation of massive antipersonnel biochemical weapons . "  The spearhead was directed at Iraq and Iran as though the Gulf countries ' urgent task were " to cope with biochemical-weapon attacks launched by Iraq and Iran , " and it would be too late if they did not buy American arms right now !  
Piracy has seriously disturbed the economic and cultural operational orders in the country and worsened the environment for national cultural industries ' survival , thus causing a massive drain on state revenues and causing cultural business units ' failure to gain an advantageous position in competition amid world economic integration by making it difficult for them to achieve effective accumulation and rapidly expand their industrial scale .  
In line with the special features that reconnaissance means should be applied to the future operational space - - air , sea , and ground - - in all weathers , this battalion launched a massive scientific and technological trailblazing campaign .  In accordance with the ways and means suggested by the officers and men , it worked out more than 30 new methods of operation to defend modern air raids , high-tech reconnaissance , and electronic welfare ; and transformed 108 camouflage devices .  
This many foreign investment companies and such an enormous amount of capital coming in have not only made China into the developing country making the greatest use of foreign capital in a short span of 20 years , in addition the massive influx of foreign goods , advanced technology and equipment , and scientific management experience is gradually changing the quality of the people 's lives , updating their traditional thinking and concepts , and becoming an indispensable part of the development of China 's economy .  
The implication is that the US army will take part in military actions not relating to wars staged in all places throughout the world .  These actions serve as an important complement to the strategy by which the US army has won two massive regional wars .  The action comprises keeping peace , achieving peace through mandatory measures , humanitarian assistance , rescue operations at home and abroad , providing disaster relief , and fighting terrorism and narcotics .  
In discussions of the question of joining the WTO , the thing some economists and local officials are most concerned about is that the massive influx of transnational companies will be a shock to the service , manufacturing , and agricultural industries in China , and they also express deep worries over native industries .  
After assuming office , however , Bush , out of consideration for relieving pressure from the US economic slowdown , first advanced a massive tax cut program and soon afterward announced the cancellation of " mandatory reduction targets " for major greenhouse gas emitters , overturning his campaign promise .  
While cracking a number of major criminal gangs , public security organs in various places have also launched massive offensives of political propaganda to thoroughly crush the psychological defense of criminals .  The " Strike Hard " campaign has thus won another batch of victories .  
The massive utilization of high-tech equipment has established a firm material foundation for joint combat , and at the same time it is giving an increasingly stronger intellectual and knowledge orientation to logistical support .  The contradiction between the lack of enough skilled specialists and the growing quantities of new and high-tech equipment will become more pronounced .  
Over the past few years , in order to seek the status as a so-called " independent political entity " in the international arena , the Taiwan authorities , in the name of expanding " international living space , " have devoted massive manpower and material and financial resources to pursuing " money diplomacy . "  
The US military has to spend a huge amount of fund to sustain the armed forces capable of fighting " two wars . "  This strategy requires that the United States maintain at least 1.4-million troops on active service .  Even with such a massive army , the Pentagon has to admit , the United States can only undertake less than a half of the war tasks .  
Guam is about 1,500 nautical miles from the Philippines . The US deployment of massive forces at this important " strategic supporting point " reflects the strategic thinking of the new Bush administration and will be conducive to launching a long-distance precision attack against the mainland 's coastal regions by US military within 12 hours .  
Our army is the massive pillar of the people 's democratic dictatorship .  The Constitution has entrusted us with the sacred duty of consolidating our national defense , resisting aggression , defending our motherland , and safeguarding the people 's labor in peace .  Moreover , to uphold the Party 's centralized power and unity of the state is our army 's basic prerequisite and necessary requirement to perform these duties .  
It is precisely these two " leaps " that have provided vast room for the development of the Japanese armed forces .  Thus , the self-defense forces are developing in the direction of long-range and massive weapons .  Moreover , Japan has joined hands with the United States to push ahead with the development of the Theater Missile Defense system in a bid to achieve absolute military superiority with which it " can both attack other countries and avoid attacks from them . "  
Li Tieying stressed : The development of the western regions is a massive and systematic project involving ecological environmental protection , infrastructure construction , industrial restructuring , scientific and technological education , reform and opening up , and ethnic and religious issues .  
In fact , the Taiwan authorities have never relaxed military preparations for " armed resistance to reunification . "  They have purchased a massive amount of advanced weaponry from foreign countries and sought to join the theater missile defense system in a bid to establish a certain disguised form of military alliance with the United States and Japan .  
He said : There were both subjective and objective reasons for the backwardness of the western region , and it also involved problems in policy , work , and natural conditions ; furthermore , conditions in various parts of the western region vary , and new problems will arise after stepping up the effort at development .  The large-scale development of the western region is a massive , complicated project , which calls for long-term , arduous efforts by people in various circles .  
From April to July this year , the ministry mobilized public security organs to conduct a massive special struggle of cracking down on traders in human beings to rescue women and children abducted for sale .  With the vigorous support of all sides in the society , public security organs at all levels meticulously organized and planned their action , and the large number of public security and people 's police officers worked unceasingly hard and struggled arduously .  
If war breaks out , the blows dealt to Taiwan 's economy can not be compared to a minor power cut or a major earthquake ; the financial securities market will fall into serious chaos , the stock market will dive , there will be massive exchange rate turbulence , foreign investment will be withdrawn , and the entire Taiwan economy may be paralyzed , so Taiwan will find it very difficult to fight a protracted war with the mainland .  
Wang noted that the UN should make more positive contributions to preventing massive humanitarian crises and the tragic mass killings of innocent civilians .  At the same time , it should be fully aware of the complexity of international intervention and the risk of inappropriate intervention .  
According to the source , the CPC holds that while in the process of " speeding up " industrialization , China is facing the rare opportunities of the extensive application of achievements in the scientific and technological revolution , the massive transformation of information technology , and the large-scale upgrading of traditional industries .  Hence , it must spur industrialization with informationization , give play to its advantage in " gaining the initiative by surpassing the early starters , " and strive to catch up from behind and realize the rapid development of the social productive forces .  
While their own countries carry out massive activities aimed at prohibiting smoking , developed countries on the contrary encourage sales of tobacco products to developing countries .  The majority of developed countries not only have not kept to their own promises regarding increasing official developmental support in international society , but have attempted through technological monopoly and trade barriers to conduct a " new economic colonialism " .  
In view of the grave situation where local and foreign triads are running rampant throughout the mainland and even infiltrating Chinese communist party and government organs , Beijing started a massive campaign to strike hard at triads across the land in September this year .  Initial results have been achieved .  After two months , 5,000 triad members involved in organized crime have been arrested .  
Giving play to China 's advantage in some resources , especially labor resource , means integrating the structural readjustment with giving play to our advantages and solving our employment problems .  We must and hard on the proper grouping of labor-intensive , capital-intensive , technology-intensive , and knowledge-intensive industries .  On the one hand , we must raise the technological standard of all sectors in the national economy , and on the other hand , we must create more jobs to enable massive shift of the agricultural population to the nonagricultural sectors .  
Because China 's relevant legal code is still not quite sound and comprehensive , its market mechanism not quite mature , and its capital market not fully open , some 70 percent of direct foreign investment in China are through joint venture and cooperation , with only a portion invested in wholly-owned companies .  Foreign investment through takeover and merger is still limited .  This will limit the massive flow of foreign capital .  
The development environment over the next five years suggests that the 10th Five-Year Plan will be implemented against a backdrop that is entirely different from the backdrop to all previous five-year plans - - one that is characterized by China 's impending accession to the World Trade Organization , the growing trend toward economic globalization , the close integration of domestic and foreign markets , a world swept up in a knowledge-based economy and a new technological revolution , and the launching of the strategy of developing western China on a massive scale .  
Li Peng said : The NPC Standing Committee must conscientiously exercise supervision over budgets and economic work in accordance with the law ; it must investigate , study , and put forward proposals on current major issues in the economic and social spheres , such as strengthening the status of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy , increasing farmer income , reforming state-owned enterprises , increasing job opportunities , implementing the strategy of developing western regions on a massive scale , joining the World Trade Organization , and implementing the strategy of seeking sustainable development .  
He said that while the financial turmoil had forced other countries to cut back on infrastructure and social programmes , Hong Kong 's excellent finances - with fiscal reserves of more than HK $ 450 billion - were allowing it to push ahead with massive investments .  
Because of our very strong fiscal reserves of HK $ 450 billion - ladies and gentlemen , the government has no debt - and with a budget surplus of 5.8% of our GDP in the current year , we are able to , through the budget recently announced for this year , continue with our massive plan of investment in infrastructure and education which will make Hong Kong much more efficient and competitive in the 21st Century . 
Because of our very strong fiscal reserves of HK $ 450 billion ( A $ 100 billion ) - the Government has no debt - and with a budget surplus of 5.8 per cent of our GDP in the past year , we are able to , through the budget announced in February this year , continue with our massive plan of investment in infrastructure and education which will make Hong Kong much more efficient and competitive in the 21st Century . 
" It is too simplistic - and also unfair - to judge our commitment to the free market by a single , extraordinary battle at a time of great economic turmoil , and when massive , secretive and destructive capital flows were creating havoc in the markets . "  
At the Financial Conference on Asia organised by the Trade Development Council today ( Thursday ) , Secretary for Financial Services , Mr Rafael Hui , in his speech entitled " What follows the Financial Turmoil " , warned that history would repeat itself without the joint effort of the international community in reforming the global financial architecture , and formulating new rules and strategies to cope with the massive and volatile capital flows in our globalised economy .

The traditional reluctance to inflict indiscriminate brutality is gone : in its place is a terrifying , lethal , religiously motivated determination ' to create massive , history-changing bloodshed ' , preferably of sufficient magnitude to destabilise , if not topple , the hated , infidel Western world .  
Behind this internationally accepted definition is the consensus that there is a qualitative difference between terrorist acts capable of inflicting massive and indiscriminate injury and damage to the public and ordinary criminal activities , such as criminal damage , assault or even murder . 
" The traditional reluctance to inflict indiscriminate brutality is gone : in its place is a terrifying , lethal , religiously motivated determination ' to create massive , history-changing bloodshed ' , preferably of sufficient magnitude to destabilise , if not topple , the hated , infidel Western world .  
The most aggravating worry of the ' 911 ' attacks is the conspicuous absence of traditional reluctance to inflict indiscriminate brutality : in its place is a terrifying , lethal , religiously motivated determination ' to create massive , history-changing bloodshed ' .  
With accelerated economic globalisation and rapid advances in technology , corruption today transcends national boundaries , and has taken on a new dimension .  It has become a means to facilitate and perpetuate syndicated crimes , including international money laundering schemes , massive commercial fraud scams , cross-border drug trafficking , smuggling of human beings and many other serious crimes .  
In commercial operation , there is also application of grid computing where intensive computing or massive data analysis is required , for example , in using random state simulation to analyse complicated financial environment , optimising product design , and pharmaceutical research and production .  
They spent only three odd years from conception of the idea to the implementation of the scheme and the finance committee approved the project only a year and a bit ago .  So within a very short period of time , they have introduced a highly complex , a very massive project and I 'm very grateful for the work by our Immigration colleagues in this regard .  
He began researching all aspects of the tale : T'ang dynasty dress , weapons , musical instruments , and the more complex task of creating visual imagery for a complete undersea realm . As the cartoon required massive investments , Hu felt it should be understandable to an international audience .  
Taiwan has graduated from the labor intensive , living-room factory economy to the sophisticated economy of capital intensive industries , computer components and massive investment in R &amp; D . Industry and government realized that in order to maintain profit margins in this new and highly competitive environment , Management Science would have to assume a greater role in directing the development of Taiwan 's economic future .  
Strolling amidst Huisun Forest , one 's spirits are refreshed by the cool , moist air . Brilliant butterflies tumble about above azaleas encircling massive tree trunks , as a nimble civet darts soundlessly through the trees . A faint mist adds a touch of poetry to it all . Everywhere is quiet , broken only by the sounds of Nature - - birdsong , cricket calls , and the sudden " swish " of a macaque monkey swinging overhead .  
The narcissus dish pictured here , when observed from the front , stares directly at you with its two large eyes , while its pair of massive pincers serve as the supporting feet of the vessel . It seems as though the narcissus is growing on the body of the crab , making quite an interesting picture , much like the ancient legend of the mountain of the immortals upon the sea , which rested on the back of a huge tortoise .  
At that time , countries all over the world operated on the gold standard , and gold was also required for international trade . It was partly thanks to this shipment of gold that Taiwan , which only had commodities such as tea and sugar to export and which relied on imports for all manufactured goods , was gradually able to transform itself from an agricultural to an industrial society , and to go from having a massive trade deficit to holding foreign exchange reserves which now rank among the world 's largest .  
The changing face of Hakka womenIn recent years there has been a massive outflow of population from Hakka villages . Most young people have left to pursue their studies or careers . Even for those left behind , traditional Hakka values are fading in young people because of increased education , the impact of the mass media , and multifarious interactions with other ethnic groups .  
Looking at the past , the last wave of stock fever-with its tidal wave cresting past the 10,000 mark , then falling with devastating force-ended up in a massive redistribution of wealth in Taiwan . When the market is unhealthy , it can be manipulated , and naturally the rich ended up richer and the poor , poorer . Moreover , the huge financial losses of the last cycle disrupted countless families and bankrupted many businesses .  
It is true that after the financial crisis struck there was no massive fall in the value of the Yen , but the combination of external pressures and internal difficulties-in the form of an overall default rate on bank lending of 14% , the collapse of several financial institutions , and the economic sluggishness which has dogged Japan for the last seven years-has been enough to leave the Japanese government bruised and battered .  
But in the last few years , with dramatic changes in the political environment , skyrocketing property prices , massive stock market swings , political graft financed by money-laden conglomerates , and an unstable labor market , workers ' " sense of comparative exploitedness " has grown ever more acute , and their mood has become far more volatile . "  
" Maybe the conditions for seed germination are very specific and furthermore , they are unknown , " says Jose Luis Leon de la Luz , a botanist affiliated with the CIB . No matter how the plant manages to pass through the eons , its natural proliferation is not sufficient to sustain massive cutting for a hungry market . One fact should be borne in mind : If damiana products are to be used in large quantities , damiana plants should be plentiful .  
The first is globalization , which has had a dual impact . For one thing it has led to a massive expansion of the international labor force , with developing countries that previously shunned capitalist competition now hurling themselves into it , adding over a billion workers from places like mainland China , India and Eastern Europe . At the same time we have the globalization of international trade , with capital and technology increasingly free to circulate rapidly around the world .  
The devastating 21 September earthquake of 1999 left Taiwan 's landscape covered in scars , but researchers discovered that the places least damaged by the quake were areas of natural forest . In mountain regions where the rainfall is most abundant , the geology most fragile and erosive forces most powerful , the false cypresses , with their massive trunks and mighty root systems , cling tightly to the frail earth .  
( " Long-period " comets come from a more distant , spherical region-the Oort Cloud . ) From ground-based observations and space missions , astronomers have already gained a degree of understanding of the more massive bodies in the solar system , and their satellites . But because the bodies at the outer limits of the solar system are of such small diameter and low brightness , they are not easily observed , and can only be studied if they move into orbits that bring them closer to the sun , as comets .  
The combined population of countries running socialist economies either now or in the past comes to over 3 billion , or 44% of the world 's total population . The major socialist economies include mainland China ( 1.2 billion ) , India ( 1 billion ) , and the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe ( 0.3 billion ) . Since the collapse of socialism , the massive labor pool of these nations has gradually been incorporated into the global capitalist economy .  
COA chairman Chen Hsi-huang , who earned his degree in agricultural economics at National Taiwan University ( NTU ) notes that Taiwan 's agricultural policies used to stress increased production-producing as much as possible on the limited land available . Consequently , Taiwan-produced canned champignon mushrooms and asparagus commanded 65% of the international market . Coupled with the export of massive amounts of sugar , rice , and bananas , this stimulated the formation of capitalistic agriculture which , in turn , helped prepare the way for the subsequent take off of industry .  
In the same way , the demand for seafood increased when Taiwan 's economy took off . Taking advantage of this favorable situation , aquaculture began sprouting up on the west coast . At one point , coastal counties were waterlogged with fully 58,000 hectares of fish farms , causing massive erosion problems . With the widespread smuggling of seafood from the PRC in recent years , aquacultural land in Taiwan has dropped to 40,000 hectares as fisheries have shifted operations to mainland China .  
Two years back Taiwan experienced a major earthquake . Last year there were landslides and massive flooding here , and also the horrific 911 incident in New York . And most recently Taiwan has faced a drought . Some of these are natural disasters , some are man-made , and some are natural disasters made worse by human action .  
Ku enthusiastically consults with people from all areas , and has done his utmost to assist domestic research in fields related to welding . Ku also contributes by " resuscitating " expensive machinery damaged by human errors or natural disasters , thus helping industry and educational institutions reduce the massive financial losses that can result from such events . While his work has guaranteed that machinery works , he has helped even more people by passing the torch of his knowledge on to his students .  
The mainland is a massive country , and the distance between urban areas is huge . Profits from distribution and retailing of books and magazines are small , even though the ' planned economy ' is gradually being dismantled , and soon it will be far too difficult to set up a wide-ranging logistics and shipping network . Because of this , some publishers are choosing not to sell through bookstores , instead looking for an alternative way , facing their own technological difficulties on the way .  
Although pressure for economic reform is gaining momentum in the international community , the PRC authorities see control of information as the final line of defense , and thus keep a tight grasp on it . However , this is already being put to the test by Western and Japanese companies , through running their own advertising fronts and licensing out their titles , staking their claims before the complete lifting of restrictions , and using their massive capital bases to secure their positions .  
On June 8th , after the news broke , even before the sales of the normal boxed lunches at midday , there were already massive queues of eager customers waiting at the station cafeteria . Since the display for the nostalgia lunches still had n't been set up , the TRA assumed that the crowd were queuing for train tickets , and paid them no heed .  
Aside from the massive popularity of the Nostalgia Lunches , domestic convenience store chains are also paying attention to this virgin market . Starting a couple of years ago , one after another they started offering different kinds of local packed lunches , starting a " biandang war , " - one would offer theirs for NT $ 40 , so a competitor would drop theirs to NT39 , all promoting their lower prices .  
In the region threatened by bird flu , Taiwan alone has remained clean . There have been sporadic outbreaks of fowl pest around the island , but thus far they have all involved the less pathogenic and less virulent H5N2 virus strain , which does not infect humans . This is why , with the massive cull of poultry leading to a shortage of chickens in several Asian countries , Taiwanese chickens have unexpectedly become much sought after , with orders coming in from various neighboring territories .  
The first typhoon to strike Taiwan this year , Typhoon Mindulle , swept in from the southwest at the start of July , bringing with it torrential rains and powerful winds and causing massive landslides and coastal flooding . Once again , having been through the disasters of the 921 earthquake of 1999 and 2001 ' s Typhoons Toraji and Nari , the people of central Taiwan faced the hardship of losing livelihoods and loved ones .

According to Mr . Turneb Delp , spokesman for the Front national pour le changement et la d \ x { 5e66 } ocratie , the elections could not be free and democratic since the Provisional Electoral Council was composed mostly of members who were close supporters of President Aristide or of the parties making up the presidential coalition , and the elections were marred by massive fraud .

KODELLAS ( Greece ) , speaking in exercise of the right of reply , said that for the past 21 years it had been indisputable that the Cyprus problem was a clear case of the violation of the territorial integrity , unity and sovereignty of an independent State , of massive human rights violations and of the artificial division of a country by military force . 
Before the year 2000 , a global initiative should be launched by the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , the World Bank , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and other interested organizations with the support of donor countries in order to facilitate the efforts of the developing countries to develop and implement a massive effort to bring electrical power to the people in rural and isolated areas , based on successes already achieved in renewable energy technologies , such as photovoltaic , wind and mini-hydro ;

The Chinese delegation expresses its profound concern at the large-scale military offensive launched by Israel in recent days in southern Lebanon , which has resulted in the loss of innocent civilian lives , the massive destruction of property and a large number of civilians ' becoming homeless or refugees , consequently further escalating the conflict in southern Lebanon and aggravating the already tense situation .  
While unnecessary , wanton humiliations of the law-breaking State would surely be inappropriate , one finds it difficult to see - for example - how a State guilty of such a crime as a deliberate armed attack and invasion , or deliberate , systematic , massive violations of human rights or self-determination should not be required to offer guarantees that , while preserving its independent statehood and territorial integrity , could be viewed as incompatible with such a formal attribute of a State as its " dignity " .  
Their continuing massive campaign of rearmament , in the context of the " joint defence doctrine " with Greece , their provocative activities , inflammatory rhetoric and harmful propaganda , coupled with a refusal to sit at the negotiating table , have taken their toll on the already inimical relations between the two communities .  
I hope the Turkish side will respond positively to my proposal , otherwise the only logical inference to be drawn will be that the massive presence of Turkish forces is not for the alleged safety of the Turkish Cypriot community , but for the perpetuation of the status quo , which , as stated in your report , has been created by military force and is sustained by military strength and which the Security Council has deemed unacceptable .  
In this regard , the Special Rapporteur expresses his deep concern at the continued detention of many political prisoners , in particular elected representatives , and the recent arrests and harassment of other supporters of democratic groups in Myanmar , culminating at the end of September 1996 in the massive arrests of NLD supporters and the virtual blockade of the Secretary General of NLD in her compound .

At the World Food Summit recently held in Rome , which it would have been more appropriate to call the " World Hunger Summit " , the rich countries had harped shamelessly on human rights , while destroying food surpluses in order to keep prices high , despite the fact that satisfying one 's hunger was a fundamental human right and that the starvation of millions was the most flagrant , massive and systematic violation of the right to life .  
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by seventeen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a land-locked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
UNICEF 's multifaceted activities have included the massive struggle waged to control the menace of epidemic diseases in the 1950s ; efforts to integrate children 's needs into the overall development agenda in the 1960s ; the commitment to provide basic social services to children in the 1970s ; the campaign for child survival and development in the 1980s ; and , in the closing decade of this century , efforts to support Governments in ensuring the protection of the rights of children , in particular those in especially difficult circumstances .  
countries , migration pressures due to climatic change , the protection of migrant women and children from abuse by their sponsors , the right of receiving countries to regulate access to their territory , the adverse consequences of forced migration , the situation of persons whose asylum claims have been rejected , the trafficking in women and children , prostitution and coercive adoption , and the sudden and massive arrival of refugees and displaced persons in need of international protection .  
Nevertheless , the conflict that engulfed eastern Zaire and the sudden and large-scale return of Rwandans from Zaire and the United Republic of Tanzania at the end of 1996 posed unprecedented challenges for UNHCR , both in terms of providing humanitarian assistance in the midst of conflict and of supporting massive reintegration in a fragile post-conflict environment .  
That exclusion was largely acceptable because insolvencies of financial services institutions usually required prompt and discrete action ( for instance to avoid massive withdrawals of deposits ) and were , for that reason , administered under special regulatory regimes in various States .  
The occupation of others territory ; widespread and massive violation of basic human rights , including the right to self-determination ; the forceful imposition of the will of one over the entire region through coercion , intimidation and official state terrorism ; the disruption of regional security and stability ; arms race ; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; the rejection of the demands of the international community ; and even the violation of commitments willingly undertaken under the so-called peace process constitute the main causes of the Middle East crisis .

Greatly concerned , the Islamic State of Afghanistan wishes to request you to take appropriate preventive measures in order to halt the planned massive military assault which would inevitably entail the loss of many lives of the innocent civilian population .  
Meanwhile , as is clear from the above , the international community of States has unequivocally admitted that the Abkhaz separatists are still pursuing " ethnic cleansing " by using the most barbaric methods in the territory under their control , leading to the massive destruction and forcible expulsion of the Georgian population , who had made up half the total population of Abkhazia before the conflict .  
Even under the situation where the United States and the south Korean authorities defiantly opposed the DPRK 's proposal for tripartite talks , the great leader took the positive step of mobilizing 150,000 Korean People 's armymen for peaceful construction in 1986 to defuse the tension on the Korean peninsula and advanced a proposal on 23 July 1987 for a massive phased reduction of the armed forces and declared a unilateral reduction of 100,000 of the People 's Army forces as a subsequent practical measure .  
Following the rapid and massive return of refugees in late 1996 and early 1997 , UNICEF focused on quickly expanding essential services in Rwanda , such as health , nutrition , education and social services , to meet the urgent needs of returning children .

The Special Rapporteur expresses his deep concern at the continued detention of many political prisoners , in particular elected representatives , and the recent arrests and harassment of other supporters of democratic groups in Myanmar , culminating in the massive arrests of NLD supporters and the virtual blockade of the General Secretary of NLD in her compound .  
That mandate is underlined by the Secretary-General in paragraph 11 of his report submitted pursuant to paragraph 2 of Security Council resolution 808 ( 1993 ) ( S / 25704 ) , in which he recalled that the Council had condemned the practice of ethnic cleansing and the massive , organized and systematic detention and rape of women , and reaffirmed that those who commit or have committed or order or have ordered the commission of such acts will be held individually responsible in respect of such acts .

Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by eighteen years of war , and underlining the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards a sustainable economic and social development , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a landlocked , least-developed and war-stricken country ,  
The profound and rapid changes we are witnessing at the international level prompt us to think collectively about the future of our peoples and the importance that should be given to dialogue and consultation in a world that , thanks to technological progress and massive international exchanges , has become a true global village .  
For instance , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions has continued to receive information about massive displacements of populations which have occurred mainly in the context of armed conflicts , including indiscriminate military attacks against civilians during counter-insurgency operations , attacks by irregular armed groups , and communal violence .  
Widespread abuses appear to be ongoing within the context of an oppressive military presence , continuing environmental damage and the cultural subordination of indigenous people in the face of the massive exploitation of resources by powerful multinational corporations .  
In this regard , the Special Rapporteur expresses his deep concern at the continued detention of many political prisoners , in particular elected representatives , and the recent arrests and harassment of other supporters of democratic groups in Myanmar , culminating at the end of September 1996 in the massive arrests of NLD supporters and the virtual blockade of the Secretary _ General of the NLD in her compound .

Nevertheless , the conflict that engulfed eastern Zaire and the sudden and large-scale return of Rwandans from Zaire and the United Republic of Tanzania at the end of 1996 posed unprecedented challenges for UNHCR both in terms of providing humanitarian assistance in the midst of conflict and of supporting massive reintegration in a fragile post-conflict environment .  
Gross and massive violations of human rights can be committed by local State bodies and officials , too , but the danger of such violations increases immeasurably when they are committed by , for example , a parliament passing racist laws , or a ministerial cabinet conducting a repressive policy .  
Declaring gross and massive violations of human rights perpetrated on the orders of a Government or with its sanction to be international crimes will establish a firm basis in international law for addressing , first , the grave international legal responsibility of the State on behalf of which a Government acts and , second , the question of the criminal responsibility of officials perpetrating such violations .  
Declaring gross and massive violations of human rights ordered or sanctioned by a Government to be international crimes could to some extent help to prevent gross and massive violations of human rights by acting as a warning to Governments and public officials .  
The first of the above problems has not yet been solved with the help of international machinery and procedures but could be if criteria , recognized at the global or regional level , for defining gross and massive violations of human rights were developed .  
The responsibility of individuals , acting on behalf of a State and participating in the perpetration , by that State , of gross and massive violations of human rights constituting an international crime can be realized on the basis of the laws of the State which was injured as a result of the crime , on the basis of the laws of the State on behalf of which the individuals in question acted , or in accordance with an international agreement .  
In addition , the declaration must without fail refer to the inseparable link between the responsibility of the State that the perpetrated gross and massive violations of human rights which can be classified as international crimes and the individual responsibility of persons participating in their perpetration .  
A few of the innumerable examples include the Pegasus cyanide heap-leach gold mine in Montana , which is adjacent to Gros Ventre and Assiniboine tribal territories , the massive Black Mesa coal mine on lands sacred to the Dineh and Hopi peoples in Big Mountain , Arizona , the extreme levels of contamination caused by Shell Oil on Ogoni traditional lands in Nigeria , and the gold-mining and uranium-drilling in the sacred Black Hills in violation of the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty between the Lakota Nation and the United States .  
It was soon observed afterwards that the fears of the former and the hypocrisy of the latter very rapidly became a source of massive and grave violations of economic , social and cultural rights and of collective rights such as the right to development and the right to a healthy environment .  
For the international community to be guilty of massive violations of collective and individual economic rights would be an utter aberration and the greatest contradiction developed within the United Nations system .  
In view of the massive and systematic violations of which the third-world peoples have been victims in the recent past , such as slavery , colonization and cultural looting , it is obvious that there could only be a global remedy , the purpose of which is to re-establish these peoples in their communal rights by returning to them the goods of which they have been unlawfully dispossessed .  
Mr . Weissbrodt stated that Mr . Chernichenkos important work greatly assisted the groups understanding of relevant aspects of international law , particularly in defining gross and massive violations of human rights .  
Much concern has been expressed about the devastating social consequences of the current financial crisis , particularly massive unemployment , the loss of health and educational services , and the consequent increase in poverty in affected countries .

Despite the progress achieved , the increasing tragedies and the escalation of massive and systematic violations are brutal reminders of the ease and frequency with which the noble ideal of defending human rights can be compromised .  
Gravely concerned that the continuation of armed conflicts in the continent threatens regional peace , causes massive human displacement , suffering and poverty , perpetuates instability and diverts scarce resources from long-term development ,

The current financial crisis , caused by massive inflows of private capital and their sudden reversal , had , however , forced the Committee to view the implications of private capital flows into developing countries from a completely different perspective .  
Expressing its grave concern about the continuation of the military confrontation in Afghanistan , threatening regional peace and security and causing massive loss of life and extensive human suffering , further destruction of property , serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure , refugee flows and other forcible displacements of large numbers of people ,  
As all are aware , my country was not the victim of a civil war , but rather the situation of crisis that it has faced has numerous characteristics that are generally typical of a war situation , such as massive migrations of population and violations of human rights , a population held hostage and polarized and a ruined economy .  
The table appended to this document is only a snapshot , giving no more than an indication , albeit a revealing one , of the blatant , deliberate and massive violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the Rwandan , Ugandan and Burundian aggressors in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
They recognized that unusual and massive movements of populations , particularly in the aftermath of armed conflict in certain countries of the subregion , constituted a grave threat to domestic peace , and urged each Government to manage migratory flows more effectively and efficiently and to better control their borders .  
We are all aware that it is not easy to combine differing viewpoints in a single package , but when we recall the current nuclear arms race and the massive stockpiles of nuclear arsenals with all the dangers that they entail , this should induce us to appeal to the international forums specialized in the field of disarmament to place this issue on their list of priorities and to apply its criteria thereto in a comprehensive manner and without any exception .  
Global financial integration had helped to generate a massive expansion of private capital flows to some developing countries , but also posed enormous challenges to national financial and banking systems in terms of ensuring the sustainability of those flows .  
The primary objective of the unit will be to promote respect for human rights and compliance with minimum humanitarian standards , and to deter massive and systematic violations of human rights in the future .  
Condemning also the massive military operations launched by the Serbian authorities against the unarmed civilians in Kosovo , resulting in large _ scale killings , systematic and planned massacres , destruction of homes and property , and forced mass exoduses to neighbouring countries , as well as internal displacement ,  
Shocked and horrified by ongoing massacres and other brutal repressive measures committed by Serbian security and paramilitary forces in Kosovo with the intent of ethnic cleansing , in clear violation of international human rights standards and international humanitarian law and resulting in the loss of lives and a massive humanitarian tragedy affecting the entire region ,

He received well _ documented information , often from first-hand sources , pointing to the perpetration of massive and systematic violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by all parties to the conflict in southern Sudan , of which innocent civilians constitute the principle target and the famine is one of the direct by-products , in the context of which food is manipulated as a weapon of war .  
The religious leaders emphasized the peaceful co-existence of the two communities , but with the other two groups focused on the tragic events in January / February 1998 that set the stage in Bahr-el-Ghazal for the worst humanitarian crisis culminating in the deadliest famine since 1988 , when an estimated 250,000 people were killed , and in massive population displacement .  
It is neither new nor extraordinary for the Commission on Human Rights to be manipulated , but it is serious that that Commission has not stated that the aerial campaign is a massive , flagrant , delirious and systematic violation of human rights .  
Their primary objective should be to seek , through their presence and contacts with the local authorities , to promote respect for minimum humanitarian standards and deter massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law in the future .  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of the document entitled " White paper on massive violations of human rights , the basic rules of international humanitarian law and environmental protection standards by the aggressor countries ( Uganda , Rwanda and Burundi ) and their Congolese accomplices in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo : Volume II " , covering the period from 6 November 1998 to 15 April 1999 ( see annex ) .  
In the first volume of the white paper , the Ministry of Human Rights concentrated on the massive violations of human rights and of the basic rules of international humanitarian law by the aggressor countries ( Uganda , Rwanda and Burundi ) in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
As part of an effort to make both national and international public opinion aware of the massive violations of human rights , the basic rules of international humanitarian law and environmental protection standards , the Government of National Salvation , through the Ministry of Human Rights , has taken the initiative of issuing periodic publications which provide a summary account of the conduct of the aggressor States of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
The aggressor countries have committed clear violations under the terms of international law : acts of aggression , violations of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a State Member of the United Nations and a member of the Organization of African Unity , violation of basic rules and principles of international humanitarian law , massive violations of fundamental individual rights and violations of provisions of international environmental law .  
Owing to the uncontrolled crossing-over of armed groups of Albanian terrorists and bandits , systematically abusing , intimidating , abducting and killing non-Albanian populations and looting , stealing and destroying their property , as well as making forced entries into people 's homes , burning churches and places of worship , there followed a massive exodus of Serbs and Montenegrins from Kosovo and Metohija .  
Others claimed that non-trade concerns of developing countries should be distinguished form those of developed countries , whose interests seemed to be focused on a justification of their continuing use of massive subsidies to the domestic agricultural sector .  
There can be no doubt that the atrocities committed against the civilian population of Sierra Leone , including widespread systematic killings , rapes and amputations , constitute massive violations of international human rights and humanitarian law .  
This does not speak only of a tolerant attitude , but also about a deliberate protection of the separatist-terrorist so-called KLA in order to shun possible responsibility for daily killings , abductions , the destruction and burning of Serbian medieval monasteries and cultural monuments - in which way KFOR becomes practically an accomplice in the great evil against the Serbian people in a flagrant massive violation of human rights and the campaign of ethnic cleansing . 
Considerable advances have been achieved in the last five decades in social and economic development , including disease eradication , massive immunization programmes , improved agricultural productivity , increased adult literacy rates , improved sanitation and water systems , and technological advances for production and communication .  
It expressed concern at the grave situation created in Gabon by the massive influx of refugees from warring neighbouring countries and again appealed urgently to the United Nations , particularly the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , and to the international community to provide assistance to Gabon with a view to meeting the varied needs of the refugees and helping the country to stem the danger posed by the entry of armed refugees into its territory .  
After a further massive loss of human lives , increased suffering of the civilian population and immense physical destruction , the two sides found themselves roughly at the same positions they held in late 1998 .  
The new UNSMA Civil Affairs Unit will work inside Afghanistan with the primary objective of promoting respect for minimum humanitarian standards and deterring massive and systematic violations of human rights in the future .

Expressing its grave concern about the continuation of the military confrontation in Afghanistan , threatening regional peace and security and causing massive loss of life and extensive human suffering , further destruction of property , serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure , refugee flows and other forcible displacements of large numbers of people ,  
The UNSMA Civil Affairs Unit , established in 1999 , will work inside Afghanistan with the primary objective of promoting respect for minimum humanitarian standards and deterring massive and systematic violations of human rights in the future .  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and property worldwide , in particular in vulnerable societies lacking adequate capacity to mitigate effectively long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences of natural disasters ;  
The failure of the international community to prevent such massive suffering in the half century since the trials in Tokyo and Nuremberg makes tragically clear the urgency of developing comprehensive measures for combating impunity as well as strong and effective early-warning and conflict-prevention measures to prevent genocide .  
Over the last 50 years , and especially since the end of the cold war , the decrease in the number of international armed conflicts has been offset by an increase in the number of civil wars and other situations of internal violence , which are characterized by massive and systematic violations of human rights .  
For this fight against poverty and this campaign for emancipation to succeed , we must agree to a decisive review of the mechanism that underlies the economic fluctuation , that causes financial tension and its attendant social consequences , and that tolerates massive exploitation of the weakest by forces that are often impersonal and unidentifiable .  
However , we can not fail to point out that this benefit will not come to everyone equally ; nor can we accept passively the idea that the great majority of people in underdeveloped countries are doomed by massive , dire poverty , hunger , poor health and malnutrition not to be a part of these optimistic statistics but , rather , to be included in the morbidity and mortality statistics characteristic of the less developed regions of the world .  
As you said , Sir , a very great tragedy has occurred in Venezuela as a result because of the persistent rains that have fallen throughout the year in the central part of the country , which , on 16 December , led to massive flooding and mudslides in the central mountain range , affecting densely populated regions , particularly the central coastal regions near the capital city and where the country ' s main airport and port are located .  
Since all of these conditions have been met , the illegal , brutal and massive economic sanctions imposed on Burundi by the neighbouring countries should be lifted because the country is on the verge of suffocation and the suffering of innocent people is indescribable ; famine is imminent ; and diseases such as meningitis and cholera are epidemic due to a lack of medication .  
Although , according to government sources , Costa Rica is still relatively untouched by the illegal traffic in toxic wastes , other people expressed their disquiet about the massive influx and intensive use of dangerous products , including agricultural chemicals , which constitute a serious threat to the environment , as well as to the life and health of persons who come into direct or indirect contact with these substances .  
Regretting that the current crisis in financial markets , characterized , inter alia , by massive and sudden outflows of capital from the affected countries and the sharp decline in private capital flows to developing countries and some economies in transition , has resulted in higher interest rate spreads , leading to a significant slowdown in economic activity ,  
As members of an organization responsible for the protection of and assistance to more than 26-million people who have sought safety from persecution , war or massive human rights abuses , UNHCR staff members around the world witness daily the untold suffering caused by landmines.Not only do landmines force people to leave their homes in search of safety , they also imperil their flight and later hinder their return .  
Not only does the use of arms complicate the search for a peaceful resolution of differences , but it is also a source of much human suffering : the displacement of populations , the destruction of socio-economic infrastructures acquired at the cost of great efforts , massive flows of refugees into bordering countries and the sudden spread of disease.This list is not an exhaustive one by any means . 
This criminal , unprecedented act of aggression , in clear support of separatism and terrorism , has already caused massive human losses and enormous destruction of civilian infrastructure all over Yugoslavia , thus provoking enormous humanitarian suffering .  
Shocked and horrified by ongoing massacres and other brutal action in Kosovo with the intent of ethnic cleansing , in clear violation of international human rights standards and international humanitarian law and resulting in the needless loss of lives and a massive humanitarian tragedy affecting the entire region ,  
This gruesome event , which has not resulted in a massive massacre of innocent and defenceless Serbian civilians only through a very fortunate concourse of circumstances , shows that the alleged completion of the demilitarization of the KLA and its illegitimate transformation into the Kosovo Protection Force have put no brakes at all on KLA systematic terror against the Serbs , aimed at driving out their last remnants from this Serbian province .  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences on vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
The more advanced developing countries had also been hit very hard by the financial crises and sudden massive outflows of capital , which had severely affected the real economy .  
After a further massive loss of human lives , increased suffering of the civilian population and immense physical destruction , the two sides found themselves roughly in the same positions they held in late 1998 .  
After a further massive loss of human lives , increased suffering of the civilian population and immense physical destruction , the two sides found themselves roughly in the same positions they held in late 1998 .  
The dire unemployment situation among highly qualified women , who had been hard hit in the first wave of massive layoffs resulting from the economic crisis and the transition to a market economy , had improved since the third periodic report had been written .  
Germany further supports UNSMA 's new Civil Affairs Unit , which will work inside Afghanistan with the primary objective of promoting respect for minimum humanitarian standards and deterring massive and systematic violations of human rights in the future .  
It has failed , for example , to address longstanding conflicts with massive human suffering and systematic violations of international humanitarian law in a timely and effective manner .  
If the forces of globalization are allowed to operate freely overlooking the central premise of humancentred development the spectre of massive levels of human rights violations resulting in grave social and political upheavals is a real one .  
For example , it has developed Unesis , a massive , authoritative , online compilation of United Nations and specialized agencies statistics in the economic , social , financial and general development areas ;  
The consequences of such failures are only too obvious : too many belligerent groups targeting the innocent and the defenceless ; massive numbers of refugees forced to flee for safety ; gross and systematic violations of human rights perpetrated .  
We also recommend that positive consideration be given to the Secretary-Generals practical and action-oriented recommendations , in particular those that are targeted at enhancing the capacity of national Governments and the international community to prosecute violations of international humanitarian law ; improving engagement by the Security Council and others with a view to obtaining access to vulnerable populations for humanitarian operations ; and developing clear criteria and procedures for the identification and separation of armed elements in situations of massive population displacement .  
In my delegations view , the mission sent a strong signal and conveyed the Security Councils genuine , unanimous determination to move ahead in the peace process , to put an end to the plundering of the wealth of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to take up the question of the massive violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law that have been taking place on the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo since the aggression began . 
The second point is that my delegation wishes to express its deep concern about the humanitarian situation that the Democratic Republic of the Congo is experiencing , particularly caused by the massive displacement of people who are fleeing violence , the interruption of traditional sources of food supplies , the systematic plundering of the countrys natural resources and the impact of the war on childrens lives , as was eloquently presented by Mr . Olara Otunnu .  
The vulnerability of the population is compounded by the continuing effects of the drought , the escalating conflict , massive internal displacement , the disruption of the livelihoods of farmers and labourers normally engaged in poppy cultivation , the absence of significant economic recovery , and the lack of a single effective national authority .  
Affirm that the first logical and credible step to be taken at this juncture of our collective struggle is for the World Conference to declare solemnly that the international community as a whole fully recognizes the historical injustices of the slave trade and that colonialism and apartheid are among the most serious and massive institutionalized forms of human rights violations ;  
This dire prognosis is based on the analysis of the current epidemiological situation in Georgia and neighbouring countries , all of which are experiencing widespread drug abuse , increased migration , and lack of disposable medical instruments and diagnostic test systems , among other factors .  Currently , Georgia is still within the so-called window of opportunity for preventing the massive spread of HIV / AIDS .  
Moreover , a genuine operation is under way to influence world opinion in order to accomplish unacknowledged goals : continuing to occupy Congolese territory , massive violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , pillage and illegal exploitation of Congolese resources .  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , which have resulted in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;

While programmes intended to draw foreign investment , such as those involving the creation of economic industrial zones , have the advantage of encouraging economic growth in developing countries , they are accompanied by considerable social costs , involving , for example , massive violations of the fundamental rights of employees , who pay dearly for them .  
Concrete and verified information about massive displacements of people , security conditions , and violations of international humanitarian and human rights law can be vital for distressed populations and international aid workers alike .  Where communications are disrupted , using the media to inform distressed populations about the activities of relief agencies , and about the location of shelter , food , water and medical services , can be critical for alleviating human suffering .  
At its fifty-seventh session , in April 2001 , the Commission on Human Rights adopted , without a vote , resolution 2001 / 13 on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan , in which it strongly condemned the mass killings and systematic human rights violations against civilians and persons deprived of their liberty , for reasons related to the armed conflict , resulting in the massive , forced displacement of the civilian population .  
In view of the repeated massive violations of human rights and humanitarian law in Afghanistan , the High Commissioner called upon the international community to establish an independent international inquiry into the massacres and other grave human rights violations committed by parties to the armed conflict in Afghanistan .  
Today aggression , intervention , interference in the internal affairs of other States , occupation of other countries territories by force , irredentism , racism and the threat or actual use of force , which had been considered relics of the past , manifest themselves along with rampant terrorism and other new forms of violence , deportations , ethnic cleansing , genocide and massive violations of human rights .  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , which have resulted in massive loss of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
The first victims of whatever military actions are undertaken will be the billions of people living in the poor and underdeveloped world , with their unbelievably serious economic and social problems , their unpayable debts and the ruinous prices of their basic commodities ; their growing natural and ecological disasters ; their hunger and extreme poverty ; the massive undernourishment of their children , teenagers and adults ; their terrible AIDS epidemic ; and their malaria , tuberculosis and infectious diseases , which threaten whole nations with extermination .  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and property worldwide , in particular in vulnerable societies lacking adequate capacity to mitigate effectively the long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences of natural disasters ;

Expressing its grave concern about the decades of conflict in Afghanistan , which has caused massive loss of life , extensive human suffering , destruction of property , serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure , refugee flows and other forcible displacements of large numbers of people ,  
Vote counting for the May 10 presidential election in the Philippines continued today with incumbent President Arroyo taking a strong lead over chief rival Poe . A watchdog body said it saw no signs of the massive cheating alleged by the opposition .  
Etienne Clement , the director of UNESCO office in Cambodia , said the problem of massive looting and trafficking of underground heritages started about five years ago , when the Cambodian government successfully cracked down on illicit trafficking of stone statuary from famous temples , so heritage traffickers have began to smuggle " less spectacular ordinary antiquities . "  
Now the western region should firmly seize the good opportunity for massive development , formulate a preferential policy , improve working conditions , and step up its efforts to bring in and use qualified personnel ; not only should it fully develop and utilize its own human resources but it should be able to retain qualified personnel and use them creatively ; moreover , it should make positive efforts to attract a large number of qualified personnel from developed areas and even from abroad to work for the massive development of the western region .  
As technological innovation is an important guarantee for enhancing competitiveness and achieving internationalization , Chinese household electrical appliance enterprises have not relaxed in technological innovation even for a moment after making it into the international market , investing massive human , material , and financial resources in technological innovation as well as marketizing , internationalizing , and commercializing it .  
In 1999 , various localities had , in line with the CPC Central Committee 's unified arrangements , conscientiously implemented the principle of " singing aloud the major theme song and of seizing well initiative , served the overall situation by concentrating efforts on the central task of economic construction , done a massive amount of meticulous work , and scored marked success .  
This time , in a seemingly serious manner , Cohen once again spread the word : " The Gulf area is confronted with the threat of ceaseless proliferation of massive antipersonnel biochemical weapons . "  The spearhead was directed at Iraq and Iran as though the Gulf countries ' urgent task were " to cope with biochemical-weapon attacks launched by Iraq and Iran , " and it would be too late if they did not buy American arms right now !  
Piracy has seriously disturbed the economic and cultural operational orders in the country and worsened the environment for national cultural industries ' survival , thus causing a massive drain on state revenues and causing cultural business units ' failure to gain an advantageous position in competition amid world economic integration by making it difficult for them to achieve effective accumulation and rapidly expand their industrial scale .  
In line with the special features that reconnaissance means should be applied to the future operational space - - air , sea , and ground - - in all weathers , this battalion launched a massive scientific and technological trailblazing campaign .  In accordance with the ways and means suggested by the officers and men , it worked out more than 30 new methods of operation to defend modern air raids , high-tech reconnaissance , and electronic welfare ; and transformed 108 camouflage devices .  
This many foreign investment companies and such an enormous amount of capital coming in have not only made China into the developing country making the greatest use of foreign capital in a short span of 20 years , in addition the massive influx of foreign goods , advanced technology and equipment , and scientific management experience is gradually changing the quality of the people 's lives , updating their traditional thinking and concepts , and becoming an indispensable part of the development of China 's economy .  
The implication is that the US army will take part in military actions not relating to wars staged in all places throughout the world .  These actions serve as an important complement to the strategy by which the US army has won two massive regional wars .  The action comprises keeping peace , achieving peace through mandatory measures , humanitarian assistance , rescue operations at home and abroad , providing disaster relief , and fighting terrorism and narcotics .  
In discussions of the question of joining the WTO , the thing some economists and local officials are most concerned about is that the massive influx of transnational companies will be a shock to the service , manufacturing , and agricultural industries in China , and they also express deep worries over native industries .  
After assuming office , however , Bush , out of consideration for relieving pressure from the US economic slowdown , first advanced a massive tax cut program and soon afterward announced the cancellation of " mandatory reduction targets " for major greenhouse gas emitters , overturning his campaign promise .  
While cracking a number of major criminal gangs , public security organs in various places have also launched massive offensives of political propaganda to thoroughly crush the psychological defense of criminals .  The " Strike Hard " campaign has thus won another batch of victories .  
The massive utilization of high-tech equipment has established a firm material foundation for joint combat , and at the same time it is giving an increasingly stronger intellectual and knowledge orientation to logistical support .  The contradiction between the lack of enough skilled specialists and the growing quantities of new and high-tech equipment will become more pronounced .  
Over the past few years , in order to seek the status as a so-called " independent political entity " in the international arena , the Taiwan authorities , in the name of expanding " international living space , " have devoted massive manpower and material and financial resources to pursuing " money diplomacy . "  
The US military has to spend a huge amount of fund to sustain the armed forces capable of fighting " two wars . "  This strategy requires that the United States maintain at least 1.4-million troops on active service .  Even with such a massive army , the Pentagon has to admit , the United States can only undertake less than a half of the war tasks .  
Guam is about 1,500 nautical miles from the Philippines . The US deployment of massive forces at this important " strategic supporting point " reflects the strategic thinking of the new Bush administration and will be conducive to launching a long-distance precision attack against the mainland 's coastal regions by US military within 12 hours .  
Our army is the massive pillar of the people 's democratic dictatorship .  The Constitution has entrusted us with the sacred duty of consolidating our national defense , resisting aggression , defending our motherland , and safeguarding the people 's labor in peace .  Moreover , to uphold the Party 's centralized power and unity of the state is our army 's basic prerequisite and necessary requirement to perform these duties .  
It is precisely these two " leaps " that have provided vast room for the development of the Japanese armed forces .  Thus , the self-defense forces are developing in the direction of long-range and massive weapons .  Moreover , Japan has joined hands with the United States to push ahead with the development of the Theater Missile Defense system in a bid to achieve absolute military superiority with which it " can both attack other countries and avoid attacks from them . "  
Li Tieying stressed : The development of the western regions is a massive and systematic project involving ecological environmental protection , infrastructure construction , industrial restructuring , scientific and technological education , reform and opening up , and ethnic and religious issues .  
In fact , the Taiwan authorities have never relaxed military preparations for " armed resistance to reunification . "  They have purchased a massive amount of advanced weaponry from foreign countries and sought to join the theater missile defense system in a bid to establish a certain disguised form of military alliance with the United States and Japan .  
He said : There were both subjective and objective reasons for the backwardness of the western region , and it also involved problems in policy , work , and natural conditions ; furthermore , conditions in various parts of the western region vary , and new problems will arise after stepping up the effort at development .  The large-scale development of the western region is a massive , complicated project , which calls for long-term , arduous efforts by people in various circles .  
From April to July this year , the ministry mobilized public security organs to conduct a massive special struggle of cracking down on traders in human beings to rescue women and children abducted for sale .  With the vigorous support of all sides in the society , public security organs at all levels meticulously organized and planned their action , and the large number of public security and people 's police officers worked unceasingly hard and struggled arduously .  
If war breaks out , the blows dealt to Taiwan 's economy can not be compared to a minor power cut or a major earthquake ; the financial securities market will fall into serious chaos , the stock market will dive , there will be massive exchange rate turbulence , foreign investment will be withdrawn , and the entire Taiwan economy may be paralyzed , so Taiwan will find it very difficult to fight a protracted war with the mainland .  
Wang noted that the UN should make more positive contributions to preventing massive humanitarian crises and the tragic mass killings of innocent civilians .  At the same time , it should be fully aware of the complexity of international intervention and the risk of inappropriate intervention .  
According to the source , the CPC holds that while in the process of " speeding up " industrialization , China is facing the rare opportunities of the extensive application of achievements in the scientific and technological revolution , the massive transformation of information technology , and the large-scale upgrading of traditional industries .  Hence , it must spur industrialization with informationization , give play to its advantage in " gaining the initiative by surpassing the early starters , " and strive to catch up from behind and realize the rapid development of the social productive forces .  
While their own countries carry out massive activities aimed at prohibiting smoking , developed countries on the contrary encourage sales of tobacco products to developing countries .  The majority of developed countries not only have not kept to their own promises regarding increasing official developmental support in international society , but have attempted through technological monopoly and trade barriers to conduct a " new economic colonialism " .  
In view of the grave situation where local and foreign triads are running rampant throughout the mainland and even infiltrating Chinese communist party and government organs , Beijing started a massive campaign to strike hard at triads across the land in September this year .  Initial results have been achieved .  After two months , 5,000 triad members involved in organized crime have been arrested .  
Giving play to China 's advantage in some resources , especially labor resource , means integrating the structural readjustment with giving play to our advantages and solving our employment problems .  We must and hard on the proper grouping of labor-intensive , capital-intensive , technology-intensive , and knowledge-intensive industries .  On the one hand , we must raise the technological standard of all sectors in the national economy , and on the other hand , we must create more jobs to enable massive shift of the agricultural population to the nonagricultural sectors .  
Because China 's relevant legal code is still not quite sound and comprehensive , its market mechanism not quite mature , and its capital market not fully open , some 70 percent of direct foreign investment in China are through joint venture and cooperation , with only a portion invested in wholly-owned companies .  Foreign investment through takeover and merger is still limited .  This will limit the massive flow of foreign capital .  
The development environment over the next five years suggests that the 10th Five-Year Plan will be implemented against a backdrop that is entirely different from the backdrop to all previous five-year plans - - one that is characterized by China 's impending accession to the World Trade Organization , the growing trend toward economic globalization , the close integration of domestic and foreign markets , a world swept up in a knowledge-based economy and a new technological revolution , and the launching of the strategy of developing western China on a massive scale .  
Li Peng said : The NPC Standing Committee must conscientiously exercise supervision over budgets and economic work in accordance with the law ; it must investigate , study , and put forward proposals on current major issues in the economic and social spheres , such as strengthening the status of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy , increasing farmer income , reforming state-owned enterprises , increasing job opportunities , implementing the strategy of developing western regions on a massive scale , joining the World Trade Organization , and implementing the strategy of seeking sustainable development .  
He said that while the financial turmoil had forced other countries to cut back on infrastructure and social programmes , Hong Kong 's excellent finances - with fiscal reserves of more than HK $ 450 billion - were allowing it to push ahead with massive investments .  
Because of our very strong fiscal reserves of HK $ 450 billion - ladies and gentlemen , the government has no debt - and with a budget surplus of 5.8% of our GDP in the current year , we are able to , through the budget recently announced for this year , continue with our massive plan of investment in infrastructure and education which will make Hong Kong much more efficient and competitive in the 21st Century . 
Because of our very strong fiscal reserves of HK $ 450 billion ( A $ 100 billion ) - the Government has no debt - and with a budget surplus of 5.8 per cent of our GDP in the past year , we are able to , through the budget announced in February this year , continue with our massive plan of investment in infrastructure and education which will make Hong Kong much more efficient and competitive in the 21st Century . 
" It is too simplistic - and also unfair - to judge our commitment to the free market by a single , extraordinary battle at a time of great economic turmoil , and when massive , secretive and destructive capital flows were creating havoc in the markets . "  
At the Financial Conference on Asia organised by the Trade Development Council today ( Thursday ) , Secretary for Financial Services , Mr Rafael Hui , in his speech entitled " What follows the Financial Turmoil " , warned that history would repeat itself without the joint effort of the international community in reforming the global financial architecture , and formulating new rules and strategies to cope with the massive and volatile capital flows in our globalised economy .  
This is the first set of embossed stamps issued in Hong Kong . Four major waterworks and facilities are depicted , namely Tai Tam Tuk Reservoir built on land ( $ 1.3 ) ; Plover Cove Reservoir , the world 's first massive reservoir carved out of the sea ( $ 2.5 ) ; large diameter water pipelines for transferring water received from Guangdong ( $ 3.1 ) and application of modern technology to the controlling and monitoring of water quality ( $ 5.0 ) .  
The traditional reluctance to inflict indiscriminate brutality is gone : in its place is a terrifying , lethal , religiously motivated determination ' to create massive , history-changing bloodshed ' , preferably of sufficient magnitude to destabilise , if not topple , the hated , infidel Western world .  
Behind this internationally accepted definition is the consensus that there is a qualitative difference between terrorist acts capable of inflicting massive and indiscriminate injury and damage to the public and ordinary criminal activities , such as criminal damage , assault or even murder . 
" The traditional reluctance to inflict indiscriminate brutality is gone : in its place is a terrifying , lethal , religiously motivated determination ' to create massive , history-changing bloodshed ' , preferably of sufficient magnitude to destabilise , if not topple , the hated , infidel Western world .  
The most aggravating worry of the ' 911 ' attacks is the conspicuous absence of traditional reluctance to inflict indiscriminate brutality : in its place is a terrifying , lethal , religiously motivated determination ' to create massive , history-changing bloodshed ' .  
With accelerated economic globalisation and rapid advances in technology , corruption today transcends national boundaries , and has taken on a new dimension .  It has become a means to facilitate and perpetuate syndicated crimes , including international money laundering schemes , massive commercial fraud scams , cross-border drug trafficking , smuggling of human beings and many other serious crimes .  
In commercial operation , there is also application of grid computing where intensive computing or massive data analysis is required , for example , in using random state simulation to analyse complicated financial environment , optimising product design , and pharmaceutical research and production .  
They spent only three odd years from conception of the idea to the implementation of the scheme and the finance committee approved the project only a year and a bit ago .  So within a very short period of time , they have introduced a highly complex , a very massive project and I 'm very grateful for the work by our Immigration colleagues in this regard .  
He began researching all aspects of the tale : T'ang dynasty dress , weapons , musical instruments , and the more complex task of creating visual imagery for a complete undersea realm . As the cartoon required massive investments , Hu felt it should be understandable to an international audience .  
Taiwan has graduated from the labor intensive , living-room factory economy to the sophisticated economy of capital intensive industries , computer components and massive investment in R &amp; D . Industry and government realized that in order to maintain profit margins in this new and highly competitive environment , Management Science would have to assume a greater role in directing the development of Taiwan 's economic future .  
Strolling amidst Huisun Forest , one 's spirits are refreshed by the cool , moist air . Brilliant butterflies tumble about above azaleas encircling massive tree trunks , as a nimble civet darts soundlessly through the trees . A faint mist adds a touch of poetry to it all . Everywhere is quiet , broken only by the sounds of Nature - - birdsong , cricket calls , and the sudden " swish " of a macaque monkey swinging overhead .  
The narcissus dish pictured here , when observed from the front , stares directly at you with its two large eyes , while its pair of massive pincers serve as the supporting feet of the vessel . It seems as though the narcissus is growing on the body of the crab , making quite an interesting picture , much like the ancient legend of the mountain of the immortals upon the sea , which rested on the back of a huge tortoise .  
At that time , countries all over the world operated on the gold standard , and gold was also required for international trade . It was partly thanks to this shipment of gold that Taiwan , which only had commodities such as tea and sugar to export and which relied on imports for all manufactured goods , was gradually able to transform itself from an agricultural to an industrial society , and to go from having a massive trade deficit to holding foreign exchange reserves which now rank among the world 's largest .  
The changing face of Hakka womenIn recent years there has been a massive outflow of population from Hakka villages . Most young people have left to pursue their studies or careers . Even for those left behind , traditional Hakka values are fading in young people because of increased education , the impact of the mass media , and multifarious interactions with other ethnic groups .  
Looking at the past , the last wave of stock fever-with its tidal wave cresting past the 10,000 mark , then falling with devastating force-ended up in a massive redistribution of wealth in Taiwan . When the market is unhealthy , it can be manipulated , and naturally the rich ended up richer and the poor , poorer . Moreover , the huge financial losses of the last cycle disrupted countless families and bankrupted many businesses .  
It is true that after the financial crisis struck there was no massive fall in the value of the Yen , but the combination of external pressures and internal difficulties-in the form of an overall default rate on bank lending of 14% , the collapse of several financial institutions , and the economic sluggishness which has dogged Japan for the last seven years-has been enough to leave the Japanese government bruised and battered .  
But in the last few years , with dramatic changes in the political environment , skyrocketing property prices , massive stock market swings , political graft financed by money-laden conglomerates , and an unstable labor market , workers ' " sense of comparative exploitedness " has grown ever more acute , and their mood has become far more volatile . "  
" Maybe the conditions for seed germination are very specific and furthermore , they are unknown , " says Jose Luis Leon de la Luz , a botanist affiliated with the CIB . No matter how the plant manages to pass through the eons , its natural proliferation is not sufficient to sustain massive cutting for a hungry market . One fact should be borne in mind : If damiana products are to be used in large quantities , damiana plants should be plentiful .  
The first is globalization , which has had a dual impact . For one thing it has led to a massive expansion of the international labor force , with developing countries that previously shunned capitalist competition now hurling themselves into it , adding over a billion workers from places like mainland China , India and Eastern Europe . At the same time we have the globalization of international trade , with capital and technology increasingly free to circulate rapidly around the world .  
The devastating 21 September earthquake of 1999 left Taiwan 's landscape covered in scars , but researchers discovered that the places least damaged by the quake were areas of natural forest . In mountain regions where the rainfall is most abundant , the geology most fragile and erosive forces most powerful , the false cypresses , with their massive trunks and mighty root systems , cling tightly to the frail earth .  
( " Long-period " comets come from a more distant , spherical region-the Oort Cloud . ) From ground-based observations and space missions , astronomers have already gained a degree of understanding of the more massive bodies in the solar system , and their satellites . But because the bodies at the outer limits of the solar system are of such small diameter and low brightness , they are not easily observed , and can only be studied if they move into orbits that bring them closer to the sun , as comets .  
The combined population of countries running socialist economies either now or in the past comes to over 3 billion , or 44% of the world 's total population . The major socialist economies include mainland China ( 1.2 billion ) , India ( 1 billion ) , and the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe ( 0.3 billion ) . Since the collapse of socialism , the massive labor pool of these nations has gradually been incorporated into the global capitalist economy .  
COA chairman Chen Hsi-huang , who earned his degree in agricultural economics at National Taiwan University ( NTU ) notes that Taiwan 's agricultural policies used to stress increased production-producing as much as possible on the limited land available . Consequently , Taiwan-produced canned champignon mushrooms and asparagus commanded 65% of the international market . Coupled with the export of massive amounts of sugar , rice , and bananas , this stimulated the formation of capitalistic agriculture which , in turn , helped prepare the way for the subsequent take off of industry .  
In the same way , the demand for seafood increased when Taiwan 's economy took off . Taking advantage of this favorable situation , aquaculture began sprouting up on the west coast . At one point , coastal counties were waterlogged with fully 58,000 hectares of fish farms , causing massive erosion problems . With the widespread smuggling of seafood from the PRC in recent years , aquacultural land in Taiwan has dropped to 40,000 hectares as fisheries have shifted operations to mainland China .  
Two years back Taiwan experienced a major earthquake . Last year there were landslides and massive flooding here , and also the horrific 911 incident in New York . And most recently Taiwan has faced a drought . Some of these are natural disasters , some are man-made , and some are natural disasters made worse by human action .  
Ku enthusiastically consults with people from all areas , and has done his utmost to assist domestic research in fields related to welding . Ku also contributes by " resuscitating " expensive machinery damaged by human errors or natural disasters , thus helping industry and educational institutions reduce the massive financial losses that can result from such events . While his work has guaranteed that machinery works , he has helped even more people by passing the torch of his knowledge on to his students .  
The mainland is a massive country , and the distance between urban areas is huge . Profits from distribution and retailing of books and magazines are small , even though the ' planned economy ' is gradually being dismantled , and soon it will be far too difficult to set up a wide-ranging logistics and shipping network . Because of this , some publishers are choosing not to sell through bookstores , instead looking for an alternative way , facing their own technological difficulties on the way .  
Although pressure for economic reform is gaining momentum in the international community , the PRC authorities see control of information as the final line of defense , and thus keep a tight grasp on it . However , this is already being put to the test by Western and Japanese companies , through running their own advertising fronts and licensing out their titles , staking their claims before the complete lifting of restrictions , and using their massive capital bases to secure their positions .  
On June 8th , after the news broke , even before the sales of the normal boxed lunches at midday , there were already massive queues of eager customers waiting at the station cafeteria . Since the display for the nostalgia lunches still had n't been set up , the TRA assumed that the crowd were queuing for train tickets , and paid them no heed .  
Aside from the massive popularity of the Nostalgia Lunches , domestic convenience store chains are also paying attention to this virgin market . Starting a couple of years ago , one after another they started offering different kinds of local packed lunches , starting a " biandang war , " - one would offer theirs for NT $ 40 , so a competitor would drop theirs to NT39 , all promoting their lower prices .  
In the region threatened by bird flu , Taiwan alone has remained clean . There have been sporadic outbreaks of fowl pest around the island , but thus far they have all involved the less pathogenic and less virulent H5N2 virus strain , which does not infect humans . This is why , with the massive cull of poultry leading to a shortage of chickens in several Asian countries , Taiwanese chickens have unexpectedly become much sought after , with orders coming in from various neighboring territories .  
The first typhoon to strike Taiwan this year , Typhoon Mindulle , swept in from the southwest at the start of July , bringing with it torrential rains and powerful winds and causing massive landslides and coastal flooding . Once again , having been through the disasters of the 921 earthquake of 1999 and 2001 ' s Typhoons Toraji and Nari , the people of central Taiwan faced the hardship of losing livelihoods and loved ones .

It said the authors of the report also need to address the unjust global economic system and financial monopolies which aggravate poverty in the developing countries and even provide incentives for corruption leading to massive transfers of assets to benefit the already rich societies  
The Committee reaffirmed that those responsible for massive , gross and systematic human rights violations and crimes against international humanitarian law should be held responsible and prosecuted .  
We regard as inadmissible any violent changes of frontiers as well as " ethnic cleansing " accompanied by massive and flagrant violations of human rights .  
The system of apartheid sought to dehumanize entire peoples and imposed on the region of southern Africa a brutal war which has resulted in untold loss of life , destruction of property and massive displacement of innocent people .  
The Committee reaffirmed that those responsible for massive , gross and systematic human rights violations and crimes against international humanitarian law should be held responsible and prosecuted .  
For 20 months we have been spectators helpless spectators of aggression , territorial conquest , " ethnic cleansing " , intolerance of every kind , and continuing massive , flagrant , systematic violations of human rights .  
Angola 's renewed civil war has paralysed most provincial and urban basic social infrastructures , disrupted essential social services and triggered massive population displacements .  
These provoked a massive stampede of refugees across the border into Zaire in the northwest , overwhelming humanitarian agencies and nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs ) whose preparations had anticipated the simultaneous movement of refugees further south .  
Neither massive economic assistance , nor a huge international presence can make a real difference if the human rights questions are left unaddressed .  
The terrible images of the Second World War , of horrible combats , of massive destruction , of endless suffering inflicted on innocent civilians and on combatants , remind us of the kind of events and dangers that brought the representatives of 51 allied countries to San Francisco to sign , on 26 June 1945 , the Charter that established the United Nations .  
Habiyaremye ( Rwanda ) ( interpretation from French ) : This is not the first time that the Rwandese delegation has addressed this Assembly , over which Mr . Freitas do Amaral is so worthily presiding at this fiftieth session , on the subject of refugees , the restoration of peace , and Rwanda 's reconstruction and social and economic development after the unfortunate events of last year : war , genocide and massacres , as well as the resultant massive exodus of Rwandans . 
This is because we are fully aware , as the Summit itself has underscored , that nothing short of a renewed and massive political will at the national and international levels to invest in people and their well-being will achieve the objectives of social development .  
" Expressing grave concern that the number of armed conflicts has not decreased since the end of the cold war , and that international and ethnic conflicts are an ongoing reality in nearly every region , resulting in violations of human rights , especially those of women and children , including massive loss of life ,  
Now , 20 years later , almost 40 per cent of the territory of Cyprus , a sovereign , independent , democratic State and a Member of the United Nations , remained under occupation , and gross and massive violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms continued to be committed there .  
Among the most acute issues were the continuing economic deterioration , the decline in real incomes , the spread of poverty , unemployment , massive migration and a sharp worsening of living standards for what appeared to be the majority of the population .  
Nothing short of a renewed and massive political will , at the national and international level , to invest in people and their well-being will achieve the objectives of social development .

Nevertheless , the conflict that engulfed eastern Zaire and the sudden and large-scale return of Rwandans from Zaire and the United Republic of Tanzania at the end of 1996 posed unprecedented challenges for UNHCR both in terms of providing humanitarian assistance in the midst of conflict and of supporting massive reintegration in a fragile post-conflict environment .  
Gross and massive violations of human rights can be committed by local State bodies and officials , too , but the danger of such violations increases immeasurably when they are committed by , for example , a parliament passing racist laws , or a ministerial cabinet conducting a repressive policy .

The responsibility of individuals , acting on behalf of a State and participating in the perpetration , by that State , of gross and massive violations of human rights constituting an international crime can be realized on the basis of the laws of the State which was injured as a result of the crime , on the basis of the laws of the State on behalf of which the individuals in question acted , or in accordance with an international agreement .  
In addition , the declaration must without fail refer to the inseparable link between the responsibility of the State that the perpetrated gross and massive violations of human rights which can be classified as international crimes and the individual responsibility of persons participating in their perpetration .  
A few of the innumerable examples include the Pegasus cyanide heap-leach gold mine in Montana , which is adjacent to Gros Ventre and Assiniboine tribal territories , the massive Black Mesa coal mine on lands sacred to the Dineh and Hopi peoples in Big Mountain , Arizona , the extreme levels of contamination caused by Shell Oil on Ogoni traditional lands in Nigeria , and the gold-mining and uranium-drilling in the sacred Black Hills in violation of the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty between the Lakota Nation and the United States .

We are all aware that it is not easy to combine differing viewpoints in a single package , but when we recall the current nuclear arms race and the massive stockpiles of nuclear arsenals with all the dangers that they entail , this should induce us to appeal to the international forums specialized in the field of disarmament to place this issue on their list of priorities and to apply its criteria thereto in a comprehensive manner and without any exception .

He received well _ documented information , often from first-hand sources , pointing to the perpetration of massive and systematic violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by all parties to the conflict in southern Sudan , of which innocent civilians constitute the principle target and the famine is one of the direct by-products , in the context of which food is manipulated as a weapon of war .  
The religious leaders emphasized the peaceful co-existence of the two communities , but with the other two groups focused on the tragic events in January / February 1998 that set the stage in Bahr-el-Ghazal for the worst humanitarian crisis culminating in the deadliest famine since 1988 , when an estimated 250,000 people were killed , and in massive population displacement .  
It is neither new nor extraordinary for the Commission on Human Rights to be manipulated , but it is serious that that Commission has not stated that the aerial campaign is a massive , flagrant , delirious and systematic violation of human rights .  
Their primary objective should be to seek , through their presence and contacts with the local authorities , to promote respect for minimum humanitarian standards and deter massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law in the future .  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of the document entitled " White paper on massive violations of human rights , the basic rules of international humanitarian law and environmental protection standards by the aggressor countries ( Uganda , Rwanda and Burundi ) and their Congolese accomplices in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo : Volume II " , covering the period from 6 November 1998 to 15 April 1999 ( see annex ) .  
In the first volume of the white paper , the Ministry of Human Rights concentrated on the massive violations of human rights and of the basic rules of international humanitarian law by the aggressor countries ( Uganda , Rwanda and Burundi ) in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
As part of an effort to make both national and international public opinion aware of the massive violations of human rights , the basic rules of international humanitarian law and environmental protection standards , the Government of National Salvation , through the Ministry of Human Rights , has taken the initiative of issuing periodic publications which provide a summary account of the conduct of the aggressor States of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
The aggressor countries have committed clear violations under the terms of international law : acts of aggression , violations of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a State Member of the United Nations and a member of the Organization of African Unity , violation of basic rules and principles of international humanitarian law , massive violations of fundamental individual rights and violations of provisions of international environmental law .  
Owing to the uncontrolled crossing-over of armed groups of Albanian terrorists and bandits , systematically abusing , intimidating , abducting and killing non-Albanian populations and looting , stealing and destroying their property , as well as making forced entries into people 's homes , burning churches and places of worship , there followed a massive exodus of Serbs and Montenegrins from Kosovo and Metohija .  
Others claimed that non-trade concerns of developing countries should be distinguished form those of developed countries , whose interests seemed to be focused on a justification of their continuing use of massive subsidies to the domestic agricultural sector .  
There can be no doubt that the atrocities committed against the civilian population of Sierra Leone , including widespread systematic killings , rapes and amputations , constitute massive violations of international human rights and humanitarian law .  
This does not speak only of a tolerant attitude , but also about a deliberate protection of the separatist-terrorist so-called KLA in order to shun possible responsibility for daily killings , abductions , the destruction and burning of Serbian medieval monasteries and cultural monuments - in which way KFOR becomes practically an accomplice in the great evil against the Serbian people in a flagrant massive violation of human rights and the campaign of ethnic cleansing .
