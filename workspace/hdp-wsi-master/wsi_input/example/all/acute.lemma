Zhang Qiong , deputy procurator-general , when briefing reporters on related situations , emphasized that to reform the procuratorial work and strengthen the function and role of legal supervision , it is necessary to gradually set up a coordinated investigation mechanism , where the procuratorial organs across the country support , coordinate with , and assist each other ; to build in the Supreme People 's Procuratorate and all provincial-level procuratorates an investigation commanding center featured by unhindered acquisition of information , acute response , and effective commanding ability and a " personnel bank " of backbone investigators ;  
( 1 ) Those who discharge highly toxic waste liquid into a body of water or who discharge or dump waste residues containing mercury , cadmium , arsenic , chromium , cyanide , yellow phosphorus , or other soluble acute toxins into a body of water or directly bury them under the ground shall be liable to a fine below 100,000 yuan ;  
After China accedes to the WTO , our state enterprises will have to directly face acute competitions from the world 's multinational companies ; and the problems of an irrational product mix , a poor product development ability , and a backward management that are currently existing in our state enterprises are expected to manifest themselves in a more evident way .  All this requires us to comprehensively reinforce the management of enterprises ;  
In today 's world , the scientific and technological revolution is advancing by leaps and bounds , a knowledge economy is rising rapidly , economic globalization is currently undergoing an increasingly accelerated process , and competition in comprehensive national strength is becoming more and more acute .  
This meant that they were subject to double suffering and double tragic fate , which made the social and class contradictions of the undeveloped nations even more acute , such that they had no other way out except revolution , and outbursts of democratic revolutions in these countries became an inevitable necessity .  
At present , the mutual stirring of various cultural and ideological trends on a worldwide scale , the mingling of progressive and backward concepts , the increasing diversification of people 's orientations of value , moral concepts , and cultural choices and , in particular , the infiltration and offensives of the Western hostile forces against us , such as " Westernization " and " disintegration , " have made the contradiction and struggle in the ideological field more and more acute and complicated .  
A joint command will have to concentrate both qualified and capable command personnel and technologically advanced command facilities .  On the basis of guaranteeing efficient operation , a joint command will have to set up fewer vertical command links , and recruit fewer but highly capable personnel , aside from constantly studying new command measures , and raising command efficiency , thus ensuring timely , highly efficient , and acute command , and unleashing overall operational efficiency to the greatest extent , in a key zone , and at a crucial juncture .  
However , the world is still far from peaceful .  A multipolar world is evolving along a tortuous path , and so is economic globalization .  New profound changes are taking place in the world 's alignment of forces and distribution of interests - - the Chinese people who have won national independence and dignity are faced with acute challenges , and so is the great cause of rejuvenating the Chinese nation in the new century .  
Given that the trend toward a multipolar world , economic globalization , and information networking becomes increasingly apparent , that science and technology are advancing at an amazing speed , and that competition in comprehensive national strength becomes increasingly acute , new profound changes are taking place in the alignment of forces and the distribution of benefits in the world . 
From this interview , people can see that the Chinese Government and people have won a decisive victory in the struggle against the " Falungong " cult .  They also can see that Li Hongzhi has turned from a cult founder into a political tool of the international anti-China forces .  This means that our struggle against the " Falungong " cult in the future will still be a protracted , acute , and complicated one .  
From this interview , people can see that the Chinese Government and people have won a decisive victory in the struggle against the " Falungong " cult .  They also can see that Li Hongzhi has turned from a cult founder into a political tool of the international anti-China forces .  This means that our struggle against the " Falungong " cult in the future will still be a protracted , acute , and complicated one .  
At this important historical juncture of the turn of the century , how to promote China 's scientific and technological progress and innovation , bring into play the important role of the number one productive forces of science and technology , continually provide a strong impetus for China 's economic and social development , and enable China to see even greater development in the acute international competition of the future are the significant tasks to which we must give careful consideration .  
Can China 's cause of socialism be consolidated and developed ?  Can China remain powerful and prosperous in face of the acute international competition in the future ?  The key lies in whether or not our party is able to continuously train a large number of high-quality leading personnel .  
We have accumulated an important experience in these past years .  That is , the more complex the situation is , the more arduous the tasks , and the more acute the struggle is , the more we should firmly adhere to Deng Xiaoping Theory and the party 's basic line , basic principle , and basic program and unswervingly concentrate our efforts in effecting an upswing in our economic construction , and make unremitting efforts to fulfill the party 's general goal and task during the socialist primary stage .  
the multi-polarization trend in the world pattern is irreversible ; and the competition of comprehensive national strength with the economic , scientific , technological , and military strength as well as national cohesion as the main content is tending to become more acute .  Judging from the general situation , peace and development remain the theme of the times .  
" We must fully understand the characteristic of Xinjiang 's anti-splittist struggle that it is protracted , acute and complex , unswervingly and firmly foster the idea that stability overrides everything , strengthen our sense of political responsibility in safeguarding Xinjiang 's stability , and stand on the forefront of the struggle consciously and on our own initiative to resolutely wage an uncompromising struggle against national splittism . "  
Today , when the 10th Five-Year Plan is formulated , the framework of a socialist market economy has been initially set up , the concept of building a market economy has struck deep roots in the hearts of people , the living standards of our people have basically reached a moderately high level , the supply of most commodities has exceeded their demand , economic globalization has become a major trend , China 's accession to the WTO is just round corner , and international competition is becoming increasingly acute .  
The motion , to be moved by Hon CHAN yuen-han , says : " That , as the current economic and employment situations remain acute , and low-income earners and the poor elderly who are not receiving the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance are very hard up , this Council urges the Government to provide them with different forms of assistance or allowances in transport , medical , housing and education services , etc . , so as to improve the livelihood of these people and their families and relieve the pressure on them . "  
Today 's meeting was held to ensure all government bureaux and departments join hands to disseminate information on relevant precautionary measures against the spread of atypical pneumonia , i.e . , severe acute respiratory syndrome .  
The spokesman said with effect from March 31 , the Director of Health will exercise her authority under the Quarantine and Prevention of Disease Ordinance to require individuals who have come into close contact with people suffering from severe acute respiratory syndrome to report daily to one of the four designated medical centres for check-up for 10 consecutive days after last contact .  
Mrs Ip assured the Consul-General that the Government had strengthened efforts in controlling the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome by preventing people likely to be infected from leaving the territory .  
The Chief Executive in Executive Council has approved an amendment regulation to empower health officers to prohibit persons who are suffering from the severe acute respiratory syndrome or those who have been exposed to the risk of the syndrome from leaving Hong Kong as an additional precautionary measure to contain the spread of the disease .  
The Government has set up various expert working groups ( e.g . on avian influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) ) and interdepartmental coordinating committees ( e.g . on SARS , dengue fever , cholera of enteroviral infection ) to facilitate disease control and research .  
This latest revision , along with the lifting of the Hong Kong travel advisory earlier by both the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , send a strong signal that severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) is contained in Hong Kong , travel is safe , and Hong Kong will continue to protect public health .  
" Bacterial food poisoning is expected to rise , " he said .  " The major contributing factors in food poisoning are cross-contamination between raw food and cooked food , as well as inadequate cooking .  Dr Tsang said the incidence of acute conjunctivitis was low in the first half of this year .  
The Government today ( August 8 ) has approved an application for financial assistance by the family members of a private doctor who died of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) contracted in the course of his professional practice .  
At the meeting , foreign guests discovered that the quality of Taiwan 's medicine had improved rapidly over the past 30 years . The death rate has declined and the average life expectancy has increased . This period has seen the eradication of most acute infectious diseases . Medical techniques and knowledge have advanced to such a degree that Taiwan may be considered equal to developed countries .  
One major reason is that these diseases - - ulcers , high blood pressure , heart and arterial disease , and so on - - are not acute illnesses brought on by a single cause , as many past epidemic diseases were , but are chronic illnesses brought on by numerous factors , so it is relatively hard to clarify cause and effect relationships .  
Despite this , the " neither large nor small " numbers of cases of these illnesses still leave people a little non-plussed when they see them . The threats to life and health from modern industrial society come from stress and environmental pollution - - cancer , heart disease , asthma , infertility , and other " diseases of modern civilization " caused by chemical or biological agents . Have n't these acute communicable illnesses transmitted by bacteria or viruses already been eradicated ?  
Hu You-huei , an associate professor of public health at the Yangming Medical College , revealed in a study that women have a higher incidence of acute , chronic , disabling , dental , and mild nervous conditions than men . "  
Associate professor Chung Wei-wen of National Chengchi University 's Graduate School of Journalism agrees with this judgement . Yet he still wants to wake up potential overseas students to the fact that knowledge is not a passive thing . When you go abroad , you can see the environment in all its pluralism and complexity , but if you do not have the ability to make acute observations and just hold on to your fixed frame of thinking , then it is like returning empty handed from a mountain of treasures .  
Lead water pipes are already being discarded by all countries ; manufacture of the lethal first generation of pesticides which contained organic mercury compounds has already been forbidden ; and the United States Food and Drug Administration has decreed a ban on using cadmium electroplated containers , because they can cause acute poisoning if used for any kind of acidic food or drink .  
" One shovelful could fill a tin can . " Today vast stretches of land have been developed , and pesticides have been badly overused in cultivated areas . Earthworms are highly vulnerable to sudden acute poisoning , " so that in many hectares of farmland , you could n't find a single worm , " says Huang , who worked hard with Kuo looking for the creatures in agricultural areas in Hsinchu .  
In terms of treatment of acute disorders , on the one hand , it is necessary to lessen the disparity between urban and rural areas ; on the other , a hierarchical medical care system must be developed , including basic medical care that covers the greatest possible area , second-level local medical care , and top-level regional hospital-centers ( RHCs ) and subdivisional hospital-centers ( SHCs ) , where complicated technology is a staple . The goal is delegating small hospitals for small ailments and big hospitals for big ailments .  
" However , I found out he was n't happy , " says Li . " On the one hand , my son strained his brain too much , and he did n't get enough exercise . His physique was skinny and weak , and he seemed fairly melancholy and introverted . What 's more , the gifted students ' class laid a lot of stress on grades , so the competition was acute .  
" The places society leaves out in the cold are precisely the places a church hospital should bring its warmth to . " Chou Tien-hung says that because National Health Insurance payments for long-stay beds are rather low , most hospitals are unwilling to provide them , since they operate at a loss . Therefore the Mennonite Hospital planned to expand its original 300 beds to 500 , with the additional 200 beds all being long-stay beds ; the shortfall in finance for long-stay care would be covered by the operating surplus from the acute outpatients department .  
But in the last few years , with dramatic changes in the political environment , skyrocketing property prices , massive stock market swings , political graft financed by money-laden conglomerates , and an unstable labor market , workers ' " sense of comparative exploitedness " has grown ever more acute , and their mood has become far more volatile . "  
Forty or fifty years ago , acute bacterial and viral diseases were the major cause of death in Taiwan . Today , they have been replaced by cancer and cerebrovascular disease . However , the threat from infectious diseases has not disappeared .  
He explains that when a patient first comes into the hospital , he is examined by a psychiatrist who treats his acute symptoms , such as insomnia , anxiety or depression . After his symptoms have been moderated , a clinical psychologist evaluates the patient 's personality and his physical and mental condition . Based on this , the clinical psychologist then provides counseling . If the patient 's abilities have deteriorated , an occupational therapist designs a rehabilitation program , which might include planning some recreational activities or interpersonal relations training .  
In " Looking Back , " a documentary on women in Taiwanese politics that was filmed with support from the DPP 's Department of Women 's Affairs , the late DPP women 's affairs director Peng Wan-ju made an acute observation about Yeh : Although it was her husband 's lingering shadow that took her into politics , Yeh 's performance has gone beyond the traditional experiences of women in opposition politics , transcending the image of a victimized family member to manifest the autonomy of a female political figure in her own right .  
It is 7:00 p.m . , and Pan , who has just hurried northward from Taichung , is driving his trusty old jeep on mountain roads skirting the Feitsui reservoir , on his way toward Pinglin . Despite the racket made by the car 's engine , his acute ears pick up the relentless clamor of a microhylid . The croaking of this mini-frog ( a mere two centimeters ) is reminiscent of an insect-ji-ji-ji . . . ji-ji-ji . . . .  
Ho Yen-tai , who is 76 this year , has the slim and healthy physique one sees so often in natives of Shandong Province . His hearing remains acute , and his eyes sharp , while his hands are dextrous enough to thread a needle with ease . His voice is vigorous , and when he gets excited he may even emphasize a point by striking the table with his palm .  
In addition to the acute harm caused by large quantities of poisonous chemicals , in the late 1980s people discovered that despite the increasing level of controls over the use of chemicals , even low levels of some compounds could still lead to chronic effects such as tumors , birth defects and genetic mutations .  
A warm and sunny May day would normally be a profitable and pleasant one for all manner of businesses . But the storm raging over the increasingly widespread epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) has enveloped the entire island of Taiwan in a mist of anxiety and tragedy .  
The outbreak of an epidemic of the pre-viously unknown disease SARS ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) revealed a Taiwan public health system shot through with flaws . But twenty years ago , Taiwan had suppressed malaria , Japanese encephalitis , infantile paralysis , and other infectious diseases and had successfully set up a powerful frontline , grassroots defense network against epidemics .  
A stable political situation with no acute ethnic conflicts has also made Romania increasingly accepted as a safe investment by the international community , which has , in turn , heightened foreign investor confidence  
We know how difficult was the road leading to the establishment of lasting peace in view of the level of distrust and the acute , accumulated suffering involved .  
The influx of young people into the labour market has led to the emergence of acute social problems ; rapid advances in many scientific and technical areas have posed new challenges that must be faced by the education and training systems if youth unemployment is to be addressed properly and prevented from giving rise to many social ills , such as marginalization , poverty and delinquency .  
Owing to the acute economic crisis , the State was unable to guarantee to a sufficient extent the protection of such inalienable rights as the right to work , the right to an adequate living standard and the right to housing or to protect the rights of many refugees and illegal immigrants in the country .  
Among the most acute issues were the continuing economic deterioration , the decline in real incomes , the spread of poverty , unemployment , massive migration and a sharp worsening of living standards for what appeared to be the majority of the population .  
In 1990 and 1991 , the main causes of infant and child mortality for both boys and girls had been preventable and treatable ; they included perinatal infections , acute respiratory infections , chronic diarrhoeal disease and nutritional deficiencies .  
In view of the challenging international context marked by countries in transition , ethnic conflicts , increase in refugees , acute complex developmental need and humanitarian assistance , the role of the resident coordinator - to lead a strong , integrated , effective team at the country level - has become even more crucial .  
Inadequate access to safe and effective contraceptive methods and high quality maternal care , and unsafe abortions , result in 500,000 maternal deaths a year , as well as in acute and chronic complications affecting approximately 20-million women .  
These include the acute crisis in the Balkans , the smouldering Cypriot problem , unresolved differences between Turkey and Greece , the periodic flare-up of tension in the Middle East , the uncertain situation regarding the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , illegal migration , the growth of religious violence , which feeds on the alarming disparities between rich and poor in individual countries , and on lagging economic development in various States .  
In the case of Belarus the problem of outstanding contributions for peace-keeping operations has taken on a particularly acute , and it would not be exaggerated to say , offensive character , primarily owing to the fact that the original motives for assigning Belarus to group ( b ) have become historically obsolete , its legal status under international law has changed and its economic situation has greatly deteriorated . 
A peaceful solution to the present acute and extremely dangerous crisis - one that would end up in a stable regional order , equality of States and good neighbourliness in the region - requires the active engagement of the most responsible international forums , especially the Security Council and United Nations Secretary-General .  
I am convinced that , notwithstanding the acute financial crisis currently facing the Organization , the provision of additional resources to UNOMIL , at a level that is modest by comparison with peace-keeping operations elsewhere , is justified by the hope that the Abuja Agreement at last offers a chance of ending the cruel war in Liberia and alleviating the terrible suffering it has caused .  
The worsening of socio-economic conditions in many LDCs in the 1990s has increasingly been translated into a marked deterioration in human welfare as reflected in reduced caloric intakes , increased mortality and morbidity , the re-emergence and spread of diseases , lower school enrolment , further marginalization of the weakest members of society , and other signals of acute social distress , as further reviewed below in chapter V .  
Three legal experts have worked with the Ministry of Justice and , in cooperation with the Ministry and UNDP , the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda developed a plan to deploy 50 foreign legal experts to assist the Government in restarting all the essential functions of the judicial system , which presently suffers from an acute shortage of qualified local personnel .  
While the Working Group is convinced that a strengthening of international cooperation and solidarity is essential for universal realization of the right to development , it is aware than there are major weaknesses in the ability of the United Nations system to make this cooperation effective and sufficiently strong to solve the acute problems currently facing the international community .  
argument was not worth entertaining because the problems of the shelterless , the slum dwellers and the inhabitants of urban areas with deficient civic amenities were so severe and caused such acute human misery , that they needed to be addressed with the utmost urgency .  
The principle of poverty eradication is based on the framework adopted by the World Summit for Social Development and on the relevant outcomes of other major United Nations conferences , including the objective of meeting the basic needs of all people , especially those living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups , particularly in the developing countries where poverty is acute , as well as the objective of enabling all women and men to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen and productive employment and work .  NULL  
Lack of implementation is partially attributed to lack of resources , expertise and political commitment and to insufficient availability of factual and scientific information on , for example , successional change and variables such as growth and yield of tree species under varying intensities of forest management , relationship between harvesting practices and forest ecosystem functions etc .  The lack of scientifically sound information is even more acute in relation to ecological processes on which increasing emphasis has been made in recent years .  
However , the issues covered in this section are of major concern to industrialized and developing countries alike , though different objectives and priorities will be stressed in different circumstances .  For example , waste reduction and avoidance is a priority for countries facing acute shortages of disposal capacity ( e.g .  
The worsening of socio-economic conditions in many LDCs in the 1990s has increasingly been translated into a marked deterioration in human welfare as reflected in reduced caloric intakes , increased mortality and morbidity , the re-emergence and spread of diseases , lower school enrolment , further marginalization of the weakest members of society , and other signals of acute social distress , as further reviewed below in section V .  
Should the Commission be satisfied with the nature and amount of information presented thus far , and bearing in mind the legislative and policy pronouncements made by the General Assembly and the Council and its subsidiary bodies , it might wish to specify practical measures for an international course of action to guide States in combating an increasingly acute criminological phenomenon of transnational dimension .  
Perceived potential costs of illicit drug use include the possible health effects of acute or chronic toxicity ; the risk of arrest and punishment ; the effect on academic or career performance ; the danger , if caught , of being expelled from school or losing a job ; the risk of resultant stigma attached to the label of illicit drug user ; and individual feelings of guilt about defying parents , the law or a religious code .  
For such drugs , reduced consumption is usually aimed at tertiary prevention approaches that highlight the possible negative health consequences related to acute and chronic toxicity that may stem from binging , frequent and continued illicit consumption .  
The Board recognizes that the transportation and provision of controlled drugs needed for humanitarian aid in acute emergencies of natural or human origin constitute a genuine justification for non-application of the normal , regular control requirements .  
The consequences of substance use are diverse , including acute and chronic health problems , disruption to interpersonal relationships ( particularly within families ) , social marginalization , criminal behaviour , school failure , vocational problems and failure to achieve normal adolescent milestones .  
Proper management of the urban process entails strengthening democratic local government at all levels to mobilize the societal resources required to expand and modernize inadequate urban infrastructures and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of housing management to prevent the current shortage from becoming even more acute .  
Although a return to acute humanitarian crisis has been averted , political instability and the ensuing insecurity have prevented the country as a whole from moving into a straightforward reconstruction mode and , under current conditions , possibilities for medium - or long-term economic and social development are limited .  
Much of sub-Saharan Africa suffers from severe shortages of technical , managerial and entrepreneurial skills , acute infrastructure bottlenecks , weak institutional capabilities , severe limitations in the capacity to import , and continued dependence on exports of a few primary commodities .  
In the least developed countries and in a number of African countries where the private sector was weak , the public sector should play an active role in establishing the basic essential infrastructure , and international cooperation should focus on countries and sectors where the lack of such infrastructure was most acute .  
In view of the acute external financial constraints and low levels of domestic savings in most African countries , there was a pressing need to improve their capacity to attract foreign investment , in the process drawing investors ' attention to the considerable opportunities existing in all major economic sectors , namely natural resources , agro-industry , other manufacturing , tourism , other services , and infrastructure .  
enslaved national minorities such as the African _ Americans , Afro _ Brazilians , Dalits , etc . who suffer acute and persistent inequalities due to centuries of gross violation of their human rights through official State policies of enslavement , segregation , and attempted forced assimilation into the bottom levels or underclass of the dominant majority . 
Unfortunately , the world continues to witness many , not fewer , incidents of just and unjust wars , regional conflicts , civil and ethnic strife , acute forms of suffering , environmental degradation and unmitigated endangerment of life itself .  
The problem of the widening industrialization and technology gap is acknowledged to be particularly acute in sub-Saharan Africa , with 33 of the world 's 48 least developed countries , while macroeconomic stabilization programmes have been adopted by most African countries since the early 1980s in an attempt to create an enabling environment for long-term growth , they have usually not included any specific measures to promote industrial development .  
Information provided both by the Secretariat and by specialized agencies gives an objective quantitative picture of where the phenomena of poverty , unemployment and social disintegration are most acute : the same places experiencing an increased deterioration in the terms of trade ; protectionism ; a fall in the prices of exported raw materials ; and the drying up of financial flows .  
However , the management of natural resources and human settlements , the provision of basic social services , the support required for targeted programmes for poverty alleviation , the correction of acute gender disabilities , social protection , employment generation and skill development , the improvements sought in public administration and governance all priorities defined by the global community are typically activities that require public resources spent through public entities .  
Similarly , we note in the report the entry into force of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law ( UNIDROIT ) Convention and of the efforts to improve existing international conventions for the protection of world cultural properties and agree that our central goal should be increasing the number of ratifications and providing technical assistance to States with acute problems of illicit trafficking in archaeological objects , as well as aiding countries experiencing armed conflicts .  
WHO envisages future activities in the northern Caucasus region which are of primary importance , including projects aimed at the control of communicable diseases in the region , in particular vaccine preventable diseases , acute diarrhoeal diseases and tuberculosis , and mental health assistance .  [ 1 ] / Available for consultation in the Secretariat .  
The UNICEF multiple indicator cluster survey , conducted in 1996 by a team of international experts commissioned by the central statistical organizations and UNICEF in the 15 governorates , indicated that the rate of acute malnutrition or wasting in children of up to five years old was 11 per cent , chronic malnutrition , which results in stunting , affected 31 per cent and 26 per cent were underweight .  
There are many obstacles to resolving the acute problems and to raising public awareness of the need to protect the environment during the current period of financial difficulties and economic instability coupled with poverty and weak discipline .  
Attempts to apply a different standard to international law and to disregard its basic norms and principles create a dangerous precedent that could cause acute destabilization and chaos on the regional and global level .  
In the face of acute budgetary constraints in many developing countries and transition economies , intensified by the worldwide financial crisis , efforts to improve financing of the social sector must be seen in the perspective of a host of competing claims upon national treasuries . 
In 1995 , the general practitioners ' service , within which 45 per cent of all diseases , conditions and injuries were treated ( the number of which was 15.6 per cent higher than in 1994 ) , most frequently recorded acute respiratory diseases , hypertension , skeletal and muscular diseases and neurotic disorders , personality disorders and other mental disturbances .  
The leading diseases in pre-school children are acute respiratory infections , infections of the skin and subcutaneous tissue , anaemia owing to iron deficiency , infectious diseases of the digestive system ( diarrhoeal diseases ) ; in schoolchildren , besides the aforementioned , also important are injuries , neurotic disorders and personality disorders .  
Given the acute and urgent need for functioning courts , my Special Representative determined that regulation 1999 / 1 should be amended so as to give explicit legal validity to the practices followed by the courts .  
This has produced a disturbing split , caused by the fact that the technological explosion is taking place in the developed countries , where a lesser portion of the world ' s population lives , while elsewhere a demographic explosion is accompanied by an acute technological deficit .  
The fragile ecosystems of small island States and their generally more limited scope for pursuing alternative development strategies make concerns for the environmental impact of tourism very acute , particularly because the sector , which is almost totally dependent on the natural environment , is viewed by many small island developing States as a fast route to social and economic development .  
In recent years the African continent has witnessed many acute struggles that threatened peace and security and led to difficult humanitarian situations , with tragic economic and social dimensions .  
It was therefore regrettable that the Institute was now mired in an acute financial crisis which might force it to close down unless it received substantial contributions from Member States , together with the assurance of sustained multiyear contributions .  
He said that landlocked developing countries left on their own would not be able to cope with the formidable challenges posed by the acute problems facing them and that this fact was clearly recognized by the international community .  
The ongoing human suffering inflicted by conflicts , from Afghanistan to Angola and from the Middle East to the Great Lakes , is a daily reminder of the need for a new and concerted response at the highest political levels from Governments , which bear the primary responsibility for protecting civilians , from the Security Council , and from all others who can help cover the considerable distance still to be travelled if the international community is to find truly effective solutions in this area of acute human need .  
In the countries middle of an acute crisis and we have several examples of such crises in Africa the United Nations and the donors face the worst possible conditions in war-torn and occupied countries , with their resources sometimes plundered , and with a lack of clear political prospects for restoring trust among the people .  In these conditions , to start implementing the economic and social development programmes that are necessary for bringing about a lasting resolution to the crisis is a considerable challenge .  
These countries are characterized by their exposure to a series of vulnerabilities and constraints such as limited human , institutional and productive capacity ; acute susceptibility to external economic shocks , natural and man-made disasters and communicable diseases ; limited access to education , health and other social services and to natural resources ; poor infrastructure ; and lack of access to information and communication technologies .  
The challenges faced by developing countries in terms of acute food insecurity should be carefully addressed to ensure adequate flexibility in national policy design to foster domestic agricultural production .  
The nature of a debt problem may vary from acute balance-of-payments difficulties ( instances of illiquidity ) to longer-term structural , financial and resource transfer problems ( cases of insolvency ) . 13 The need for repeated reschedulings of official bilateral debts appears to be related to the fact that the Paris Club approach was originally designed to address liquidity problems hence the importance attached to the cut-off date in Paris Club agreements . 
The economic and social problems of the region remained acute and the rate of growth of gross domestic product ( GDP ) required to place Africa on the path of sustainable development had not been attained .  
In view of the failure of the global community to harness the benefits of globalization , as evidenced by increasing poverty and marginalization , it was legitimate to ask whether the best interests of the global community were served in a world of short-term profit-taking subject to acute cyclical reverses , where the biggest segment of the market remained undeveloped .  
The Secretary-General , in his report prepared in June 2000 ( A / 54 / 918-S / 2000 / 581 ) , had noted that 20 years after the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and after billions of dollars had been expended to feed successive war efforts , Afghanistan remained in a state of acute crisis , with its resources depleted , its intelligentsia in exile , its people disenfranchised , its traditional political structures shattered and its human development indices among the lowest in the world .  
Zhang Qiong , deputy procurator-general , when briefing reporters on related situations , emphasized that to reform the procuratorial work and strengthen the function and role of legal supervision , it is necessary to gradually set up a coordinated investigation mechanism , where the procuratorial organs across the country support , coordinate with , and assist each other ; to build in the Supreme People 's Procuratorate and all provincial-level procuratorates an investigation commanding center featured by unhindered acquisition of information , acute response , and effective commanding ability and a " personnel bank " of backbone investigators ;  
( 1 ) Those who discharge highly toxic waste liquid into a body of water or who discharge or dump waste residues containing mercury , cadmium , arsenic , chromium , cyanide , yellow phosphorus , or other soluble acute toxins into a body of water or directly bury them under the ground shall be liable to a fine below 100,000 yuan ;  
After China accedes to the WTO , our state enterprises will have to directly face acute competitions from the world 's multinational companies ; and the problems of an irrational product mix , a poor product development ability , and a backward management that are currently existing in our state enterprises are expected to manifest themselves in a more evident way .  All this requires us to comprehensively reinforce the management of enterprises ;  
In today 's world , the scientific and technological revolution is advancing by leaps and bounds , a knowledge economy is rising rapidly , economic globalization is currently undergoing an increasingly accelerated process , and competition in comprehensive national strength is becoming more and more acute .  
This meant that they were subject to double suffering and double tragic fate , which made the social and class contradictions of the undeveloped nations even more acute , such that they had no other way out except revolution , and outbursts of democratic revolutions in these countries became an inevitable necessity .  
At present , the mutual stirring of various cultural and ideological trends on a worldwide scale , the mingling of progressive and backward concepts , the increasing diversification of people 's orientations of value , moral concepts , and cultural choices and , in particular , the infiltration and offensives of the Western hostile forces against us , such as " Westernization " and " disintegration , " have made the contradiction and struggle in the ideological field more and more acute and complicated .  
A joint command will have to concentrate both qualified and capable command personnel and technologically advanced command facilities .  On the basis of guaranteeing efficient operation , a joint command will have to set up fewer vertical command links , and recruit fewer but highly capable personnel , aside from constantly studying new command measures , and raising command efficiency , thus ensuring timely , highly efficient , and acute command , and unleashing overall operational efficiency to the greatest extent , in a key zone , and at a crucial juncture .  
However , the world is still far from peaceful .  A multipolar world is evolving along a tortuous path , and so is economic globalization .  New profound changes are taking place in the world 's alignment of forces and distribution of interests - - the Chinese people who have won national independence and dignity are faced with acute challenges , and so is the great cause of rejuvenating the Chinese nation in the new century .  
Given that the trend toward a multipolar world , economic globalization , and information networking becomes increasingly apparent , that science and technology are advancing at an amazing speed , and that competition in comprehensive national strength becomes increasingly acute , new profound changes are taking place in the alignment of forces and the distribution of benefits in the world . 
From this interview , people can see that the Chinese Government and people have won a decisive victory in the struggle against the " Falungong " cult .  They also can see that Li Hongzhi has turned from a cult founder into a political tool of the international anti-China forces .  This means that our struggle against the " Falungong " cult in the future will still be a protracted , acute , and complicated one .

At this important historical juncture of the turn of the century , how to promote China 's scientific and technological progress and innovation , bring into play the important role of the number one productive forces of science and technology , continually provide a strong impetus for China 's economic and social development , and enable China to see even greater development in the acute international competition of the future are the significant tasks to which we must give careful consideration .  
Can China 's cause of socialism be consolidated and developed ?  Can China remain powerful and prosperous in face of the acute international competition in the future ?  The key lies in whether or not our party is able to continuously train a large number of high-quality leading personnel .  
We have accumulated an important experience in these past years .  That is , the more complex the situation is , the more arduous the tasks , and the more acute the struggle is , the more we should firmly adhere to Deng Xiaoping Theory and the party 's basic line , basic principle , and basic program and unswervingly concentrate our efforts in effecting an upswing in our economic construction , and make unremitting efforts to fulfill the party 's general goal and task during the socialist primary stage .  
the multi-polarization trend in the world pattern is irreversible ; and the competition of comprehensive national strength with the economic , scientific , technological , and military strength as well as national cohesion as the main content is tending to become more acute .  Judging from the general situation , peace and development remain the theme of the times .  
" We must fully understand the characteristic of Xinjiang 's anti-splittist struggle that it is protracted , acute and complex , unswervingly and firmly foster the idea that stability overrides everything , strengthen our sense of political responsibility in safeguarding Xinjiang 's stability , and stand on the forefront of the struggle consciously and on our own initiative to resolutely wage an uncompromising struggle against national splittism . "  
Today , when the 10th Five-Year Plan is formulated , the framework of a socialist market economy has been initially set up , the concept of building a market economy has struck deep roots in the hearts of people , the living standards of our people have basically reached a moderately high level , the supply of most commodities has exceeded their demand , economic globalization has become a major trend , China 's accession to the WTO is just round corner , and international competition is becoming increasingly acute .  
The motion , to be moved by Hon CHAN yuen-han , says : " That , as the current economic and employment situations remain acute , and low-income earners and the poor elderly who are not receiving the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance are very hard up , this Council urges the Government to provide them with different forms of assistance or allowances in transport , medical , housing and education services , etc . , so as to improve the livelihood of these people and their families and relieve the pressure on them . "  
Today 's meeting was held to ensure all government bureaux and departments join hands to disseminate information on relevant precautionary measures against the spread of atypical pneumonia , i.e . , severe acute respiratory syndrome .  
The spokesman said with effect from March 31 , the Director of Health will exercise her authority under the Quarantine and Prevention of Disease Ordinance to require individuals who have come into close contact with people suffering from severe acute respiratory syndrome to report daily to one of the four designated medical centres for check-up for 10 consecutive days after last contact .  
Mrs Ip assured the Consul-General that the Government had strengthened efforts in controlling the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome by preventing people likely to be infected from leaving the territory .  
The Chief Executive in Executive Council has approved an amendment regulation to empower health officers to prohibit persons who are suffering from the severe acute respiratory syndrome or those who have been exposed to the risk of the syndrome from leaving Hong Kong as an additional precautionary measure to contain the spread of the disease .  
The Government has set up various expert working groups ( e.g . on avian influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) ) and interdepartmental coordinating committees ( e.g . on SARS , dengue fever , cholera of enteroviral infection ) to facilitate disease control and research .  
This latest revision , along with the lifting of the Hong Kong travel advisory earlier by both the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , send a strong signal that severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) is contained in Hong Kong , travel is safe , and Hong Kong will continue to protect public health .  
" Bacterial food poisoning is expected to rise , " he said .  " The major contributing factors in food poisoning are cross-contamination between raw food and cooked food , as well as inadequate cooking .  Dr Tsang said the incidence of acute conjunctivitis was low in the first half of this year .  
The Government today ( August 8 ) has approved an application for financial assistance by the family members of a private doctor who died of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) contracted in the course of his professional practice .  
At the meeting , foreign guests discovered that the quality of Taiwan 's medicine had improved rapidly over the past 30 years . The death rate has declined and the average life expectancy has increased . This period has seen the eradication of most acute infectious diseases . Medical techniques and knowledge have advanced to such a degree that Taiwan may be considered equal to developed countries .  
One major reason is that these diseases - - ulcers , high blood pressure , heart and arterial disease , and so on - - are not acute illnesses brought on by a single cause , as many past epidemic diseases were , but are chronic illnesses brought on by numerous factors , so it is relatively hard to clarify cause and effect relationships .  
Despite this , the " neither large nor small " numbers of cases of these illnesses still leave people a little non-plussed when they see them . The threats to life and health from modern industrial society come from stress and environmental pollution - - cancer , heart disease , asthma , infertility , and other " diseases of modern civilization " caused by chemical or biological agents . Have n't these acute communicable illnesses transmitted by bacteria or viruses already been eradicated ?  
Hu You-huei , an associate professor of public health at the Yangming Medical College , revealed in a study that women have a higher incidence of acute , chronic , disabling , dental , and mild nervous conditions than men . "  
Associate professor Chung Wei-wen of National Chengchi University 's Graduate School of Journalism agrees with this judgement . Yet he still wants to wake up potential overseas students to the fact that knowledge is not a passive thing . When you go abroad , you can see the environment in all its pluralism and complexity , but if you do not have the ability to make acute observations and just hold on to your fixed frame of thinking , then it is like returning empty handed from a mountain of treasures .  
Lead water pipes are already being discarded by all countries ; manufacture of the lethal first generation of pesticides which contained organic mercury compounds has already been forbidden ; and the United States Food and Drug Administration has decreed a ban on using cadmium electroplated containers , because they can cause acute poisoning if used for any kind of acidic food or drink .  
" One shovelful could fill a tin can . " Today vast stretches of land have been developed , and pesticides have been badly overused in cultivated areas . Earthworms are highly vulnerable to sudden acute poisoning , " so that in many hectares of farmland , you could n't find a single worm , " says Huang , who worked hard with Kuo looking for the creatures in agricultural areas in Hsinchu .  
In terms of treatment of acute disorders , on the one hand , it is necessary to lessen the disparity between urban and rural areas ; on the other , a hierarchical medical care system must be developed , including basic medical care that covers the greatest possible area , second-level local medical care , and top-level regional hospital-centers ( RHCs ) and subdivisional hospital-centers ( SHCs ) , where complicated technology is a staple . The goal is delegating small hospitals for small ailments and big hospitals for big ailments .  
" However , I found out he was n't happy , " says Li . " On the one hand , my son strained his brain too much , and he did n't get enough exercise . His physique was skinny and weak , and he seemed fairly melancholy and introverted . What 's more , the gifted students ' class laid a lot of stress on grades , so the competition was acute .  
" The places society leaves out in the cold are precisely the places a church hospital should bring its warmth to . " Chou Tien-hung says that because National Health Insurance payments for long-stay beds are rather low , most hospitals are unwilling to provide them , since they operate at a loss . Therefore the Mennonite Hospital planned to expand its original 300 beds to 500 , with the additional 200 beds all being long-stay beds ; the shortfall in finance for long-stay care would be covered by the operating surplus from the acute outpatients department .  
But in the last few years , with dramatic changes in the political environment , skyrocketing property prices , massive stock market swings , political graft financed by money-laden conglomerates , and an unstable labor market , workers ' " sense of comparative exploitedness " has grown ever more acute , and their mood has become far more volatile . "  
Forty or fifty years ago , acute bacterial and viral diseases were the major cause of death in Taiwan . Today , they have been replaced by cancer and cerebrovascular disease . However , the threat from infectious diseases has not disappeared .  
He explains that when a patient first comes into the hospital , he is examined by a psychiatrist who treats his acute symptoms , such as insomnia , anxiety or depression . After his symptoms have been moderated , a clinical psychologist evaluates the patient 's personality and his physical and mental condition . Based on this , the clinical psychologist then provides counseling . If the patient 's abilities have deteriorated , an occupational therapist designs a rehabilitation program , which might include planning some recreational activities or interpersonal relations training .  
In " Looking Back , " a documentary on women in Taiwanese politics that was filmed with support from the DPP 's Department of Women 's Affairs , the late DPP women 's affairs director Peng Wan-ju made an acute observation about Yeh : Although it was her husband 's lingering shadow that took her into politics , Yeh 's performance has gone beyond the traditional experiences of women in opposition politics , transcending the image of a victimized family member to manifest the autonomy of a female political figure in her own right .  
It is 7:00 p.m . , and Pan , who has just hurried northward from Taichung , is driving his trusty old jeep on mountain roads skirting the Feitsui reservoir , on his way toward Pinglin . Despite the racket made by the car 's engine , his acute ears pick up the relentless clamor of a microhylid . The croaking of this mini-frog ( a mere two centimeters ) is reminiscent of an insect-ji-ji-ji . . . ji-ji-ji . . . .  
Ho Yen-tai , who is 76 this year , has the slim and healthy physique one sees so often in natives of Shandong Province . His hearing remains acute , and his eyes sharp , while his hands are dextrous enough to thread a needle with ease . His voice is vigorous , and when he gets excited he may even emphasize a point by striking the table with his palm .  
In addition to the acute harm caused by large quantities of poisonous chemicals , in the late 1980s people discovered that despite the increasing level of controls over the use of chemicals , even low levels of some compounds could still lead to chronic effects such as tumors , birth defects and genetic mutations .  
A warm and sunny May day would normally be a profitable and pleasant one for all manner of businesses . But the storm raging over the increasingly widespread epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) has enveloped the entire island of Taiwan in a mist of anxiety and tragedy .  
The outbreak of an epidemic of the pre-viously unknown disease SARS ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) revealed a Taiwan public health system shot through with flaws . But twenty years ago , Taiwan had suppressed malaria , Japanese encephalitis , infantile paralysis , and other infectious diseases and had successfully set up a powerful frontline , grassroots defense network against epidemics .  
A stable political situation with no acute ethnic conflicts has also made Romania increasingly accepted as a safe investment by the international community , which has , in turn , heightened foreign investor confidence  
We know how difficult was the road leading to the establishment of lasting peace in view of the level of distrust and the acute , accumulated suffering involved .  
The influx of young people into the labour market has led to the emergence of acute social problems ; rapid advances in many scientific and technical areas have posed new challenges that must be faced by the education and training systems if youth unemployment is to be addressed properly and prevented from giving rise to many social ills , such as marginalization , poverty and delinquency .  
Owing to the acute economic crisis , the State was unable to guarantee to a sufficient extent the protection of such inalienable rights as the right to work , the right to an adequate living standard and the right to housing or to protect the rights of many refugees and illegal immigrants in the country .  
Among the most acute issues were the continuing economic deterioration , the decline in real incomes , the spread of poverty , unemployment , massive migration and a sharp worsening of living standards for what appeared to be the majority of the population .  
In 1990 and 1991 , the main causes of infant and child mortality for both boys and girls had been preventable and treatable ; they included perinatal infections , acute respiratory infections , chronic diarrhoeal disease and nutritional deficiencies .  
In view of the challenging international context marked by countries in transition , ethnic conflicts , increase in refugees , acute complex developmental need and humanitarian assistance , the role of the resident coordinator - to lead a strong , integrated , effective team at the country level - has become even more crucial .  
Inadequate access to safe and effective contraceptive methods and high quality maternal care , and unsafe abortions , result in 500,000 maternal deaths a year , as well as in acute and chronic complications affecting approximately 20-million women .  
These include the acute crisis in the Balkans , the smouldering Cypriot problem , unresolved differences between Turkey and Greece , the periodic flare-up of tension in the Middle East , the uncertain situation regarding the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , illegal migration , the growth of religious violence , which feeds on the alarming disparities between rich and poor in individual countries , and on lagging economic development in various States .  
In the case of Belarus the problem of outstanding contributions for peace-keeping operations has taken on a particularly acute , and it would not be exaggerated to say , offensive character , primarily owing to the fact that the original motives for assigning Belarus to group ( b ) have become historically obsolete , its legal status under international law has changed and its economic situation has greatly deteriorated . 
A peaceful solution to the present acute and extremely dangerous crisis - one that would end up in a stable regional order , equality of States and good neighbourliness in the region - requires the active engagement of the most responsible international forums , especially the Security Council and United Nations Secretary-General .  
I am convinced that , notwithstanding the acute financial crisis currently facing the Organization , the provision of additional resources to UNOMIL , at a level that is modest by comparison with peace-keeping operations elsewhere , is justified by the hope that the Abuja Agreement at last offers a chance of ending the cruel war in Liberia and alleviating the terrible suffering it has caused .  
The worsening of socio-economic conditions in many LDCs in the 1990s has increasingly been translated into a marked deterioration in human welfare as reflected in reduced caloric intakes , increased mortality and morbidity , the re-emergence and spread of diseases , lower school enrolment , further marginalization of the weakest members of society , and other signals of acute social distress , as further reviewed below in chapter V .  
Three legal experts have worked with the Ministry of Justice and , in cooperation with the Ministry and UNDP , the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda developed a plan to deploy 50 foreign legal experts to assist the Government in restarting all the essential functions of the judicial system , which presently suffers from an acute shortage of qualified local personnel .  
While the Working Group is convinced that a strengthening of international cooperation and solidarity is essential for universal realization of the right to development , it is aware than there are major weaknesses in the ability of the United Nations system to make this cooperation effective and sufficiently strong to solve the acute problems currently facing the international community .  
argument was not worth entertaining because the problems of the shelterless , the slum dwellers and the inhabitants of urban areas with deficient civic amenities were so severe and caused such acute human misery , that they needed to be addressed with the utmost urgency .  
The principle of poverty eradication is based on the framework adopted by the World Summit for Social Development and on the relevant outcomes of other major United Nations conferences , including the objective of meeting the basic needs of all people , especially those living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups , particularly in the developing countries where poverty is acute , as well as the objective of enabling all women and men to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen and productive employment and work .  NULL  
Lack of implementation is partially attributed to lack of resources , expertise and political commitment and to insufficient availability of factual and scientific information on , for example , successional change and variables such as growth and yield of tree species under varying intensities of forest management , relationship between harvesting practices and forest ecosystem functions etc .  The lack of scientifically sound information is even more acute in relation to ecological processes on which increasing emphasis has been made in recent years .  
However , the issues covered in this section are of major concern to industrialized and developing countries alike , though different objectives and priorities will be stressed in different circumstances .  For example , waste reduction and avoidance is a priority for countries facing acute shortages of disposal capacity ( e.g .  
The worsening of socio-economic conditions in many LDCs in the 1990s has increasingly been translated into a marked deterioration in human welfare as reflected in reduced caloric intakes , increased mortality and morbidity , the re-emergence and spread of diseases , lower school enrolment , further marginalization of the weakest members of society , and other signals of acute social distress , as further reviewed below in section V .  
Should the Commission be satisfied with the nature and amount of information presented thus far , and bearing in mind the legislative and policy pronouncements made by the General Assembly and the Council and its subsidiary bodies , it might wish to specify practical measures for an international course of action to guide States in combating an increasingly acute criminological phenomenon of transnational dimension .  
Perceived potential costs of illicit drug use include the possible health effects of acute or chronic toxicity ; the risk of arrest and punishment ; the effect on academic or career performance ; the danger , if caught , of being expelled from school or losing a job ; the risk of resultant stigma attached to the label of illicit drug user ; and individual feelings of guilt about defying parents , the law or a religious code .  
For such drugs , reduced consumption is usually aimed at tertiary prevention approaches that highlight the possible negative health consequences related to acute and chronic toxicity that may stem from binging , frequent and continued illicit consumption .  
The Board recognizes that the transportation and provision of controlled drugs needed for humanitarian aid in acute emergencies of natural or human origin constitute a genuine justification for non-application of the normal , regular control requirements .  
The consequences of substance use are diverse , including acute and chronic health problems , disruption to interpersonal relationships ( particularly within families ) , social marginalization , criminal behaviour , school failure , vocational problems and failure to achieve normal adolescent milestones .  
Proper management of the urban process entails strengthening democratic local government at all levels to mobilize the societal resources required to expand and modernize inadequate urban infrastructures and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of housing management to prevent the current shortage from becoming even more acute .  
Although a return to acute humanitarian crisis has been averted , political instability and the ensuing insecurity have prevented the country as a whole from moving into a straightforward reconstruction mode and , under current conditions , possibilities for medium - or long-term economic and social development are limited .  
Much of sub-Saharan Africa suffers from severe shortages of technical , managerial and entrepreneurial skills , acute infrastructure bottlenecks , weak institutional capabilities , severe limitations in the capacity to import , and continued dependence on exports of a few primary commodities .  
In the least developed countries and in a number of African countries where the private sector was weak , the public sector should play an active role in establishing the basic essential infrastructure , and international cooperation should focus on countries and sectors where the lack of such infrastructure was most acute .  
In view of the acute external financial constraints and low levels of domestic savings in most African countries , there was a pressing need to improve their capacity to attract foreign investment , in the process drawing investors ' attention to the considerable opportunities existing in all major economic sectors , namely natural resources , agro-industry , other manufacturing , tourism , other services , and infrastructure .  
enslaved national minorities such as the African _ Americans , Afro _ Brazilians , Dalits , etc . who suffer acute and persistent inequalities due to centuries of gross violation of their human rights through official State policies of enslavement , segregation , and attempted forced assimilation into the bottom levels or underclass of the dominant majority . 
Unfortunately , the world continues to witness many , not fewer , incidents of just and unjust wars , regional conflicts , civil and ethnic strife , acute forms of suffering , environmental degradation and unmitigated endangerment of life itself .  
The problem of the widening industrialization and technology gap is acknowledged to be particularly acute in sub-Saharan Africa , with 33 of the world 's 48 least developed countries , while macroeconomic stabilization programmes have been adopted by most African countries since the early 1980s in an attempt to create an enabling environment for long-term growth , they have usually not included any specific measures to promote industrial development .  
Information provided both by the Secretariat and by specialized agencies gives an objective quantitative picture of where the phenomena of poverty , unemployment and social disintegration are most acute : the same places experiencing an increased deterioration in the terms of trade ; protectionism ; a fall in the prices of exported raw materials ; and the drying up of financial flows .  
However , the management of natural resources and human settlements , the provision of basic social services , the support required for targeted programmes for poverty alleviation , the correction of acute gender disabilities , social protection , employment generation and skill development , the improvements sought in public administration and governance all priorities defined by the global community are typically activities that require public resources spent through public entities .  
Similarly , we note in the report the entry into force of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law ( UNIDROIT ) Convention and of the efforts to improve existing international conventions for the protection of world cultural properties and agree that our central goal should be increasing the number of ratifications and providing technical assistance to States with acute problems of illicit trafficking in archaeological objects , as well as aiding countries experiencing armed conflicts .  
WHO envisages future activities in the northern Caucasus region which are of primary importance , including projects aimed at the control of communicable diseases in the region , in particular vaccine preventable diseases , acute diarrhoeal diseases and tuberculosis , and mental health assistance .  [ 1 ] / Available for consultation in the Secretariat .  
The UNICEF multiple indicator cluster survey , conducted in 1996 by a team of international experts commissioned by the central statistical organizations and UNICEF in the 15 governorates , indicated that the rate of acute malnutrition or wasting in children of up to five years old was 11 per cent , chronic malnutrition , which results in stunting , affected 31 per cent and 26 per cent were underweight .  
There are many obstacles to resolving the acute problems and to raising public awareness of the need to protect the environment during the current period of financial difficulties and economic instability coupled with poverty and weak discipline .  
Attempts to apply a different standard to international law and to disregard its basic norms and principles create a dangerous precedent that could cause acute destabilization and chaos on the regional and global level .  
In the face of acute budgetary constraints in many developing countries and transition economies , intensified by the worldwide financial crisis , efforts to improve financing of the social sector must be seen in the perspective of a host of competing claims upon national treasuries . 
In 1995 , the general practitioners ' service , within which 45 per cent of all diseases , conditions and injuries were treated ( the number of which was 15.6 per cent higher than in 1994 ) , most frequently recorded acute respiratory diseases , hypertension , skeletal and muscular diseases and neurotic disorders , personality disorders and other mental disturbances .  
The leading diseases in pre-school children are acute respiratory infections , infections of the skin and subcutaneous tissue , anaemia owing to iron deficiency , infectious diseases of the digestive system ( diarrhoeal diseases ) ; in schoolchildren , besides the aforementioned , also important are injuries , neurotic disorders and personality disorders .  
Given the acute and urgent need for functioning courts , my Special Representative determined that regulation 1999 / 1 should be amended so as to give explicit legal validity to the practices followed by the courts .  
This has produced a disturbing split , caused by the fact that the technological explosion is taking place in the developed countries , where a lesser portion of the world ' s population lives , while elsewhere a demographic explosion is accompanied by an acute technological deficit .  
The fragile ecosystems of small island States and their generally more limited scope for pursuing alternative development strategies make concerns for the environmental impact of tourism very acute , particularly because the sector , which is almost totally dependent on the natural environment , is viewed by many small island developing States as a fast route to social and economic development .  
In recent years the African continent has witnessed many acute struggles that threatened peace and security and led to difficult humanitarian situations , with tragic economic and social dimensions .  
It was therefore regrettable that the Institute was now mired in an acute financial crisis which might force it to close down unless it received substantial contributions from Member States , together with the assurance of sustained multiyear contributions .  
He said that landlocked developing countries left on their own would not be able to cope with the formidable challenges posed by the acute problems facing them and that this fact was clearly recognized by the international community .  
The ongoing human suffering inflicted by conflicts , from Afghanistan to Angola and from the Middle East to the Great Lakes , is a daily reminder of the need for a new and concerted response at the highest political levels from Governments , which bear the primary responsibility for protecting civilians , from the Security Council , and from all others who can help cover the considerable distance still to be travelled if the international community is to find truly effective solutions in this area of acute human need .  
In the countries middle of an acute crisis and we have several examples of such crises in Africa the United Nations and the donors face the worst possible conditions in war-torn and occupied countries , with their resources sometimes plundered , and with a lack of clear political prospects for restoring trust among the people .  In these conditions , to start implementing the economic and social development programmes that are necessary for bringing about a lasting resolution to the crisis is a considerable challenge .  
These countries are characterized by their exposure to a series of vulnerabilities and constraints such as limited human , institutional and productive capacity ; acute susceptibility to external economic shocks , natural and man-made disasters and communicable diseases ; limited access to education , health and other social services and to natural resources ; poor infrastructure ; and lack of access to information and communication technologies .  
The challenges faced by developing countries in terms of acute food insecurity should be carefully addressed to ensure adequate flexibility in national policy design to foster domestic agricultural production .  
The nature of a debt problem may vary from acute balance-of-payments difficulties ( instances of illiquidity ) to longer-term structural , financial and resource transfer problems ( cases of insolvency ) . 13 The need for repeated reschedulings of official bilateral debts appears to be related to the fact that the Paris Club approach was originally designed to address liquidity problems hence the importance attached to the cut-off date in Paris Club agreements . 
The economic and social problems of the region remained acute and the rate of growth of gross domestic product ( GDP ) required to place Africa on the path of sustainable development had not been attained .  
In view of the failure of the global community to harness the benefits of globalization , as evidenced by increasing poverty and marginalization , it was legitimate to ask whether the best interests of the global community were served in a world of short-term profit-taking subject to acute cyclical reverses , where the biggest segment of the market remained undeveloped .  
The Secretary-General , in his report prepared in June 2000 ( A / 54 / 918-S / 2000 / 581 ) , had noted that 20 years after the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and after billions of dollars had been expended to feed successive war efforts , Afghanistan remained in a state of acute crisis , with its resources depleted , its intelligentsia in exile , its people disenfranchised , its traditional political structures shattered and its human development indices among the lowest in the world .
