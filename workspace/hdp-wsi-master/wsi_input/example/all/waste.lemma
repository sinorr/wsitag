The leader of the project , Dai Sirui , from Southwest Agricultural University , said the project involved the study and demonstration of key technologies of people 's working and living , ecological problems , city waste water and garbage disposal , landslide monitoring warning , pasture and husbandry sectors ' development , advantageous and unique sector 's development , and ecological and economic system reconstruction after the Three Gorges Dam conserved water .  
It is necessary to maintain a good image of strictly disciplining ourselves and practicing clean and honest government , take a correct view of the powers in our hands , take the lead in observing discipline and law , persist in honest administration , and wage resolute struggle against negative phenomena of corruption such as abuse of power , harming the public for private profit , using public office for private gain , and extravagance and waste .  
( 1 ) Those who discharge highly toxic waste liquid into a body of water or who discharge or dump waste residues containing mercury , cadmium , arsenic , chromium , cyanide , yellow phosphorus , or other soluble acute toxins into a body of water or directly bury them under the ground shall be liable to a fine below 100,000 yuan ;  
( 2 ) those who discharge or dump radioactive solid waste matter , oils , acid liquors , alkaline liquors , or wastewater containing substance of a high or average radioactivity into a body of water shall be liable to a fine below 50,000 yuan ;  
Its main function is to undertake the treatment and disposal of nuclear energy , nuclear material , nuclear fuel , exhausted fuel , and radioactive waste , the prospecting and excavation of uranium deposits , the scientific research and development as well as the construction , production , and operation of nuclear energy and nuclear-related fields , such as nuclear instrument and equipment , isotope , nuclear technology application , and economic cooperation with foreign countries and import-export businesses .  
makes information distorted and policy decisions wrong ; causes the waste of many human , material , and financial resources and precious time ; and enables the people to lose many rare chances for development .  
Through continuing to deepen the fiscal and taxation reforms , we should establish a complete and unified fiscal and taxation system , and expand the sources of government revenue ; we must also strengthen fiscal and tax management and ensure that all collectable revenue is collected , put a stop to artificial revenue loss , rationally arrange fiscal funds , pay attention to returns in the use of funds , oppose extravagance and waste , and promote thrift and economy .  
Operations under high-tech conditions are the combined operations of all the military branches ; and in adapting correspondingly , equipment support can only be planned overall after going through the three branches ' joint support , and only then will there be a rational distribution of resources , organizational chaos be overcome , waste of materials and equipment be overcome , work procedures be simplified , and non-support consumption be lessened , fully putting into play the capability of existing resources .  
Statistical data from a battlefield showed that , after a tank crew have stayed in a small and closed space for a long time where it is filled with various kinds of radiation , waste gases , electromagnetic waves , heat , and noises , tank speed reduced by 19 percent , time to complete shooting increased by 35 percent , miss-hitting increased by 4 percent , and , in real-combat exercises , their fighting capacity declined by 7 to 10 percent everyday .  
We should further strengthen a sense of anxiety , of urgency and of mission and put into full play an excellent working style of making full use of every minute , work in a sweeping and resolute manner , do work right after we say we will do it and try to do work well .  We should thoroughly eradicate unhealthy , formalistic , deceptive working styles that waste time and should devote solid and effective efforts to implement all aspects of work .  
It was disclosed that the entire system is likely to cost as much as $ 60-billion upon completion .  However , no one is yet sure if the system will serve as " a seamless heavenly robe " free of problems upon completion .  Moreover , as modern science and technology are still developing at lightning speed , it is difficult to tell if the NMD system will end up as a heap of waste material in future .  
The economic , legal , and necessary administrative means should be used comprehensively to shut down enterprises which produce goods of inferior quality , waste resources , cause serious pollution , and do not have production safety conditions ; eliminate backward equipment , technology , and techniques ; cut down on surplus production capacity , and prevent these enterprises from reviving .  
It is necessary to actively promote legal administration , to intensify law enforcement inspections , to strengthen law enforcement oversight , to firmly implement the principles of following existing laws , strict law enforcement , and tracking down offenses against the law , to curb waste and destruction of resources , and to effectively improve the ecological environment in order to provide effective guarantees for sustainable economic and social development .  
On the one hand , the troops should participate in and support the ecological and environmental constructions , and on the other hand , they should take the lead to clean up the sources of pollution and focus on the comprehensive treatment of the garrisons ' everyday waste water , the oil-polluted water used to clean equipment , the waste water discharged from hospitals and clinics , and smoke and dust emission from boilers and so on to make sure that the sources of pollution will meet the emission and discharge standards after the treatment .  
Retired General Gordon Sullivan , former Army chief of staff , delivered a resentful speech attacking Rumsfeld 's reform as being " rash and reckless , " and the space militarization program even as a total waste of the national defense budget .  
We should create a warm , joyful , united , inspiring atmosphere around the main theme , and should organize various activities with the spirit of innovation by improving the work style , stressing real results , preventing waste and extravagance , and opposing formalism . 
The nation 's discharge of sulfur dioxide , chemical oxygen demand , dust , industrial solid waste and other major pollutants should be cut by 10 percent relative to 2000 ' s level .  In particular , the emission of sulfur dioxide in the " two controlled " zones should be reduced by 20 percent compared to 2000 ' s levels .  
Third , by way of structural readjustment , the province should close down a number of small factories and small mines which are plagued by backward production techniques and unmarketable products and which have caused a huge waste of resources and a heavy pollution to the environment ; meanwhile , to meet the demands of the modern enterprise system , the province should extend support to a number of dominating enterprises which have a great bearing on the country 's overall situation , and should further readjust and optimize its industrial structure .  
The 44th session of the IAEA General Conference , which started on 18 September , will review the IAEA 's 1999 annual report , as well as reports on stepping up international cooperation in nuclear safety , radiation safety , and radioactive waste safety , on intensifying the IAEA 's technological cooperation , and on preventing illicit trafficking in nuclear materials . 
The current centralized cleanup has further implemented " several regulations on rigorous enforcement of economy and curbing luxury and waste practiced at party and government organs issued by the State Council under the Central CPC Committee , " promoted the development of cultivating honesty and self-discipline among leading cadres at central and state organs , and improved the common practices at various organs , in addition to saving a huge amount of state funds .  
They neither reach deep into the reality nor go deep among the masses .  Refraining from making investigations and studies and without a clear understanding of the real situation , they act on their own personal feeling and subjective will .  What they are seeking is their own promotion .  They deceive their superiors and delude their subordinates and make false work performance .  And they do not hesitate to waste manpower and public funds .  As for the people 's well-being and demands , they are indifferent and insensitive .  
This year in particular , there have been consecutive incidents of the killing of a South Korean hostess by a U.S . serviceman , the " mistaken bombing " by the U.S . military at Maehyang-Ri , and the discharge of poisonous waste fluid into the Han River by the U.S . military .  This has touched off even stronger anti-U.S . sentiments .  
The completion of these projects will add to the cities 18.87 million-ton daily water supply capacity , 8.24 million-ton daily waste water treatment capacity , 31,317-ton solid waste treatment capacity , 7.8 million cubic meters daily gas supply capacity , and 1,585 kilometers of network of water supply and discharge and gas pipelines .  We have added another 1,308 kilometers of new urban roadways , built 21 bridges , and added 86.84 million square meters of heated space .  
The new facility is designed and is being built to meet stringent environmental standards .  An underground waste water treatment plant is under construction for treatment of effluent generated from livestock holding and slaughter .  
Holders of valid Dumping Licences for public filling areas may be permitted to dump materials such as earth , building debris , broken rock and concrete at the barging point provided that the materials are free from marine mud , household refuse , plastic , metal , industrial and chemical waste , animal and vegetable matter and other materials considered unsuitable . 
The Government 's policy objective on the environmental well-being of the community is to improve our urban , rural and marine surroundings , conserve our natural heritage , and optimise the use of resources and goods so as to reduce pollution and waste and promote health and the enjoyment of our living environment .  
The EIA identified there to be air quality , noise , water quality , blasting and solid waste impacts during quarrying and site formation operations , but concluded that , with suitable mitigation measures and good monitoring and audit programme implemented , such impacts could be controlled to within the established standards and guidelines . 
Seminars and experience-sharing sessions on environmental protection issues are jointly organised by the Education Department , other government departments and green groups on a regular basis for primary and secondary schools .  The main contents of these sessions include waste disposal .  
" We understand that local recyclers are facing difficulties because of reduced demand and stiff competition from countries that have devalued their currencies .  We are aware that in some countries their arrangements are , in effect , encouraging them to export subsidised waste paper to Hong Kong and elsewhere . "  
Every day , 4,000 tonnes of waste paper are produced .  About 2,000 tonnes are either part of domestic waste and go straight to landfills , mostly through USD and RSD collection services , or are of poor quality or contaminated commercial waste that the collectors again take direct to the landfills or refuse transfer stations .  
The Department also set up a Healthy Living into the 21st Century exhibition counter at the Victoria Park Fair venue to disseminate environmental protection , hygiene and health related messages with a heavy focus on the activities of the Council in these matters .  The exhibition materials included photographs , video-tapes , and model display on environmental protection activities such as waste reduction , environmental hygiene , healthy living style among students , etc .  
There are special conditions in the contract for these approved contractors to safeguard the classified waste handled by them and to prevent unauthorised or accidental access to the information contained therein .  
A vessel sank between Tap Mun Chau and Chek Chau on January 1 , last year , but to date a container on the sunken vessel is still left in the sea and has not been salvaged .  Recently , the plastic waste inside that container has been flowing out from the container and drifting about in the nearby waters , resulting in the death of a substantial amount of marine fish in the fish culture zones in these waters , and causing serious damage to marine ecology .  
I have recently received complaints from the public that some recycling bins provided by the Council are not cleared .  Hence , people who support environmental protection discover that these bins are too full for further loading when they carry the domestic waste papers and other recyclable items to the bins .  This would not only disappoint those people who support environmental protection , but would also lead to the waste papers and other recyclable items being accumulated next to the bins , resulting in stacks of refuse .  
" The working group will continue to take a more pro-active role in controlling flytipping , through extension of opening hours for public filling areas and public barging points and giving farmers instructions on how to dispose of animal carcasses . "  " Other controlling measures include strengthening legislation on trip-ticket system for disposal of construction and demolition material , and circulating guidelines to assist the staff of its member departments in the clearance of illegal dumping of chemical waste materials , " he added .  
For this purpose , Marine Department ( MD ) has a fleet of 61 vessels to clean up floating refuse within Hong Kong waters everyday and to provide domestic waste collection services to overseas as well as local vessels .  
" Our recurrent expenditure on environmental protection and conservation will grow by 7.6% in real terms , reflecting additional resources for commissioning and operating new sewage treatment plants , increased payments for the disposal of waste due to the commissioning of new facilities , additional staff for implementing air quality initiatives and additional resources for new barging points and for sorting facilities for construction and demolition waste . " she added .  
Whilst the EPD shares Greenpeace 's concern on issues such as the need to control persistent organic pollutants , promote clean industry , enhance waste recovery and recycling , the EPD is very concerned that Greenpeace 's action has often done the opposite in misleading the public in understanding some key environmental issues .  
" In this respect , the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department 's primary waste management role is to ensure the hygienic collection and transport of domestic waste , they are keen to see how they can better support the Government 's objective of increasing the recovery and reuse of valuable materials , " the spokesman stressed . 
Due to rapid increase in the population in Sha Tin and indiscriminate discharges from industrial , commercial , livestock and domestic sources , the Shing Mun River was heavily polluted in the 1980s .  The organic pollution load discharged into the river in those days was around 9 000 kg Biochemical Oxygen Demand ( BOD ) per day , which was equivalent to the waste discharged from about 160 000 people .  
Clean Hong Kong is one of the initiatives stated in the Chief Executive 's Policy Address this year .  The objective is to bring about visible and sustainable improvements on the ground through both active cleansing operations and public education and publicity efforts .  It will last for three years and comprise four key elements : * Stepped up enforcement action against littering and dumping of waste ;  
As to outward port cargo , marked increases were recorded for artificial resins and plastic materials ( + 40% ) , iron and steel ( + 28% ) , metalliferous ores and metal scrap ( + 27% ) , pulp and waste paper ( + 17% ) , furniture and parts thereof ( + 16% ) , and live animals chiefly for food and edible animal products ( + 13% ) .  
It is characterised by a number of green features including electronic ballast and energy saving bulbs , waste collectors for recyclables , asbestos-free insulating materials , a ventilation system powered by solar energy and a sunroof to maximise the use of natural light .  
The Authority has also set key environmental management goals and targets for the coming years .  These include improving energy saving in new estates and the recovery rate of waste for recycling , increasing water recycling at construction sites , enhancing environmental design of residential buildings and adopting environmentally friendly building materials .  
The need and reasonableness of an across-the-board cut is doubtful .  The Housing Authority 's current measure to re-assess the rent for individual commercial tenant according to commercial principles can better reflect the reality and help needy tenants maintain their competitiveness .  Rental reductions will not benefit shop tenants which have been enjoying prosperous business .  If so , this would be a waste of public funds .  
According to the findings of the EIA study , the potential impacts arising from the project on various aspects ( including impacts on water quality , air quality , noise , waste management , ecology , fisheries and cultural heritage as well as landscape and visual impacts ) can meet the established environmental objectives .  
As for outward port cargo , significant increases were recorded in pulp and waste paper ( + 23% ) , organic chemicals ( + 12% ) , artificial resins and plastic materials ( + 11% ) and iron and steel ( + 11% ) .  
As for other types of battery waste which are disposed of at the three landfills , they should not cause environmental problems since the landfills are lined with impermeable liners to prevent underground leakage of contaminated liquid , and such liquid is properly collected and treated within the landfills .  
Senior Environmental Protection Officer Mr Fok Wai-kai said : " Through daily work and extensive and frank discussions with officials in Shanghai , I have acquired comprehensive knowledge of their organisational arrangements as well as Shanghai 's complicated waste management networks .  
Earlier this year , in view of the increased public awareness and use of the waste separation bins , we considered it opportune to examine whether recycling of plastic bags would be practical and economically viable .  
( c ) We have always encouraged the environmental industry to recover and recycle different kinds of materials .  Hence , the CWTC and some private chemical waste disposal facilities have been recycling chemical waste .  Examples include the recovery of copper oxide from spent etchant ; fuel from oily water waste ; production of lubricating oil , hydraulic oil and moulding oil from different types of recycled waste oil ; silver from photofinishing waste ; and precious metals such as gold and silver from spent plating solution .  
As for outward port cargo , marked increases were recorded for " iron and steel " ( + 37% ) , " organic chemicals " ( + 30% ) , " pulp and waste paper " ( + 26% ) , " metalliferous ores and metal scrap " ( + 24% ) , " toys " ( + 22% ) , and " furniture and parts thereof " ( + 14% ) .  
The area is divided into two sections , separated with stainless steel netting to facilitate the disposal of the waste left by the fish . Thus , a delicate balance is kept between the acid and alkali content of the water , which helps to improve the growth of the abalone .  
After several years of intensive work , Mr . Chuang eventually produced a machine which is faster , processing up to 110 pieces a minute , only one thirteenth the size of the imported models , and only requires a three-quarters of a horsepower engine to operate . The waste rate is also low , with 82 kilograms of peeled asparagus obtained from 100 kilograms of the raw material .  
If we do not push hard for advanced development , how can we compete with other industrial countries ? For people who assumed nature 's resources to be infinite , the energy crunch of the 1970 ' s was a rude awakening , an indication of impending environmental crises stemming from careless spoiling and waste of natural resources .  
At a time when foreign currency reserves were low , the purchase of U . S . $ 2,000 worth of fruit trees seemed wasteful . Chiang Ching-kuo reassured Sung that money spent on scientific research was never a waste .  
Says Tseng : " Silt and sediment from the upper reaches of Hualien River has produced a sharp decline in the river 's animal and plant life . On top of this , the waste water discharged from nearby factories has polluted the river and raised the water temperature , so there are a lot fewer ku fish there now . "  
The length of time required for the 14 major development projects varies according to their nature . For example , China Steel 's third expansion project can be completed this year , yet only about five kilometers a year can be completed of the Taipei municipal rapid transit system , which will reach 100 kilometers in length , while the urban waste disposal project is an ongoing one .  
As to how to clean up the Tamsui River system , Premier Yu stated that his preliminary view is that the main sources of pollution of the Tamsui River system are pollution caused by urban domestic sewage , industrial waste water , and refuse dumped along the river banks .  
With the development of science and technology , the amount of waste is increasing at an alarming rate all over the world , including many items which are not biodegradable . In addition , the habit of frugality has been flagging with the advent of material plenty , and things are as easily thrown out as they are acquired .  
In the past , refuse was invariably used for compost , burned or buried . Compost heaps have no place in an increasingly urban society , and open-air burning has been relinquished because of the air pollution it creates , but the growth of waste in a prosperous , industrialized nation is usually faster than that of the population .  
In the past , scientific and technological development was clearly aimed at increasing our per capita income , but now that the economy has taken off , " raising the quality of life is the most pressing task at hand , " says Ma Nan-hsien , director of planning and evaluation at the National Science Council . The proportion of resources devoted to environmental and medical research , such as developing better waste processing technology or setting up a National Health Research Institute , will constantly increase .  
To stay outside the patterns of adult life and just hang out means to waste the most precious period of life of learning skills and knowledge . Also , given the disapproving attitude of others , it will be hard to avoid a decline in self-respect and self - esteem , which will have a negative influence on long-term prospects . At the same time , it is also a great waste of educational resources , social re sources and economic development .  
In Mexico , for example , 12.5 square meters of forest are burned for each 11 kilograms of formula produced . Waste from the cows creates vast amounts of methane , adding to global warming . It requires a great deal of energy to manufacture dry powdered milk from the original milk . Packaging requires the expenditure and waste of large amounts of tin , aluminum , and plastic ; for example in the U . S . 550 million empty formula tins are discarded annually , while Taiwan throws away about five million .  
Although many environmental scholars believe that there is also a problem of organic pollution , the scholarly community still lacks indepth under-standing in this area . In any case , organic waste is highly mobile ; Taiwan also has strong winds and heavy rains , " and has the good fortune to be surrounded by sea on all sides , so just two or three storms and most of it gets washed away , " is how one scholar describes it .  
Mr . Bigs should clean up their heavy metal : Faced with the red , blue , green , and other variously colored liquid pollutants generated by the electroplating industry , the industrial community ten years ago thought to follow the example of Japan and establish a special electroplating industrial zone to concentrate the scattered factories in one place and treat the waste water collectively .  
Lee Tung-liang , a Changhua County Councilor and a leader in the anti-Dupont environmental movement , says that if the water quality does not improve he is thinking about calling on the farmers to let all their land go to waste , and appeal to the county magistrate . " But , that would probably be very hard , and I 'm afraid it would n't be easy to get a positive response from the farmers . "  
They continually penetrate the soil , eating an amount of soil each day equal to their body weight , while their digestive system is like a factory line sucking in rough earth and waste and producing " night soil beads , " which are superior to bits of ordinary soil . Besides having greater air content , these " night soil beads " also have one third more water and microbes . Earthworm manure is excellent fertilizer .  
Further , the voters should respect the fact that legislators are national level representatives , and must be responsible to the people of the whole nation , and not ask their legislators to waste their money and energy going to local social gatherings or attending weddings and funerals and the like [ as local officials routinely do ] , nor select legislators on the basis of localism or the narrow concerns of some special interest group . This is the only way to give legislators more room to attend to the policy process .  
This company located in Kaohsiung originally made badminton racquet heads , whose main raw material is cork . Not only does cork have to be imported from abroad , it is even more troublesome to deal with the waste after the wood is processed .  
The government has set up a treatment plant for highly concentrated electroplating fluid in the Taichung area , and it is encouraging operators to use collective methods to turn their waste water over to specialists for disposal . Yet there are those who would rather sneak around and evade legal restraints .  
Formerly a planner for an advertising agency , Huang noticed many years ago that colorful and attractive magazine advertisements and calendar photos would serve as good basic material for creating original illustrations . TaKing great pains to gather these photos and art work that others saw as waste paper , he has cut them up and pasted them together into 150 collages that accompany the text .  
When the various conflicts surrounding the health insurance system became a hot topic of discussion , most people probably overlooked one basic fact : The universal health care plan is actually only a financial design , and its goal is to eliminate " loss and waste " from the vast health care system . As for actual medical service , one still must look to the same health care network of medical centers and personnel that is already in place .  
National Yang Ming University professor of public health Lan Chung-fu , who was the first to put forward a plan for health care network development , indicates that medical resources are precious and limited , and the main spirit of a health care network plan is : to reasonably distribute medical resources , to avoid inadequate supplies and to curb waste .  
For example , Taipower has always claimed that the costs of nuclear power are low . But as yet there is no way to finally dispose of nuclear waste , and it will impose enormous costs on the next generation . The maximum for compensation in the event of an accident at a nuclear power plant has been set at NT $ 1.4 billion , and the law says that anything over that amount will be paid by the government , thus artificially lowering the calculated costs of nuclear power immensely .  
In addition , and more worthy of attention , a number of jade pendants and other decorative objects made from " Taiwan soft jade " have been found at Tamalin . A large amount of jade craft waste material has also been found . This situation resembles that uncovered in Wanjung Rural Township in Hualien , which is known as a " jade handicraft site " of prehistoric people .  
But the charms of the traditional fishing industry are being threatened . Factories on the land emit poisonous waste , deforming the spines of the fish that swim at the mouth of the river . Liao has witnessed large-scale drift nets thrown by large fishing vessels catching all fish large and small . The heavy iron chains of the drift net destroy the sea bed , and it will take the sea bed , which nourishes the sea , decades to heal its wound .  
At museums , on the street , at sidewalk stands , in temples , at the vanguard of urban design , and in the shifting light and shadows of the city , looking for the value of existence , I 'm oppressed by a nightmare that piles up over my head as thick as clouds , blocking the road ahead . Masses of people coming , masses of people going , and I 'm just living on here in this empty , preposterous world of corruption and waste .  
But from the point of view of international goodwill and the natural reaction most people have toward anything nuclear , it might have been best to give more attention to the issues raised by concerned observers . For example , Michael Kau , a scholar at Brown University in the US , and Fang Chien , a well-known environmental activist , pointed out that no one wants nuclear waste in their back yard , and disregarding the sentiments of a neighbor does not conform to Chinese ethics .  
Kaohsiung 's major source of running water comes from the Kaoping River , but agricultural pollution ( both in the form of pesticides and livestock waste ) and illegal dumping of garbage have seriously eroded the quality of Kaoping River water , which has received low water-quality designations for several years running .  
Chen Shu says that as an agent , of course he wants to make sure all the paperwork proceeds smoothly , and yet the required paperwork for fishing vessels to enter and exit the harbor is very complicated . Argentina is very strict on safety , as strict as any developed country . It requires stringent guards against environmental pollution-oil can not be poured directly into the sea , and there must be oil and water filtering mechanisms , chemical treatment of human waste , foot activation devices for washing hands , and so on .  
The park was originally approved to release a maximum of 28,200 kiloliters of treated effluent per day . But in October and November of last year , the electronics industry was booming and the volume of effluent increased rapidly . Treated waste water from the park hit a record high of over 72,000 kiloliters . And recently average daily discharge has been running at around 53,000 kiloliters .  
According to regulations , when the volume of effluent exceeds the approved maximum by 10% , a report of this fact and an application to increase the approved maximum must be submitted . But the approval process takes six months and the volume of waste water was continuing to grow at an explosive rate . As such , the park was unable to avoid exceeding the stipulated volume .  
Chunghsing Village was modeled after English communities . Over 40 years ago , it was unique in Taiwan for its waste water treatment and rain water drainage systems , its specially planted camphor trees , bodhi trees , and assorted grasses and plants , giving the entire village plentiful greenery and shade .  
In Bengbu , a group of teenagers sent down to work in the countryside goes through an unexpected experience on the way there which shows just how unprepared they are for the adult world into which they 've been pushed . In Backstage , a group of performers waste away their youth in an underfunded , lackluster performing arts troupe . In Sisters , one promising young woman after another is transformed by marriage from the apple of everyone 's eye into just another boring housewife .  
FPG moved quickly to clarify the situation , and later stated that there had indeed been deficiencies in the selection of the company to which it had contracted disposal of the waste . It also assumed responsibility for shipping the waste back to Taiwan , where it is now stored on a temporary site near Kaohsiung harbor . But despite these actions , FPG 's image as a pragmatic and responsible company has been severely tarnished .  
" If it had n't been for the Formosa Plastics mercury waste incident in Cambodia , who knows how long the chaos in Taiwan 's management , storage and disposal of hazardous industrial wastes would have continued , along with the tremendous threat it poses to human health and the environment ? " asks Professor Lin Cheng-fang of National Taiwan University 's Graduate Institute of Environmental Engineering , giving FPG some backhanded credit for highlighting the issue .  
Under the ROC 's " Standard Criteria for Identifying Hazardous Industrial Wastes , " hazardous wastes are divided into three major categories . The first comprises specifically listed substances which are generated by industrial processes or are inherently toxic . The second comprises substances defined as hazardous by their characteristics , including those which are corrosive , flammable or infectious ( mostly medical waste ) , or contain individual non-ferrous metals . This includes substances such as powerful oxidants which may cause other materials to ignite .  
The recyclers also tipped the waste liquid from their acid baths into the nearby Erhjen Creek , turning its waters black and giving rise to the notorious " green oyster incident . "  
As environmental standards have risen , the Basel Convention has been repeatedly amended . It lists over 50 types of hazardous waste for which cross-border movements are controlled , and by coordination with the World Customs Organization , new tariff schedule codes have been defined to more effectively control international movements of hazardous waste .  
In fact , because there is nowhere else for hazardous waste to go , under current regulations waste which has been solidified or stabilized , and which passes leaching tests to ensure that there is no danger of toxins escaping , can be buried in segregated areas of city and county sanitary landfills .  
However , to date the exchange center has not been able to balance demand with supply . Lin Chih-sen , a division chief at the IDB , comments that many raw materials derived from waste do not have the same level of purity as original feedstocks , and so do not meet manufacturers ' requirements . Hence the proportion of waste materials offered through the exchange center which are actually sold is very low-less than 10% .  
I would n't waste my time with it ! " Ban Jieyu 's eloquent denial of witchcraft won her the emperor 's reprieve . Thoroughly familiar with classical literature and history , Ban Jieyu was also a talented poet , and Ban Gu included her melancholy poetry in his History . The depth of this woman shines through in her poetry , which while moody does not give way to self-pity or grumbling .  
Where I live in northwestern Switzerland , small municipal refuse bags , which hold 17 liters , cost around NT $ 30 each . Even the largest size of bags only hold 110 liters , yet cost NT $ 108 . This is definitely much more expensive than in Taipei City , but I 've never heard anyone complain that the bags are too dear . I think this is because they do a good job of reducing and separating their waste .  
The 15-member committee finished its three-month review on September 15 without coming to a conclusive decision , with individual committee members in sharp disagreement over the per-kilowatt cost of nuclear power , the cost of canceling construction , and the cost to society of having a nuclear plant in operation . Many have criticized the Re-Evaluation Committee as " a complete waste of money , time , and energy . "  
But most farmers and laborers ca n't draw and paint . Born to a poor farming family in hard times , he had God-given artistic talent . Not wanting waste this gift , he has found an outlet for it on paper , allowing future generations of Taiwanese to know how their ancestors spent their days toiling and getting calluses on their hands . Collected together , these paintings make for a lively history of life in a Taiwanese farming village of the past .  
The pair get married , but the Snake King arrives disguised as a local village girl and steals the magic feather . In the end , Wan Shi turns into a huge boulder to pin down the Snake King , while the egret goddess gives up her magic feather to save the island , which has been laid to waste . Thanks to the sacrifices of Wan Shi and the egret goddess , the people are able to live in peace once again .  
Although nuclear power does not produce greenhouse gases , the controversies that rage over the safety of nuclear plants and the disposal of nuclear waste are prohibitive ; nor does the COP encourage countries to develop nuclear energy . Thus , " renewable energy " sources such as wind and solar power , despite the high costs of researching and developing these alternatives , are inevitable . Next year Taiwan Power Company will finally take the plunge and invest a large amount of money in a wind power program .  
Efforts to cut back on plastic waste shifted into a higher gear on January 1 with a measure restricting the use of plastic bags and plastic ( including expanded polystyrene , i.e . " styrofoam " ) disposable eating utensils . This marks the second phase of implementation of a policy that was first introduced on a more limited scale last July , when the government clamped down on the use of such items by government agencies , membership supermarkets for military personnel , and public and private schools .  
In contrast , the enormous expenses of the two dialysis centers in Malaysia are covered entirely locally by donations from grateful patients and the money raised by local volunteers through small donations and recycling of waste . Wang Yun-ching relates that most people have the mistaken idea that all Tzu Chi volunteers are Buddhists . In fact , those handling medical duties for Tzu Chi branch organizations around the world include persons of many different faiths .  
Many nutritionists have finally come round to telling the media that it is best not to eat too many instant noodles . The reasons are that they have a high salt content and can cause high blood pressure , they contain preservatives that may cause cancer . Also , some unscrupulous manufacturers make their noodles using waste cooking oil , and there are worries that eating this oil can lead to digestive tract disorders and other ailments .  
For Shi Jin-hua , who suffers from diabetes , 1980 marked the time he started taking insulin injections and regularly recording his blood-sugar level with a glucometer . In the two decades since then , he estimates that he has measured his own blood sugar level at least 40,000 times . Over the years , Shi has carefully stored the medical waste , so important to his continued physical health and control , in sealed plastic bags .  
" It 's the plainness of rice straw that attracts people to it , " says Kao Hsi-lin . " It gives rise to a desire for a natural , rustic life . " Kao is a vibrant man who builds installations , paints and studies creative media . After several years spent working on community building , he is now giving new life to rice straw , a material that the people of Jenju had previously thought of as a waste product .  
Today , because staying alive is not hard , people are unable to find meaning in life itself . Yet we must look for meaning in life itself , " comments social critic Nanfang Shuo . He notes that feelings of fatigue , emptiness , waste , and futility with respect to life have become an unavoidable existential question for young men and women .  
Besides the public 's complaints that how to sort waste is not clearly defined and that the collection procedure is inconvenient , environmental groups are concerned that instituting the policy without adequate supporting measures-giving rise to problems such as insufficient publicity , the failure to purchase dedicated vehicles for collecting kitchen waste , and the still-incomplete state of processing sites-will undermine its effectiveness .  
According to many environmental groups , experience with kitchen waste recycling in rural communities shows that during the initial stages , residents were unclear about what was to be recycled , and as a result kitchen wastes were provided without first draining them , or items such as stray toilet paper , chopsticks , and plastic bags were often found mixed in . This type of front-end problem with the collection system is relatively easy to correct using instruction and appropriate adjustments . The real headache turns out to be with the downstream processes .  
However , kitchen waste is the main source of the foul odors and disease vector proliferation in garbage . When kitchen wastes are mixed with other garbage for processing , landfills are inundated with noxious gases , polluting the air . If taken instead to incinerators , due to their high water content , much energy will be wasted in the burning process , and the lifespan of the incinerator will also be reduced . At the same time , concentrations of the toxin dioxin will be increased .  
With its beautiful natural scenery , Ilan County has a strong environmental consciousness . As early as 1977 , the county began experimenting with and promoting the recycling of kitchen waste . Natural Environmental Protection Foundation chairperson Liu Shu-hui and National Ilan Institute of Technology jointly developed a simple composting method suitable for use by families and neighborhoods .  
Currently , the country as a whole recycles an average of almost 15% of all kitchen waste . As for the disposition of collected kitchen waste , " 70% is used primarily for raising pigs , and composting accounts for 30% , " says Lin Tso-hsiang , section chief for kitchen waste recycling operations at the Environmental Protection Administration 's Bureau of Environmental Inspection . During the current phase , local governments have not been required to institute kitchen waste recycling ; they are merely encouraged to do so .  
Immunity seesaw Although allergies are caused by physiological factors , adverse environmental factors can make an allergy much worse . Chiang Bor-luen points out that nitric oxide , carbon monoxide , sulfur dioxide , and other waste gases emitted by motor vehicles and factories can harm the respiratory tract and aggravate a preexisting allergy .  
Looking to the future , it seems to be a foregone conclusion that NHI premiums will have to increase to ensure that hospitals can survive , the public can get needed medical care , and the NHI program itself can stay solvent . The caveat is that besides increasing revenues , restraining expenditures and eliminating waste are the only viable long-term options for saving the program , and the only means of achieving a satisfactory result for the government , the health care sector , and the public .  
according to an official from the chinese ministry of foreign trade and economic co operation , the aim of the project , the memorandum of understanding of which was signed in 1992 , is to assist china in mitigating environmental degradation caused by the depositing of mine waste through introducing suitable technology from australia  
Liquid wastes from urban and industrial pollution sources represent about 20 to 40 per cent of total liquid waste generation , but are the major sources of organic pollutants , heavy metals and hazardous toxic chemicals .  
Environmentally sound waste disposal requires the collaboration of local and national authorities , based on appropriate and sustainable legal instruments and their effective implementation .  
The UNCHS Sustainable Cities Programme ( SCP ) has assisted in the move towards privatization of solid waste management in selected cities and has established an innovative framework for city consultations leading to improved city management functions .  
UNEP / IRPTC carries data profiles relevant to the assessment of hazards and risks posed by chemical substances to human health and the environment , waste management , and legal information on national and international regulatory control measures .  
The problems associated with radioactive waste management and disposal are complex and multifaceted , touching on scientific , technical , geologic , economic , social , health , environmental , political and intergenerational factors . 
Safe , acceptable management and final disposal of radioactive waste including spent fuel and waste from future decommissioning require coordination of a multiplicity of activities scientific , technical , economic , social , legal and political efforts .  
As a result of its financial assistance for local environmental health projects , its close ties with municipalities and the Palestinian Authority , and its collaborative relationship with three major solid waste projects in the Gaza Strip , UNRWA was instrumental in achieving coordination and promoting common standards and strategies in the environmental health sector among the Palestinian Authority , local municipalities and non-governmental organizations operating in the Gaza Strip .  
This half century will also be remembered as a time of tremendous waste of human creativity and energy for purposes of destruction , a time of rising disparities between nations , of flagrant abuse of nature and its finite resources and , above all , of unprecedented loss of human lives and human deprivation despite the infinite possibilities opened up by revolutions in science and technology .  
The changes of the last decade in economic and political conditions and new consensuses reached during the recent series of conferences offer a unique opportunity to develop an intensified , strengthened and more realistic approach to such cooperation , but the opportunity may go to waste if we fail to shape a more efficient , creative and forward-looking United Nations . 
A painful and futile internal conflict , brought on by intransigence and ideological utopianism , added to the waste of public resources and Governments overwhelmed by the nation 's problems , led Peru into a deep internal crisis with grave international consequences . 
The Agreement contains a general obligation , among other things , for countries to minimize waste , discards , catch by lost or abandoned gear , catch of non-target species both fish and non-fish species and impacts on associated and / or dependent species in particular endangered species through measures including , to the extent practicable , the development and use of selective , environmentally safe and cost-effective fishing gear and techniques .  
Rowe ( Australia ) : All discussions of the problem of land-mines are redolent with statistics and verbal images of a profoundly shocking and disturbing nature , invoking numbers of civilians , including children , killed or injured , the extent of their injuries , the cost of rehabilitation , the effect on their livelihoods and their prospects for family life , the acreage of arable land laid waste and the incalculable debilitating social and political effects of living with a constant source of terror .  
Develop and disseminate to farming households integrated farm management technologies , such as crop rotation , organic manuring and other techniques involving reduced use of agricultural chemicals , multiple techniques for sources of nutrients and the efficient utilization of external inputs , while enhancing techniques for waste and by-product utilization and prevention of pre - and post-harvest losses , taking particular note of the role of women ;  
Governments , according to their capacities and available resources and with the cooperation of the United Nations and other relevant organizations , should promote centres of excellence for training in hazardous waste management , building on appropriate national institutions and encouraging international cooperation , inter alia , through institutional links between developed and developing countries .  
Countries should take urgent measures to avert the ongoing rapid environmental and economic degradation in developing countries that generally affects the lives of women and children in rural areas suffering drought , desertification and deforestation , armed hostilities , natural disasters , toxic waste and the aftermath of the use of unsuitable agro-chemical products .  
The longer this situation continues , the more likely it is that we will be faced with a genuine structural public-service problem leading to inefficient use of national human capacities and a waste of resources .  
The Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes ( Helsinki , 1992 ) contains binding obligations to parties to apply best available technologies for the treatment of industrial waste water containing hazardous substances , to apply at least biological treatment or equivalent processes for treating municipal waste water , and to carry out research on the development of new technologies and environmentally sound disposal practices .  
As far as production is concerned , the use of input and materials ( intense or otherwise ) and the adoption of technologies ( i.e . , whether they are environmentally sound or not ) may well determine both the level of industrial waste generation and the chemical and physical properties of products , with implications for the use and disposal stages .  
The urban poor are the primary victims of municipal sewage discharged into water bodies and the improper disposal of solid waste and toxic chemicals .  
TACF provides assistance and training to developing countries in the use of nuclear technology for power generation , and for scientific , resource , agricultural , medical , environmental and industrial applications , as well as for activities relating to radiation protection , safety of nuclear installations and waste management .  
For long-lived , high-level waste , the Act of December 1991 established rules of research that will lead to the appropriate management of such wastes : separation and transmutation of long-lived radioactive elements ; possibilities of reversible and irreversible storage in deep geologic formations ; and laboratory research including conditioning and long-term surface depositories for such wastes .  
Germany subscribes to the concept of safe and environmentally sound management of radioactive waste ; and of unlimited , irrecoverable , ultimate disposal of the waste in deep geologic formations .  
It will also promote minimization , re-use and environmentally sound treatment and disposal of waste and sewage through provision of information strategies , tools and instruments for improved waste management and enhanced capabilities at national and local level for solid and liquid waste management .  
Technical material . ( i ) Maintaining relevant databases and other information systems concerning hazardous waste generation , treatment technologies and regulatory and other instruments ; ( ii ) four updated PC-version of the database of the International Register of Potentially Toxic Chemicals and distribution of subsets thereof ; and ( iii ) establishment of one regional information network . ( a ) Advisory service .  
Further took note of the gradual shift of focus from pollution control and waste management to pollution prevention approaches in policies and programmes at the country level and bilateral and multilateral cooperation , and observed that this shift has resulted in the introduction of production patterns that emphasize the more efficient use of raw materials and energy , taking into account the capture and recycling of wastes and the better use of end-products of the productive system ;  
These included : empowerment of women as an overall concept ; mass media ; statistics and indicators on gender issues ; natural resources and sustainable development : water , waste management and sanitation ; renewable energy ; and issues related to different groups of female population such as the ageing , displaced ; refugees and migrants .  50 .  The Board decided that INSTRAW should introduce the following in its new programme , among other subjects :  
The Acting Director emphasized that that situation limited the Institute 's capacity to provide the corresponding General Assembly committees with substantive contributions and research findings in critical areas of economic and social development processes , such as : water , environment and sustainable development , waste management , renewable sources of energy , human settlements , poverty alleviation , desertification , international migration , and violence against women migrant workers .  
minimize pollution , waste , discards , catch by lost or abandoned gear , catch of non-target species , both fish and non-fish species , ( hereinafter referred to as non-target species ) and impacts on associated or dependent species , in particular endangered species , through measures including , to the extent practicable , the development and use of selective , environmentally safe and cost-effective fishing gear and techniques ;  
The impact on women of environmental and natural resource degradation , deriving from , inter alia , unsustainable production and consumption patterns , drought , poor quality water , global warming , desertification , sea-level rise , hazardous waste , natural disasters , toxic chemicals and pesticide residues , radioactive waste , armed conflicts and its consequences ;  
Pilot projects take into account the specific characteristics of small island developing States in relation to waste generation and disposal , fragile ecosystems , limited resource base , geographical isolation and scarce human resources .  
Pilot projects take into account the specific characteristics of small island developing States in relation to waste generation and disposal , fragile ecosystems , limited resource base , geographical isolation and scarce human resources .  
minimize pollution , waste , discards , catch by lost or abandoned gear , catch of non-target species , both fish and non-fish species , ( hereinafter referred to as non-target species ) and impacts on associated or dependent species , in particular endangered species , through measures including , to the extent practicable , the development and use of selective , environmentally safe and cost-effective fishing gear and techniques ;  
Even in normal times , particularly in developing countries , the capacities of these infrastructures are often strained to manage even the most basic social and economic development programmes , and a single disaster can severely disrupt the community lifelines that provide food distribution , water supplies , health-care services , waste disposal and communications locally and with the rest of the world .  
The Sustainable Dar es Salaam Project ( SDP ) supports the City Council in developing sustainable solutions to priority environmental issues such as solid waste , servicing urban land , air quality , surface water , coastal area resources , recreational and tourism resources and urban agricultural production .  
In keeping with Iraq 's former position that the political decision had not been made to proceed to the design , development and production of nuclear weapons , the purpose of this work had previously been explained as technological development with the long-term possibility of converting to metal the depleted uranium , expected to result from Iraq 's indigenous enrichment processes , as part of a waste management strategy .  
tasks of this committee would be to oversee the earliest possible restoration to normal functioning of all public services and utilities ( including water , sanitation , energy supply , public transport , communications , waste disposal , health and educational facilities ) and to oversee the rebuilding of houses damaged or destroyed during the conflict ;  
While it may be true that the existing financial crisis is primarily a crisis of payment , there is no denying the fact that there is unnecessary waste being generated here , whether in regard to the duplication of work detail , the excessive copying of documents , the scheduling of numerous meetings destined to accomplish nothing or to a myriad of other undesirables .  
The presentation to the General Assembly of the annual report of the IAEA provides us with a valuable opportunity to review the work which the Agency has carried out and to measure the impact and efficiency of its activities in the various fields in which it operates in accordance with its statutory functions , both in respect of its work in the prevention of nuclear proliferation and in the promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , as well as in the strengthening of international cooperation in nuclear safety , radiological protection and waste management .  
Despite a large degree of convergence on many of the issues that will be addressed by this convention , we feel constrained to reiterate that , for countries like India , whose nuclear programme is based on a closed fuel cycle , it would not be possible to consider including spent fuel in a convention dealing with the safety of radioactive waste management .  
The concept of eco-efficiency , which is concerned with maximizing the productivity of energy and material inputs in order to reduce resource consumption and pollution / waste per unit output , is currently seen as a promising short - to medium-term strategy , appropriate in both developed and developing countries , for maintaining economic growth and competitiveness while achieving improved environmental quality ( the double dividend ) .  
A number of other actions can be noted , such as the 1993-1994 ban on the dumping of radioactive waste , sewage sludge and industrial waste and on incineration of toxic wastes at sea , as agreed in the 1972 Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter ( London Convention ) ; ( c ) In relation to programme areas C and D , the legal framework for sustainable use and conservation of living aquatic resources in the oceans has been substantially improved since UNCED .  
Governments should promote the establishment of self-sustaining financial mechanisms in support of , inter alia : ( i ) training of personnel ; ( ii ) navigational safety and antipollution measures in international straits ; ( iii ) waste reception facilities in ports ; and ( iv ) salvage and emergency response facilities and capacity-building in hydrographic surveying and nautical charting .  
Depending on the context and needs of the cities , towns and villages in each country and region , special attention should be paid to the most critical issues , such as changing production and consumption patterns ; energy efficiency ; sustainable resource and land-use management ; [ poverty eradication ; population and health ; water supply , sanitation and waste management ; disaster prevention , mitigation , preparedness and management ; cultural and historical heritage ; environmental protection ; industry ; infrastructure ; and basic services such as health and education facilities .  
Health problems related to adverse environmental conditions , including a lack of access to safe water and sanitation , inadequate waste management , poor drainage , air pollution , and exposure to excessive noise levels , as well as ineffective and inadequate health services , exact a heavy toll on the quality of life and the overall contribution to society of millions of people . 
Dispose , within both rural and urban areas by the year 2025 , of all sewage , waste waters and solid wastes in a manner in conformity with national or international environmental quality guidelines ;  
However , the issues covered in this section are of major concern to industrialized and developing countries alike , though different objectives and priorities will be stressed in different circumstances .  For example , waste reduction and avoidance is a priority for countries facing acute shortages of disposal capacity ( e.g .  
Extended producer responsibility ( EPR ) represents one of the most innovative approaches to tackling the problems of rising industrial and household waste volumes ( which may be either physically or politically hard to dispose of ) , rising costs of disposal and human health and environmental concerns relating to the spread of toxic and hazardous substances as a result of dissipative uses of products or inadequate waste management practices .  
A wide variety of approaches are currently being used : instruments deployed to date have focused on guiding product choice ( through ecolabelling and other product information ) and changing behaviour relating to energy saving , waste disposal and personal mobility ( through education , information and pricing signals ) .  
Commends the efforts of the Institute to address all levels of poverty that hamper so dramatically the advancement of women , through the coordination of research and training activities in the areas of economic and political empowerment of women ; statistics and indicators in gender issues ; communications ; women , natural resources and sustainable development ; water , sanitation and waste management ; renewable sources of energy ; and issues related to different population groups , such as the girl child , older women , displaced women , refugee and migrant women and women in rural areas ;  
The aforementioned 1972 London Dumping Convention for the prevention of marine pollution by waste dumping has been significantly strengthened by amendments in 1993 banning the dumping of radioactive , industrial and incineration wastes ; a new protocol under discussion would ban all marine disposal except in specific cases that could be shown to have no adverse environmental impacts .  
The unit employing this method , called TerraSURE , is capable of creating isolated , functional process reactors in the subsurface of hazardous waste sites , landfills or tailing deposits where in situ bio-remediation , chemical degradation and solvent extraction can be carried out .  
Quantitative analysis of the effectiveness of the Basel Convention remains difficult , largely because of a lack of reliable data related to hazardous waste generation ; an absence of comparable data between national authorities ; the absence of accurate baseline data for reported global trade in hazardous wastes ; lack of clear definitions of wastes considered to be " hazardous " ; and the absence of one major industrialized country and several developing countries as parties to the Convention .  
It also asked Governments and agencies of the United Nations system to promote programmes for guiding management and corrective actions to control pollution in the larger coastal urban settlements , specifically in the treatment of sewage and waste disposal , both domestic and industrial , as well as to control pollution in river systems caused by mining industries .  
Urgent action of a new type is needed to ensure that water 's deep involvement in both environment and development issues can be properly addressed , action that will demand an integrated approach to land use , water-supply and waste management , with due attention to all water 's parallel functions in nature and society , as well as to the evident linkages between upstream land and water use and downstream opportunities . 
The number of individuals living in water-stressed countries or countries with a chronic water scarcity will increase tenfold in only one generation to encompass more than one third of the world population .  In waste areas , there has been an overexploitation of aquifers , which are becoming ever more seriously depleted .  The risks that threaten to erupt wherever socio-economic development depends on a continuously undermined key resource are evident : ultimate resource constraints will one day send shocks through such vulnerable societies .  
The Committee was informed , upon request , that the amount of $ 2.5-million had been based on prior experience in other missions for disposal of hazardous waste , such as contaminated petrol , oil and lubricants , batteries and used tyres and other toxic wastes ; that in the past , those requirements had been provided under transport operations ; and that , in view of the strict regional laws regarding the disposal of hazardous wastes , UNPF had made the provision based on Croatia 's requirement that such waste be disposed of by Government-licensed contractors .  
The Board stated that the Institute 's programme of work should continue to focus on and establish priorities in areas where INSTRAW has already acquired expertise - areas such as the political and economic empowerment of women ; statistics and indicators in gender issues ; natural resources and sustainable development ; water and waste management ; renewable sources of energy ; access to credit ; women and the media ; and , issues relating to different population groups , especially the elderly and displaced , refugees and migrant women .  
The Acting Director noted that this limited the Institute 's ability to provide the other main committees of the General Assembly with substantive contributions and conclusions derived from its research in crucial areas of economic and social development , such as water , environment and sustainable development , waste management , renewable sources of energy , human settlements , alleviation of poverty , desertification , international migration , and violence against women migrant workers .  
Iraq is under international obligation to waste no time in registering the remaining Iranian prisoners of war about whose detention in Iraq ample evidence exists , and for providing that list to the Iranian authorities as agreed upon at Tehran on 14 September 1995 , and thereby paving the way for a final solution to this outstanding and sad humanitarian issue . 
A careful balance must be maintained between , on the one hand , establishing priorities to make the best use of resources and avoid waste , and on the other hand the principle of adequate provision for alternatives as insurance against even the remote possibility of future political , monopoly , regulatory or efficiency difficulties on any of the main transit transport routes available to landlocked countries .  
Steps to cut total transport costs will be of real significance to the growth of the Central Asian economies , whether they come about by developing new alternative routes , increasing competition on all routes , improving the quality and efficiency of transport infrastructure and services , or cooperative efforts to reduce waste and inefficiency by installing the most advanced international concepts of transit transport facilitation .  
The programme is designed to improve urban living conditions and strengthen municipal institutional capacities for the planning and operation of urban facilities and public services , including water supply and solid waste management .  
The Council , in paragraph 2 of the resolution , " Commends the work of the Institute on the issue addressing the process of the economic and political empowerment of women ; statistics and indicators in gender issues ; women , natural resources and sustainable development ; water , waste management and renewable sources of energy ; and issues related to different groups , such as the elderly , displaced , refugees and migrant women " .  
The limited information obtained from national sources shows that a number of small island developing States have begun to implement parts of the Programme of Action that have especially high priority at the national level , including institution-building , particularly the strengthening of legislative frameworks ; waste management ; coastal area management ; and to a lesser extent , the preservation of biodiversity .  
A primary responsibility of the regional commissions is to provide advisory services and to strengthen regional networks by which Member States may exchange experience and information , and harmonize national economic , social , environmental and settlement policies and strategies - in particular those that have a critical cross-border impact on , inter alia , migration , shared coastal zones , river basins and ecosystems , watersheds , and pollution and waste management .  
The competent authorities shall secure , on fair conditions and upon the request of the Registrar or on his behalf , the public services needed by the Tribunal such as , but not limited to , postal , telephone and telegraphic services , electricity , water , gas , sewage , collection of waste , fire protection , local transportation and cleaning of public streets .  
It is to be hoped that the scientifically advanced nations will effectively control the use of scientific progress by their nationals or public authorities and prevent any use detrimental to the natural wealth and the human , genetic and biological resources of the less developed nations or to the individual freedom and privacy of their citizens , especially with respect to trade in and management of waste materials .  
Cancelled : ( ii ) compendium on human settlement-related interventions in the control of vector-borne diseases in urban areas ; ( iv ) strategies for environmentally sound energy management in urban areas of sub-Saharan Africa ; and ( viii ) compendium of sustainable disposal techniques for septate and pit-latrine waste .  
The development of this new article , which introduces both the precautionary approach and the polluter pays principle , is connected with proposals to include " reverse lists " - i.e . , instead of " black and grey lists " , which means that all dumping would be strictly prohibited with the exception of clearly identified waste categories - and the Waste Assessment Framework .  
At their fourth meeting , they also expressed their concern regarding the safe and secure transportation of INF materials through the region . 187 They called on all States to maintain cooperation and exchange information on the transportation of nuclear material and radioactive waste and to continue working through IMO and IAEA in the development of additional measures which would complement the 1993 INF Code .  
Botswana has always maintained that the international community must always aim at ensuring that the financial , material and human resources invested in the cause of peace do not go to waste due to premature withdrawal of a peacekeeping mission .  
Coordination of international actors is essential to avoid waste and duplication and , more importantly , to avoid conflicting advice from technical consultants , programmes working at cross purposes and over-funding of or inordinate attention to particular aspects of the democratization process to the detriment of others ; the last could lead in turn to an imbalance between the capacities of State and civic institutions .  
Barbados is improving living conditions by revitalizing the main town centres , developing systems of physical planning and coastal management , and promoting public-private partnerships , disposing of waste and extending water resources .  
It further noted that recent space technology spin-offs had resulted in products such as an anti-shock pressure suit for medical applications , a transportation guidance system , a hand-held electromagnetic probe for inspecting aircraft for cracks and other damage , an obstacle detection system to assist in automated operations , a prototype silicon detector of radiation-induced effects in humans , automated robotic gasoline pumps , force reflecting devices to assist the blind in using a computer mouse , nuclear waste facility clean-up , and field applications and demonstrations of tele-medicine systems ( " tele-clinics " ) .  
We , who have a closed fuel cycle nuclear power programme , have consistently opposed the inclusion of spent fuel , which is a valuable resource material , along with radioactive waste in this convention .  
For these reasons , Costa Rica supports the creation of a broad region called The nuclear-weapon-free Southern Hemisphere and adjacent areas on the basis of a proposal for resolutions put forward by Brazil , which should include a total ban on the transport and transfer of nuclear materials for bellicose purposes and of atomic waste .  
Over 120-million people worldwide are officially unemployed and many more underemployed , causing massive personal suffering , widespread social disintegration and huge economic waste .  
In some cities in Europe , campaigns to encourage communities to separate waste at the household level have been so successful that there is insufficient capacity to recycle all the waste collected by municipal authorities and , because of increased supply , the market price for recycled materials has dropped drastically .  
However , recent outbreaks of cholera in Peru and a " plague scare " in India ( see box 4 ) have clearly demonstrated the human suffering and loss of life that may result from poor waste management and the disastrous effect that waste-related diseases may have on the trade and tourism vital for national economy .  
In a recently completed study carried out by UNCHS in Africa and Asia , direct epidemiological relationships between inadequate waste management and the incidence of diarrhoea and , respiratory and skin diseases have been established and low-cost , remedial interventions have been recommended , advancing strong health arguments for targeted investments in infrastructure in low-income settlements . 
Until waste management authorities overcome these institutional shortcomings and develop a more flexible management structure , responsive to the needs of public , private and community sectors , isolated schemes will remain good examples of " best practice demonstrations " and will not be incorporated into the overall waste management system .  
The effectiveness of waste - management policies may be enhanced when combined with economic and environmental policies designed to improve , for example , efficiency in production and consumption and with policies targeted at making production processes and consumer choice and behaviour more suitable .  
Environmentally induced migrations are caused by natural disasters , such as earthquakes , flash flooding , typhoons , and volcanic eruptions ; by nuclear and hazardous waste contamination ; by agricultural and rural decline , resource pollution , chronic water shortages ; or by dam construction and other large-scale development projects .  
On another level , the Habitat Agenda also provides clear and detailed expression of the local environmental agenda and priorities of developing countries , which are focused on essential services , such as water supply , sanitation and waste management , among others , and are informed by the relationship between poverty and environmental decline , and thus by the need for sustainable economic growth to address both issues .  
Human rights violations have been reported , in addition to sporadic and discretionary enforcement of environmental regulations : reportedly , unlined toxic waste pits allow pollution to seep into drinking water supplies , thus threatening the right to health of surrounding communities , and calls for compensation from the oil companies are often met with claims of sabotage or payment of compensation to the Government of which the local villagers see little . 
After the fire , Thai government authorities allegedly relocated the toxic residues to a dumpsite in a military area in Kanchanaburi . The toxic waste is buried approximately 4 m underground and the entire 3,800 _ m2 area is covered with cement . 
A prevalence of environmental inequities based on socio _ economic and racial factors has been reported : of the two factors , race appears to have both an independent and a more important relationship with the distribution of commercial hazardous waste facilities than income .  
Over 120-million people worldwide are officially unemployed and many more underemployed , causing massive personal suffering , widespread social disintegration and huge economic waste .  
Handling guidelines , better inventories , and improved treatment are typical preventive strategies for the management of hazardous waste ; reduction strategies and enhanced treatment are used for solid wastes , with reduction targets established in some countries .  
Decide to work towards evolving principles based on sound management of hazardous wastes so as to develop national policies to phase out toxic agricultural and industrial chemicals and trade in hazardous waste ;  
The International Atomic Energy Agency is continuing its activities and studies in such key areas as : creation of an international nuclear information system ; problems of migration of radionuclide contaminants in soils , forests and lakes ; training for the safe operation and management of nuclear power plants ; radiation monitoring and protection and radioactive waste management ; and reduction of internal radiation doses to the population .  
Barbados is improving living conditions by revitalizing the main town centres , developing systems of physical planning and coastal management , and promoting partnerships between the public and private sector , disposing of waste and extending water resources .  
For that reason , we reiterate our grave concern at the increasingly frequent transport of radioactive material and nuclear waste through areas of the high seas close to our exclusive economic zone .  
Glaciers are melting ; forests are retreating ; we are changing the seasons ; we are running out of fish in the sea ; we are poisoning our children with persistent organic pollutants ; and we are accumulating nuclear waste to the peril of future generations .  
However , despite improvements in legislative and institutional frameworks and the institution of mandatory requirements for environmental impact assessments for new tourism investments in some , small island developing States continue to face considerable difficulties in dealing with problems of waste management and pollution due to poor infrastructural , technological and human resource capacity .  
Given that many countries , particularly in the developing world , lack adequate institutional capacity in hazardous waste management and in monitoring illegal imports of chemical and hazardous wastes , there is an urgent need for strengthening national capacity for the effective management of such wastes .  
The Brazil / Norway Workshop on Consumption and Production Patterns ( Brasilia , November 1996 ) concluded , among other things , that the role of advertising and the media is critical ; that the international community should apply the resources of the media to induce behavioural changes to avoid waste , inefficient resource use and conspicuous consumption ; and that positive messages of how individuals can live in a sustainable manner were required , instead of encouraging ever-rising material consumption or exaggerating the likelihood of environmental disaster .  
Adopting all necessary legislative , administrative and technical measures to ensure the physical protection of nuclear material , nuclear fuel , radioactive products or waste , radioactive substances , nuclear installations and nuclear devices as well as protection against illegal or unauthorized access to them by third parties .  
Upon the completion of the proceedings connected with an act of nuclear terrorism , if it is considered feasible , any nuclear material , nuclear fuel , radioactive products or waste or any other radioactive substances as well as nuclear installations , nuclear explosive or radiation-dissemination devices , including homemade devices and / or their components or objects of which they are components shall be returned to the State party , to which they belong or which was the State of their origin .  
States parties shall not be required by this Convention to provide any information which they are not permitted to communicate pursuant to domestic legislation or which would jeopardize the security of the State concerned or the physical protection of nuclear material , nuclear fuel , radioactive products or waste , radioactive substances , nuclear installations , nuclear devices or their components or objects of which they are components .  
Although national legislation on the protection of the environment has been enacted in many countries , statutory provisions dealing with the protection of the environment were mostly spread through a whole array of legislation and regulations , mainly focusing on hazardous waste , water , soil and air pollution , trafficking in endangered species of flora and fauna , noise pollution and trafficking in nuclear substances , and contained in the various laws on these issues .  
Spain reported on initiatives to combat marine pollution , including the control and monitoring of maritime transport of pollutant products that may have an impact on the environment ; the prevention of pollution from ships ; the monitoring and control of industrial waste or waste from ships ; and active participation in the implementation of specific maritime safety plans in each port , taking into account current provisions including those of the National Regulation for the Admission , Handling and Storage of Hazardous Goods in Ports .  
The competent authorities shall do their utmost to ensure that the Authority shall be provided , on fair and equitable terms but in any case not less favourable than those accorded to the agencies of the Government , with necessary utilities and public services , including but not limited to electricity , water , gas , sewerage , collection of waste , fire protection and local transportation .  
The complex problems linked to overstocking , excessive donations , poor storage facilities and management , inadequate disposal or waste management capacity , vulnerability to insect plagues and changes in national policies have resulted in an alarming increase in outdated pesticide and chemicals stocks over the last two decades . 
In most countries with nuclear programmes , the preferred method for the disposal of long-lived radioactive waste is its long-term isolation in a system of multiple barriers located in deep and stable geological formations .  
The fact that a power company of Taiwan Province of China could attempt to export radioactive waste to a country where appropriate facilities are lacking , without being subject to any existing international regulatory mechanism , clearly testifies to the need to strengthen the current international regime controlling the transboundary movement of radioactive waste .  
Presidential commissions of inquiry have in recent years been appointed to investigate and report on alleged contraventions of laws and other control measures based on international conventions designed to combat such activities as the smuggling of and illegal trade in ivory and rhinoceros horn , the import and disposal of hazardous waste containing mercury and the import of hazardous waste containing cupric arsenic .  
In the health sector , United Nations observers regularly report an exceptionally serious deterioration in the health infrastructure : a high infant mortality rate and high rates of morbidity and mortality in general , poor and inadequate storage conditions for supplies , an unreliable supply of electricity and back-up generators , faulty or non-functioning air-conditioning , defective cold-storage , interrupted water supplies , broken / leaking sewage systems and non-functioning hospital waste disposal systems .  
Considerable efforts have been made everywhere in Africa to revitalize the social sector , minimize needless waste of human and natural resources , promote popular participation and democratic governance , focus world attention on the continent 's needs for a more supportive international economic environment , and reinforce efforts at conflict prevention and resolution .  
Where there is insufficient competition , the government may divide the work ( e.g . geographically ) between outside contractors and inside workforces , as is done for instance by the city of Bogota , Colombia , where solid waste collection is shared between public and private agencies , with a private firm made responsible for monitoring the operations of all the agencies . 2 Continued government provision of at least part of the service provides in-house knowledge of costs and technology changes and thereby some protection against inflated contracts ; 
Seven projects on modern techniques and technologies for the development of both surface and groundwater resources ; use of alternative sources of energy ; new and renewable energy technologies ; and improving the efficiency of resource use , minimizing waste and maximizing recycling and environmental protection ;  
This plan is responsible for all programmes related to desertification , surface and ground water pollution , atmospheric pollution , poor sanitation suffered by rural and urban peoples , poor management of industrial and household waste and population growth and its impact on urban sprawl .  
To the contrary , if shortsighted strategies and options are forced upon us , it can mean an ever-deteriorating situation combining the consequences of war , pollution and unconscionable industrial exploitation : the conspiracy of landmines and industrial waste overwhelming the land , the people , the fragile peace and our common Earth .  
These challenges shelter and housing and the need to address urbanization both impact disproportionately and very severely on hundreds of millions of poor and disadvantaged people in nations large and small people who , mostly but not in all cases , live in the developing countries of our world ; people who are huddled in vast urban slums or in rural shacks ; people who lack not just secure work , but also such basic necessities as clean water , sanitation , waste disposal , safe transportation and even the most minimal green spaces to call their own .  
We have to address as a matter of priority the three most immediate dangers identified by the Commission : the overexploitation of marine biological resources , the dumping of toxic waste and the harmful effects of global warming .  
We continue to be concerned at the threat to the fragile marine environment posed by the regular shipment of nuclear and other hazardous waste through the Caribbean Sea .  
The two major releases from surface and underground mining relevant to reprocessing and utilization are mineral wastes ( overburden and waste rock ) and contaminated waters ( acidic , metal-laden discharges from waste disposal sites and workings ) .  
Incineration , mainly of medical waste and combustible hazardous materials , has been practised widely in the region , but , it has not generally been efficient because of poor maintenance of plants , manpower shortage and improper choice of facilities .  
The Commission noted that , as the world has become more industrialized , there have been increasing environmental pressures such as harmful emissions and waste , which have had global , regional or local impacts .  
Develop a cooperation programme to address the concerns raised by maritime transport of nuclear and other waste , and to cooperate and coordinate in the relevant international fora to strengthen standards governing such transport and its safety .  
The difficulty in providing adequate health care , the continued practice of open drainage , the indiscriminate disposal of waste water and industrial effluents and rampant water pollution have resulted in the creation of mega-slums unsuitable for human living .  
Formulating policies favourable to the development in rural and poor urban areas of health programmes , including safe water supply , sanitation , and waste disposal , taking into account the specific needs of young women and young men for a healthy environment ;  
Some consider that the permanent nature of the organization is the source of unacceptable waste at a time when budgetary austerity is being imposed on all countries and at a stage in our economic history which is haunted by the spectre of crisis and unemployment among both poor and rich .  
There is an enormous annual turnover in markets for illegal goods , such as illegal drugs , protected wildlife , stolen works of art , illegal firearms , and nuclear and / or toxic waste , as well as for trafficking in human beings .  
The article states that United States and British forces fired more than 1-million depleted uranium rounds , weighing 315 tons , and that this was the first time that the toxic metal , a waste product left when natural uranium is refined to make weapons or fuel , was used in war .  
The employed person 's salary is augmented in case of work in conditions which are more difficult than normal for a particular job ( climate , noise , vibrations , irradiation , humidity , harmful gases , biologically harmful substances , physical strain , work with dirty materials , danger caused by tools or objects , means of transport , waste materials , electricity , explosions , heat , corrosive materials , etc . ) , which need to be made specific by special or individual collective agreements .  
This does not fit in with the traditional concept of the commercial money market or purchasing flexibility , and constitutes a senseless waste of Iraqi funds , for reasons linked to the mechanism used by the Security Council Committee established by resolution 661 ( 1990 ) for processing memorandum of understanding contracts .  
In all such modifications , the Commission shall take into account the state of the technology being developed , the processing system utilized , the value and potential use of any waste , the environmental effects of the activities , the economic and resource data , and the international need for the mineral resources .  
Cuba is aware of the possible dangers attendant upon any use of radioactive waste , which would be tantamount to radiological war , and of the effects of such use on national , regional and international security , and especially the security of the developing countries ; and also of the inherent threat to the preservation of the environment .  
As mentioned above , in most situations of realizing human rights in a particular country , there is so much waste and inefficient use of domestic resources that substantial progress can be made in improving the realization of most human rights even within the existing resources , which can be augmented by international cooperation for which a call has been given explicitly in the Declaration on the Right to Development .  
The two human rights workers were arrested in December 1998 in connection with a popular protest , which turned violent , against the secret import and dumping by local authorities of industrial toxic waste .  They were accused of leading an unlawful demonstration and incitement to violence .  
Singapores three-year technical assistance programme for sustainable development which was intended to help developing countries through the provision of training in areas such as urban environmental management , environmental technology , solid waste management , water supply engineering , urban planning and transport management , had so far benefitted more than 1,000 people from 80 countries .  
In its concern for a safe environment , the Council gave instructions for the creation of an effective mechanism to coordinate the action of ministries and other relevant agencies at the national level in each member State in taking proper measures to dispose of medical waste and process radioactive waste and also to coordinate the trans-boundary movement of hazardous waste .  
The Minister calls attention to the fact that the United Nations Compensation Commission has been concealing from Iraq information relating to claims , and he urges you to intervene with a view to having the Commission follow the proper legal procedures established by international law and judicial precedent so as to protect the assets of the Iraqi people from unwarranted dissipation and waste .  
In view of the fact that we have received no replies over the past years , we appeal to you once more , in accordance with your legal responsibilities , to intervene in this matter in order to have the Commission follow the proper legal procedures established by international law and judicial precedent so as to protect the assets of the Iraqi people from unwarranted dissipation and waste .  
Ideal or existing socialism , on the other hand , is seen as allowing consciously planned rational development , which does away with such capitalist flaws as recurring crises , waste and unemployment ; it fosters social equality and may promote a higher form of liberty where a united society comes to master its own progress .  
Transnational organized crime includes tax evasion , the forgery of clothes and electronic equipment , fraud against international financial institutions , unfair competition on international markets , industrial espionage , the import and export of protected plants and animals , trafficking in works of art and the illegal dumping of toxic industrial waste .  
The Government stressed that the people of the South required reparation and justice for impunity , neo-colonial wars , the extermination of populations and peoples , the defilement of their economic , cultural and natural heritage by countries of the North , the decapitalization of the developing countries charged with paying external debts and the dumping of toxic waste in their territories , to cite only a few examples .  
The activities of the Agency in that area have been strengthened by the adoption of additional standards for the safe management and transportation of radioactive waste and for the security of nuclear power stations , which were approved by the Board of Governors , as well as by the adoption of resolutions in the General Conference on the radiological protection of patients , the safety of transport of radioactive materials and the security of radiation sources .  
Regardless of its considerable benefits , nuclear energy is still problematic in one particular aspect : spent fuel and nuclear waste , its interim storage and final repository , especially in small States with limited industrial and scientific capabilities .  
This year such issues include the dumping of nuclear waste and other toxic substances , the regional seas programme of the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , the increasing threat to shipping from piracy and armed robbery at sea , the importance of enhancing the safety of navigation and the continued work of the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization towards a convention on the protection of the underwater cultural heritage .  
Because of their inability to adequately guard their maritime area , which is linked to their low level of technological development , the States of the zone are powerless to deal with harmful activities carried out in their maritime area , including the dumping of radioactive and toxic waste and illegal fishing , which is often carried out by vessels sailing under two flags .  
Motivated by the need to protect the health and safety or our population and our environment , we believe that these efforts should continue , thus promoting the adoption of mechanisms that will provide sufficient guarantees to all the States concerned that the strictest safety measures will be applied in the international maritime transport of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel , and that any damage resulting from accidents in connection with such operations will be made good .  
For the island States , whether in the Caribbean or the Pacific , the international maritime transportation of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuels is a real security threat , all the more serious because most of those potentially affected are small countries lacking the resources to cope with a crisis of such magnitude , caused by big countries and by technologies that those small countries do not control .  
The need for universal commitment to such preventive measures has become more pressing due to the isolation and oceanic location of some small island developing States and their total dependence on a marine and limited terrestrial base , which render them highly vulnerable to contamination from such waste .  
Indeed , the issues of climate change , soil erosion , global warming , sea level rise , coastal and marine resources , natural and environmental disasters , biodiversity resources , waste management and freshwater resources are among those that all developing countries face , in particular small island nations , in an increasingly competitive global economy .  
Support for gender-specific research on the short - and long-term effects of the occupational and environmental health risks of work , including work in the formal and informal sector , performed by both women and men , and take effective legal and other measures to reduce these risks , including risks in the workplace , in the environment and from harmful chemicals , including pesticides , radiation , toxic waste and other such hazards that affect womens health ;  
Governments at all levels , the private sector and other major groups as defined in Agenda 21 are urged to cooperate in developing waste collection systems and disposal facilities , and developing programmes for prevention , minimization and recycling of waste , to safeguard and improve the quality of life in human settlements and coastal regions in all countries , especially in developing countries .  
In 1989 , the ecological organization Greenpeace had revealed the existence of a letter of intent signed by a German waste-processing firm , Pick Up Problems , and these dignitaries in Paraguay , who were acting in a personal capacity , for the export of 1 , 200 , 000 tons of waste which were to be processed in the Chaco region , where there were plans to build an incineration plant .  
The first instance of the illegal entry of dangerous waste reported by the Brazilian authorities is that of four containers holding 68 , 332 kg of toxic wastes ( copper , zinc and other heavy metals ) which arrived in the coastal port of Santos ( State of So Paulo ) in December 1993 .  
The analysis of the main trends and features of movements of toxic waste and dangerous products in the Special Rapporteurs previous reports to the Commission on Human Rights showed that , over the last decade , the region of Latin America and the Caribbean was tending to become a favourite target area for the illegal traffic in these products and wastes .  
The Basel Convention and the national laws of the countries visited regard the illegal traffic in dangerous waste as a criminal act liable to punishment under criminal law , regardless of any civil or administrative penalties which may be imposed on persons found guilty of such trafficking .  
A number of people stressed that incidents which had come to light often thanks to the watchfulness of local associations and NGOs like Greenpeace International , might represent only a tiny percentage of the waste and products which are banned from import , but which are smuggled into the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean and buried there illegally .  
The most serious worries are still the excessive or uncontrolled use of chemicals and toxic agricultural products and the harmful effects on the environment and health of the activities of foreign transplants and transnational companies , which are taking advantage of liberalization and deregulation to employ products and substances which are prohibited in the developed countries and to transfer highly polluting industries and those which produce large quantities of dangerous waste .  
The unique social , economic and environmental characteristics of small island developing States , such as high population density , relative isolation , limited availability of land space , and paucity of human and financial resources , limit the range of possible options for the sound management of waste .  
The project consists of two components : ( a ) a Jakarta component to achieve better waste management through both solid and liquid monitoring activities , educational activities for students and local people , community-based waste recycling and composting activities ; ( b ) a Pulau Seribu islands component with coral reef monitoring activities , scientific research , educational activities for local fishermen and alternative income activities for women and fishermen .  
Most small island developing States would derive tremendous benefits from the introduction of environmentally sustainable technological innovations in the areas of the development of renewable energy , freshwater and marine resources ; telecommunications and information technology ; waste management and natural disaster mitigation ; and sustainable land resources management .  
Its dangerous waste control regulations , drawn up on the basis of the provisions of the Basel Convention embody the technical and legal principles applicable to the environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes in the light of current programmes and policies , and prohibit the import of any type of waste .  
The final resolution of the Conference stated that it is crucial to ensure access to all relevant information for the public , to involve local and regional authorities and the public in decision _ making and to seek public confidence in principles that govern the safety of repositories and in waste management programmes ( for the proceedings of the Conference , see the Council of Europe series Studies and Texts , No . 57 ) .  
The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that a number of confirmed cases of illegal traffic in toxic wastes have not been solved in a satisfactory manner , either from the standpoint of the obligation to seek out and prosecute those allegedly responsible or of the duty to assist the victim countries in accordance with the principle of returning such waste to the country of origin , if known , or if not , to other States capable of managing it in an environmentally sound manner .  
The major interests at the international level are the prevention of marine pollution from land-based sources and pollution by dumping of waste , protection of the sensitive environment of the Arctic Ocean , and exchange of scientific information on the oceans and its living resources .  
In developing countries , such corruption may undermine economic development through a number of related factors : the misuse or waste of international aid ; unfinished development projects ; discovery and replacement of corrupt politicians , leading to political instability ; and living standards remaining below the countrys potential .  
While experts are confident that geological disposal is safe , technologically feasible and environmentally responsible , the public at large remains skeptical , and the volume of highlevel waste continues to build .  
CARICOM member States have for many years expressed growing concern at the increasing threat to our marine environment posed by pollution and by the transportation of hazardous and nuclear waste through the Caribbean Sea .  
Most countries declared their intention to create an effective and comprehensive safety net , accompanied by efforts to control costs and waste , thereby leading to a more efficient use of resources .  
It still dumps nuclear waste in the occupied Arab territories and continues its programme of developing all kinds of weapons of mass destruction , biological or chemical , because of the worlds inaction and the double standards that the great Powers apply .  
The continued neglect of the urban waste problem will inevitably have dire consequence with regional and global implications in the not too distant future .  
They are compounded by political instability , waste and mismanagement of resources , corruption and lack of transparency , which have been diverting the scarce financial resources away from legitimate expenditures , including investment in social development .  
In such areas waste is visible , and downstream effects include contamination of limited groundwater lenses in highly populated and industrial areas and unhealthy inshore waters .  
In the broader context of nuclearweaponfree zones , Chile attached special importance to the regulation of the international maritime transport of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel according to the highest international safety standards .  
Of crucial importance was an adequate national technical , human and regulatory infrastructure in nuclear safety , radiological protection and waste management for the peaceful application of nuclear energy .  
In connection with the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , the vital importance of security in the international maritime transport of radioactive waste is quite evident .  
The States members of MERCOSUR and the associated countries considered that the strictest safety requirements should be observed in the international maritime transport of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel , which posed great danger to the marine environment and the health of populations in affected areas .  
Adoption of the clean production strategy in its widest sense : This involves the prudent exploitation of natural resources ; avoidance of the use of hazardous substances ; increased efficiency of the design and production processes ; reduced emissions , runoffs and wastes , whether in production or end-use , to levels the environment can support ; environmentally sound waste management ; and consideration of the modification of patterns of consumption that have given rise to a societal demand for a particular commodity or service .  
Adoption of measures to ensure effective Arab participation in achievements in the field of advanced technology for the improvement of the Arab environment : Increasing efforts are today being made to achieve important and promising advances in addressing chronic environmental issues connected with meeting the natural resource requirements of development projects , and especially their renewable resource requirements , with reducing pollution levels in production and end-use , with improving the effectiveness of waste recycling and with safer waste disposal .  
Quality of life is declining in urban areas , with losses of housing and of human lives caused by erosion , siltation and flooding ; general insalubrity owing to the lack of appropriate solid and liquid waste management systems ; severe overcrowding caused both by the population explosion and by uncontrollable concentrations of population ; physical and chemical degradation of land ; pollution of all kinds ; and above all , deforestation on the periphery of urban areas . 
The aforementioned Act , in chapter IV , article 153 , provides that the importation of hazardous and radioactive waste requires the prior and express authorization of the Ministry of Science , Technology and the Environment , meaning that such importation will have to comply with existing international recommendations and national regulations and should be for socially justifiable purposes .  
To date , conventions have been developed covering the safety of power reactors , radioactive waste and spent fuel management , early notification and assistance in case of a nuclear accident or radiological emergency , and the physical protection of nuclear material .  
It is no secret to Member States that it is dangerous to dump any form of radioactive waste , which could be used in radiological warfare , as well as having other harmful effects on regional and international peace , especially in developing countries .  
Exerting greater and more positive efforts towards achieving integration between environmental and health strategies , especially in terms of providing safe drinking water and food , treating waste-water and solid waste , controlling or limiting the potential dangers of chemicals , various types of pollution and genetically modified substances ; and achieving nuclear safety in the Arab region ;  
The leader of the project , Dai Sirui , from Southwest Agricultural University , said the project involved the study and demonstration of key technologies of people 's working and living , ecological problems , city waste water and garbage disposal , landslide monitoring warning , pasture and husbandry sectors ' development , advantageous and unique sector 's development , and ecological and economic system reconstruction after the Three Gorges Dam conserved water .  
It is necessary to maintain a good image of strictly disciplining ourselves and practicing clean and honest government , take a correct view of the powers in our hands , take the lead in observing discipline and law , persist in honest administration , and wage resolute struggle against negative phenomena of corruption such as abuse of power , harming the public for private profit , using public office for private gain , and extravagance and waste .  
( 1 ) Those who discharge highly toxic waste liquid into a body of water or who discharge or dump waste residues containing mercury , cadmium , arsenic , chromium , cyanide , yellow phosphorus , or other soluble acute toxins into a body of water or directly bury them under the ground shall be liable to a fine below 100,000 yuan ;  
( 2 ) those who discharge or dump radioactive solid waste matter , oils , acid liquors , alkaline liquors , or wastewater containing substance of a high or average radioactivity into a body of water shall be liable to a fine below 50,000 yuan ;  
Its main function is to undertake the treatment and disposal of nuclear energy , nuclear material , nuclear fuel , exhausted fuel , and radioactive waste , the prospecting and excavation of uranium deposits , the scientific research and development as well as the construction , production , and operation of nuclear energy and nuclear-related fields , such as nuclear instrument and equipment , isotope , nuclear technology application , and economic cooperation with foreign countries and import-export businesses .  
makes information distorted and policy decisions wrong ; causes the waste of many human , material , and financial resources and precious time ; and enables the people to lose many rare chances for development .  
Through continuing to deepen the fiscal and taxation reforms , we should establish a complete and unified fiscal and taxation system , and expand the sources of government revenue ; we must also strengthen fiscal and tax management and ensure that all collectable revenue is collected , put a stop to artificial revenue loss , rationally arrange fiscal funds , pay attention to returns in the use of funds , oppose extravagance and waste , and promote thrift and economy .  
Operations under high-tech conditions are the combined operations of all the military branches ; and in adapting correspondingly , equipment support can only be planned overall after going through the three branches ' joint support , and only then will there be a rational distribution of resources , organizational chaos be overcome , waste of materials and equipment be overcome , work procedures be simplified , and non-support consumption be lessened , fully putting into play the capability of existing resources .  
Statistical data from a battlefield showed that , after a tank crew have stayed in a small and closed space for a long time where it is filled with various kinds of radiation , waste gases , electromagnetic waves , heat , and noises , tank speed reduced by 19 percent , time to complete shooting increased by 35 percent , miss-hitting increased by 4 percent , and , in real-combat exercises , their fighting capacity declined by 7 to 10 percent everyday .  
We should further strengthen a sense of anxiety , of urgency and of mission and put into full play an excellent working style of making full use of every minute , work in a sweeping and resolute manner , do work right after we say we will do it and try to do work well .  We should thoroughly eradicate unhealthy , formalistic , deceptive working styles that waste time and should devote solid and effective efforts to implement all aspects of work .  
It was disclosed that the entire system is likely to cost as much as $ 60-billion upon completion .  However , no one is yet sure if the system will serve as " a seamless heavenly robe " free of problems upon completion .  Moreover , as modern science and technology are still developing at lightning speed , it is difficult to tell if the NMD system will end up as a heap of waste material in future .  
The economic , legal , and necessary administrative means should be used comprehensively to shut down enterprises which produce goods of inferior quality , waste resources , cause serious pollution , and do not have production safety conditions ; eliminate backward equipment , technology , and techniques ; cut down on surplus production capacity , and prevent these enterprises from reviving .  
It is necessary to actively promote legal administration , to intensify law enforcement inspections , to strengthen law enforcement oversight , to firmly implement the principles of following existing laws , strict law enforcement , and tracking down offenses against the law , to curb waste and destruction of resources , and to effectively improve the ecological environment in order to provide effective guarantees for sustainable economic and social development .  
On the one hand , the troops should participate in and support the ecological and environmental constructions , and on the other hand , they should take the lead to clean up the sources of pollution and focus on the comprehensive treatment of the garrisons ' everyday waste water , the oil-polluted water used to clean equipment , the waste water discharged from hospitals and clinics , and smoke and dust emission from boilers and so on to make sure that the sources of pollution will meet the emission and discharge standards after the treatment .  
Retired General Gordon Sullivan , former Army chief of staff , delivered a resentful speech attacking Rumsfeld 's reform as being " rash and reckless , " and the space militarization program even as a total waste of the national defense budget .  
We should create a warm , joyful , united , inspiring atmosphere around the main theme , and should organize various activities with the spirit of innovation by improving the work style , stressing real results , preventing waste and extravagance , and opposing formalism . 
The nation 's discharge of sulfur dioxide , chemical oxygen demand , dust , industrial solid waste and other major pollutants should be cut by 10 percent relative to 2000 ' s level .  In particular , the emission of sulfur dioxide in the " two controlled " zones should be reduced by 20 percent compared to 2000 ' s levels .  
Third , by way of structural readjustment , the province should close down a number of small factories and small mines which are plagued by backward production techniques and unmarketable products and which have caused a huge waste of resources and a heavy pollution to the environment ; meanwhile , to meet the demands of the modern enterprise system , the province should extend support to a number of dominating enterprises which have a great bearing on the country 's overall situation , and should further readjust and optimize its industrial structure .  
The 44th session of the IAEA General Conference , which started on 18 September , will review the IAEA 's 1999 annual report , as well as reports on stepping up international cooperation in nuclear safety , radiation safety , and radioactive waste safety , on intensifying the IAEA 's technological cooperation , and on preventing illicit trafficking in nuclear materials . 
The current centralized cleanup has further implemented " several regulations on rigorous enforcement of economy and curbing luxury and waste practiced at party and government organs issued by the State Council under the Central CPC Committee , " promoted the development of cultivating honesty and self-discipline among leading cadres at central and state organs , and improved the common practices at various organs , in addition to saving a huge amount of state funds .  
They neither reach deep into the reality nor go deep among the masses .  Refraining from making investigations and studies and without a clear understanding of the real situation , they act on their own personal feeling and subjective will .  What they are seeking is their own promotion .  They deceive their superiors and delude their subordinates and make false work performance .  And they do not hesitate to waste manpower and public funds .  As for the people 's well-being and demands , they are indifferent and insensitive .  
This year in particular , there have been consecutive incidents of the killing of a South Korean hostess by a U.S . serviceman , the " mistaken bombing " by the U.S . military at Maehyang-Ri , and the discharge of poisonous waste fluid into the Han River by the U.S . military .  This has touched off even stronger anti-U.S . sentiments .  
The completion of these projects will add to the cities 18.87 million-ton daily water supply capacity , 8.24 million-ton daily waste water treatment capacity , 31,317-ton solid waste treatment capacity , 7.8 million cubic meters daily gas supply capacity , and 1,585 kilometers of network of water supply and discharge and gas pipelines .  We have added another 1,308 kilometers of new urban roadways , built 21 bridges , and added 86.84 million square meters of heated space .  
The new facility is designed and is being built to meet stringent environmental standards .  An underground waste water treatment plant is under construction for treatment of effluent generated from livestock holding and slaughter .  
Holders of valid Dumping Licences for public filling areas may be permitted to dump materials such as earth , building debris , broken rock and concrete at the barging point provided that the materials are free from marine mud , household refuse , plastic , metal , industrial and chemical waste , animal and vegetable matter and other materials considered unsuitable . 
The Government 's policy objective on the environmental well-being of the community is to improve our urban , rural and marine surroundings , conserve our natural heritage , and optimise the use of resources and goods so as to reduce pollution and waste and promote health and the enjoyment of our living environment .  
The EIA identified there to be air quality , noise , water quality , blasting and solid waste impacts during quarrying and site formation operations , but concluded that , with suitable mitigation measures and good monitoring and audit programme implemented , such impacts could be controlled to within the established standards and guidelines . 
Seminars and experience-sharing sessions on environmental protection issues are jointly organised by the Education Department , other government departments and green groups on a regular basis for primary and secondary schools .  The main contents of these sessions include waste disposal .  
" We understand that local recyclers are facing difficulties because of reduced demand and stiff competition from countries that have devalued their currencies .  We are aware that in some countries their arrangements are , in effect , encouraging them to export subsidised waste paper to Hong Kong and elsewhere . "  
Every day , 4,000 tonnes of waste paper are produced .  About 2,000 tonnes are either part of domestic waste and go straight to landfills , mostly through USD and RSD collection services , or are of poor quality or contaminated commercial waste that the collectors again take direct to the landfills or refuse transfer stations .  
The Department also set up a Healthy Living into the 21st Century exhibition counter at the Victoria Park Fair venue to disseminate environmental protection , hygiene and health related messages with a heavy focus on the activities of the Council in these matters .  The exhibition materials included photographs , video-tapes , and model display on environmental protection activities such as waste reduction , environmental hygiene , healthy living style among students , etc .  
There are special conditions in the contract for these approved contractors to safeguard the classified waste handled by them and to prevent unauthorised or accidental access to the information contained therein .  
A vessel sank between Tap Mun Chau and Chek Chau on January 1 , last year , but to date a container on the sunken vessel is still left in the sea and has not been salvaged .  Recently , the plastic waste inside that container has been flowing out from the container and drifting about in the nearby waters , resulting in the death of a substantial amount of marine fish in the fish culture zones in these waters , and causing serious damage to marine ecology .  
I have recently received complaints from the public that some recycling bins provided by the Council are not cleared .  Hence , people who support environmental protection discover that these bins are too full for further loading when they carry the domestic waste papers and other recyclable items to the bins .  This would not only disappoint those people who support environmental protection , but would also lead to the waste papers and other recyclable items being accumulated next to the bins , resulting in stacks of refuse .  
" The working group will continue to take a more pro-active role in controlling flytipping , through extension of opening hours for public filling areas and public barging points and giving farmers instructions on how to dispose of animal carcasses . "  " Other controlling measures include strengthening legislation on trip-ticket system for disposal of construction and demolition material , and circulating guidelines to assist the staff of its member departments in the clearance of illegal dumping of chemical waste materials , " he added .  
For this purpose , Marine Department ( MD ) has a fleet of 61 vessels to clean up floating refuse within Hong Kong waters everyday and to provide domestic waste collection services to overseas as well as local vessels .  
" Our recurrent expenditure on environmental protection and conservation will grow by 7.6% in real terms , reflecting additional resources for commissioning and operating new sewage treatment plants , increased payments for the disposal of waste due to the commissioning of new facilities , additional staff for implementing air quality initiatives and additional resources for new barging points and for sorting facilities for construction and demolition waste . " she added .  
Whilst the EPD shares Greenpeace 's concern on issues such as the need to control persistent organic pollutants , promote clean industry , enhance waste recovery and recycling , the EPD is very concerned that Greenpeace 's action has often done the opposite in misleading the public in understanding some key environmental issues .  
" In this respect , the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department 's primary waste management role is to ensure the hygienic collection and transport of domestic waste , they are keen to see how they can better support the Government 's objective of increasing the recovery and reuse of valuable materials , " the spokesman stressed . 
Due to rapid increase in the population in Sha Tin and indiscriminate discharges from industrial , commercial , livestock and domestic sources , the Shing Mun River was heavily polluted in the 1980s .  The organic pollution load discharged into the river in those days was around 9 000 kg Biochemical Oxygen Demand ( BOD ) per day , which was equivalent to the waste discharged from about 160 000 people .  
Clean Hong Kong is one of the initiatives stated in the Chief Executive 's Policy Address this year .  The objective is to bring about visible and sustainable improvements on the ground through both active cleansing operations and public education and publicity efforts .  It will last for three years and comprise four key elements : * Stepped up enforcement action against littering and dumping of waste ;  
As to outward port cargo , marked increases were recorded for artificial resins and plastic materials ( + 40% ) , iron and steel ( + 28% ) , metalliferous ores and metal scrap ( + 27% ) , pulp and waste paper ( + 17% ) , furniture and parts thereof ( + 16% ) , and live animals chiefly for food and edible animal products ( + 13% ) .  
It is characterised by a number of green features including electronic ballast and energy saving bulbs , waste collectors for recyclables , asbestos-free insulating materials , a ventilation system powered by solar energy and a sunroof to maximise the use of natural light .  
The Authority has also set key environmental management goals and targets for the coming years .  These include improving energy saving in new estates and the recovery rate of waste for recycling , increasing water recycling at construction sites , enhancing environmental design of residential buildings and adopting environmentally friendly building materials .  
The need and reasonableness of an across-the-board cut is doubtful .  The Housing Authority 's current measure to re-assess the rent for individual commercial tenant according to commercial principles can better reflect the reality and help needy tenants maintain their competitiveness .  Rental reductions will not benefit shop tenants which have been enjoying prosperous business .  If so , this would be a waste of public funds .  
According to the findings of the EIA study , the potential impacts arising from the project on various aspects ( including impacts on water quality , air quality , noise , waste management , ecology , fisheries and cultural heritage as well as landscape and visual impacts ) can meet the established environmental objectives .  
As for outward port cargo , significant increases were recorded in pulp and waste paper ( + 23% ) , organic chemicals ( + 12% ) , artificial resins and plastic materials ( + 11% ) and iron and steel ( + 11% ) .  
As for other types of battery waste which are disposed of at the three landfills , they should not cause environmental problems since the landfills are lined with impermeable liners to prevent underground leakage of contaminated liquid , and such liquid is properly collected and treated within the landfills .  
Senior Environmental Protection Officer Mr Fok Wai-kai said : " Through daily work and extensive and frank discussions with officials in Shanghai , I have acquired comprehensive knowledge of their organisational arrangements as well as Shanghai 's complicated waste management networks .  
Earlier this year , in view of the increased public awareness and use of the waste separation bins , we considered it opportune to examine whether recycling of plastic bags would be practical and economically viable .  
( c ) We have always encouraged the environmental industry to recover and recycle different kinds of materials .  Hence , the CWTC and some private chemical waste disposal facilities have been recycling chemical waste .  Examples include the recovery of copper oxide from spent etchant ; fuel from oily water waste ; production of lubricating oil , hydraulic oil and moulding oil from different types of recycled waste oil ; silver from photofinishing waste ; and precious metals such as gold and silver from spent plating solution .  
As for outward port cargo , marked increases were recorded for " iron and steel " ( + 37% ) , " organic chemicals " ( + 30% ) , " pulp and waste paper " ( + 26% ) , " metalliferous ores and metal scrap " ( + 24% ) , " toys " ( + 22% ) , and " furniture and parts thereof " ( + 14% ) .  
The area is divided into two sections , separated with stainless steel netting to facilitate the disposal of the waste left by the fish . Thus , a delicate balance is kept between the acid and alkali content of the water , which helps to improve the growth of the abalone .  
After several years of intensive work , Mr . Chuang eventually produced a machine which is faster , processing up to 110 pieces a minute , only one thirteenth the size of the imported models , and only requires a three-quarters of a horsepower engine to operate . The waste rate is also low , with 82 kilograms of peeled asparagus obtained from 100 kilograms of the raw material .  
If we do not push hard for advanced development , how can we compete with other industrial countries ? For people who assumed nature 's resources to be infinite , the energy crunch of the 1970 ' s was a rude awakening , an indication of impending environmental crises stemming from careless spoiling and waste of natural resources .  
At a time when foreign currency reserves were low , the purchase of U . S . $ 2,000 worth of fruit trees seemed wasteful . Chiang Ching-kuo reassured Sung that money spent on scientific research was never a waste .  
Says Tseng : " Silt and sediment from the upper reaches of Hualien River has produced a sharp decline in the river 's animal and plant life . On top of this , the waste water discharged from nearby factories has polluted the river and raised the water temperature , so there are a lot fewer ku fish there now . "  
The length of time required for the 14 major development projects varies according to their nature . For example , China Steel 's third expansion project can be completed this year , yet only about five kilometers a year can be completed of the Taipei municipal rapid transit system , which will reach 100 kilometers in length , while the urban waste disposal project is an ongoing one .  
As to how to clean up the Tamsui River system , Premier Yu stated that his preliminary view is that the main sources of pollution of the Tamsui River system are pollution caused by urban domestic sewage , industrial waste water , and refuse dumped along the river banks .  
With the development of science and technology , the amount of waste is increasing at an alarming rate all over the world , including many items which are not biodegradable . In addition , the habit of frugality has been flagging with the advent of material plenty , and things are as easily thrown out as they are acquired .  
In the past , refuse was invariably used for compost , burned or buried . Compost heaps have no place in an increasingly urban society , and open-air burning has been relinquished because of the air pollution it creates , but the growth of waste in a prosperous , industrialized nation is usually faster than that of the population .  
In the past , scientific and technological development was clearly aimed at increasing our per capita income , but now that the economy has taken off , " raising the quality of life is the most pressing task at hand , " says Ma Nan-hsien , director of planning and evaluation at the National Science Council . The proportion of resources devoted to environmental and medical research , such as developing better waste processing technology or setting up a National Health Research Institute , will constantly increase .  
To stay outside the patterns of adult life and just hang out means to waste the most precious period of life of learning skills and knowledge . Also , given the disapproving attitude of others , it will be hard to avoid a decline in self-respect and self - esteem , which will have a negative influence on long-term prospects . At the same time , it is also a great waste of educational resources , social re sources and economic development .  
In Mexico , for example , 12.5 square meters of forest are burned for each 11 kilograms of formula produced . Waste from the cows creates vast amounts of methane , adding to global warming . It requires a great deal of energy to manufacture dry powdered milk from the original milk . Packaging requires the expenditure and waste of large amounts of tin , aluminum , and plastic ; for example in the U . S . 550 million empty formula tins are discarded annually , while Taiwan throws away about five million .  
Although many environmental scholars believe that there is also a problem of organic pollution , the scholarly community still lacks indepth under-standing in this area . In any case , organic waste is highly mobile ; Taiwan also has strong winds and heavy rains , " and has the good fortune to be surrounded by sea on all sides , so just two or three storms and most of it gets washed away , " is how one scholar describes it .  
Mr . Bigs should clean up their heavy metal : Faced with the red , blue , green , and other variously colored liquid pollutants generated by the electroplating industry , the industrial community ten years ago thought to follow the example of Japan and establish a special electroplating industrial zone to concentrate the scattered factories in one place and treat the waste water collectively .  
Lee Tung-liang , a Changhua County Councilor and a leader in the anti-Dupont environmental movement , says that if the water quality does not improve he is thinking about calling on the farmers to let all their land go to waste , and appeal to the county magistrate . " But , that would probably be very hard , and I 'm afraid it would n't be easy to get a positive response from the farmers . "  
They continually penetrate the soil , eating an amount of soil each day equal to their body weight , while their digestive system is like a factory line sucking in rough earth and waste and producing " night soil beads , " which are superior to bits of ordinary soil . Besides having greater air content , these " night soil beads " also have one third more water and microbes . Earthworm manure is excellent fertilizer .  
Further , the voters should respect the fact that legislators are national level representatives , and must be responsible to the people of the whole nation , and not ask their legislators to waste their money and energy going to local social gatherings or attending weddings and funerals and the like [ as local officials routinely do ] , nor select legislators on the basis of localism or the narrow concerns of some special interest group . This is the only way to give legislators more room to attend to the policy process .  
This company located in Kaohsiung originally made badminton racquet heads , whose main raw material is cork . Not only does cork have to be imported from abroad , it is even more troublesome to deal with the waste after the wood is processed .  
The government has set up a treatment plant for highly concentrated electroplating fluid in the Taichung area , and it is encouraging operators to use collective methods to turn their waste water over to specialists for disposal . Yet there are those who would rather sneak around and evade legal restraints .  
Formerly a planner for an advertising agency , Huang noticed many years ago that colorful and attractive magazine advertisements and calendar photos would serve as good basic material for creating original illustrations . TaKing great pains to gather these photos and art work that others saw as waste paper , he has cut them up and pasted them together into 150 collages that accompany the text .  
When the various conflicts surrounding the health insurance system became a hot topic of discussion , most people probably overlooked one basic fact : The universal health care plan is actually only a financial design , and its goal is to eliminate " loss and waste " from the vast health care system . As for actual medical service , one still must look to the same health care network of medical centers and personnel that is already in place .  
National Yang Ming University professor of public health Lan Chung-fu , who was the first to put forward a plan for health care network development , indicates that medical resources are precious and limited , and the main spirit of a health care network plan is : to reasonably distribute medical resources , to avoid inadequate supplies and to curb waste .  
For example , Taipower has always claimed that the costs of nuclear power are low . But as yet there is no way to finally dispose of nuclear waste , and it will impose enormous costs on the next generation . The maximum for compensation in the event of an accident at a nuclear power plant has been set at NT $ 1.4 billion , and the law says that anything over that amount will be paid by the government , thus artificially lowering the calculated costs of nuclear power immensely .  
In addition , and more worthy of attention , a number of jade pendants and other decorative objects made from " Taiwan soft jade " have been found at Tamalin . A large amount of jade craft waste material has also been found . This situation resembles that uncovered in Wanjung Rural Township in Hualien , which is known as a " jade handicraft site " of prehistoric people .  
But the charms of the traditional fishing industry are being threatened . Factories on the land emit poisonous waste , deforming the spines of the fish that swim at the mouth of the river . Liao has witnessed large-scale drift nets thrown by large fishing vessels catching all fish large and small . The heavy iron chains of the drift net destroy the sea bed , and it will take the sea bed , which nourishes the sea , decades to heal its wound .  
At museums , on the street , at sidewalk stands , in temples , at the vanguard of urban design , and in the shifting light and shadows of the city , looking for the value of existence , I 'm oppressed by a nightmare that piles up over my head as thick as clouds , blocking the road ahead . Masses of people coming , masses of people going , and I 'm just living on here in this empty , preposterous world of corruption and waste .  
But from the point of view of international goodwill and the natural reaction most people have toward anything nuclear , it might have been best to give more attention to the issues raised by concerned observers . For example , Michael Kau , a scholar at Brown University in the US , and Fang Chien , a well-known environmental activist , pointed out that no one wants nuclear waste in their back yard , and disregarding the sentiments of a neighbor does not conform to Chinese ethics .  
Kaohsiung 's major source of running water comes from the Kaoping River , but agricultural pollution ( both in the form of pesticides and livestock waste ) and illegal dumping of garbage have seriously eroded the quality of Kaoping River water , which has received low water-quality designations for several years running .  
Chen Shu says that as an agent , of course he wants to make sure all the paperwork proceeds smoothly , and yet the required paperwork for fishing vessels to enter and exit the harbor is very complicated . Argentina is very strict on safety , as strict as any developed country . It requires stringent guards against environmental pollution-oil can not be poured directly into the sea , and there must be oil and water filtering mechanisms , chemical treatment of human waste , foot activation devices for washing hands , and so on .  
The park was originally approved to release a maximum of 28,200 kiloliters of treated effluent per day . But in October and November of last year , the electronics industry was booming and the volume of effluent increased rapidly . Treated waste water from the park hit a record high of over 72,000 kiloliters . And recently average daily discharge has been running at around 53,000 kiloliters .  
According to regulations , when the volume of effluent exceeds the approved maximum by 10% , a report of this fact and an application to increase the approved maximum must be submitted . But the approval process takes six months and the volume of waste water was continuing to grow at an explosive rate . As such , the park was unable to avoid exceeding the stipulated volume .  
Chunghsing Village was modeled after English communities . Over 40 years ago , it was unique in Taiwan for its waste water treatment and rain water drainage systems , its specially planted camphor trees , bodhi trees , and assorted grasses and plants , giving the entire village plentiful greenery and shade .  
In Bengbu , a group of teenagers sent down to work in the countryside goes through an unexpected experience on the way there which shows just how unprepared they are for the adult world into which they 've been pushed . In Backstage , a group of performers waste away their youth in an underfunded , lackluster performing arts troupe . In Sisters , one promising young woman after another is transformed by marriage from the apple of everyone 's eye into just another boring housewife .  
FPG moved quickly to clarify the situation , and later stated that there had indeed been deficiencies in the selection of the company to which it had contracted disposal of the waste . It also assumed responsibility for shipping the waste back to Taiwan , where it is now stored on a temporary site near Kaohsiung harbor . But despite these actions , FPG 's image as a pragmatic and responsible company has been severely tarnished .  
" If it had n't been for the Formosa Plastics mercury waste incident in Cambodia , who knows how long the chaos in Taiwan 's management , storage and disposal of hazardous industrial wastes would have continued , along with the tremendous threat it poses to human health and the environment ? " asks Professor Lin Cheng-fang of National Taiwan University 's Graduate Institute of Environmental Engineering , giving FPG some backhanded credit for highlighting the issue .  
Under the ROC 's " Standard Criteria for Identifying Hazardous Industrial Wastes , " hazardous wastes are divided into three major categories . The first comprises specifically listed substances which are generated by industrial processes or are inherently toxic . The second comprises substances defined as hazardous by their characteristics , including those which are corrosive , flammable or infectious ( mostly medical waste ) , or contain individual non-ferrous metals . This includes substances such as powerful oxidants which may cause other materials to ignite .  
The recyclers also tipped the waste liquid from their acid baths into the nearby Erhjen Creek , turning its waters black and giving rise to the notorious " green oyster incident . "  
As environmental standards have risen , the Basel Convention has been repeatedly amended . It lists over 50 types of hazardous waste for which cross-border movements are controlled , and by coordination with the World Customs Organization , new tariff schedule codes have been defined to more effectively control international movements of hazardous waste .  
In fact , because there is nowhere else for hazardous waste to go , under current regulations waste which has been solidified or stabilized , and which passes leaching tests to ensure that there is no danger of toxins escaping , can be buried in segregated areas of city and county sanitary landfills .  
However , to date the exchange center has not been able to balance demand with supply . Lin Chih-sen , a division chief at the IDB , comments that many raw materials derived from waste do not have the same level of purity as original feedstocks , and so do not meet manufacturers ' requirements . Hence the proportion of waste materials offered through the exchange center which are actually sold is very low-less than 10% .  
I would n't waste my time with it ! " Ban Jieyu 's eloquent denial of witchcraft won her the emperor 's reprieve . Thoroughly familiar with classical literature and history , Ban Jieyu was also a talented poet , and Ban Gu included her melancholy poetry in his History . The depth of this woman shines through in her poetry , which while moody does not give way to self-pity or grumbling .  
Where I live in northwestern Switzerland , small municipal refuse bags , which hold 17 liters , cost around NT $ 30 each . Even the largest size of bags only hold 110 liters , yet cost NT $ 108 . This is definitely much more expensive than in Taipei City , but I 've never heard anyone complain that the bags are too dear . I think this is because they do a good job of reducing and separating their waste .  
The 15-member committee finished its three-month review on September 15 without coming to a conclusive decision , with individual committee members in sharp disagreement over the per-kilowatt cost of nuclear power , the cost of canceling construction , and the cost to society of having a nuclear plant in operation . Many have criticized the Re-Evaluation Committee as " a complete waste of money , time , and energy . "  
But most farmers and laborers ca n't draw and paint . Born to a poor farming family in hard times , he had God-given artistic talent . Not wanting waste this gift , he has found an outlet for it on paper , allowing future generations of Taiwanese to know how their ancestors spent their days toiling and getting calluses on their hands . Collected together , these paintings make for a lively history of life in a Taiwanese farming village of the past .  
The pair get married , but the Snake King arrives disguised as a local village girl and steals the magic feather . In the end , Wan Shi turns into a huge boulder to pin down the Snake King , while the egret goddess gives up her magic feather to save the island , which has been laid to waste . Thanks to the sacrifices of Wan Shi and the egret goddess , the people are able to live in peace once again .  
Although nuclear power does not produce greenhouse gases , the controversies that rage over the safety of nuclear plants and the disposal of nuclear waste are prohibitive ; nor does the COP encourage countries to develop nuclear energy . Thus , " renewable energy " sources such as wind and solar power , despite the high costs of researching and developing these alternatives , are inevitable . Next year Taiwan Power Company will finally take the plunge and invest a large amount of money in a wind power program .  
Efforts to cut back on plastic waste shifted into a higher gear on January 1 with a measure restricting the use of plastic bags and plastic ( including expanded polystyrene , i.e . " styrofoam " ) disposable eating utensils . This marks the second phase of implementation of a policy that was first introduced on a more limited scale last July , when the government clamped down on the use of such items by government agencies , membership supermarkets for military personnel , and public and private schools .  
In contrast , the enormous expenses of the two dialysis centers in Malaysia are covered entirely locally by donations from grateful patients and the money raised by local volunteers through small donations and recycling of waste . Wang Yun-ching relates that most people have the mistaken idea that all Tzu Chi volunteers are Buddhists . In fact , those handling medical duties for Tzu Chi branch organizations around the world include persons of many different faiths .  
Many nutritionists have finally come round to telling the media that it is best not to eat too many instant noodles . The reasons are that they have a high salt content and can cause high blood pressure , they contain preservatives that may cause cancer . Also , some unscrupulous manufacturers make their noodles using waste cooking oil , and there are worries that eating this oil can lead to digestive tract disorders and other ailments .  
For Shi Jin-hua , who suffers from diabetes , 1980 marked the time he started taking insulin injections and regularly recording his blood-sugar level with a glucometer . In the two decades since then , he estimates that he has measured his own blood sugar level at least 40,000 times . Over the years , Shi has carefully stored the medical waste , so important to his continued physical health and control , in sealed plastic bags .  
" It 's the plainness of rice straw that attracts people to it , " says Kao Hsi-lin . " It gives rise to a desire for a natural , rustic life . " Kao is a vibrant man who builds installations , paints and studies creative media . After several years spent working on community building , he is now giving new life to rice straw , a material that the people of Jenju had previously thought of as a waste product .  
Today , because staying alive is not hard , people are unable to find meaning in life itself . Yet we must look for meaning in life itself , " comments social critic Nanfang Shuo . He notes that feelings of fatigue , emptiness , waste , and futility with respect to life have become an unavoidable existential question for young men and women .  
Besides the public 's complaints that how to sort waste is not clearly defined and that the collection procedure is inconvenient , environmental groups are concerned that instituting the policy without adequate supporting measures-giving rise to problems such as insufficient publicity , the failure to purchase dedicated vehicles for collecting kitchen waste , and the still-incomplete state of processing sites-will undermine its effectiveness .  
According to many environmental groups , experience with kitchen waste recycling in rural communities shows that during the initial stages , residents were unclear about what was to be recycled , and as a result kitchen wastes were provided without first draining them , or items such as stray toilet paper , chopsticks , and plastic bags were often found mixed in . This type of front-end problem with the collection system is relatively easy to correct using instruction and appropriate adjustments . The real headache turns out to be with the downstream processes .  
However , kitchen waste is the main source of the foul odors and disease vector proliferation in garbage . When kitchen wastes are mixed with other garbage for processing , landfills are inundated with noxious gases , polluting the air . If taken instead to incinerators , due to their high water content , much energy will be wasted in the burning process , and the lifespan of the incinerator will also be reduced . At the same time , concentrations of the toxin dioxin will be increased .  
With its beautiful natural scenery , Ilan County has a strong environmental consciousness . As early as 1977 , the county began experimenting with and promoting the recycling of kitchen waste . Natural Environmental Protection Foundation chairperson Liu Shu-hui and National Ilan Institute of Technology jointly developed a simple composting method suitable for use by families and neighborhoods .  
Currently , the country as a whole recycles an average of almost 15% of all kitchen waste . As for the disposition of collected kitchen waste , " 70% is used primarily for raising pigs , and composting accounts for 30% , " says Lin Tso-hsiang , section chief for kitchen waste recycling operations at the Environmental Protection Administration 's Bureau of Environmental Inspection . During the current phase , local governments have not been required to institute kitchen waste recycling ; they are merely encouraged to do so .  
Immunity seesaw Although allergies are caused by physiological factors , adverse environmental factors can make an allergy much worse . Chiang Bor-luen points out that nitric oxide , carbon monoxide , sulfur dioxide , and other waste gases emitted by motor vehicles and factories can harm the respiratory tract and aggravate a preexisting allergy .  
Looking to the future , it seems to be a foregone conclusion that NHI premiums will have to increase to ensure that hospitals can survive , the public can get needed medical care , and the NHI program itself can stay solvent . The caveat is that besides increasing revenues , restraining expenditures and eliminating waste are the only viable long-term options for saving the program , and the only means of achieving a satisfactory result for the government , the health care sector , and the public .  
according to an official from the chinese ministry of foreign trade and economic co operation , the aim of the project , the memorandum of understanding of which was signed in 1992 , is to assist china in mitigating environmental degradation caused by the depositing of mine waste through introducing suitable technology from australia  
Liquid wastes from urban and industrial pollution sources represent about 20 to 40 per cent of total liquid waste generation , but are the major sources of organic pollutants , heavy metals and hazardous toxic chemicals .  
Environmentally sound waste disposal requires the collaboration of local and national authorities , based on appropriate and sustainable legal instruments and their effective implementation .  
The UNCHS Sustainable Cities Programme ( SCP ) has assisted in the move towards privatization of solid waste management in selected cities and has established an innovative framework for city consultations leading to improved city management functions .  
UNEP / IRPTC carries data profiles relevant to the assessment of hazards and risks posed by chemical substances to human health and the environment , waste management , and legal information on national and international regulatory control measures .  
The problems associated with radioactive waste management and disposal are complex and multifaceted , touching on scientific , technical , geologic , economic , social , health , environmental , political and intergenerational factors . 
Safe , acceptable management and final disposal of radioactive waste including spent fuel and waste from future decommissioning require coordination of a multiplicity of activities scientific , technical , economic , social , legal and political efforts .  
As a result of its financial assistance for local environmental health projects , its close ties with municipalities and the Palestinian Authority , and its collaborative relationship with three major solid waste projects in the Gaza Strip , UNRWA was instrumental in achieving coordination and promoting common standards and strategies in the environmental health sector among the Palestinian Authority , local municipalities and non-governmental organizations operating in the Gaza Strip .  
This half century will also be remembered as a time of tremendous waste of human creativity and energy for purposes of destruction , a time of rising disparities between nations , of flagrant abuse of nature and its finite resources and , above all , of unprecedented loss of human lives and human deprivation despite the infinite possibilities opened up by revolutions in science and technology .  
The changes of the last decade in economic and political conditions and new consensuses reached during the recent series of conferences offer a unique opportunity to develop an intensified , strengthened and more realistic approach to such cooperation , but the opportunity may go to waste if we fail to shape a more efficient , creative and forward-looking United Nations . 
A painful and futile internal conflict , brought on by intransigence and ideological utopianism , added to the waste of public resources and Governments overwhelmed by the nation 's problems , led Peru into a deep internal crisis with grave international consequences . 
The Agreement contains a general obligation , among other things , for countries to minimize waste , discards , catch by lost or abandoned gear , catch of non-target species both fish and non-fish species and impacts on associated and / or dependent species in particular endangered species through measures including , to the extent practicable , the development and use of selective , environmentally safe and cost-effective fishing gear and techniques .  
Rowe ( Australia ) : All discussions of the problem of land-mines are redolent with statistics and verbal images of a profoundly shocking and disturbing nature , invoking numbers of civilians , including children , killed or injured , the extent of their injuries , the cost of rehabilitation , the effect on their livelihoods and their prospects for family life , the acreage of arable land laid waste and the incalculable debilitating social and political effects of living with a constant source of terror .  
Develop and disseminate to farming households integrated farm management technologies , such as crop rotation , organic manuring and other techniques involving reduced use of agricultural chemicals , multiple techniques for sources of nutrients and the efficient utilization of external inputs , while enhancing techniques for waste and by-product utilization and prevention of pre - and post-harvest losses , taking particular note of the role of women ;  
Governments , according to their capacities and available resources and with the cooperation of the United Nations and other relevant organizations , should promote centres of excellence for training in hazardous waste management , building on appropriate national institutions and encouraging international cooperation , inter alia , through institutional links between developed and developing countries .  
Countries should take urgent measures to avert the ongoing rapid environmental and economic degradation in developing countries that generally affects the lives of women and children in rural areas suffering drought , desertification and deforestation , armed hostilities , natural disasters , toxic waste and the aftermath of the use of unsuitable agro-chemical products .  
The longer this situation continues , the more likely it is that we will be faced with a genuine structural public-service problem leading to inefficient use of national human capacities and a waste of resources .  
The Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes ( Helsinki , 1992 ) contains binding obligations to parties to apply best available technologies for the treatment of industrial waste water containing hazardous substances , to apply at least biological treatment or equivalent processes for treating municipal waste water , and to carry out research on the development of new technologies and environmentally sound disposal practices .  
As far as production is concerned , the use of input and materials ( intense or otherwise ) and the adoption of technologies ( i.e . , whether they are environmentally sound or not ) may well determine both the level of industrial waste generation and the chemical and physical properties of products , with implications for the use and disposal stages .  
The urban poor are the primary victims of municipal sewage discharged into water bodies and the improper disposal of solid waste and toxic chemicals .  
TACF provides assistance and training to developing countries in the use of nuclear technology for power generation , and for scientific , resource , agricultural , medical , environmental and industrial applications , as well as for activities relating to radiation protection , safety of nuclear installations and waste management .  
For long-lived , high-level waste , the Act of December 1991 established rules of research that will lead to the appropriate management of such wastes : separation and transmutation of long-lived radioactive elements ; possibilities of reversible and irreversible storage in deep geologic formations ; and laboratory research including conditioning and long-term surface depositories for such wastes .  
Germany subscribes to the concept of safe and environmentally sound management of radioactive waste ; and of unlimited , irrecoverable , ultimate disposal of the waste in deep geologic formations .  
It will also promote minimization , re-use and environmentally sound treatment and disposal of waste and sewage through provision of information strategies , tools and instruments for improved waste management and enhanced capabilities at national and local level for solid and liquid waste management .  
Technical material . ( i ) Maintaining relevant databases and other information systems concerning hazardous waste generation , treatment technologies and regulatory and other instruments ; ( ii ) four updated PC-version of the database of the International Register of Potentially Toxic Chemicals and distribution of subsets thereof ; and ( iii ) establishment of one regional information network . ( a ) Advisory service .  
Further took note of the gradual shift of focus from pollution control and waste management to pollution prevention approaches in policies and programmes at the country level and bilateral and multilateral cooperation , and observed that this shift has resulted in the introduction of production patterns that emphasize the more efficient use of raw materials and energy , taking into account the capture and recycling of wastes and the better use of end-products of the productive system ;  
These included : empowerment of women as an overall concept ; mass media ; statistics and indicators on gender issues ; natural resources and sustainable development : water , waste management and sanitation ; renewable energy ; and issues related to different groups of female population such as the ageing , displaced ; refugees and migrants .  50 .  The Board decided that INSTRAW should introduce the following in its new programme , among other subjects :  
The Acting Director emphasized that that situation limited the Institute 's capacity to provide the corresponding General Assembly committees with substantive contributions and research findings in critical areas of economic and social development processes , such as : water , environment and sustainable development , waste management , renewable sources of energy , human settlements , poverty alleviation , desertification , international migration , and violence against women migrant workers .  
minimize pollution , waste , discards , catch by lost or abandoned gear , catch of non-target species , both fish and non-fish species , ( hereinafter referred to as non-target species ) and impacts on associated or dependent species , in particular endangered species , through measures including , to the extent practicable , the development and use of selective , environmentally safe and cost-effective fishing gear and techniques ;  
The impact on women of environmental and natural resource degradation , deriving from , inter alia , unsustainable production and consumption patterns , drought , poor quality water , global warming , desertification , sea-level rise , hazardous waste , natural disasters , toxic chemicals and pesticide residues , radioactive waste , armed conflicts and its consequences ;  
Pilot projects take into account the specific characteristics of small island developing States in relation to waste generation and disposal , fragile ecosystems , limited resource base , geographical isolation and scarce human resources .  
Pilot projects take into account the specific characteristics of small island developing States in relation to waste generation and disposal , fragile ecosystems , limited resource base , geographical isolation and scarce human resources .  
minimize pollution , waste , discards , catch by lost or abandoned gear , catch of non-target species , both fish and non-fish species , ( hereinafter referred to as non-target species ) and impacts on associated or dependent species , in particular endangered species , through measures including , to the extent practicable , the development and use of selective , environmentally safe and cost-effective fishing gear and techniques ;  
Even in normal times , particularly in developing countries , the capacities of these infrastructures are often strained to manage even the most basic social and economic development programmes , and a single disaster can severely disrupt the community lifelines that provide food distribution , water supplies , health-care services , waste disposal and communications locally and with the rest of the world .  
The Sustainable Dar es Salaam Project ( SDP ) supports the City Council in developing sustainable solutions to priority environmental issues such as solid waste , servicing urban land , air quality , surface water , coastal area resources , recreational and tourism resources and urban agricultural production .  
In keeping with Iraq 's former position that the political decision had not been made to proceed to the design , development and production of nuclear weapons , the purpose of this work had previously been explained as technological development with the long-term possibility of converting to metal the depleted uranium , expected to result from Iraq 's indigenous enrichment processes , as part of a waste management strategy .  
tasks of this committee would be to oversee the earliest possible restoration to normal functioning of all public services and utilities ( including water , sanitation , energy supply , public transport , communications , waste disposal , health and educational facilities ) and to oversee the rebuilding of houses damaged or destroyed during the conflict ;  
While it may be true that the existing financial crisis is primarily a crisis of payment , there is no denying the fact that there is unnecessary waste being generated here , whether in regard to the duplication of work detail , the excessive copying of documents , the scheduling of numerous meetings destined to accomplish nothing or to a myriad of other undesirables .  
The presentation to the General Assembly of the annual report of the IAEA provides us with a valuable opportunity to review the work which the Agency has carried out and to measure the impact and efficiency of its activities in the various fields in which it operates in accordance with its statutory functions , both in respect of its work in the prevention of nuclear proliferation and in the promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , as well as in the strengthening of international cooperation in nuclear safety , radiological protection and waste management .  
Despite a large degree of convergence on many of the issues that will be addressed by this convention , we feel constrained to reiterate that , for countries like India , whose nuclear programme is based on a closed fuel cycle , it would not be possible to consider including spent fuel in a convention dealing with the safety of radioactive waste management .  
The concept of eco-efficiency , which is concerned with maximizing the productivity of energy and material inputs in order to reduce resource consumption and pollution / waste per unit output , is currently seen as a promising short - to medium-term strategy , appropriate in both developed and developing countries , for maintaining economic growth and competitiveness while achieving improved environmental quality ( the double dividend ) .  
A number of other actions can be noted , such as the 1993-1994 ban on the dumping of radioactive waste , sewage sludge and industrial waste and on incineration of toxic wastes at sea , as agreed in the 1972 Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter ( London Convention ) ; ( c ) In relation to programme areas C and D , the legal framework for sustainable use and conservation of living aquatic resources in the oceans has been substantially improved since UNCED .  
Governments should promote the establishment of self-sustaining financial mechanisms in support of , inter alia : ( i ) training of personnel ; ( ii ) navigational safety and antipollution measures in international straits ; ( iii ) waste reception facilities in ports ; and ( iv ) salvage and emergency response facilities and capacity-building in hydrographic surveying and nautical charting .  
Depending on the context and needs of the cities , towns and villages in each country and region , special attention should be paid to the most critical issues , such as changing production and consumption patterns ; energy efficiency ; sustainable resource and land-use management ; [ poverty eradication ; population and health ; water supply , sanitation and waste management ; disaster prevention , mitigation , preparedness and management ; cultural and historical heritage ; environmental protection ; industry ; infrastructure ; and basic services such as health and education facilities .  
Health problems related to adverse environmental conditions , including a lack of access to safe water and sanitation , inadequate waste management , poor drainage , air pollution , and exposure to excessive noise levels , as well as ineffective and inadequate health services , exact a heavy toll on the quality of life and the overall contribution to society of millions of people . 
Dispose , within both rural and urban areas by the year 2025 , of all sewage , waste waters and solid wastes in a manner in conformity with national or international environmental quality guidelines ;  
However , the issues covered in this section are of major concern to industrialized and developing countries alike , though different objectives and priorities will be stressed in different circumstances .  For example , waste reduction and avoidance is a priority for countries facing acute shortages of disposal capacity ( e.g .  
Extended producer responsibility ( EPR ) represents one of the most innovative approaches to tackling the problems of rising industrial and household waste volumes ( which may be either physically or politically hard to dispose of ) , rising costs of disposal and human health and environmental concerns relating to the spread of toxic and hazardous substances as a result of dissipative uses of products or inadequate waste management practices .  
A wide variety of approaches are currently being used : instruments deployed to date have focused on guiding product choice ( through ecolabelling and other product information ) and changing behaviour relating to energy saving , waste disposal and personal mobility ( through education , information and pricing signals ) .  
Commends the efforts of the Institute to address all levels of poverty that hamper so dramatically the advancement of women , through the coordination of research and training activities in the areas of economic and political empowerment of women ; statistics and indicators in gender issues ; communications ; women , natural resources and sustainable development ; water , sanitation and waste management ; renewable sources of energy ; and issues related to different population groups , such as the girl child , older women , displaced women , refugee and migrant women and women in rural areas ;  
The aforementioned 1972 London Dumping Convention for the prevention of marine pollution by waste dumping has been significantly strengthened by amendments in 1993 banning the dumping of radioactive , industrial and incineration wastes ; a new protocol under discussion would ban all marine disposal except in specific cases that could be shown to have no adverse environmental impacts .  
The unit employing this method , called TerraSURE , is capable of creating isolated , functional process reactors in the subsurface of hazardous waste sites , landfills or tailing deposits where in situ bio-remediation , chemical degradation and solvent extraction can be carried out .  
Quantitative analysis of the effectiveness of the Basel Convention remains difficult , largely because of a lack of reliable data related to hazardous waste generation ; an absence of comparable data between national authorities ; the absence of accurate baseline data for reported global trade in hazardous wastes ; lack of clear definitions of wastes considered to be " hazardous " ; and the absence of one major industrialized country and several developing countries as parties to the Convention .  
It also asked Governments and agencies of the United Nations system to promote programmes for guiding management and corrective actions to control pollution in the larger coastal urban settlements , specifically in the treatment of sewage and waste disposal , both domestic and industrial , as well as to control pollution in river systems caused by mining industries .  
Urgent action of a new type is needed to ensure that water 's deep involvement in both environment and development issues can be properly addressed , action that will demand an integrated approach to land use , water-supply and waste management , with due attention to all water 's parallel functions in nature and society , as well as to the evident linkages between upstream land and water use and downstream opportunities . 
The number of individuals living in water-stressed countries or countries with a chronic water scarcity will increase tenfold in only one generation to encompass more than one third of the world population .  In waste areas , there has been an overexploitation of aquifers , which are becoming ever more seriously depleted .  The risks that threaten to erupt wherever socio-economic development depends on a continuously undermined key resource are evident : ultimate resource constraints will one day send shocks through such vulnerable societies .  
The Committee was informed , upon request , that the amount of $ 2.5-million had been based on prior experience in other missions for disposal of hazardous waste , such as contaminated petrol , oil and lubricants , batteries and used tyres and other toxic wastes ; that in the past , those requirements had been provided under transport operations ; and that , in view of the strict regional laws regarding the disposal of hazardous wastes , UNPF had made the provision based on Croatia 's requirement that such waste be disposed of by Government-licensed contractors .  
The Board stated that the Institute 's programme of work should continue to focus on and establish priorities in areas where INSTRAW has already acquired expertise - areas such as the political and economic empowerment of women ; statistics and indicators in gender issues ; natural resources and sustainable development ; water and waste management ; renewable sources of energy ; access to credit ; women and the media ; and , issues relating to different population groups , especially the elderly and displaced , refugees and migrant women .  
The Acting Director noted that this limited the Institute 's ability to provide the other main committees of the General Assembly with substantive contributions and conclusions derived from its research in crucial areas of economic and social development , such as water , environment and sustainable development , waste management , renewable sources of energy , human settlements , alleviation of poverty , desertification , international migration , and violence against women migrant workers .  
Iraq is under international obligation to waste no time in registering the remaining Iranian prisoners of war about whose detention in Iraq ample evidence exists , and for providing that list to the Iranian authorities as agreed upon at Tehran on 14 September 1995 , and thereby paving the way for a final solution to this outstanding and sad humanitarian issue . 
A careful balance must be maintained between , on the one hand , establishing priorities to make the best use of resources and avoid waste , and on the other hand the principle of adequate provision for alternatives as insurance against even the remote possibility of future political , monopoly , regulatory or efficiency difficulties on any of the main transit transport routes available to landlocked countries .  
Steps to cut total transport costs will be of real significance to the growth of the Central Asian economies , whether they come about by developing new alternative routes , increasing competition on all routes , improving the quality and efficiency of transport infrastructure and services , or cooperative efforts to reduce waste and inefficiency by installing the most advanced international concepts of transit transport facilitation .  
The programme is designed to improve urban living conditions and strengthen municipal institutional capacities for the planning and operation of urban facilities and public services , including water supply and solid waste management .  
The Council , in paragraph 2 of the resolution , " Commends the work of the Institute on the issue addressing the process of the economic and political empowerment of women ; statistics and indicators in gender issues ; women , natural resources and sustainable development ; water , waste management and renewable sources of energy ; and issues related to different groups , such as the elderly , displaced , refugees and migrant women " .  
The limited information obtained from national sources shows that a number of small island developing States have begun to implement parts of the Programme of Action that have especially high priority at the national level , including institution-building , particularly the strengthening of legislative frameworks ; waste management ; coastal area management ; and to a lesser extent , the preservation of biodiversity .  
A primary responsibility of the regional commissions is to provide advisory services and to strengthen regional networks by which Member States may exchange experience and information , and harmonize national economic , social , environmental and settlement policies and strategies - in particular those that have a critical cross-border impact on , inter alia , migration , shared coastal zones , river basins and ecosystems , watersheds , and pollution and waste management .  
The competent authorities shall secure , on fair conditions and upon the request of the Registrar or on his behalf , the public services needed by the Tribunal such as , but not limited to , postal , telephone and telegraphic services , electricity , water , gas , sewage , collection of waste , fire protection , local transportation and cleaning of public streets .  
It is to be hoped that the scientifically advanced nations will effectively control the use of scientific progress by their nationals or public authorities and prevent any use detrimental to the natural wealth and the human , genetic and biological resources of the less developed nations or to the individual freedom and privacy of their citizens , especially with respect to trade in and management of waste materials .  
Cancelled : ( ii ) compendium on human settlement-related interventions in the control of vector-borne diseases in urban areas ; ( iv ) strategies for environmentally sound energy management in urban areas of sub-Saharan Africa ; and ( viii ) compendium of sustainable disposal techniques for septate and pit-latrine waste .  
The development of this new article , which introduces both the precautionary approach and the polluter pays principle , is connected with proposals to include " reverse lists " - i.e . , instead of " black and grey lists " , which means that all dumping would be strictly prohibited with the exception of clearly identified waste categories - and the Waste Assessment Framework .  
At their fourth meeting , they also expressed their concern regarding the safe and secure transportation of INF materials through the region . 187 They called on all States to maintain cooperation and exchange information on the transportation of nuclear material and radioactive waste and to continue working through IMO and IAEA in the development of additional measures which would complement the 1993 INF Code .  
Botswana has always maintained that the international community must always aim at ensuring that the financial , material and human resources invested in the cause of peace do not go to waste due to premature withdrawal of a peacekeeping mission .  
Coordination of international actors is essential to avoid waste and duplication and , more importantly , to avoid conflicting advice from technical consultants , programmes working at cross purposes and over-funding of or inordinate attention to particular aspects of the democratization process to the detriment of others ; the last could lead in turn to an imbalance between the capacities of State and civic institutions .  
Barbados is improving living conditions by revitalizing the main town centres , developing systems of physical planning and coastal management , and promoting public-private partnerships , disposing of waste and extending water resources .  
It further noted that recent space technology spin-offs had resulted in products such as an anti-shock pressure suit for medical applications , a transportation guidance system , a hand-held electromagnetic probe for inspecting aircraft for cracks and other damage , an obstacle detection system to assist in automated operations , a prototype silicon detector of radiation-induced effects in humans , automated robotic gasoline pumps , force reflecting devices to assist the blind in using a computer mouse , nuclear waste facility clean-up , and field applications and demonstrations of tele-medicine systems ( " tele-clinics " ) .  
We , who have a closed fuel cycle nuclear power programme , have consistently opposed the inclusion of spent fuel , which is a valuable resource material , along with radioactive waste in this convention .  
For these reasons , Costa Rica supports the creation of a broad region called The nuclear-weapon-free Southern Hemisphere and adjacent areas on the basis of a proposal for resolutions put forward by Brazil , which should include a total ban on the transport and transfer of nuclear materials for bellicose purposes and of atomic waste .  
Over 120-million people worldwide are officially unemployed and many more underemployed , causing massive personal suffering , widespread social disintegration and huge economic waste .  
In some cities in Europe , campaigns to encourage communities to separate waste at the household level have been so successful that there is insufficient capacity to recycle all the waste collected by municipal authorities and , because of increased supply , the market price for recycled materials has dropped drastically .  
However , recent outbreaks of cholera in Peru and a " plague scare " in India ( see box 4 ) have clearly demonstrated the human suffering and loss of life that may result from poor waste management and the disastrous effect that waste-related diseases may have on the trade and tourism vital for national economy .  
In a recently completed study carried out by UNCHS in Africa and Asia , direct epidemiological relationships between inadequate waste management and the incidence of diarrhoea and , respiratory and skin diseases have been established and low-cost , remedial interventions have been recommended , advancing strong health arguments for targeted investments in infrastructure in low-income settlements . 
Until waste management authorities overcome these institutional shortcomings and develop a more flexible management structure , responsive to the needs of public , private and community sectors , isolated schemes will remain good examples of " best practice demonstrations " and will not be incorporated into the overall waste management system .  
The effectiveness of waste - management policies may be enhanced when combined with economic and environmental policies designed to improve , for example , efficiency in production and consumption and with policies targeted at making production processes and consumer choice and behaviour more suitable .  
Environmentally induced migrations are caused by natural disasters , such as earthquakes , flash flooding , typhoons , and volcanic eruptions ; by nuclear and hazardous waste contamination ; by agricultural and rural decline , resource pollution , chronic water shortages ; or by dam construction and other large-scale development projects .  
On another level , the Habitat Agenda also provides clear and detailed expression of the local environmental agenda and priorities of developing countries , which are focused on essential services , such as water supply , sanitation and waste management , among others , and are informed by the relationship between poverty and environmental decline , and thus by the need for sustainable economic growth to address both issues .  
Human rights violations have been reported , in addition to sporadic and discretionary enforcement of environmental regulations : reportedly , unlined toxic waste pits allow pollution to seep into drinking water supplies , thus threatening the right to health of surrounding communities , and calls for compensation from the oil companies are often met with claims of sabotage or payment of compensation to the Government of which the local villagers see little . 
After the fire , Thai government authorities allegedly relocated the toxic residues to a dumpsite in a military area in Kanchanaburi . The toxic waste is buried approximately 4 m underground and the entire 3,800 _ m2 area is covered with cement . 
A prevalence of environmental inequities based on socio _ economic and racial factors has been reported : of the two factors , race appears to have both an independent and a more important relationship with the distribution of commercial hazardous waste facilities than income .  
Over 120-million people worldwide are officially unemployed and many more underemployed , causing massive personal suffering , widespread social disintegration and huge economic waste .  
Handling guidelines , better inventories , and improved treatment are typical preventive strategies for the management of hazardous waste ; reduction strategies and enhanced treatment are used for solid wastes , with reduction targets established in some countries .  
Decide to work towards evolving principles based on sound management of hazardous wastes so as to develop national policies to phase out toxic agricultural and industrial chemicals and trade in hazardous waste ;  
The International Atomic Energy Agency is continuing its activities and studies in such key areas as : creation of an international nuclear information system ; problems of migration of radionuclide contaminants in soils , forests and lakes ; training for the safe operation and management of nuclear power plants ; radiation monitoring and protection and radioactive waste management ; and reduction of internal radiation doses to the population .  
Barbados is improving living conditions by revitalizing the main town centres , developing systems of physical planning and coastal management , and promoting partnerships between the public and private sector , disposing of waste and extending water resources .  
For that reason , we reiterate our grave concern at the increasingly frequent transport of radioactive material and nuclear waste through areas of the high seas close to our exclusive economic zone .  
Glaciers are melting ; forests are retreating ; we are changing the seasons ; we are running out of fish in the sea ; we are poisoning our children with persistent organic pollutants ; and we are accumulating nuclear waste to the peril of future generations .  
However , despite improvements in legislative and institutional frameworks and the institution of mandatory requirements for environmental impact assessments for new tourism investments in some , small island developing States continue to face considerable difficulties in dealing with problems of waste management and pollution due to poor infrastructural , technological and human resource capacity .  
Given that many countries , particularly in the developing world , lack adequate institutional capacity in hazardous waste management and in monitoring illegal imports of chemical and hazardous wastes , there is an urgent need for strengthening national capacity for the effective management of such wastes .  
The Brazil / Norway Workshop on Consumption and Production Patterns ( Brasilia , November 1996 ) concluded , among other things , that the role of advertising and the media is critical ; that the international community should apply the resources of the media to induce behavioural changes to avoid waste , inefficient resource use and conspicuous consumption ; and that positive messages of how individuals can live in a sustainable manner were required , instead of encouraging ever-rising material consumption or exaggerating the likelihood of environmental disaster .  
Adopting all necessary legislative , administrative and technical measures to ensure the physical protection of nuclear material , nuclear fuel , radioactive products or waste , radioactive substances , nuclear installations and nuclear devices as well as protection against illegal or unauthorized access to them by third parties .  
Upon the completion of the proceedings connected with an act of nuclear terrorism , if it is considered feasible , any nuclear material , nuclear fuel , radioactive products or waste or any other radioactive substances as well as nuclear installations , nuclear explosive or radiation-dissemination devices , including homemade devices and / or their components or objects of which they are components shall be returned to the State party , to which they belong or which was the State of their origin .  
States parties shall not be required by this Convention to provide any information which they are not permitted to communicate pursuant to domestic legislation or which would jeopardize the security of the State concerned or the physical protection of nuclear material , nuclear fuel , radioactive products or waste , radioactive substances , nuclear installations , nuclear devices or their components or objects of which they are components .  
Although national legislation on the protection of the environment has been enacted in many countries , statutory provisions dealing with the protection of the environment were mostly spread through a whole array of legislation and regulations , mainly focusing on hazardous waste , water , soil and air pollution , trafficking in endangered species of flora and fauna , noise pollution and trafficking in nuclear substances , and contained in the various laws on these issues .  
Spain reported on initiatives to combat marine pollution , including the control and monitoring of maritime transport of pollutant products that may have an impact on the environment ; the prevention of pollution from ships ; the monitoring and control of industrial waste or waste from ships ; and active participation in the implementation of specific maritime safety plans in each port , taking into account current provisions including those of the National Regulation for the Admission , Handling and Storage of Hazardous Goods in Ports .  
The competent authorities shall do their utmost to ensure that the Authority shall be provided , on fair and equitable terms but in any case not less favourable than those accorded to the agencies of the Government , with necessary utilities and public services , including but not limited to electricity , water , gas , sewerage , collection of waste , fire protection and local transportation .  
The complex problems linked to overstocking , excessive donations , poor storage facilities and management , inadequate disposal or waste management capacity , vulnerability to insect plagues and changes in national policies have resulted in an alarming increase in outdated pesticide and chemicals stocks over the last two decades . 
In most countries with nuclear programmes , the preferred method for the disposal of long-lived radioactive waste is its long-term isolation in a system of multiple barriers located in deep and stable geological formations .  
The fact that a power company of Taiwan Province of China could attempt to export radioactive waste to a country where appropriate facilities are lacking , without being subject to any existing international regulatory mechanism , clearly testifies to the need to strengthen the current international regime controlling the transboundary movement of radioactive waste .  
Presidential commissions of inquiry have in recent years been appointed to investigate and report on alleged contraventions of laws and other control measures based on international conventions designed to combat such activities as the smuggling of and illegal trade in ivory and rhinoceros horn , the import and disposal of hazardous waste containing mercury and the import of hazardous waste containing cupric arsenic .  
In the health sector , United Nations observers regularly report an exceptionally serious deterioration in the health infrastructure : a high infant mortality rate and high rates of morbidity and mortality in general , poor and inadequate storage conditions for supplies , an unreliable supply of electricity and back-up generators , faulty or non-functioning air-conditioning , defective cold-storage , interrupted water supplies , broken / leaking sewage systems and non-functioning hospital waste disposal systems .  
Considerable efforts have been made everywhere in Africa to revitalize the social sector , minimize needless waste of human and natural resources , promote popular participation and democratic governance , focus world attention on the continent 's needs for a more supportive international economic environment , and reinforce efforts at conflict prevention and resolution .  
Where there is insufficient competition , the government may divide the work ( e.g . geographically ) between outside contractors and inside workforces , as is done for instance by the city of Bogota , Colombia , where solid waste collection is shared between public and private agencies , with a private firm made responsible for monitoring the operations of all the agencies . 2 Continued government provision of at least part of the service provides in-house knowledge of costs and technology changes and thereby some protection against inflated contracts ; 
Seven projects on modern techniques and technologies for the development of both surface and groundwater resources ; use of alternative sources of energy ; new and renewable energy technologies ; and improving the efficiency of resource use , minimizing waste and maximizing recycling and environmental protection ;  
This plan is responsible for all programmes related to desertification , surface and ground water pollution , atmospheric pollution , poor sanitation suffered by rural and urban peoples , poor management of industrial and household waste and population growth and its impact on urban sprawl .  
To the contrary , if shortsighted strategies and options are forced upon us , it can mean an ever-deteriorating situation combining the consequences of war , pollution and unconscionable industrial exploitation : the conspiracy of landmines and industrial waste overwhelming the land , the people , the fragile peace and our common Earth .  
These challenges shelter and housing and the need to address urbanization both impact disproportionately and very severely on hundreds of millions of poor and disadvantaged people in nations large and small people who , mostly but not in all cases , live in the developing countries of our world ; people who are huddled in vast urban slums or in rural shacks ; people who lack not just secure work , but also such basic necessities as clean water , sanitation , waste disposal , safe transportation and even the most minimal green spaces to call their own .  
We have to address as a matter of priority the three most immediate dangers identified by the Commission : the overexploitation of marine biological resources , the dumping of toxic waste and the harmful effects of global warming .  
We continue to be concerned at the threat to the fragile marine environment posed by the regular shipment of nuclear and other hazardous waste through the Caribbean Sea .  
The two major releases from surface and underground mining relevant to reprocessing and utilization are mineral wastes ( overburden and waste rock ) and contaminated waters ( acidic , metal-laden discharges from waste disposal sites and workings ) .  
Incineration , mainly of medical waste and combustible hazardous materials , has been practised widely in the region , but , it has not generally been efficient because of poor maintenance of plants , manpower shortage and improper choice of facilities .  
The Commission noted that , as the world has become more industrialized , there have been increasing environmental pressures such as harmful emissions and waste , which have had global , regional or local impacts .  
Develop a cooperation programme to address the concerns raised by maritime transport of nuclear and other waste , and to cooperate and coordinate in the relevant international fora to strengthen standards governing such transport and its safety .  
The difficulty in providing adequate health care , the continued practice of open drainage , the indiscriminate disposal of waste water and industrial effluents and rampant water pollution have resulted in the creation of mega-slums unsuitable for human living .  
Formulating policies favourable to the development in rural and poor urban areas of health programmes , including safe water supply , sanitation , and waste disposal , taking into account the specific needs of young women and young men for a healthy environment ;  
Some consider that the permanent nature of the organization is the source of unacceptable waste at a time when budgetary austerity is being imposed on all countries and at a stage in our economic history which is haunted by the spectre of crisis and unemployment among both poor and rich .  
There is an enormous annual turnover in markets for illegal goods , such as illegal drugs , protected wildlife , stolen works of art , illegal firearms , and nuclear and / or toxic waste , as well as for trafficking in human beings .  
The article states that United States and British forces fired more than 1-million depleted uranium rounds , weighing 315 tons , and that this was the first time that the toxic metal , a waste product left when natural uranium is refined to make weapons or fuel , was used in war .  
The employed person 's salary is augmented in case of work in conditions which are more difficult than normal for a particular job ( climate , noise , vibrations , irradiation , humidity , harmful gases , biologically harmful substances , physical strain , work with dirty materials , danger caused by tools or objects , means of transport , waste materials , electricity , explosions , heat , corrosive materials , etc . ) , which need to be made specific by special or individual collective agreements .  
This does not fit in with the traditional concept of the commercial money market or purchasing flexibility , and constitutes a senseless waste of Iraqi funds , for reasons linked to the mechanism used by the Security Council Committee established by resolution 661 ( 1990 ) for processing memorandum of understanding contracts .  
In all such modifications , the Commission shall take into account the state of the technology being developed , the processing system utilized , the value and potential use of any waste , the environmental effects of the activities , the economic and resource data , and the international need for the mineral resources .  
Cuba is aware of the possible dangers attendant upon any use of radioactive waste , which would be tantamount to radiological war , and of the effects of such use on national , regional and international security , and especially the security of the developing countries ; and also of the inherent threat to the preservation of the environment .  
As mentioned above , in most situations of realizing human rights in a particular country , there is so much waste and inefficient use of domestic resources that substantial progress can be made in improving the realization of most human rights even within the existing resources , which can be augmented by international cooperation for which a call has been given explicitly in the Declaration on the Right to Development .  
The two human rights workers were arrested in December 1998 in connection with a popular protest , which turned violent , against the secret import and dumping by local authorities of industrial toxic waste .  They were accused of leading an unlawful demonstration and incitement to violence .  
Singapores three-year technical assistance programme for sustainable development which was intended to help developing countries through the provision of training in areas such as urban environmental management , environmental technology , solid waste management , water supply engineering , urban planning and transport management , had so far benefitted more than 1,000 people from 80 countries .  
In its concern for a safe environment , the Council gave instructions for the creation of an effective mechanism to coordinate the action of ministries and other relevant agencies at the national level in each member State in taking proper measures to dispose of medical waste and process radioactive waste and also to coordinate the trans-boundary movement of hazardous waste .  
The Minister calls attention to the fact that the United Nations Compensation Commission has been concealing from Iraq information relating to claims , and he urges you to intervene with a view to having the Commission follow the proper legal procedures established by international law and judicial precedent so as to protect the assets of the Iraqi people from unwarranted dissipation and waste .  
In view of the fact that we have received no replies over the past years , we appeal to you once more , in accordance with your legal responsibilities , to intervene in this matter in order to have the Commission follow the proper legal procedures established by international law and judicial precedent so as to protect the assets of the Iraqi people from unwarranted dissipation and waste .  
Ideal or existing socialism , on the other hand , is seen as allowing consciously planned rational development , which does away with such capitalist flaws as recurring crises , waste and unemployment ; it fosters social equality and may promote a higher form of liberty where a united society comes to master its own progress .  
Transnational organized crime includes tax evasion , the forgery of clothes and electronic equipment , fraud against international financial institutions , unfair competition on international markets , industrial espionage , the import and export of protected plants and animals , trafficking in works of art and the illegal dumping of toxic industrial waste .  
The Government stressed that the people of the South required reparation and justice for impunity , neo-colonial wars , the extermination of populations and peoples , the defilement of their economic , cultural and natural heritage by countries of the North , the decapitalization of the developing countries charged with paying external debts and the dumping of toxic waste in their territories , to cite only a few examples .  
The activities of the Agency in that area have been strengthened by the adoption of additional standards for the safe management and transportation of radioactive waste and for the security of nuclear power stations , which were approved by the Board of Governors , as well as by the adoption of resolutions in the General Conference on the radiological protection of patients , the safety of transport of radioactive materials and the security of radiation sources .  
Regardless of its considerable benefits , nuclear energy is still problematic in one particular aspect : spent fuel and nuclear waste , its interim storage and final repository , especially in small States with limited industrial and scientific capabilities .  
This year such issues include the dumping of nuclear waste and other toxic substances , the regional seas programme of the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , the increasing threat to shipping from piracy and armed robbery at sea , the importance of enhancing the safety of navigation and the continued work of the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization towards a convention on the protection of the underwater cultural heritage .  
Because of their inability to adequately guard their maritime area , which is linked to their low level of technological development , the States of the zone are powerless to deal with harmful activities carried out in their maritime area , including the dumping of radioactive and toxic waste and illegal fishing , which is often carried out by vessels sailing under two flags .  
Motivated by the need to protect the health and safety or our population and our environment , we believe that these efforts should continue , thus promoting the adoption of mechanisms that will provide sufficient guarantees to all the States concerned that the strictest safety measures will be applied in the international maritime transport of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel , and that any damage resulting from accidents in connection with such operations will be made good .  
For the island States , whether in the Caribbean or the Pacific , the international maritime transportation of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuels is a real security threat , all the more serious because most of those potentially affected are small countries lacking the resources to cope with a crisis of such magnitude , caused by big countries and by technologies that those small countries do not control .  
The need for universal commitment to such preventive measures has become more pressing due to the isolation and oceanic location of some small island developing States and their total dependence on a marine and limited terrestrial base , which render them highly vulnerable to contamination from such waste .  
Indeed , the issues of climate change , soil erosion , global warming , sea level rise , coastal and marine resources , natural and environmental disasters , biodiversity resources , waste management and freshwater resources are among those that all developing countries face , in particular small island nations , in an increasingly competitive global economy .  
Support for gender-specific research on the short - and long-term effects of the occupational and environmental health risks of work , including work in the formal and informal sector , performed by both women and men , and take effective legal and other measures to reduce these risks , including risks in the workplace , in the environment and from harmful chemicals , including pesticides , radiation , toxic waste and other such hazards that affect womens health ;  
Governments at all levels , the private sector and other major groups as defined in Agenda 21 are urged to cooperate in developing waste collection systems and disposal facilities , and developing programmes for prevention , minimization and recycling of waste , to safeguard and improve the quality of life in human settlements and coastal regions in all countries , especially in developing countries .  
In 1989 , the ecological organization Greenpeace had revealed the existence of a letter of intent signed by a German waste-processing firm , Pick Up Problems , and these dignitaries in Paraguay , who were acting in a personal capacity , for the export of 1 , 200 , 000 tons of waste which were to be processed in the Chaco region , where there were plans to build an incineration plant .  
The first instance of the illegal entry of dangerous waste reported by the Brazilian authorities is that of four containers holding 68 , 332 kg of toxic wastes ( copper , zinc and other heavy metals ) which arrived in the coastal port of Santos ( State of So Paulo ) in December 1993 .  
The analysis of the main trends and features of movements of toxic waste and dangerous products in the Special Rapporteurs previous reports to the Commission on Human Rights showed that , over the last decade , the region of Latin America and the Caribbean was tending to become a favourite target area for the illegal traffic in these products and wastes .  
The Basel Convention and the national laws of the countries visited regard the illegal traffic in dangerous waste as a criminal act liable to punishment under criminal law , regardless of any civil or administrative penalties which may be imposed on persons found guilty of such trafficking .  
A number of people stressed that incidents which had come to light often thanks to the watchfulness of local associations and NGOs like Greenpeace International , might represent only a tiny percentage of the waste and products which are banned from import , but which are smuggled into the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean and buried there illegally .  
The most serious worries are still the excessive or uncontrolled use of chemicals and toxic agricultural products and the harmful effects on the environment and health of the activities of foreign transplants and transnational companies , which are taking advantage of liberalization and deregulation to employ products and substances which are prohibited in the developed countries and to transfer highly polluting industries and those which produce large quantities of dangerous waste .  
The unique social , economic and environmental characteristics of small island developing States , such as high population density , relative isolation , limited availability of land space , and paucity of human and financial resources , limit the range of possible options for the sound management of waste .  
The project consists of two components : ( a ) a Jakarta component to achieve better waste management through both solid and liquid monitoring activities , educational activities for students and local people , community-based waste recycling and composting activities ; ( b ) a Pulau Seribu islands component with coral reef monitoring activities , scientific research , educational activities for local fishermen and alternative income activities for women and fishermen .  
Most small island developing States would derive tremendous benefits from the introduction of environmentally sustainable technological innovations in the areas of the development of renewable energy , freshwater and marine resources ; telecommunications and information technology ; waste management and natural disaster mitigation ; and sustainable land resources management .  
Its dangerous waste control regulations , drawn up on the basis of the provisions of the Basel Convention embody the technical and legal principles applicable to the environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes in the light of current programmes and policies , and prohibit the import of any type of waste .  
The final resolution of the Conference stated that it is crucial to ensure access to all relevant information for the public , to involve local and regional authorities and the public in decision _ making and to seek public confidence in principles that govern the safety of repositories and in waste management programmes ( for the proceedings of the Conference , see the Council of Europe series Studies and Texts , No . 57 ) .  
The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that a number of confirmed cases of illegal traffic in toxic wastes have not been solved in a satisfactory manner , either from the standpoint of the obligation to seek out and prosecute those allegedly responsible or of the duty to assist the victim countries in accordance with the principle of returning such waste to the country of origin , if known , or if not , to other States capable of managing it in an environmentally sound manner .  
The major interests at the international level are the prevention of marine pollution from land-based sources and pollution by dumping of waste , protection of the sensitive environment of the Arctic Ocean , and exchange of scientific information on the oceans and its living resources .  
In developing countries , such corruption may undermine economic development through a number of related factors : the misuse or waste of international aid ; unfinished development projects ; discovery and replacement of corrupt politicians , leading to political instability ; and living standards remaining below the countrys potential .  
While experts are confident that geological disposal is safe , technologically feasible and environmentally responsible , the public at large remains skeptical , and the volume of highlevel waste continues to build .  
CARICOM member States have for many years expressed growing concern at the increasing threat to our marine environment posed by pollution and by the transportation of hazardous and nuclear waste through the Caribbean Sea .  
Most countries declared their intention to create an effective and comprehensive safety net , accompanied by efforts to control costs and waste , thereby leading to a more efficient use of resources .  
It still dumps nuclear waste in the occupied Arab territories and continues its programme of developing all kinds of weapons of mass destruction , biological or chemical , because of the worlds inaction and the double standards that the great Powers apply .  
The continued neglect of the urban waste problem will inevitably have dire consequence with regional and global implications in the not too distant future .  
They are compounded by political instability , waste and mismanagement of resources , corruption and lack of transparency , which have been diverting the scarce financial resources away from legitimate expenditures , including investment in social development .  
In such areas waste is visible , and downstream effects include contamination of limited groundwater lenses in highly populated and industrial areas and unhealthy inshore waters .  
In the broader context of nuclearweaponfree zones , Chile attached special importance to the regulation of the international maritime transport of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel according to the highest international safety standards .  
Of crucial importance was an adequate national technical , human and regulatory infrastructure in nuclear safety , radiological protection and waste management for the peaceful application of nuclear energy .  
In connection with the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , the vital importance of security in the international maritime transport of radioactive waste is quite evident .  
The States members of MERCOSUR and the associated countries considered that the strictest safety requirements should be observed in the international maritime transport of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel , which posed great danger to the marine environment and the health of populations in affected areas .  
Adoption of the clean production strategy in its widest sense : This involves the prudent exploitation of natural resources ; avoidance of the use of hazardous substances ; increased efficiency of the design and production processes ; reduced emissions , runoffs and wastes , whether in production or end-use , to levels the environment can support ; environmentally sound waste management ; and consideration of the modification of patterns of consumption that have given rise to a societal demand for a particular commodity or service .  
Adoption of measures to ensure effective Arab participation in achievements in the field of advanced technology for the improvement of the Arab environment : Increasing efforts are today being made to achieve important and promising advances in addressing chronic environmental issues connected with meeting the natural resource requirements of development projects , and especially their renewable resource requirements , with reducing pollution levels in production and end-use , with improving the effectiveness of waste recycling and with safer waste disposal .  
Quality of life is declining in urban areas , with losses of housing and of human lives caused by erosion , siltation and flooding ; general insalubrity owing to the lack of appropriate solid and liquid waste management systems ; severe overcrowding caused both by the population explosion and by uncontrollable concentrations of population ; physical and chemical degradation of land ; pollution of all kinds ; and above all , deforestation on the periphery of urban areas . 
The aforementioned Act , in chapter IV , article 153 , provides that the importation of hazardous and radioactive waste requires the prior and express authorization of the Ministry of Science , Technology and the Environment , meaning that such importation will have to comply with existing international recommendations and national regulations and should be for socially justifiable purposes .  
To date , conventions have been developed covering the safety of power reactors , radioactive waste and spent fuel management , early notification and assistance in case of a nuclear accident or radiological emergency , and the physical protection of nuclear material .  
It is no secret to Member States that it is dangerous to dump any form of radioactive waste , which could be used in radiological warfare , as well as having other harmful effects on regional and international peace , especially in developing countries .  
Exerting greater and more positive efforts towards achieving integration between environmental and health strategies , especially in terms of providing safe drinking water and food , treating waste-water and solid waste , controlling or limiting the potential dangers of chemicals , various types of pollution and genetically modified substances ; and achieving nuclear safety in the Arab region ;
