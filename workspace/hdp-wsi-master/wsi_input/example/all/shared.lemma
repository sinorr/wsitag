The United Nations should promote regional information-sharing among local and regional governments - e.g . , through regional United Nations workshops and seminars for regional government executives and through the actual involvement of financial managers in the budgetary process and simulation programmes .

While it is true that responsibility for social development lies , first and foremost , with States themselves , which have the right and duty to implement appropriate policies to achieve that objective , it is no less true that this responsibility must be assumed , in a spirit of solidarity , by the international community as a whole , not just because of moral and political requirements that are broadly shared today , but also because of the enlightened self-interest of us all .
