Judging by its narrative style , the report apparently intended to adopt a purely objective method , such as by stating that " China 's basic national aim is to become a powerful , modern , and unified prosperous country " ; China 's security strategy " is aimed at preserving what it sees as its sovereignty interests in Taiwan , the South China Sea , and other peripheral areas , protecting its economic interests , and also promoting regional stability " .  
Sometimes maybe only units of a certain armed service are needed , but usually combined forces including active units and reserve forces are needed " .  " In the meantime , the skills and resources provided by multinational forces , regional organizations , international bodies , non-government organizations , voluntary organizations , and private organizations should be adequately made use of , if possible " , to ensure that the US army 's " non-war military operation " will achieve the intended objective .  
Just as some economists have analyzed , through the practice of proactive financial policies , China has withstood the impacts of the Asian financial crisis , achieved the sustained and relatively rapid national economic growth , created favorable conditions for promoting reform , exploiting the existing production capability , mitigating the contradiction with regard to employment , and maintaining social stability , and concentrated its energies on constructing a number of infrastructure facilities and accomplishing some major projects which were intended , but were unable , to be carried out for years .  
Since its inauguration , the new US administration has refused to engage in self-examination to discover its errors , become more unscrupulous , refused to implement the Kyoto Protocol , persistently intended to develop its national missile defense system , and delayed without proper reasons in paying UN membership fees for a long time .  Consequently , the United States has been badly discredited in the international community .  
For example , a belligerent will have to concentrate forces for a " move " aimed at forcing the enemy to submit to its own will and intention , through releasing a large amount of powerful information .  A belligerent will also have to release information intended to highlight its own strong points and the enemy 's weaknesses , sow discord between the enemy troops , and unleash a psychological attack on the enemy , thus putting psychological pressure on the enemy , weakening the enemy 's will , and " winning a war without fighting " .  
This method of attempting to wreck and even wipe out its will to resist by striking at the psychology of a country 's top leadership stratum should be described as psychological warfare at the strategic level , which is intended to eliminate at a small price potential obstacles that may arise to counter western countries such as the United States and Britain , and reach their aim of dominating the world at will .  
The questions set in the polls of the " Ministry of Foreign Affairs " did point out that " the existing system and way of life will be retained . "  However , keeping in mind the fact that Taiwan is an island and its people are afraid of losing their freedom of external connections , they emphasized that " Taiwan will not have any diplomatic power from now on , " which was also intended as a threat .  
Moreover , the Taiwan authorities have repeatedly used the money earned by onerous toil of the ordinary people to buy advanced weapons from foreign countries , advocated " a decisive battle offshore , " and intended to form a military alliance against the mainland with the United States and Japan .  
In fact , the United States has never intended to make Taiwan an " independent " country in the true sense of the word .  Taiwan is a mere pawn on the US strategic chessboard and an " unsinkable aircraft carrier " deployed in the Far East Pacific region by the United States . Whether the United States will retain or abandon this pawn is determined not by its consideration of Taiwan people 's interests but solely by the consideration of its own national interests .  
Sources said that the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone had originally intended to celebrate the 20th anniversary of its establishment with fanfare .  Not only was a preparatory committee established , but television stations and other media from various parts of the country were invited to go to Shenzhen to make special reports that " suit their own needs . "  At the same time , it also submitted a " plan for celebrations " to the State Council and expressed the hope that central leaders would travel south to attend the celebrations as they did 10 years ago .  
As a matter of fact , we did not make any substantive adjustment to the tax preferential policies toward foreign investors .  In 1997 , we intended to adjust the tax referential policy in terms of import equipment , but owing to the changes in macroeconomic situation such as the Asian financial crisis , we suspended the policy adjustment .  
As for the purchase of submarines from the United States , a naval officer indicated that , if the United States reopens its closed production lines to produce submarines powered by conventional diesel engines , the costs of the submarines [ that Taiwan intended to buy ] would be substantially higher .  He said political factors are also important issues the United States has to consider before it decides whether to sell submarines to Taiwan . He said in the future the United States might assist Taiwan to build its own submarines by providing Taiwan with technical support .  
I suggest that while stepping up in-depth or meticulous education or transformation work , the government should hold higher the law as a sharp sword ; should more severely crack down on a small number of die-hard elements of " Falungong , " who have plotted or organized activities intended to create a disturbance ; and should firmly prevent such people from fanning the flames of disorder or sabotaging a situation of stability and unity , which we have built with hard efforts .

" The dragon 's main colours - gold , purple , orange and blue - are intended to contrast with the green background of the venue and to herald success on earth .  It is an impressive sight to behold and a great photo opportunity for both local residents as well as tourists , " the spokesman added .  
Jointly organised by the Home Affairs Department , the Heung Yee Kuk and the South China Morning Post , the Director of Home Affairs , Mrs Shelley Lau , said : " The Most Beautified Village Contest was intended not just to encourage contesting villages to carry out certain superficial improvements to their environment .  Instead , it is aimed more at effecting long-term improvements with considerable stock attached to the village 's greening activities , maintenance and preservation of its historical relics , and the ambience of the village , apart from general environmental improvements . "  
In two of the cases detected by the TTF , traders declared in the import documents that the imported goods were for local consumption , whereas in fact the goods had been entirely manufactured in Mainland China , intended for export to quota restrained countries under false claim to Hong Kong origin .  
A " non-immunity " clause is normally included in Ordinances establishing a corporation or other body which is empowered to perform public or semi-public functions but which is intended to operate independently of the Government . The " non-immunity " clause makes it clear that the body is independent and ensures that it is treated in law as an ordinary private body .  
1 .  High-stake public examination for the purpose of allocating S1 places is not necessary during the nine years of free and universal basic education .  Empirical evidence has proven that selection-oriented public assessments , even if they are not intended to require prior preparation , would inevitably hamper students ' learning experience and make primary education examination-driven .  This would in turn hinder the all-round development of students ; and  
According to the information released , the EU decided to temporarily suspend the import of all Mainland China 's products of animal origin intended for human consumption or for use in animal feed with effect from 30 January 2002 .  This decision was made in the light of an inspection report on the control of chemical residues in live animals and animal products in the Mainland compiled by the EU 's Food and Veterinary Office . The main products being suspended include honey , rabbit meat , poultry and crustacean food such as shrimps and prawns .

In addition , the Pharmacy and Poisons Board proposes to relax the control of Clobetasone butyrate when contained in preparations intended for external application only at not more than 0.05% so that its sale does not require the support of a prescription but still has to be sold by authorised sellers of poisons under the direct supervision of registered pharmacists .  
He suggested that for the avoidance of any doubt , it may well be considered desirable to state generally in the new law that nothing in it is intended to contravene Articles 27 or 39 of the Basic Law , and that restrictions apply only in so far as they are lawful pursuant to those provisions of the Basic Law . It was Mr Pannick 's opinion that none of the provisions set out in the Consultation Document are objectionable as a matter of legal principle . 
The fine level for the relevant offences was set in 1977 and has not been adjusted since then .  Similar offences in other ordinances attract higher fines than those in the ordinance .  It was considered appropriate to raise the fine to reflect the intended deterrent effect , the spokesman explained .  
Falling within this area are coastal areas mainly below the 20-metre contour .  This zone is intended to conserve and retain the natural coastlines and the sensitive coastal natural environment including attractive geological features , physical landform or areas of high landscape , scenic or ecological value .  
I wrote to Ch'iao Kuan-hua pointing out that this analogy proved the opposite of what was intended . Ireland had been under English rule longer than Taiwan had been under Chinese rule but had become independent . What the argument actually showed was that the Chinese Communists were more imperialistic than the extreme British conservatives who opposed Irish independence . What Yeh Chien-ying 's proposals try to do is to make a concession to Western feelings by claiming the Chinese Communist Party would be satisfied with purely nominal unification .  
The former begins with a lively waltz , projecting a fresh exuberance . Its short segments include literature appreciation , public health lectures , and general legal topics , all of which are intended to relate to daily life and inspire self-improvement .  
The " superstar " art objects that go for astronomical prices are almost all the focus of intense promotion by auction houses intended to stir up a competitive psychology among buyers . Many less ballyhooed works of nearly equal artistic value , overlooked in the commercial furor , sell for quite pedestrian prices .  
The pestle music of the Bunun , which is played before the rice harvest , was originally intended to attract people from neighboring villages to come and share in the crop . Rice is n't planted much any more , but the performance still shows the tribe 's solidarity and generous spirit of sharing , qualities worth cherishing by indigenous people and outsiders alike .  
The tour group had made advanced reservations for soft sleepers from Huhhot City to Peking . Suddenly they were confronted with the news that all of their tickets had been cancelled . Upon inquiring as to the reason , they discovered that the very train they intended to board had been requisitioned by a high ranking official of the communist party ; naturally , none of the soft sleeper cars could fit other passengers .  
Passports are intended to serve as personal documents to use abroad for identification and proof of nationality . But because of unusual circumstances in the nation 's foreign relations , the history of the ROC passport over the last 40 years sets it apart . Now the document , worth tens of thousands of US dollars , is coveted by international thieves .  
The Mu-Kuang Rehabilitation Center is now located in Tungshan Rural Township , Ilan County , on a 4300 m2 site .

Shenghsing Railway Station : The highest point on western Taiwan 's mountain railway line . The structure contains no metal nails . The Eight Trigrams design fixed to the beams is intended to ward off evil . Between Shenghsing and Tai-an , the railway passes over bridges and through tunnels , past green farmland and countryside , with scenic spots such as the Yutengping river valley and the " broken bridge " at Lungteng , which was split in two by a great earthquake over 50 years ago .  
The secret of what meaning Liu Bowen really intended his poem to convey went with him to his grave ; but many believers did go to Tienhoukung Temple in Lukang to ask how the temple oracle could have been so mistaken . The temple elders came out in person to make it clear that " this was probably just hearsay or even a hoax , we do n't think the divination was made according to the proper practice , so of course its credibility is doubtful . "  
When we chose the book labels as gifts , we simply thought they had an old-fashioned elegance and would be nice to collect . We never thought that the negative side of their content would lead to a misunderstanding . Because our paper-cut stories are mainly intended to be amusing and tell a story , many of them have a negative or ironic side to their meaning . This is true , for instance , of stories in recent issues such as " Both on the Losing End , " and " No Silver Buried Here . "  
Although the intended targets of sanctions were countries that over-exploited resources held in international waters , the amendment included a provision to the effect that whenever the secretary of commerce or secretary of the interior learns of trade or other forms of exchange , by foreign nationals , that directly or indirectly harms international conservation programs for endangered or threatened species , they should submit certification of this fact to the president .  
Taiwan had long hoped to join CITES and play a larger role in international conservation , but had always been hindered by political factors . International conservation groups were therefore " disappointed " by the fact that one of the reasons CITES left Yemen and South Korea off the list of countries for sanctions was that they intended to join the organization , without yet showing concrete improvements , and many countries confided that they were outraged on Taiwan 's behalf .  
The cat 's owner wanted to invoke the " vicious dog law " to have Lucy destroyed , but Lucy 's owner held that the law was intended to punish dogs whose bad deeds had hurt humans , and was not applicable to conflicts between animals . Fur Ball 's owner , however , claimed personal suffering as the result of Fur Ball 's cruel death , and thus argued that Lucy had caused injury to a person , making the vicious dog law applicable to this case .

The central level reform issues came up first . Even before the conference began , the KMT 's dual executive mixed system idea was being attacked on all sides . Skeptics argued that the proposal was aimed at expanding presidential power and establishing a firm foundation for the vice-president serving concurrently as premier . Some boldly declared that the proposal was simply intended to pave the way for Lee Teng-hui to run for re-election .  
It continued : " Chinese emperors collected these works over 11 centuries . Some of the pieces predate them-the elaborate wine vessel from the mid-ninth century BC , for example , and the curious reddish bronze vat , or liang , from AD 9 that was intended to enforce a new set of volumetric standards . In complexity , both works are years ahead of their Western equivalents . Nor was there a Western equivalent of the enormous workshops that , in centuries to come , filled these emperors ' warehouses . "  
" There does not need to be a conflict between the needs of urban development and historical building preservation , " says Tseng Shu-cheng , an assistant professor in Tamkang University 's Architecture Department . Preserving historic buildings or spaces is not intended to stop time and halt development . On the contrary it is intended to use their historical essence to make a new and creative use of the space .  
In the first half of October , ROC Vice President Lien Chan paid a visit to Europe . After his itinerary was revealed , it inevitably met with intense pressure from Beijing . The result was that this journey , originally to have covered northern , central and southern Europe and intended to build friendly foreign relations with the three countries of Iceland , Austria and Spain , lost Spain as a destination .  
In addition , a point that is particularly scorned is that the normally jovial program hosts look unnatural and out of place when doing these emotive segments . Variety shows still are played mainly for laughs and entertainment . Inserting these segments is a gimmick intended to add drama . The hosts , stuck between solemnity and silliness , often look embarrassed and uncertain what to do next .  
Although hotel chairman Lin Shih-jung has already stated that under the present circumstances he has no choice but to close down the hotel , the incident has drawn attention to the illegal use of mountain slope land and to the issue of safety in the tourism industry . This in turn has raised concerns over the proposed construction of a hotel at Matsao in Yangmingshan National Park , since the intended site also lies on a seismic fault line .  
NHI was initially intended to use a global budgeting system , but this system has proved to be too difficult to implement . However , according to Yang Han-chuan , the BNHI is now working on a pilot program to be tested with dental care in the near future . Chuang Yi-chou says , " The mechanism is a good one , but the system was designed with the whole nation operating off of one budget .  
ISO 14000 is a set of management standards intended to encourage firms to build environmental management systems . This means protecting against pollution , making economical use of resources in the production process , manufacturing green products and working to improve the quality of the overall environment by making continuous efforts to improve every aspect of their production processes .  
If you can get them breathing and their hearts beating again , you 've always got a shot at saving them . " But the use of CPR , which was originally intended for saving lives in medical emergencies , has been commandeered by the extend-life-at-all-costs philosophy of the modern medical era . Whether or not their illnesses are curable , if patients can be made to live another day , another hour , or even another minute , all efforts are made to save them .  
He had originally intended to locate his capital in Jiaozaitu ( part of present-day Taichung City ) because of its convenient location halfway between north and south on Taiwan 's western plain .  
Taiwanese companies were among the major investors . In 2000 , mainland policymakers turned their attention to developing China 's western regions , and the culturally rich ancient capital Xi'an was anointed as the site of one of China 's four future " Silicon Valleys , " in addition to Beijing 's Zhongguancun , Shanghai 's Pudong , and the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone . These four centers each have their own strengths and weaknesses , and are intended to both compete and cooperate with each other .  
One area of particular difficulty has been the decision to promote the simultaneous learning of local and international languages , intended both to strengthen local consciousness and as a response to global trends . This approach has dramatically increased the pressure on children , leaving many unsure about the relative importance of different languages .  
At that time the MOE had just launched its new " nine-year integrated curriculum , " which reset the first year of English-language study at the fifth grade effective in 2001 . In order to fill the spaces created by the expansion , the MOE sent out a call for qualified English teachers , ultimately resulting in the recruiting of 3500 trainees . However , just two years later more than 1500 teachers , nearly half of the group intended to be the color guard of the new primary English-language instruction , had fallen by the wayside .  
Going from creative ideas to practical applications takes very pragmatic skills , like patient experimentation and testing , requiring total focus and concentration . As the classical poet Tao Yuan-ming declared , " When swept by a thought , I gladly forget to eat . " And Thomas Edison is said to have once absent-mindedly cooked his own watch rather than the egg he intended .  
The biggest drawback of this type of treatment is that it takes two to three years , which is more than most people can put up with . What 's more , desensitization is also a risky procedure , because allergy shots can in some cases have the opposite effect to that intended , and provoke asthma , allergic rhinitis , and even anaphylactic shock . Therefore , unless they suffer from a severe case of allergy , most people opt to wage a protracted war of resistance or even to live in peaceful coexistence with their allergy .  
A number of seminars and discussion forums intended for large audiences were organized , aiming to enhance popular understanding of foreign direct investment , its developmental potential , and the relevant policy issues .

When the founding fathers of the 1945 Charter forged close structural links between the Court and the United Nations , they obviously intended that the Court should be fully integrated into the new system for the peaceful settlement of disputes that had just been devised , but they did not in any way wish to deprive the Court of the autonomy indispensable to the sound administration of justice .  
The Agenda is consistent because , learning from the failure of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990 , it was designed as an operational whole in which the respective responsibilities and commitments of Africa and the international community were clearly spelled out in what has rightly been called a partnership contract intended to lay the groundwork for lasting African economic and social recovery before the end of the present decade .

In the Mission 's view , the laying of mines in places where people work , live or circulate constitutes a violation of this commitment and of the principles of international humanitarian law , since it puts the civilian population at unnecessary risk and there is no proportionality between the intended military objective and the foreseeable harm that may be caused to that population .

In the case of an emerging widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population , the intent clause of the last element indicates that this mental element is satisfied if the perpetrator intended to further such an attack .  
Residual effects of regional conflicts and of the tension that marked the cold war have led to an unprecedented increase in the illicit traffic in small arms and light weapons , whose intended recipients are mainly developing countries .  
In the case of an emerging widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population , the intent clause of the last element indicates that this mental element is satisfied if the perpetrator intended to further such an attack .  
Although the sanctions were designed to specifically target the illegal activities of Liberias elite , and not intended to harm the lives of ordinary Liberians , the report of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) has confirmed the bleak humanitarian situation of the population in Liberia .  
The measures provided for under subparagraphs ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) of the present decree do not apply to supplies of non-lethal military equipment intended solely for humanitarian or protective purposes , related technical assistance or training approved in advance by the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1267 ( 1999 ) or to protective clothing , including flak jackets and military helmets imported into Afghanistan by United Nations personnel , representatives of the media and the staff of humanitarian organizations for their personal use only .  
Concern was expressed that , depending on the decisions to be made by the Working Group with respect to articles 2 and 13 , the remainder of the draft provisions might need to be re-examined to avoid creating a situation where the standard set by the uniform rules would apply equally to electronic signatures that ensured a high level of security and to low-value certificates that might be used in the context of electronic communications that were not intended to carry significant legal effect .  
His delegation understood that the Secretariat intended to submit a revised budget estimate based on the priorities for the coming months , as identified by the new Special Representative of the Secretary-General , and on the timing and budgetary implications of the forthcoming Kosovo-wide elections .  
In order to achieve economic development , the Government intended to apply strict fiscal and budgetary measures , holding inflation at about 3 per cent , enhancing the competitiveness of the domestic economy and improving the business environment so as to promote the development of the private sector .  
The framework law should include provisions on its purpose ; the targets or goals to be achieved and the time frame to be set for the achievement of those targets ; the means by which the purpose could be achieved described in broad terms , in particular the intended collaboration with civil society and the private sector and with international organizations ; institutional responsibility for the process ; and the national mechanisms for its monitoring , as well as possible recourse procedures .  
The main recommendation , intended to free the executive heads to focus more on strategic policy issues and to enable the system to respond more effectively and in a timely manner to major international developments , was the establishment of two high-level committees on policy and programme issues and management issues , respectively .  
While programmes intended to draw foreign investment , such as those involving the creation of economic industrial zones , have the advantage of encouraging economic growth in developing countries , they are accompanied by considerable social costs , involving , for example , massive violations of the fundamental rights of employees , who pay dearly for them .  
The Peacekeeping Best Practices Unit will be considerably strengthened and is intended to be at the heart of a new system by which the Organization learns from its peacekeeping experience , developing policies , procedures and related operational tools that are incorporated into the planning and conduct of both ongoing and future missions .  
The application of such laws , which are intended to restrict the access of the targeted sovereign States and Members of the United Nations to markets , capital , technology and investment in order to exert pressure upon them to change their political and economic orientation is a flagrant violation of the principles of international law , the Charter of the United Nations and numerous other resolutions of the General Assembly .  
This strategy is designed to be consistent with existing treaties , protocols and resolutions relevant to mine action , including , but not limited to , the anti-personnel mine ban treaty , the Convention on certain conventional weapons and its Protocols , the 1949 Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols of 1977 , the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the standard rules for the disabled . 6 The strategy is intended to assist Member States to fulfil their international obligations and to support the universalization of relevant international instruments . 
It is time that the necessary political will is displayed by those countries whose ambiguous positions have led the Conference on Disarmament to its current comatose state , so that the Conference can be activated to fulfil its intended role as the single multilateral negotiating forum on disarmament .  
Secondly , while the actual payments in 2001 might well exceed the amount assessed during the year , it was troubling to note that there would still be almost $ 1.8-billion in unpaid assessments by years end half of which was owed by one State , which regarded a substantial part of that outstanding amount as contested arrears and seemed to be in no hurry to announce when it intended to finish paying its debt . 
The new format , which was intended to reflect an approach that was more qualitative than quantitative , set forth the objectives around which each programme had been designed , as well as expected accomplishments , indicators of achievement and external factors that could affect the level of success in meeting those expectations .  
In addition to these personal aids , the State also runs a scheme of building aids , which are intended for public contractors ( such as the low cost housing fund , the national society for low cost housing and the communes ) or private contractors ( such as non-profit making companies contributing to broader subsidized housing programmes ) .  
Emphasizes that adjustments are intended to provide an incentive for Parties included in Annex I to provide complete and accurate annual greenhouse gas inventories prepared in accordance with the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance and any good practice guidance adopted by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol .

Decides that the measures imposed by subparagraphs and above shall not apply to supplies of non-lethal military equipment intended solely for humanitarian or protective use , and related technical assistance or training , as approved in advance by the Committee established by paragraph 14 below ;  
For a public official or any other person , the soliciting or accepting , directly or indirectly , of any undue advantage for himself or herself or for another person , through the abuse of his or her real or supposed influence with a view to obtaining from an administration or public authority of the State Party any undue advantage or any favourable decision for himself or herself or for any other person , whether or not the influence is exerted or whether or not the supposed influence leads to the intended result . 
Judging by its narrative style , the report apparently intended to adopt a purely objective method , such as by stating that " China 's basic national aim is to become a powerful , modern , and unified prosperous country " ; China 's security strategy " is aimed at preserving what it sees as its sovereignty interests in Taiwan , the South China Sea , and other peripheral areas , protecting its economic interests , and also promoting regional stability " .  
Sometimes maybe only units of a certain armed service are needed , but usually combined forces including active units and reserve forces are needed " .  " In the meantime , the skills and resources provided by multinational forces , regional organizations , international bodies , non-government organizations , voluntary organizations , and private organizations should be adequately made use of , if possible " , to ensure that the US army 's " non-war military operation " will achieve the intended objective .  
Just as some economists have analyzed , through the practice of proactive financial policies , China has withstood the impacts of the Asian financial crisis , achieved the sustained and relatively rapid national economic growth , created favorable conditions for promoting reform , exploiting the existing production capability , mitigating the contradiction with regard to employment , and maintaining social stability , and concentrated its energies on constructing a number of infrastructure facilities and accomplishing some major projects which were intended , but were unable , to be carried out for years .  
Since its inauguration , the new US administration has refused to engage in self-examination to discover its errors , become more unscrupulous , refused to implement the Kyoto Protocol , persistently intended to develop its national missile defense system , and delayed without proper reasons in paying UN membership fees for a long time .  Consequently , the United States has been badly discredited in the international community .  
For example , a belligerent will have to concentrate forces for a " move " aimed at forcing the enemy to submit to its own will and intention , through releasing a large amount of powerful information .  A belligerent will also have to release information intended to highlight its own strong points and the enemy 's weaknesses , sow discord between the enemy troops , and unleash a psychological attack on the enemy , thus putting psychological pressure on the enemy , weakening the enemy 's will , and " winning a war without fighting " .  
This method of attempting to wreck and even wipe out its will to resist by striking at the psychology of a country 's top leadership stratum should be described as psychological warfare at the strategic level , which is intended to eliminate at a small price potential obstacles that may arise to counter western countries such as the United States and Britain , and reach their aim of dominating the world at will .  
The questions set in the polls of the " Ministry of Foreign Affairs " did point out that " the existing system and way of life will be retained . "  However , keeping in mind the fact that Taiwan is an island and its people are afraid of losing their freedom of external connections , they emphasized that " Taiwan will not have any diplomatic power from now on , " which was also intended as a threat .  
Moreover , the Taiwan authorities have repeatedly used the money earned by onerous toil of the ordinary people to buy advanced weapons from foreign countries , advocated " a decisive battle offshore , " and intended to form a military alliance against the mainland with the United States and Japan .  
In fact , the United States has never intended to make Taiwan an " independent " country in the true sense of the word .  Taiwan is a mere pawn on the US strategic chessboard and an " unsinkable aircraft carrier " deployed in the Far East Pacific region by the United States . Whether the United States will retain or abandon this pawn is determined not by its consideration of Taiwan people 's interests but solely by the consideration of its own national interests .  
Sources said that the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone had originally intended to celebrate the 20th anniversary of its establishment with fanfare .  Not only was a preparatory committee established , but television stations and other media from various parts of the country were invited to go to Shenzhen to make special reports that " suit their own needs . "  At the same time , it also submitted a " plan for celebrations " to the State Council and expressed the hope that central leaders would travel south to attend the celebrations as they did 10 years ago .  
As a matter of fact , we did not make any substantive adjustment to the tax preferential policies toward foreign investors .  In 1997 , we intended to adjust the tax referential policy in terms of import equipment , but owing to the changes in macroeconomic situation such as the Asian financial crisis , we suspended the policy adjustment .  
As for the purchase of submarines from the United States , a naval officer indicated that , if the United States reopens its closed production lines to produce submarines powered by conventional diesel engines , the costs of the submarines [ that Taiwan intended to buy ] would be substantially higher .  He said political factors are also important issues the United States has to consider before it decides whether to sell submarines to Taiwan . He said in the future the United States might assist Taiwan to build its own submarines by providing Taiwan with technical support .  
I suggest that while stepping up in-depth or meticulous education or transformation work , the government should hold higher the law as a sharp sword ; should more severely crack down on a small number of die-hard elements of " Falungong , " who have plotted or organized activities intended to create a disturbance ; and should firmly prevent such people from fanning the flames of disorder or sabotaging a situation of stability and unity , which we have built with hard efforts .

" The dragon 's main colours - gold , purple , orange and blue - are intended to contrast with the green background of the venue and to herald success on earth .  It is an impressive sight to behold and a great photo opportunity for both local residents as well as tourists , " the spokesman added .  
Jointly organised by the Home Affairs Department , the Heung Yee Kuk and the South China Morning Post , the Director of Home Affairs , Mrs Shelley Lau , said : " The Most Beautified Village Contest was intended not just to encourage contesting villages to carry out certain superficial improvements to their environment .  Instead , it is aimed more at effecting long-term improvements with considerable stock attached to the village 's greening activities , maintenance and preservation of its historical relics , and the ambience of the village , apart from general environmental improvements . "  
In two of the cases detected by the TTF , traders declared in the import documents that the imported goods were for local consumption , whereas in fact the goods had been entirely manufactured in Mainland China , intended for export to quota restrained countries under false claim to Hong Kong origin .  
A " non-immunity " clause is normally included in Ordinances establishing a corporation or other body which is empowered to perform public or semi-public functions but which is intended to operate independently of the Government . The " non-immunity " clause makes it clear that the body is independent and ensures that it is treated in law as an ordinary private body .  
1 .  High-stake public examination for the purpose of allocating S1 places is not necessary during the nine years of free and universal basic education .  Empirical evidence has proven that selection-oriented public assessments , even if they are not intended to require prior preparation , would inevitably hamper students ' learning experience and make primary education examination-driven .  This would in turn hinder the all-round development of students ; and  
According to the information released , the EU decided to temporarily suspend the import of all Mainland China 's products of animal origin intended for human consumption or for use in animal feed with effect from 30 January 2002 .  This decision was made in the light of an inspection report on the control of chemical residues in live animals and animal products in the Mainland compiled by the EU 's Food and Veterinary Office . The main products being suspended include honey , rabbit meat , poultry and crustacean food such as shrimps and prawns .

In addition , the Pharmacy and Poisons Board proposes to relax the control of Clobetasone butyrate when contained in preparations intended for external application only at not more than 0.05% so that its sale does not require the support of a prescription but still has to be sold by authorised sellers of poisons under the direct supervision of registered pharmacists .  
He suggested that for the avoidance of any doubt , it may well be considered desirable to state generally in the new law that nothing in it is intended to contravene Articles 27 or 39 of the Basic Law , and that restrictions apply only in so far as they are lawful pursuant to those provisions of the Basic Law . It was Mr Pannick 's opinion that none of the provisions set out in the Consultation Document are objectionable as a matter of legal principle . 
The fine level for the relevant offences was set in 1977 and has not been adjusted since then .  Similar offences in other ordinances attract higher fines than those in the ordinance .  It was considered appropriate to raise the fine to reflect the intended deterrent effect , the spokesman explained .  
Falling within this area are coastal areas mainly below the 20-metre contour .  This zone is intended to conserve and retain the natural coastlines and the sensitive coastal natural environment including attractive geological features , physical landform or areas of high landscape , scenic or ecological value .  
I wrote to Ch'iao Kuan-hua pointing out that this analogy proved the opposite of what was intended . Ireland had been under English rule longer than Taiwan had been under Chinese rule but had become independent . What the argument actually showed was that the Chinese Communists were more imperialistic than the extreme British conservatives who opposed Irish independence . What Yeh Chien-ying 's proposals try to do is to make a concession to Western feelings by claiming the Chinese Communist Party would be satisfied with purely nominal unification .  
The former begins with a lively waltz , projecting a fresh exuberance . Its short segments include literature appreciation , public health lectures , and general legal topics , all of which are intended to relate to daily life and inspire self-improvement .  
The " superstar " art objects that go for astronomical prices are almost all the focus of intense promotion by auction houses intended to stir up a competitive psychology among buyers . Many less ballyhooed works of nearly equal artistic value , overlooked in the commercial furor , sell for quite pedestrian prices .  
The pestle music of the Bunun , which is played before the rice harvest , was originally intended to attract people from neighboring villages to come and share in the crop . Rice is n't planted much any more , but the performance still shows the tribe 's solidarity and generous spirit of sharing , qualities worth cherishing by indigenous people and outsiders alike .  
The tour group had made advanced reservations for soft sleepers from Huhhot City to Peking . Suddenly they were confronted with the news that all of their tickets had been cancelled . Upon inquiring as to the reason , they discovered that the very train they intended to board had been requisitioned by a high ranking official of the communist party ; naturally , none of the soft sleeper cars could fit other passengers .  
Passports are intended to serve as personal documents to use abroad for identification and proof of nationality . But because of unusual circumstances in the nation 's foreign relations , the history of the ROC passport over the last 40 years sets it apart . Now the document , worth tens of thousands of US dollars , is coveted by international thieves .  
The Mu-Kuang Rehabilitation Center is now located in Tungshan Rural Township , Ilan County , on a 4300 m2 site . As well as professional instructors , audio-assisted braille teaching equipment and an all-round education and training program , the Center has a library , a massage teaching room , a scented garden for the blind , and so on . These comprehensive facilities are intended to cater to all the needs of the students from their education and physical well being to their preparation for later life .  
Shenghsing Railway Station : The highest point on western Taiwan 's mountain railway line . The structure contains no metal nails . The Eight Trigrams design fixed to the beams is intended to ward off evil . Between Shenghsing and Tai-an , the railway passes over bridges and through tunnels , past green farmland and countryside , with scenic spots such as the Yutengping river valley and the " broken bridge " at Lungteng , which was split in two by a great earthquake over 50 years ago .  
The secret of what meaning Liu Bowen really intended his poem to convey went with him to his grave ; but many believers did go to Tienhoukung Temple in Lukang to ask how the temple oracle could have been so mistaken . The temple elders came out in person to make it clear that " this was probably just hearsay or even a hoax , we do n't think the divination was made according to the proper practice , so of course its credibility is doubtful . "  
When we chose the book labels as gifts , we simply thought they had an old-fashioned elegance and would be nice to collect . We never thought that the negative side of their content would lead to a misunderstanding . Because our paper-cut stories are mainly intended to be amusing and tell a story , many of them have a negative or ironic side to their meaning . This is true , for instance , of stories in recent issues such as " Both on the Losing End , " and " No Silver Buried Here . "  
Although the intended targets of sanctions were countries that over-exploited resources held in international waters , the amendment included a provision to the effect that whenever the secretary of commerce or secretary of the interior learns of trade or other forms of exchange , by foreign nationals , that directly or indirectly harms international conservation programs for endangered or threatened species , they should submit certification of this fact to the president .  
Taiwan had long hoped to join CITES and play a larger role in international conservation , but had always been hindered by political factors . International conservation groups were therefore " disappointed " by the fact that one of the reasons CITES left Yemen and South Korea off the list of countries for sanctions was that they intended to join the organization , without yet showing concrete improvements , and many countries confided that they were outraged on Taiwan 's behalf .  
The cat 's owner wanted to invoke the " vicious dog law " to have Lucy destroyed , but Lucy 's owner held that the law was intended to punish dogs whose bad deeds had hurt humans , and was not applicable to conflicts between animals . Fur Ball 's owner , however , claimed personal suffering as the result of Fur Ball 's cruel death , and thus argued that Lucy had caused injury to a person , making the vicious dog law applicable to this case .  
Meanwhile the domestic tenders , which were intended to support the ROC 's own civil engineering sector , also provoked a fierce conflict between the forces of the big established operators and those of new players , and suspicions of collusion or excessive price cutting in their tenders have not been laid to rest to this day .  
The central level reform issues came up first . Even before the conference began , the KMT 's dual executive mixed system idea was being attacked on all sides . Skeptics argued that the proposal was aimed at expanding presidential power and establishing a firm foundation for the vice-president serving concurrently as premier . Some boldly declared that the proposal was simply intended to pave the way for Lee Teng-hui to run for re-election .  
It continued : " Chinese emperors collected these works over 11 centuries . Some of the pieces predate them-the elaborate wine vessel from the mid-ninth century BC , for example , and the curious reddish bronze vat , or liang , from AD 9 that was intended to enforce a new set of volumetric standards . In complexity , both works are years ahead of their Western equivalents . Nor was there a Western equivalent of the enormous workshops that , in centuries to come , filled these emperors ' warehouses . "  
" There does not need to be a conflict between the needs of urban development and historical building preservation , " says Tseng Shu-cheng , an assistant professor in Tamkang University 's Architecture Department . Preserving historic buildings or spaces is not intended to stop time and halt development . On the contrary it is intended to use their historical essence to make a new and creative use of the space .  
In the first half of October , ROC Vice President Lien Chan paid a visit to Europe . After his itinerary was revealed , it inevitably met with intense pressure from Beijing . The result was that this journey , originally to have covered northern , central and southern Europe and intended to build friendly foreign relations with the three countries of Iceland , Austria and Spain , lost Spain as a destination .  
In addition , a point that is particularly scorned is that the normally jovial program hosts look unnatural and out of place when doing these emotive segments . Variety shows still are played mainly for laughs and entertainment . Inserting these segments is a gimmick intended to add drama . The hosts , stuck between solemnity and silliness , often look embarrassed and uncertain what to do next .  
Although hotel chairman Lin Shih-jung has already stated that under the present circumstances he has no choice but to close down the hotel , the incident has drawn attention to the illegal use of mountain slope land and to the issue of safety in the tourism industry . This in turn has raised concerns over the proposed construction of a hotel at Matsao in Yangmingshan National Park , since the intended site also lies on a seismic fault line .  
NHI was initially intended to use a global budgeting system , but this system has proved to be too difficult to implement . However , according to Yang Han-chuan , the BNHI is now working on a pilot program to be tested with dental care in the near future . Chuang Yi-chou says , " The mechanism is a good one , but the system was designed with the whole nation operating off of one budget .  
ISO 14000 is a set of management standards intended to encourage firms to build environmental management systems . This means protecting against pollution , making economical use of resources in the production process , manufacturing green products and working to improve the quality of the overall environment by making continuous efforts to improve every aspect of their production processes .  
If you can get them breathing and their hearts beating again , you 've always got a shot at saving them . " But the use of CPR , which was originally intended for saving lives in medical emergencies , has been commandeered by the extend-life-at-all-costs philosophy of the modern medical era . Whether or not their illnesses are curable , if patients can be made to live another day , another hour , or even another minute , all efforts are made to save them .  
He had originally intended to locate his capital in Jiaozaitu ( part of present-day Taichung City ) because of its convenient location halfway between north and south on Taiwan 's western plain .  
Taiwanese companies were among the major investors . In 2000 , mainland policymakers turned their attention to developing China 's western regions , and the culturally rich ancient capital Xi'an was anointed as the site of one of China 's four future " Silicon Valleys , " in addition to Beijing 's Zhongguancun , Shanghai 's Pudong , and the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone . These four centers each have their own strengths and weaknesses , and are intended to both compete and cooperate with each other .  
One area of particular difficulty has been the decision to promote the simultaneous learning of local and international languages , intended both to strengthen local consciousness and as a response to global trends . This approach has dramatically increased the pressure on children , leaving many unsure about the relative importance of different languages .  
At that time the MOE had just launched its new " nine-year integrated curriculum , " which reset the first year of English-language study at the fifth grade effective in 2001 . In order to fill the spaces created by the expansion , the MOE sent out a call for qualified English teachers , ultimately resulting in the recruiting of 3500 trainees . However , just two years later more than 1500 teachers , nearly half of the group intended to be the color guard of the new primary English-language instruction , had fallen by the wayside .  
Going from creative ideas to practical applications takes very pragmatic skills , like patient experimentation and testing , requiring total focus and concentration . As the classical poet Tao Yuan-ming declared , " When swept by a thought , I gladly forget to eat . " And Thomas Edison is said to have once absent-mindedly cooked his own watch rather than the egg he intended .  
The biggest drawback of this type of treatment is that it takes two to three years , which is more than most people can put up with . What 's more , desensitization is also a risky procedure , because allergy shots can in some cases have the opposite effect to that intended , and provoke asthma , allergic rhinitis , and even anaphylactic shock . Therefore , unless they suffer from a severe case of allergy , most people opt to wage a protracted war of resistance or even to live in peaceful coexistence with their allergy .  
A number of seminars and discussion forums intended for large audiences were organized , aiming to enhance popular understanding of foreign direct investment , its developmental potential , and the relevant policy issues .

Bolivia has signed several bilateral treaties intended to advance international cooperation on legal matters within a framework of strict respect for sovereignty , but at the same time closing off avenues to impunity for international crime .  
When the founding fathers of the 1945 Charter forged close structural links between the Court and the United Nations , they obviously intended that the Court should be fully integrated into the new system for the peaceful settlement of disputes that had just been devised , but they did not in any way wish to deprive the Court of the autonomy indispensable to the sound administration of justice .  
The Agenda is consistent because , learning from the failure of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990 , it was designed as an operational whole in which the respective responsibilities and commitments of Africa and the international community were clearly spelled out in what has rightly been called a partnership contract intended to lay the groundwork for lasting African economic and social recovery before the end of the present decade .  
Under the same item , the Commission considered the current status of implementation of General Assembly resolution 47 / 237 on the International Year of the Family and took note of the intention of the Secretary-General to submit to the Assembly , at its fiftieth session , his specific proposals on the follow-up to the International Year of the Family , intended to serve as an indicative guide for action , primarily at the national and local levels .  
Since it was established in 1945 , the United Nations has elaborated a comprehensive body of international human rights standards and put into place a complex system of international supervision of national respect for those standards , which provide the High Commissioner with a solid foundation on which to build his own specific activities .

As to how the specific nature of the Model Law should be reflected in the draft Guide , it was agreed that clear indication should be given that the Model Law was intended to constitute a discrete and balanced set of rules , all of which should be enacted by implementing States in order to meet the objectives of the Model Law .  
The third preambular paragraph of the draft statute reiterates the guiding principle that the international criminal court " is intended to be complementary to national criminal justice systems in cases where such trial procedures many not be available or may be ineffective " . 
It believes that establishing a linkage between the Security Council , which is a political organ by nature and by virtue of its mandate and structure , and the international criminal court , whose establishment is intended to provide a neutral and impartial legal forum , will create enormous problems that will undermine confidence in the court 's neutrality and impartiality .  
For exports to a non-nuclear-weapon State not party to the Treaty , source or special fissionable material either directly transferred , or produced , processed , or used in the facility for which the transferred item is intended , shall not be diverted to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ;
