Today , the curtains of a large-scale development of the country 's western region have already been raised , and the enthusiasm of the vast numbers of cadres and masses is running high .  At such a moment , we should pay close attention to correctly guiding , protecting , and bringing into play the enthusiasm of all sides ; and should bring about a healthy development to the large-scale development of the western region .  
The " three representations " is the scientific summary of the Party 's character and aim , is the centralized requirements of maintaining the Party 's advancement , is the creative utilization and development of Theory of Marxism Party building , and is the fundamental guiding ideology of strengthening Party building under new circumstances , which has strong ideological content , theoretical content and distinctive character of the day .  
Experience has proven that the guiding ideology , basic principles , work patterns , and leadership systems for the anti-corruption campaign defined by the Central Committee are entirely correct , effective , and in keeping with China 's basic circumstances during the current phase .  They are the fundamental guarantee that we will continually achieve new results in the fight against corruption .

"  
The third is to make clear the guiding ideology that the examination , verification and issuance of certificates are only one link of management and are not the entire management of social order and fire prevention .  What is more important is to establish a standard and effective routine supervision and inspection mechanism in order to ensure that once a problem is discovered , it will be dealt with until it is solved and thorough improvements are made .  
Adhering to the guiding principle that focuses on unity , stability , inspiration , and positive propaganda , we had a good grasp of the press , broadcast , movie , and television work , armed people 's minds with scientific theory , guided people with correct public opinion , molded people with lofty spirits , and encouraged people with fine artistic works .  
The building of party character and honest government has been a clear success , and we have formulated a complete set of guiding ideologies , basic principles , leadership system , and work pattern to fight corruption .  We have introduced a series of laws and regulations on honest government , and we have to different degrees solved some of the more serious problems the masses are most concerned about .  The struggle to treat the symptoms and the causes of corruption is developing in depth and is gaining breadth .  
The " Program " has put forward the overall objective and subordinate objectives for the educational reform and development of military academies in the coming decade , clearly defined the guiding ideology and the development principle for the work , drawn the outline of an educational system in military academies which enjoys the special characteristics of our army , and has put forward a series of mutually supporting and mutually dovetailing major reform measures .  
Wang Ke pointed out : The important speech , which Chairman Jiang made from a strategic height and after having reviewed the whole situation , is a scientific summation of our party 's historical experience , a deep revelation of the inherent laws governing the work of party building , and an enrichment and development of Mao Zedong 's and Deng Xiaoping 's thoughts on party building .  It has further pointed out the direction of party building in the new period and has a high theoretical and ideological level and a guiding function .  
As far as social supervision is concerned , what is most crucial is that supervision departments should earnestly change their guiding ideology for developing the capital market , really proceed from giving play to market functions and improving the efficiency of the distribution of capital resources , strengthen supervision over the " openness , justice and fairness " of market , reduce unnecessary interference , adopt measures to gradually release and curb market " bubbles , " and reduce the overall risk of market .  
The important concept of " three represents " put forward by General Secretary Jiang is an in-depth summing-up of historical experiences in the building of our party , a scientific generalization of the party 's nature , aims , and tasks , and new requirements set for party building in the new period .  It embodies the distinct characteristics of the times and is of profound ideological and scientific guiding significance .  
In the course of studying the " three represents , " party committees of the armed forces and armed police units at and above the army level felt that party committees and leading cadres not only should act as model practitioners of the " three represents " but they should also shoulder the responsibility of guiding the party committees of subordinate military units in meeting the " three represents " requirements and advance party building in the military units in an all-round way .  
They should have a firm ideal and conviction , be totally devoted to their work and have a strong sense of responsibility , be honest and upright in their ways and have a down-to-earth work style , and be good at uniting and guiding the masses for a satisfactory fulfillment of tasks in all fields .  
The issues of belief and conviction involve many major issues including our guiding thought , social system , cadres ' contingent building , as well as people 's thinking that have a bearing on the rise and fall and success and failure of our party .  Faced with tough challenges in the new millenium , and at a time of comprehensively pushing forward our cause into the new century , we need a strong spiritual force even more .  
Party committees and governments as well as departments concerned in key areas seriously affected by illegal drugs should promptly swing into action to conduct careful investigation , make earnest arrangements , and adopt decisive measures to change the conditions of the localities within a specified time in accordance with the principles guiding the handling of the most serious problems of illegal drugs specific to the localities .  
Leading cadres should take the lead in studying the " Three Represents " , should publicize and disseminate the " Three Represents " through their personal fruitful experiences , and should go deep down to the grassroots units , instructing them face to face , explaining the difficult points and unclear points , inspiring and guiding them , and assisting the Party members and broad numbers of officers and soldiers in grassroots units in their effectively studying and satisfactorily carrying out the important thinking of the " Three Represents " .  
In addition to encouraging the large-scale introduction of foreign capital , China has put a fair amount of emphasis all along on the quality of the utilization of foreign capital , laying out clearly the guiding policies for the active , reasonable , and effective utilization of foreign capital .  
They do not have a comprehensive and scientific understanding about the relationship between economic construction and ideological and political works and do not have sufficient understanding about the importance , urgency , and protracted nature of the ideological and political work .  If this state of affairs is allowed to go on , the guiding position of Marxism will be shaken and the people will lose the correct ideological foundation for jointly forging ahead , ending with ideological confusion .  This is very dangerous .  
In the light of glorious achievements attained in military logistical building and reform in the past decade , leaders from the logistics departments of major military units and the Armed Police Corps as well as experts and scholars from some universities and institutes had an in-depth discussion .  Their discussion focused on the epochal background for Chairman Jiang to give major expositions on logistical work , and characteristics and guiding position of his theory .  
Specifically , it is necessary to achieve actual effects in correcting the guiding ideology for work and overcoming the formalism , in enhancing the unit 's level of training the military with science and technology , in strengthening the ideological and political building of the unit , and in resolving the hot and difficult issues which have confounded the grass-roots level over a long period of time .  
In his important speech at the central ideological and political work meeting , Comrade Jiang Zemin made a brilliant analysis and profound exposition of the important position , main tasks , guiding ideology , and basic requirements of the party 's ideological and political work in the new period , and major issues that need handling in doing the work , from the height of both international and domestic overall situations .  
For more than 20 years now , the basic lines , basic guiding principles , and policies for reform and opening up formulated and continually improved by the Party 's second and third generations of central leadership work hard to embody the forward direction of developmental requirements for China 's advanced productive force and culture , truly representing the basic interests of the majority .  
It has upheld singing out the principal melody , successfully fought the battle of initiative , grasped the important issues , taken education and trust in ideals as the core , strongly propagated patriotism , collectivism , and socialism , deeply implemented the Party 's fundamental theory , its basic line , its basic education on guiding principles , established a correct world view , outlook on life , and value judgments .  
In recent years , the whole party carried out the activities of studying Deng Xiaoping Theory , conducted " three stress " education among cadres at and above the county level , recently studied and propagated Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thesis on " three represents " , and held a central ideological and political work conference not long ago .  All this has given full play to our party 's strong political advantages and effectively guaranteed the guiding position of Marxism in the ideological field .  
It also means and is most crucial to hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , adhere to the absolute leadership of the Party , comprehensively implement both the Party 's guiding principle on education and the Central Military Commission 's requirements on running military schools , and maintain the original nature of these schools . " producing skilled students " means to foster high-quality military professionals with a comprehensive training in moral , academic , military and physical aspects and with superior qualities in all other aspects .  
Following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , the Chinese armed forces ' guiding thought for construction underwent a strategic change .  We have reduced the number of personnel , substantially restructured our sizes , drawn up a strategic policy for military affairs in the new period , and achieved the " two fundamental changes " .  The successes we have achieved have attracted worldwide attention .  
It means fighting an active battle well , walking ahead of the masses , and guiding the masses to overcome interference and make correct options under very complex and complicated environments .  
Since the convening of the third plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , those involved in civil air defense work have constantly emancipated the mind , deepened reforms , aggressively explored new ways in China 's peacetime civil air defense building , and helped bring about a strategic transformation in the guiding thought of civil air defense building , namely , a transformation from preparation for fighting " an early war , a major war , a nuclear war " to the track of modernization building centering on the economic construction in peacetime ; 
Over the last five years , in the face of all difficulties arising in the very complicated internal and external environments and economic ad social life , we have always regarded speeding up development as a basic guiding ideology in the economic work , upheld employing methods of development to revolve issues in our forging ahead , adopted a series of policies and measures to promote economic developments , and maintained relatively fast speed developments . 
We revamped our concepts and emancipated our minds , guiding all areas to actively and boldly develop civil air defense reform practice .  We broke with the closed state , throwing open the doors , and sharply developing and utilizing early-stage projects , with projects integrating peacetime with wartime , such as underground markets , parking garages , production shops , and cultural entertainment places , springing up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain .  
Practice has proved that the guiding ideology , basic principles , leadership mechanism , and the work setup and arrangements drawn up by the party Central Committee for the responsibility system over the building a sound party style and a clean administration are totally correct ; and so long as we can unswervingly carry them out in practice , the responsibility system for the building of a sound party style and a clean administration can surely play a greater role in the practice of running the party strictly .  
Third , cadre appointments must be based on the principle of incorruptibility .  Outstanding candidates selected through democratic procedures and proved to be honest and upright in their behavior by the assessment of the organization should be appointed to key positions without hesitation so that they may play a exemplary and guiding role in the cadre contingent and encourage all cadres to maintain the spirit of working hard in making progress .  
We have also paid attention to guiding people in adopting a correct world outlook , outlook on life , and values , and vigorously promoted patriotism , collectivism , socialism , and the spirit of building an enterprise through arduous effort , as well as all ethics that are conducive to state unity , national solidarity , economic development , and social progress .  
Over the last two years , the scientific and technological military training has brought about profound changes in the guiding principle , contents , means and methods of military training , as well as in military tactics ; and has played an important role in enhancing the troops ' ability of winning in future high-tech war .  
In guiding the scientific and technological military training of troop units , the Guangzhou Military Region has closely integrated learning new knowledge with studying and mastering new equipment , new skills and new tactics , incorporated them into specific technical and tactical subjects , and turn them into applied training courses which combine knowledge with skill .  In this way , it has had feasible training methods and appraisal criteria and made battlefield application of high-tech knowledge a required course which must be tested .  
The training quality will directly affect the implementation of work related to combat readiness .  In giving training guidance , this department persisted in guiding the equipment training practice with scientific and technological achievements , and chanted the slogan of " conducting training with science and technology and doing everything for the sake of winning the battle " during the training .  It also probed into the law governing military training with science and technology in order to seek development in equipment training .  
Therefore , leaders and institution cadres at all levels , cadres of grassroots units and cadets should all take the management education as a compulsory course , study it hard , temper themselves in a painstaking manner , continuously improving their abilities in organizing , planning , and guiding troops through the management education , fully master the basic methods , meet the requirements for scientifically leading and correctly managing soldiers , and become qualified leaders of soldiers in the new period .  
We must carefully formulate and seriously carry out a guiding plan for ethical building , blend the basic moral concept demands into the relevant laws and regulations and the various specific policies , and into the various items of social management , and continually promote the formation and perfection of the system of socialist ideology and ethics .  
refining and distilling the ruling party 's " governing " policy and historical mission of developing productive forces and culture and realizing the people 's interests in such a way as to make them the ruling party 's fundamental guiding principle on " administering the party " has answered the important historical questions of " what kind of party we should build and how we should build our party " ; all this has raised Marxist party building theory to a higher level .  
Party committees , political institutions and leaders at all levels should profoundly and satisfactorily do this ideological and political work , guiding retired cadres to think from a strategic perspective of the reforming , dynamic and stable overall situation of the country and the military construction .  
The facts have fully proven that Deng Xiaoping Theory is forever the great banner guiding us in continually advancing from victory to victory , and that the party 's third-generation leadership collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has superlative skill and ability in mastering complex situations and leading socialist modernization , and is profoundly trusted and revered by the whole party , the whole army , and the people of all nationalities throughout the country .  
This Opinion regards Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of the " three represents " as the guideline , gives an eye on the reality of the party-building in the military and explicitly proposes the guiding principle , fundamental objective , major tasks and detailed requirements on extensively promoting throughout the military an educational campaign to maintain the advanced nature of party members .  
Contents in the preface of the revised law include the guiding position of Deng Xiaoping Theory and call for adhering to reform , opening up , taking the socialist road with Chinese characteristics , developing a socialist market economy and strengthening the building of socialist democracy and legal system .  The revised law has clearly defined the system of regional national autonomy as a basic political system of our country .  
We should correct the guiding principle of our tasks , make great efforts to eradicate unhealthy workings styles like bureaucracy , characterized by staying high above reality and soldiers , and formalism , characterized by pursuing unrealistic personal fame and working in a perfunctory manner , so as to improve the comprehensive quality of officers .  
Especially at a time when the country is engaged in launching the important reform projects of building a socialist market economic system and restructuring the financial and tax policies , the ministry has taken the initiative in supporting and guiding Tibet 's financial reforms in accordance with Tibet 's actual situation .  
Supporting the Party 's principles , guiding public opinion in the correct direction , the overall situation of serving Tibet : these are three mutual relationships coexisting in a single entity ; this is a political demand the Party makes of its organs ' newspapers , the sublime mission of those who run the newspapers .  
Since these training exercises , be they staged on a map , on a computer in a simulated manner , or with real arms and real men , often involve a large amount of financial and human resources and organizational efforts , we should study ways of fully developing their exemplary or guiding roles for our teaching and training work ;  
The open market operation played an important role in putting base money into circulation in 1998 and 1999 , regulating the liquidity of commercial banks in 2000 , and guiding the interest rates for money markets .

The work organs of national defense education at the provincial , prefectural , and county levels in all parts of the country should , under the unified leadership of the local national defense education committees and national defense education leading groups , and effectively perform the functions of organizing , guiding , coordinating , and inspecting national defense education work in their administrative areas .  
Local institutions for national defense education at provincial , prefectural , and county levels should conscientiously perform their duty of organizing , guiding , coordinating , and inspecting the work on national defense education within their own administrative divisions , under the unified leadership of the local committees for national defense education or leading groups for national defense education .  
Guiding projects take major local projects that conform to the direction and conditions of national plans to tackle key scientific and technological problem and that have a stimulating effect on local leading industries and sustainable social development , or those that can improve local capabilities for technological innovation , and lists them in the national plans for tackling key scientific and technological problems for guidance and implementation .  The funding to implement guiding projects is to be raised primarily by the localities and businesses .  
The key to studying for the purpose of application lies in guiding the broad ranks of cadres to combine theoretical study with the study of practical issues and conscientiously enhance their abilities to analyze and solve practical issues using scientific theory in close connection with the new changes in the international situation , the new advances in China 's drive of reform and opening up to the outside world and socialism modernization as well , and the new developments and new problems facing our party building .

we must adhere to the guiding principle of " one central task , two important jobs , and three assurances , " i.e . , we should regard economic construction as the central task , closely attend to maintaining stability and developing the economy , and ensure long-term social peace and stability in Tibet , ensure the rapid development of Tibet 's economy , and ensure notable improvement of the living standard of the people of Tibet ;

We should not only be aware of the significant development and the significant contributions , but also profoundly understand the substantial significance for the practice and the guiding role .  In this way , we can comprehensively and accurately master the ideological and theoretical system and lay down a solid theoretical and ideological foundation for Party members to conscientiously put their advanced nature into practice .  
Marxism is our guiding ideology on building our party and state , the guide to actions in all our work , the ideological foundation and spiritual motive force pushing people of all nationalities of the entire country to fight for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation through concerted efforts , and also a powerful ideological weapon for our efforts to understand the world and to reform the objective world and subjective world .  
The dominant position of public ownership , the nature of state power of people 's democracy , and the CPC 's ruling position have determined that the ideological reflection of such economic and political relationships can only be the use of Marxism as the party 's and the state 's guiding ideology .

Particular efforts should be devoted to meticulously studying Chairman Jiang 's expositions on how we should understand the historical progress of development of socialist society , how we should understand historical progress of the development of capitalist society , how we should understand the influence on people 's thinking exerted by our practice of socialist reform and how we should understand the impact of the current international environment and international political struggles .  These expositions should be regarded as the guiding principle and fundamental basis for observing and understanding the international and domestic situation .  
As a result of implementation in the past six years of this guiding principle for the work in Tibet in the new period , the whole region 's social situation has stabilized , rate of economic growth has increased remarkably , efforts in reform and opening up have gradually picked up , construction of infrastructure facilities including that of energy , transportation and communication has developed fairly fast , local financial revenues have registered a relatively greater increase , and the people 's livelihood has clearly improved .  
The guiding principle for Tibet 's work in the new period has further aroused our consciousness in opposing separatism and safeguarding stability .  In exposing and criticizing Dalai in recent years , we have been waging a tit-for-tat struggle against him in the spiritual sphere , which is the main battleground , to fight confusion and correct foolishness .  We have done a great deal of highly effective work in strengthening the buildup of socialist spiritual civilization .

Mao Zedong 's thinking on the untied front , Deng Xiaoping 's theory on the united front in the new period , and the theses of the party 's third-generation leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core on the united front provide the powerful ideological weapons for guiding the triumphant advanced of the united front .  
The united front should firmly adoptthe guiding principle of serving economic construction , should pool the wisdom and strength of all social strata , all political parties , all ethnic groups , all social organizations , and the people in all social circles for advancing our country 's socialist modernization .  
To fulfill the tasks in the transitional period and realize the change into socialism , the key lay in the proper accomplishment of the socialist transformation .  That was an ownership revolution of guiding individual and private economies into socialism .

It also adopted the guiding principle and policy of " letting literature and art service socialism and the people " and " letting a-hundred flowers blossom and a-hundred schools of thought contend .

All this has shown that the CPC has always represented the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , and that it has been making unremitting efforts to bring about and develop our prosperous and outstanding national culture .

The important concept of " three represents " put forward by General Secretary Jiang is an in-depth summing-up of historical experiences in the building of our party , a scientific generalization of the party 's nature , aims , and tasks , and new requirements set for party building in the new period .  It embodies the distinct characteristics of the times and is of profound ideological and scientific guiding significance .  
In the course of studying the " three represents , " party committees of the armed forces and armed police units at and above the army level felt that party committees and leading cadres not only should act as model practitioners of the " three represents " but they should also shoulder the responsibility of guiding the party committees of subordinate military units in meeting the " three represents " requirements and advance party building in the military units in an all-round way .  
They should have a firm ideal and conviction , be totally devoted to their work and have a strong sense of responsibility , be honest and upright in their ways and have a down-to-earth work style , and be good at uniting and guiding the masses for a satisfactory fulfillment of tasks in all fields .  
The issues of belief and conviction involve many major issues including our guiding thought , social system , cadres ' contingent building , as well as people 's thinking that have a bearing on the rise and fall and success and failure of our party .  Faced with tough challenges in the new millenium , and at a time of comprehensively pushing forward our cause into the new century , we need a strong spiritual force even more .

Leading cadres should take the lead in studying the " Three Represents " , should publicize and disseminate the " Three Represents " through their personal fruitful experiences , and should go deep down to the grassroots units , instructing them face to face , explaining the difficult points and unclear points , inspiring and guiding them , and assisting the Party members and broad numbers of officers and soldiers in grassroots units in their effectively studying and satisfactorily carrying out the important thinking of the " Three Represents " .

Specifically , it is necessary to achieve actual effects in correcting the guiding ideology for work and overcoming the formalism , in enhancing the unit 's level of training the military with science and technology , in strengthening the ideological and political building of the unit , and in resolving the hot and difficult issues which have confounded the grass-roots level over a long period of time .  
In his important speech at the central ideological and political work meeting , Comrade Jiang Zemin made a brilliant analysis and profound exposition of the important position , main tasks , guiding ideology , and basic requirements of the party 's ideological and political work in the new period , and major issues that need handling in doing the work , from the height of both international and domestic overall situations .  
For more than 20 years now , the basic lines , basic guiding principles , and policies for reform and opening up formulated and continually improved by the Party 's second and third generations of central leadership work hard to embody the forward direction of developmental requirements for China 's advanced productive force and culture , truly representing the basic interests of the majority .  
It has upheld singing out the principal melody , successfully fought the battle of initiative , grasped the important issues , taken education and trust in ideals as the core , strongly propagated patriotism , collectivism , and socialism , deeply implemented the Party 's fundamental theory , its basic line , its basic education on guiding principles , established a correct world view , outlook on life , and value judgments .  
In recent years , the whole party carried out the activities of studying Deng Xiaoping Theory , conducted " three stress " education among cadres at and above the county level , recently studied and propagated Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thesis on " three represents " , and held a central ideological and political work conference not long ago .  All this has given full play to our party 's strong political advantages and effectively guaranteed the guiding position of Marxism in the ideological field .  
It also means and is most crucial to hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , adhere to the absolute leadership of the Party , comprehensively implement both the Party 's guiding principle on education and the Central Military Commission 's requirements on running military schools , and maintain the original nature of these schools . " producing skilled students " means to foster high-quality military professionals with a comprehensive training in moral , academic , military and physical aspects and with superior qualities in all other aspects .  
Following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , the Chinese armed forces ' guiding thought for construction underwent a strategic change .  We have reduced the number of personnel , substantially restructured our sizes , drawn up a strategic policy for military affairs in the new period , and achieved the " two fundamental changes " .  The successes we have achieved have attracted worldwide attention .  
It means fighting an active battle well , walking ahead of the masses , and guiding the masses to overcome interference and make correct options under very complex and complicated environments .  
Since the convening of the third plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , those involved in civil air defense work have constantly emancipated the mind , deepened reforms , aggressively explored new ways in China 's peacetime civil air defense building , and helped bring about a strategic transformation in the guiding thought of civil air defense building , namely , a transformation from preparation for fighting " an early war , a major war , a nuclear war " to the track of modernization building centering on the economic construction in peacetime ; 
Over the last five years , in the face of all difficulties arising in the very complicated internal and external environments and economic ad social life , we have always regarded speeding up development as a basic guiding ideology in the economic work , upheld employing methods of development to revolve issues in our forging ahead , adopted a series of policies and measures to promote economic developments , and maintained relatively fast speed developments . 
We revamped our concepts and emancipated our minds , guiding all areas to actively and boldly develop civil air defense reform practice .  We broke with the closed state , throwing open the doors , and sharply developing and utilizing early-stage projects , with projects integrating peacetime with wartime , such as underground markets , parking garages , production shops , and cultural entertainment places , springing up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain .  
Practice has proved that the guiding ideology , basic principles , leadership mechanism , and the work setup and arrangements drawn up by the party Central Committee for the responsibility system over the building a sound party style and a clean administration are totally correct ; and so long as we can unswervingly carry them out in practice , the responsibility system for the building of a sound party style and a clean administration can surely play a greater role in the practice of running the party strictly .  
Third , cadre appointments must be based on the principle of incorruptibility .
