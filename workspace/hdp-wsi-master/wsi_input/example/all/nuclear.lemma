Even with such capability , however , the power station has still put nuclear safety first and never lowered vigilance .  It has established a virtual protective screen more secure than steel reinforced concrete - - a nuclear safety culture deeply rooted in people 's hearts .  
The detachment also made use of the technological advantages of colleges , and launched several special firing experiments under the guidance of college experts , including antitank missile cross-water firing , pitch angle firing , and firing in nuclear and chemical warfare .  They obtained a huge amount of first-hand information , and accumulated precious experiences .  Based on their training results , they compiled the " training outlines , " which were promulgated and implemented by the whole army .  
Cao Gangchuan indicated : Such a large-span development in the scientific and technological undertaking for national defense and weaponry development has also brought along the progress of the entire country in the field of high technologies ; given a great impetus to the industrialization of such high-tech sectors as nuclear power , aviation , space flight , shipbuilding , machinery , and electronics ; and has made considerable contribution to promoting the economic construction and enhancing the comprehensive national strength of our country .  
Its main function is to undertake the treatment and disposal of nuclear energy , nuclear material , nuclear fuel , exhausted fuel , and radioactive waste , the prospecting and excavation of uranium deposits , the scientific research and development as well as the construction , production , and operation of nuclear energy and nuclear-related fields , such as nuclear instrument and equipment , isotope , nuclear technology application , and economic cooperation with foreign countries and import-export businesses .  
[ Li Dingfan ] Our country 's nuclear industry was established in 1955 .  In the past 40 years or so , the industry developed tremendously from scratch and succeeded in developing " two bombs and one boat , " thus enabling China to become one of the nuclear countries in the world , smashing the nuclear monopoly and blackmail by the imperialists and hegemonists , greatly boosting its comprehensive national strength , and making tremendous contributions in maintaining world peace .  
Our country has signed government-to-government agreements on peaceful utilization of nuclear energy with 16 countries , including Britain , France , Russia , and Japan , and established economic , technological , and trade relations with more than 40 countries and regions , thus playing a positive role in promoting international cooperation in peaceful utilization of nuclear energy .  
[ Li Dingfan ] For many years while making efforts to enter the international market for peaceful utilization of nuclear energy , China 's nuclear industry has fully developed and utilized nuclear energy resources to serve the construction of the national economy and the livelihood of the people ; constructed many nuclear power projects , such as the Qinshan and Daya Bay nuclear power stations ; developed newly rising high-tech industries in which nuclear fuel , civilian-use nuclear technology , and production of nonnuclear civilian goods support and complement one another ;  
[ Li Dingfan ] In the new century , the CNNC 's entire line of thinking on development is to further cut the new development path of " integrating military and civilian production , developing nuclear energy power generation , readjusting the structure , giving prominence to efficiency , strengthening management , and invigorating the nuclear industry with science and technology . "  
do a good job in diverting redundant workers to other jobs and increasing efficiency with reduced staff ; put it in a prominent place to improve efficiency ; and establish a new-type small and efficient nuclear technology industrial system based on the integration of military and civilian production .  
On the basis of its geopolitics and its domestic and foreign " realistic " situation , Russia has gradually formed its own unique " practical containment " nuclear strategy : to prevent the outbreak of a nuclear war and a large-scale conventional war by means of nuclear deterrence and to first use nuclear weapons in a regional war , local war or armed conflict to attain the goal of safeguarding national security and maintaining the status of a big country .  
In the military reform conducted in Russia in the past few years , the size of various arms and services has been cut by a big margin , but the strategic missile troops alone have been strengthened and they have absorbed the military aerospace troops and the missile space defense troops .  Russia 's strength for launching nuclear attacks and for reconnaissance , early warning and resistance have been strengthened .  
Relying on its super economic and technological strength while possessing a huge nuclear arsenal , an individual military power has vigorously developed the national missile defense system in an attempt to seek absolute security of its own .  
Such a practice is a covert unilateral nuclear arms expansion in essence , which not only is unfavorable to the safeguarding of the global strategic balance and stability , but will also shake the prerequisite and basis for international nuclear nonproliferation .  
According a leading member of the State Civil Air Defense Office , as modern warfare principally is expressed in local hi-tech wars , nuclear and chemical protection is predicated on the safe use of the civil air defense engineering projects .  
It has set up a number of specialized laboratories for nuclear and chemical protection research and experiments .  It has a high-level contingent of scientists and researchers .  Over the years , it has attained a number of scientific research achievements that are up to advanced world standards in the field of nuclear and chemical protection .  
China has always devoted its efforts to international cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy , advocating efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons .  But we should not ignore the legitimate right of all countries , particularly developing countries , to use nuclear energy peacefully , even less so applying a double standard , to exploit anti-proliferation as the means for restricting and obstructing cooperation by all countries in the peaceful use of nuclear energy .  
The move in fact represents unilateral nuclear arms build-up in disguised form .  The move will not only bring severe damage to the integrity and vitality of the ABM treaty and the global strategic balance and stability , but will also seriously disrupt the basis for the US-Russia bilateralnuclear reductions , impede the international nuclear disarmament process , thus shatter the prerequisite and basis for international nuclear non-proliferation .  
In 1972 , the heads of state of the United States and the Soviet Union had no alternative but held talks to sign the " Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty " , which explicitly restricted both sides in the establishment of an anti-ballistic missile defense system , thus ruling out the possibility that one side could launch a nuclear attack without being punished .  This was acclaimed by the international community .  
Even more serious , the " ABM Treaty " is built on the basis of the theory of relative security ; it brought about relative balance of US and Soviet nuclear offensive and defensive forces through " mutually assured destruction " and prevented either side from carrying out a preemptive nuclear strike , while the US NMD is aimed at achieving its unilateral absolute military superiority and absolute security .  
The 1987 " MRBM Treaty " , the 1991 US-Soviet treaty on reduction of tactical nuclear weapons , and START-1 and START-2 respectively of 1991 and 1993 were agreed between the United States and the Soviet Union ( Russia ) after the signing of the " ABM Treaty " , in the firm belief that their own nuclear retaliatory force retained sufficient deterrent capability .  
The lightning pace of the advance of modern technology is right now influencing the earth on which we live with its mysterious power .  It is creating an unprecedented productive force , but at the same time , it also brings a host of problems like energy crises , environmental pollution , filth from the Internet , and increased polarization on a global scale .  Humanity even has the " nuclear threat " , with which it can destroy itself many times over .  
With its huge nuclear arsenal and policy of insisting on a nuclear first strike , the United States put all its strength behind developing and deploying NMD . This is in the hope of weakening or even depriving other nations with nuclear capabilities of their anti-missile capabilities , and , extending the threat one step further , this will have a deep and far-reaching negative effect on the global strategic order .  
At the same time , China also can not sit back and watch her legitimate national security interests be damaged , but rather must take the necessary measures based on changes to the global and regional security situation To ensure the minimum level of nuclear counterstrike ability , because China absolutely will not be subject to a nuclear threat ever again .  
Since the convening of the third plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , those involved in civil air defense work have constantly emancipated the mind , deepened reforms , aggressively explored new ways in China 's peacetime civil air defense building , and helped bring about a strategic transformation in the guiding thought of civil air defense building , namely , a transformation from preparation for fighting " an early war , a major war , a nuclear war " to the track of modernization building centering on the economic construction in peacetime ; 
If the United States deploys NMD , this will mean that the currently fragile Russian-US strategic balance will be broken , that Russia 's nuclear deterrent force will " be rendered ineffective , " and that the previous Russian-US nuclear disarmament will turn to be a disguised move for doing away with Russia 's nuclear weapons .  
That Putin lost no time in putting forward his proposals before attending the informal meeting of APEC leaders on 15 November shows that Russia is ready to continue to greatly reduce and finally eliminate nuclear arms on the basis of maintaining strategic stability ; and using the forum of the unofficial meeting of APEC leaders to publicize Russia 's ideas was for the purpose of gaining further international support on this issue .  
On the contrary , the gap between weaponry based on new scientific principles and old-fashioned weaponry can not be readily bridged with tactics .  Examples are the gaps between hot weapons and cold weapons , between mechanized weapons and human power , between nuclear weapons and conventional weapons .  These days developed countries are researching and developing " new concept weapons " such as kinetic energy weapons , directional energy weapons , meteorological weapons , subsonic weapons , and artificial intelligence weapons , which may lead to a breakthrough in the nature of weaponry .  
In order to develop the capacity for protection against nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , an anti-chemical warfare corps school was set up 50 years ago to train anti-chemical warfare cadres for the armed forces .  This raised the curtain of the building of the anti-chemical warfare corps in New China . In the past 50 years , our armed forces have organized troops with a relatively high quality to deal with nuclear , chemical and biological weapons .  
At present , the equipment of our armed forces for reconnoitering nuclear and chemical weapons has the technical means to reconnoiter and monitor attacks by all kinds of nuclear and chemical weapons and to give alarm .  Such equipment also includes advanced equipment for reconnoitering nuclear and chemical weapons , which is based on modern analysis and testing technology , detecting and alarming technology , and digital telecommunications technology , and is represented by armored anti-chemical reconnaissance vehicles .  
Serial equipment and complete sets of equipment for reconnoitering nuclear and chemical weapons in field operation can dash about in toxic and contaminated areas under all circumstances .  This has provided a firm material basis for increasing the capacity of our armed forces for protection against nuclear , chemical and biological weapons .  
The promulgation of the " Regulations on the Operation of the Anti-chemical Warfare Corps " of the new generation marked an important breakthrough made by our armed forces in their research on the characteristics and objective laws of operation under the threats of nuclear and chemical weapons , and marked a change from emphasizing protection on the same plane in the combined operation of the ground force to three-dimension protection in the joint operation of different armed services .  
With the efforts made in the past years , a system for training a new type of anti-chemical-warfare capable personnel has been formed in our armed forces .  At present , major combat equipment , including tanks , airplanes and vessels can better resist nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , and both the armed forces and the civilian basically have complete sets of equipment for protection against such weapons .  
The equipment for the mass defense of military units is in the main complete with quality reaching a good standard .  The preventive capability by specialized anti-chemical warfare units and the overall preventive capability of the Army , the Navy , the Air Force and the Second Artillery Corps have all been significantly improved .  The military units ' fighting capability under the threat of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons has been significantly strengthened .  
Such equipment is based on modern analytic and laboratory test technology , detecting and warning technology , automatic control technology , and digital communication technology as well as represented by armored chemical agent-detecting vehicles and nuclear agent-detecting robots .  This kind of equipment for detecting nuclear and chemical agents in the battlefield - - with wheel-type chassis-mounted vehicles as the backbone and with series of chassis-mounted vehicles as supplements - - can operate in contaminated areas under all kinds of situations .  
At present , our military units have composite decontamination equipment , multifunctional and rapid decontamination equipment , and one-man decontamination equipment , thus forming a complete equipment system .  Such a system , which is comprehensive in function and in technical means , can do a good job in decontaminating the pollution caused by nuclear , chemical , and biological weapons .  Our military units can enter an area contaminated by nuclear and chemical pollution to carry out decontamination work .  
To establish the structural design of nuclear weapons devices , Guo Yonghuai proposed " proceeding along two parallel roads and choosing the superior one in the end " in order to determine the optimum plan for the first nuclear bomb detonation , which played a decisive role in deciding several critical questions .  
Look !  In the cyber warfare drill room of the training center of the brigade , a " nuclear warfare " broke out on the screen .  The " blue army " took advantage of its strong military force to give a sudden nuclear attack against the " red army , " thus bringing myriad changes to the battlefield .  
On 20 April 2000 , Japan 's House of Representatives approved " Amendment to the Law on Formation of Defense Agency " and decided to set up several new research posts in the Defense Agency , including those for research on nuclear weapons , biological weapons research , and other special weapons as well .  It also decided to set up a research forum for nonmilitary experts on medical science and military science .  
Second , the US military may plan to use Guam as an experimental site for US nuclear submarines in the new century .  For instance , a submarine 's deep-water communications and data image transmission and the suitability of undersea launching of missiles under new fighting conditions can all be tested at the base in Guam .  
It was reported that the circulation line of US nuclear attack submarine has the problem of metal embrittlement and so it has been criticized by the people .  If nuclear submarines are reinforced in Japan , local people are expected to show objections .  Therefore , Guam has become the best choice of the US military .  
At a meeting to deliberate the " Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty " held at the UN headquarters in New York on 24 April 2000 , on behalf of the international community , UN Secretary General Kofi Annan explicitly voiced his opposition to NMD and his strong misgivings about the enormous destruction the US arbitrary move might bring to the international arms control and nuclear disarmament .  
The " Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty " was extended for an indefinite period with the support of many developing countries in 1995 , and the " Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty " was adopted by the United Nations in 1996 .  This is because the international community confirmed that the world would ultimately move toward a " nuclear-free " prospect and believed that the major nuclear arms powers would , in the end , gradually achieve balanced arms disarmament on the basis of cooperation among major powers .  
The starting point of this assumption ( namely , guarding against the threat of missile attacks ) of the United States failed to convince Germany . A considerably large number of personages from the military and political circles believed that this is not reasonable .  Because during the Cold War period , the threat of the nuclear arsenal of the Soviet Union to West Europe was many , many times bigger than it is now , did not the East-West balanced posture based on nuclear deterrent ensure the security of Germany ?  
In just three weeks after President Bush entered the White House , he was anxious to increase military spending again .  The objective is to make the United States , which presently holds the largest store of nuclear weapons and the world 's most advanced and strongest standing military , always capable of maintaining its absolute military dominance , as well as further distance itself from all other major countries ' military capacity and consolidating the US position as the world 's " only superpower " .  
The operational concept of " full dimensional protection " which was proposed by the US military in 1996 calls for the establishment of both offensive and defensive measures to deal with information warfare , guided missiles , and nuclear , biological , and chemical weapons of mass destruction .  
Deputy Chief of General Staff Wu Quanxu , who instructed the drill , claimed that to protect the people 's personal and property safety and to minimize the loss from the possible nuclear accidents , the PLA has established and perfected the rescue and commanding system , whereby the servicemen are combined with the people , the peacetime need is combined with the wartime need , and the three armed services are integrated , and has already possessed the capabilities of providing rapid rescue to all sorts of nuclear accidents .  
This reporter noticed from the scene of the drill that it took only a dozen of minutes during the whole process from the nuclear accident rescue and commanding center , that was organized by the army , the navy , and the air force , received the report of " nuclear accident " to the switching on of the emergency and rescue commanding automatic system and the transmission of rescue order to the three armed forces .  
Wu Quanxu , deputy chief of the General Staff Department , who had come to direct the training exercise , told us reporters : In order to protect people 's life and property and reduce to a minimum possible losses during a nuclear accident , the PLA has established and refined a rescue command system marked by integration of military forces with civil forces , peacetime needs with wartime needs , and forces of three services and have cultivated capabilities of launching an emergency rescue operation in all types of nuclear power accidents .  
These officials believe that the new US administration has two " nails in the eye and thorns in the flesh " : The first is what Americans say is Iraq 's concealed underground biological and chemical weapons stores , and the second is the nuclear command centers which , they say , Russia is hurrying to build , hidden deep in the mountains .  
If the target firing tests of the unmanned Stealth fighter are successful , and the program for development of the new type of nuclear weapons is approved , this will mean that the Bush Administration will pour more and more funds into developing futuristic military technology in the hope of maintaining the US hegemonist status in the world through pursuing absolute superiority in military technology ; and still more , it will mean that the United States will make the world still less peaceful and secure , and this is bound to trigger a large-scale arms race worldwide .  
Robert Wilson , a thermonuclear weapons expert at Princeton University , warned that the US military has simply got dizzy , as there can not be any such thing as a nuclear weapon that can destroy enemy underground bunkers without threatening the local inhabitants .  
Academician Pan said : With regard to the chronic effect of radiation , on the basis of analyzing and studying large amounts of the existing data , the UN Scientific Committee on the Radiation Effect of Atomic Energy has drawn a conclusion : apart from an increase in thyroid gland cancer observed among children exposed to radiation , no major members of the public have been found to be physically affected in relation to ionizing radiation 14 years after the Chernobyl nuclear accident .  
During the visit , Shi Yunsheng also respectively met with Kelche , chief of staff the French armed forces ; Le Chiavez , the French defense minister 's foreign affairs adviser ; and others .  He visited the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle , a La Fayette-class frigate equipped with guided missiles , and a strategic missile nuclear submarine - - which are the French Navy 's latest vessels , and France 's naval college .  
The exhibition reflected Tsinghua 's major scientific and technological innovations as well as the achievements attained in the tackling of major technological hurdles , basic research , and technological research for national defense .  The fields involved information , nuclear energy and technology , life science and technology , new materials , energy and environment , and advanced manufacturing .  
In recent years , India has formulated a military strategy of " guarding against China northward , fighting against Pakistan westward , dominating the Indian Ocean southward , and expanding its sphere of influence eastward " in addition to its efforts to build nuclear deterrent power .  Expanding its sphere of influence eastward means extending its sphere of influence to the South China Sea and a part of the Pacific region .  
The article notes that while the United States indeed faces certain new threats in the " new strategic environment " that has appeared after the Cold War , the main threat the United States faces today is not intercontinental ballistic missiles , but terrorism , such as the ignition of chemical , biological , or nuclear weapons that terrorists have smuggled into US ports . 
A series of erroneous policies , such as the sudden announcements on the termination , and then the resumption of the construction of the fourth nuclear plant and the use of large sums from the " national stabilization fund " to support the stock market in order to fulfill political promises , have wasted energy , resulting in the loss of hope for Taiwan in the next decade .  
the development of enterprises in the war industry will promote the development of the US economy ; the building of the super shield will guarantee the United States ' absolute security and offset the nuclear deterring capacity of other nuclear states and shake off the binding of the anti-missile treaty , thus leading to the establishment of a new world security system with the United States at the center .  All these factors were included in the strategic consideration of the United States .  
The Gulf War and Kosovo War have demonstrated the trend of information war .  The United States has realized that , under the situation of a new military revolution , the pattern of future war will have a qualitative difference from a mechanized war with nuclear weapons .  US military strategy must be adjusted to suit the changing patterns of war .  
Under the situation of weakness of comprehensive national strength and being inferior to NATO in conventional forces , nuclear weapons will remain an effective deterrent power of Russia in the future period and the " tower of strength " to support Russia 's desire to be a major military power .  
In its annual report released on 31 May the Defense Ministry of India once again spread the sheer fallacy of the so-called " theory of China threat " , alleging that there is an exceptionally great imbalance in nuclear power between China and India with China enjoying a huge superiority , that " all major cities in India are within the range of China 's guided missiles " and , fabricating rumors out of thin air , that China is assisting Pakistan in developing the latter 's missile and nuclear capability .  
Since the nuclear tests , India has stepped up the process to become nuclear armed in disregard of international community 's opposition .  Successively , it has established the " minimum nuclear deterrence " strategy , called for the establishment of a " three in one " nuclear strike system , frequently carried out various kinds of guided missile tests , and stepped up importing and developing advanced fighter planes .  
Quite a few serving generals , and retired generals who have just left active service , maintained : Taiwan has to develop such weapons as medium-range missiles for the sake of strategic deterrent , even if such missiles are armed with no nuclear warheads .  They stated : The more the mainland economy develops , the more deterrent Taiwan 's medium-range missiles will have .  
Ground-to-air missiles , aviation missiles , ship-to-ship missiles , anti-tank missiles , conventional missiles , offensive tactical missiles , strategic nuclear missiles , and continental strategic missiles moved through Tiananmen Square , and almost all the new missile types from China 's guided missile family made their appearances .  
Many large-scale military exercises have shown the newest achievements that China 's military has obtained from the traditional " three attacks and three defenses " - - attacking tanks , planes , and airborne troops , and defending against nuclear , chemical , and biological attacks - - to the " new three attacks and three defenses " of attacking stealth aircraft , cruise missiles , and helicopter gun ships , and defending against precision strikes , electronic jamming , and reconnaissance and surveillance .  
While facing the overbearing offensive launched by the United States , to preserve its own national strategic and security interests , on the one hand , Russia insisted that the ABM Treaty could not be revised or abolished and indicated that if the United States deploys the national missile defense system , Russian will take corresponding countermeasures , including increasing the quantity of nuclear warheads , and even threatened to scrap other concluded treaties on reducing nuclear weapons ;  
So far India has not decided to shrink back from its nuclear weapons development program ; on the contrary it is stepping up the development of various missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads , including ICBM 's with a range exceeding 20,000 km , and three months ago it carried out a major nuclear war exercise close to the India-Pakistan border ; why then has the United States decided to lift the sanctions at this time ?  
Then , under Helen 's command , the US special mixed fleet turned and fled toward the open waters .  In 1996 , when the PLA conducted a military exercise including test-firing its guided missiles , the United States also sent aircraft carriers to the Taiwan Strait . After the PLA 's nuclear submarines departed from their military port and disappeared in the vast seas , the US aircraft carriers immediately left the region .  
He said : By adopting a foreign policy of going our own way , the Bush Administration will disrupt international security , hurt our economic and environmental protection interests , and stop a historical chance for us to agree with China and Russia on limiting weapons and reducing nuclear weapons .  " These examples demonstrate that a country 's unilateral actions can not possibly form a lasting strategic framework that has the submission of all other countries . "  
The scientist Lee Wen-ho , born in Taiwan , has made special trips to China and held discussions and exchanges with Chinese nuclear scientists , moreover he still has " convenient conditions for contacts , and for dropping and transferring top secret reports , and it is completely possible that he has revealed to China material on America 's most sophisticated nuclear weapons technology . "  
But nuclear deterrence can never reach the fringe territories and the hot zones where the major powers ' interests overlap , and as far as the medium-sized and small countries are concerned , war is still an effective political means , and because their instruments of war are relatively simple , wars that erupt in those regions are still going to be traditional wars , and the modes of combat are still going to be the traditional forms of anti-personnel firepower .  
Thus , although a formation of U.S . aircraft carriers had shown up more than 100 nautical miles east of Taiwan to make its military presence known during our army 's military exercises in 1996 , it had not actually sailed into the Taiwan Straits . Moreover , as soon as the U.S . forces learned that a number of Chinese nuclear submarines had lifted anchor and left the port , the aircraft carrier battle group immediately moved back 100 nautical miles .

In order to achieve its strategic intention of building a " US unipolar world , " the United States aims to possess the world 's most advanced conventional and nuclear weapons and to maintain the world 's most powerful conventional and nuclear arsenal and to comprehensively raise its technical superiority , in a bid to ensure its " overwhelmingly superior dominant status in every kind of conflict " and " successfully fight two major theater wars that occur almost simultaneously . "  
In spite of the extremely low probability of a release of nuclear radioactive substance from nuclear power stations and nuclear facilities , various countries are taking strict preventive and nuclear emergency measures to prevent the damage to and adverse effect on the environment and public if a serious nuclear accident should happen by any chance .  
As regards the fourth nuclear plant , whose construction has begun , involving some NT36.4 billion of construction funds ( with more than 30 percent of the project completed ) to date , Taiwan 's new leader stated : The issue of scrapping or building the fourth nuclear plant is still at an appraisal stage .  It is by no means a simple question of right or wrong .  We have to take into account issues like how much we would lose if the " fourth nuclear plant " were not built ;  
The remarks of Xin Qi , a Chinese expert on the Taiwan issue , made at a discussion held recently by the Society for the Chinese in western America were reported by a newspaper under an eye-catching title of " Surely attack if independence , and surely win if attacking - - no fear of launching a nuclear war to fight a decisive battle . "  The newspaper also claimed that by voicing the " appalling words , " he will " definitely reinforce his image of commonly deemed the spokesman for the People 's Liberation Army . "  
They said they started the war to keep stable the Yugoslav Federation 's situation and to halt military conflicts and disputes , namely , with good intentions , but what followed was : The people were plunged into misery and suffering , the national economy fell back 20 years , and the natural environment and people 's lives were threatened by prolonged pollution from nuclear radiation and chemical and poisonous gases We can not help asking : Can a war solve any problem ? 
The two sides are committed to a world free from nuclear , biological or chemical weapons .  They stressed that the international regime for eliminating and prohibiting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction should be permanently and indiscriminately applicable to all regions and countries with no exception .  
And at the same time both sides took note of the legitimate rights of any country for peaceful uses of nuclear energy , chemical and biological technology in a transparent manner under the supervision of the relevant international organizations .  
He believes : If the plan for star wars is approved , the consequences of global arms race will be very serious : It will undermine existing international agreements on arms and on destruction of nuclear weapons , including international treaties banning nuclear tests , treaties on reducing strategic weapons , and agreements on controlling and stopping nuclear weapons .  
The United States has already possessed the world 's most advanced nuclear and conventional weapons and now it is making great efforts to develop NMD . This goes against the trend of the times and is also unfavorable to international arms control and efforts in disarmament .  It will have a serious and negative impact on maintaining a global and regional strategic balance and stability in the 21st century .  
With regard to the attempt of the United States to deploy its advanced TMD [ theatre missile defense ] in northeast Asia in the course of developing its NMD , Sha Zukang pointed out that this has constituted a direct threat to the effectiveness of China 's existing limited nuclear force .  
At today 's news conference held by the Foreign Ministry , Sun Yuxi , while answering a reporter 's question regarding the failure of the US missile interception test , said : The US development of the NMD system will break the global strategic equilibrium and stability , hinder the nuclear disarmament process , spoil the efforts of the international community on non-proliferation , and may trigger off another round of the arms race .  This is against the interests of all nations across the world , including the United States itself .  
He will have an official meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin tomorrow morning .  After the meeting , the two sides are expected to sign a joint declaration on promoting the development of bilateral relations , accelerating the process of multipolarization , and opposing the theater missile defense [ TMD ] system .  The two sides will also sign a series of documents on cooperation in the spheres of nuclear energy , economy and trade , crude oil and gas , communications , banking , education , and culture .  
Thanks to this " three attacks and three defenses " training , all military units generally acquired the skills of attacking tanks , aircraft , and paratroopers and the skills of defending against nuclear attack , chemical warfare , and biological weapons .  At the same time , People 's Liberation Army [ PLA ] training has developed by leaps and bounds as a result .  
To further intensify scientific and technological cooperation , the Chinese Government and the Japanese Government have decided to cooperatively develop a new round of 89 scientific and technological projects in the biological , nuclear energy , agricultural , medical , resources , and environmental protection fields .  
In the several years when Wen Ho Lee was investigated and prosecuted and in the days when the Cox Report was out , some quite reputable media in the United States tore off the " fair , objective , and factual " mask and , totally disregarding the most basic journalistic ethics , showered false accusations on China about the stealing of US nuclear secrets , and fanned up enmity against China among unknowledgeable American people .  
It is closed that there is great potential for cooperation of mutual benefit between China and Russia . For example , cooperation in the fields of petroleum , natural gas , nuclear energy , machine building , civil aviation , telecommunications and aviation [ sic ] will be discussed by the Chinese and Russian prime ministers during their regular meeting in Beijing this October .  
The 44th session of the IAEA General Conference , which started on 18 September , will review the IAEA 's 1999 annual report , as well as reports on stepping up international cooperation in nuclear safety , radiation safety , and radioactive waste safety , on intensifying the IAEA 's technological cooperation , and on preventing illicit trafficking in nuclear materials . 
This reporter has learned from the China National Nuclear Corporation that on 26 September , China and Pakistan held a ceremony in Islamabad , capital of Pakistan , to sign a temporary acceptance certificate for Pakistan 's Chashma Nuclear Power Plant , the first nuclear power plant designed , built , and exported by China .  
In a special article , China Times described the coming together and eventual parting of ways between Chen and Tang as " the nuclear explosion of the Chen-Tang system " with devastating results to all sides , saying that it not only put a full-stop to " government of the whole people " but cast unpredictable variables to the already disturbing political situation .  
In recent years , the China Research Institute of Atomic Energy Science has been geared toward facilitating perspective and basic researches .  It has been designated as a comprehensive research base for nuclear science and technology .  Its four key missions of scientific studies are to maintain China 's status as a nuclear power , to facilitate a sustained development of nuclear energy , to conduct studies of basic nuclear science , and to industrialize nuclear technology .  
The nuclear convention signed between the DPRK and the United States in Geneva in October 1994 has stipulated clearly that the two countries would realize complete normalization in political and economic relations , and the two countries would establish liaison offices in each other 's capital until a diplomatic relationship at ambassadorial level is built .  
After Taiwan 's " Executive Yuan " announced the halt of the construction of the fourth nuclear plant , it set off an intense backlash from the opposition parties .  [ In remarks ] targeted at the problem of the halt of the construction of the fourth nuclear plant , James Soong indicated today that an absolute majority of public opinion supports construction of the " fourth nuclear plant " .  
However , because some mass organizations threatened to surround the Legislative Yuan to express their anti-nuclear opinions and dismiss legislators who advocate the construction of nuclear power plant and because some legislators received threats , those legislators who support the nuclear power plant have to ask for personal protection .  The Legislative Yuan is permeated with an atmosphere of howling winds before a storm .  The Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan has maintained a high degree of caution to prevent accidents .  
It was learned that regarding the new government 's immediate announcement on the cessation of the building of the fourth nuclear power plant only half an hour after the " meeting between Chen Shui-bian and Lien Chan " last Friday , Lien Chan indeed was unhappy and had some doubts .  Lien Chan held that " it is imperative to maintain some social morality and justice . "  
Hoping to Possess Sophisticated Secret WeaponsAccording to the informed source , the meeting emphasized that in view of the ever-changing international situation and the havoc wrought by hegemonism and power politics in the new period , our army must possess high-tech deterrence conventional weapons , high-tech deterrence nuclear weapons and two or three types of high-tech deterrence sophisticated secret weapons to guarantee national security and territorial integrity and ensure that China 's sovereignty will not be violated . 
Since the reform and opening up began , they have , in chronological order , undertaken the construction of Daya Bay , Qinshan , Lingao , and other nuclear power generation projects and accomplished , with flying colors , a batch of ordnance-related scientific research projects , including the electron-positron collider , controlled nuclear fusion device , low-temperature heat reactor , high-temperature gas-cooled reactor , submarine base , and space simulation capsule .  
The Statistics Department pointed out that , during the period from 1994 to 1998 , our country purchased $ 13.3 billion , or 11.9 percent , of regular weapons ( excluding controlled nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , and biochemical weapons ) sold around the world , making our country the world 's largest weapon importing country .  The major countries where Taiwan purchased its weapons from were : The United States , $ 8.1 billion ; and France , $ 5.15 billion .  
The US military 's expansion of its nuclear submarine base in Guam has a relatively particular purpose .  It wants to use Guam as an experimental site for US nuclear submarines in the new century .  For instance , a submarine 's deep-water communications and data image transmission and the suitability of undersea launching of missiles under new fighting conditions can all be tested at the base in Guam .  
By 2005 , two new-generation submarines and a new nuclear submarine will be commissioned and 15 submarines will complete their reequipment and renovation ; destroyers and frigates will have their electronics , radar and missile equipment renewed ; and 10 new-type naval vessels will be launched and some of them will be armed with deterrent weapons .  
Russia has three major weapons : strategic nuclear missiles , anti-satellite weaponry , and directional anti-missile high-energy laser and particle beam weaponry .  But Russia today does not have the money to continue to develop them .  Taking advantage of the other 's problem , the United States is setting a trap for Russia by using its NMD program to egg Russia on to develop high-expense anti-missile system , thereby causing Russia 's national economy to be bled white by huge outlay of military expenses .  
The licensing control on strategic commodities aims at ensuring Hong Kong 's continued access to high - technology goods and up-to-date technology which are essential for maintaining Hong Kong 's status as a regional centre of finance , trade , banking and telecommunication , and preventing Hong Kong from being used as a conduit for the proliferation of strategically - sensitive goods , arms , munitions or chemical / biological / nuclear weapons .  
Furthermore , hydraulic power has been exploited to the maximum in Taiwan already . Though there is great potential in the development of nuclear power , the sources of raw material are mainly overseas , and the radioactive residue is difficult to dispose of .  
Though progress has been made in heavy industry , and nuclear weapons have been produced , India 's grassroots social construction work lags far behind . Most of the people are poverty-stricken , and disparity in the distribution of wealth between rich and poor is tremendous . When floods and droughts occur , many die of hunger . " What uses are such highly educated people to their country if they live in exile ? "  
To date , except for the fourth nuclear power plant , on which work has temporarily been stopped , for the Tai-chung coal-fired power plant , the number two northern highway , and the Taipei metropolitan rapid transit system , for which preparatory work is being undertaken , and for the Ssuchunghsi reservoir and the Mingtan electric power peaking facility , the plans for which are now being examined , the other 24 projects are all under way and from 20 to 70 percent completed , so that in general things can be considered to be running smoothly .  
However , in the face of this rapidly growing cohort , all countries have exhibited chaos . Some elderly are rejected from the nuclear family or are thought of as an unproductive burden on the national economy . Even more disconcerting is that health care for the elderly can lead not only to family frictions , but can overwhelm national health care systems . Aging is an unavoidable process for us .  
Liu Yu-shan , secretory-general of the Council for Economic Planning and Development , notes that right now the projects in which the Europeans , Americans , and Japanese are most interested are the high-tech ones . The main ones can be categorized as transportation ( the mass rapid transit system and the high-speed railroad ) , energy ( the fourth nuclear power and electrical generators ) , environmental protection ( incinerators ) , and the modernization of the postal and telecommunications networks .  
The places to which they have scattered are unusual , as well . Some live high up at the Sun Yat-sen Hall atop Yangming Mountain , and some live down low near Keelung Harbor . Some can be found in tightly guarded army ammunition factories , and in nuclear power plants . Several generations of students and teachers meet to have fun together , and everybody feels as close as one big family .  
For example , Taipower has always claimed that the costs of nuclear power are low . But as yet there is no way to finally dispose of nuclear waste , and it will impose enormous costs on the next generation . The maximum for compensation in the event of an accident at a nuclear power plant has been set at NT $ 1.4 billion , and the law says that anything over that amount will be paid by the government , thus artificially lowering the calculated costs of nuclear power immensely .  
For over a year , there have been frequent reports of Taiwan 's taxi drivers being involved in street protests and disputes . They have featured in campaigns ranging from opposition to the system of affiliation to cab companies and the introduction of compulsory third-Party motor insurance , to protests against the planned fourth nuclear power plant .  
Two years ago , preparations were being made for Taiwan 's fourth nuclear power plant , to be built in Kungliao Rural Township . When they began digging , they uncovered objects suspected of being ancient relics of the Ketagalan . Pan Huo-yen blocked the excavating machines with his own body , and the photograph of this act became a symbol of the conflict between culture and economic development .  
But from the point of view of international goodwill and the natural reaction most people have toward anything nuclear , it might have been best to give more attention to the issues raised by concerned observers . For example , Michael Kau , a scholar at Brown University in the US , and Fang Chien , a well-known environmental activist , pointed out that no one wants nuclear waste in their back yard , and disregarding the sentiments of a neighbor does not conform to Chinese ethics .  
A military gap ? Professor Chung has considerable confidence in the current naval forces of the ROC . He says that , leaving aside nuclear weapons , Taiwan 's maritime defense level , including ships , weapons systems , and personnel quality , is ahead of the PRC by 10 to 15 years .  
Following local opposition to the fourth nuclear power station , the sixth naphtha cracker and other major projects , Bayer of Germany has , almost on the eve of the start of construction work , called a halt to its plan to build a chemical plant in the Taichung Harbor zone . This followed the newly elected county magistrate 's insistence that a referendum would be called to decide whether the plan should be allowed to go ahead . Although the central government is attempting to mediate , the future of the Bayer plan is now uncertain .  
In an industrial society , as extended families living under one roof have given way to smaller and smaller nuclear families , the family can no longer serve the same functions it once did in supporting the needs of all segments of the population . Yet traditional Eastern attitudes , morality and values rooted in thousands of years of history are not easy to change , and they have a big effect on how policy toward the elderly is set .  
But a name can not be changed on a whim-the content of courses and research programs has to be planned beforehand . Chou is also aware how quickly times are changing : even the situation five years from now can not be predicted , and someone who is only familiar with one branch of knowledge can not respond to change . The orientation of systems science is for students to learn how to " integrate " knowledge of different fields such as materials science , thermal flux and nuclear engineering .  
The PRC has an enormous undersea force and has been developing nuclear subs . Meanwhile , Taiwan has only four subs , two of which are re-fitted submarines used by the US in World War II ( they are outdated and useful only for training ) . The current ROC submarine force can not effectively undertake counter blockade missions . Therefore , the purchase of new submarines is urgent .  
These are some of the main arguments that constitute Lin 's 1988 book China 's Nuclear Weapons Strategy , which is now available for the first time in a Taiwan translation in Lin 's recently published The Nuclear Hegemon . Although China 's Nuclear Weapons Strategy was published back in 1988 , it is still very enlightening for readers today to find out how Communist China 's nuclear weapons strategy is very much tied to Chinese strategic tradition . Anyone studying Communist China 's military can not ignore the influence of traditional strategic culture .  
In sum , by reading Lin 's new book , The Nuclear Hegemon , the reader can enjoy , first , a systematic look back at Communist China 's long road to becoming a nuclear power and its subtle use of traditional Chinese strategic thinking , as seen through the eyes of a Chinese . The reader can also come to understand the true capabilities of the PLA through the essays on PLA military modernization .  
The public is very wary of the nuclear plant , however , and environmental groups have been engaged in a raging debate with plant supporters over industrial policy and nuclear safety . There have been numerous street demonstration against the plant , and many members of the Democratic Progressive Party , including former DPP chairman Lin Yi-hsiung , are among the plant 's leading detractors . Opposition to the plant is one of the DPP 's key policy positions .  
Since Chen Shui-bian assumed the presidency , however , the new administration has been concerned that a sudden termination of the nuclear plant might hamper economic development and strike a heavy blow to the business community . The administration accordingly instructed the Ministry of Economic Affairs ( MOEA ) to set up the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant Re-Evaluation Committee to weigh the relative merits of building versus scrapping the plant .  
The 15-member committee finished its three-month review on September 15 without coming to a conclusive decision , with individual committee members in sharp disagreement over the per-kilowatt cost of nuclear power , the cost of canceling construction , and the cost to society of having a nuclear plant in operation . Many have criticized the Re-Evaluation Committee as " a complete waste of money , time , and energy . "  
But in the months that followed the members of this team seemed to be marching to different drummers . They often contradicted each other , and their efforts seemed generally uncoordinated . A chorus of criticism rose up over the government 's handling of the Pachang Creek rescue incident , and criticism grew even more intense when the government moved to halt the construction of Taiwan 's fourth nuclear power plant .  
Plans for the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant have triggered an intense struggle between opponents of nuclear power and those more concerned about industrial development . A constitutional ruling by the Council of Grand Justices appears to have moved the debate back to square one , with the ruling and opposition parties slugging it out once again .

After work on the plant resumes , there will be neither an immediate nuclear risk nor an immediate benefit of power generation . But environmentalists are convinced that the marine habitat of Yenliao , lying within a marine resource conservation area immensely rich in both the number of species and their populations , will be devastated , and that the three-kilometer golden beach of fine quartz sand which runs from Yenliao to Fulung , one of the priceless ecological and tourist resources of the northeast coast , may be lost along with it .  
The Council for Economic and Development ( CEPD ) , which is supposed to take overall charge of economic development policy , failed to play its proper coordinating role . The Ministry of Economic Affairs was consumed by the struggle over nuclear power , and failed to pay enough attention to the need to adjust Taiwan 's industrial structure . The Ministry of Finance was busy trying to support share prices on Taiwan 's stock market , but in doing so resorted to measures that violated market principles .  
Although nuclear power does not produce greenhouse gases , the controversies that rage over the safety of nuclear plants and the disposal of nuclear waste are prohibitive ; nor does the COP encourage countries to develop nuclear energy . Thus , " renewable energy " sources such as wind and solar power , despite the high costs of researching and developing these alternatives , are inevitable . Next year Taiwan Power Company will finally take the plunge and invest a large amount of money in a wind power program .  
In the past Taiwan placed excessive importance on fossil fuels and nuclear energy , and created a monopoly of electrical power supply , thereby excluding opportunities for development of renewable sources of energy . Thus the President emphasized , " In the future we should , acting through liberalization of the power market and various subsidy measures , increase incentives for diversification of sources of energy . "  
( Laura Li / tr . by Anthony W . Sariti ) The recent referendum held in Pinglin Township favoring the opening of a Pinglin exit on the Taipei-Ilan Freeway led to the resignation of Environmental Protection Administrator Hao Lung-bin and focused public opinion on the issue of advisory referendums . The possibility that during the March presidential election next year referendums will be simultaneously held on entry into the World Health Organization , the fourth nuclear power station , and the reform of the National Assembly is also drawing close attention from observers .  
Before the 1960s , one third of Taiwan families were classified as " patriarchal families . " These were " extended families " consisting of both direct and co-lateral family members living together . After the 1980s the proportion of " blended families " ( a " stem " family composed of three directly related generations ) increased . Today it is the " nuclear family " of husband , wife and children that has become the norm .  
The search for alternative sources of energy has become an important issue worldwide . In Taiwan , the debate four years ago over whether to continue building a fourth nuclear power plant produced a popular consensus that the island should be made a nuclear-free zone . Thus we urgently need to find clean , safe , sustainable energy sources .  
Pakistan , saying it would conduct successive missile tests from 25th to 28th , paid no attention to UN 's call for constraint , having launched 2 missiles , which can be equipped with nuclear warheads .  One of the missiles was Hatf-v ( Ghauri ) missile that can hit targets deep inside India and the other was newly developed short ranged Ghaznavi missile .  
( AFP , Washington ) Citing the confidential assessment report from the Pentagon , a US defense official pointed out that if a nuclear war broke out between India and Pakistan , the worst scenario would be the loss of lives ranging from 9 million to 12-million .  That figure could merely be the instant death toll resulting from the nuclear war , not including the deaths from diseases , starvation and polluted water supplies that accompanied the war .  
At a time when the north and the south have signed a joint declaration of mutual non aggression and when the nuclear framework agreement between the DPRK and the U S has entered the stage of implementation , conditions are now ripe for Washington and Pyongyang to strike a new peace deal , which is also imperative , the paper said  
Iran fully adheres to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) on nuclear weapons , and all its atomic programs are based on " peaceful use of nuclear energy for medical , agricultural and energy generation purposes " and " within the framework of the internationally recognized absolute rights of any country "  
ukrainian foreign minister anatoly alenko in his written speech at the meeting said ukraine posed no nuclear threat to europe for the buttons of the nuclear weapons were controlled by russia ukraine was only waiting for a " safe environment "  
Sergeyev told a press that NATO 's new concept has made it imperative for Russia to review some of the principles of the national military theory designed to defend Russia 's security , saying that the revision of the military theory will involve the entire armed forces , including the nuclear deterrent  
It may refer to the total of the future doses committed by that source or unit of practice , as for instance , the collective effective dose committed by atmospheric nuclear explosions or by one year of medical exposures .  
Notwithstanding the positive initiative taken by the major nuclear Powers since the end of the cold war , there is still a need to establish a close link between disarmament and international peace in the years ahead .  
The primary threat to humankind is now posed not by the possibility of the eruption of a nuclear conflict between the major Powers , but by regional crises of a national , ethnic or religious nature .  
However , even more worrying is the potential proliferation of nuclear , chemical , biological and ballistic missiles - the danger of their falling into the wrong hands .  
As agreed , separate expert groups in the chemical , biological , ballistic missile and nuclear areas met to pursue the objectives outlined above .  
Because of the physical nature of such material , the uncontrolled movement of nuclear material , in conjunction with the interests of organized crime , creates favourable conditions for the production of the socalled personal weapons of mass destruction .  
The principle has been referred to and applied at the national level in relation to human activities with potentially severe effects on human health ( engineering , the pharmaceutical and chemical industries , nuclear power plants , etc . ) .  
The key to resolving the nuclear issue is a fair and stepbystep solution befitting the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea 's unique status based on its temporary suspension of the effectuation of its announced withdrawal from NPT .  
Determined to promote regional cooperation for the development and practical application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in the interest of sustainable social and economic development of the African continent ,  
Calls upon all States to take urgent , effective measures to terminate all collaboration with the racist regime of South Africa , in particular in the military and nuclear fields , and to refrain from entering into other relations which run counter to the maintenance of existing sanctions against the regime in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and of the Organization of African Unity ;  
Noting with grave concern the extensive links and collaboration between the apartheid regime of South Africa and certain countries in the political , diplomatic , economic , nuclear , military and other fields , and the growing military and nuclear cooperation between racist Pretoria and Israel ,  
Condemns the extensive links and collaboration between the apartheid regime of South Africa and certain countries in the political , diplomatic , economic , nuclear , military and other fields , and the growing military and nuclear cooperation between the racist regime and Israel ;  
At its organizational session , the Commission also decided that the items entitled " Process of nuclear disarmament in the framework of international peace and security , with the objective of the elimination of nuclear weapons " and " Review of the Declaration of the 1990s as the Third Disarmament Decade " would be concluded at its 1995 substantive session .  
In certain key areas , there is an evident and growing trend in the trafficking and use of chemical and fissionable materials in conflicts , as well as the hidden or overt desire of some countries to possess nuclear weapons .  
High expectations violently oscillated with the doldrums of despair ; the exuberant relief of peoples ridding themselves of totalitarian rule alternated with the miserable anguish of occupation and ethnic cleansing ; rays of hope were paralleled by violent explosions of civil strife ; nuclear non-proliferation was countered by a devastating spread in the traffic in conventional weaponry ; peace for some was matched by wanton slaughter for others .  
Hungary had supported from the very beginning the idea of indefinite extension , for we are convinced that this major international instrument promotes stability by preventing the spread of the nuclear arsenal and at the same time aims at the orderly development of nuclear cooperation for peaceful purposes .  
We also stress the need to complete without delay comprehensive and verifiable treaties to ban nuclear-weapon tests and to cut off the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices .  
We are confident that a Middle East zone free of nuclear and weapons of mass destruction would enhance the peace process and lead to a situation wherein enormous financial resources would be saved and channelled towards the economic prosperity and social development of the peoples of the region .  
However , the nuclear testing undertaken right afterwards caused disillusion in international public opinion and has made it imperative for all nations first and foremost the nuclear-weapon States to redouble their efforts in a fully responsible manner , so as to complete the comprehensive test-ban treaty in the course of the next year .  
It had a crash programme to build a nuclear weapon in 1990-1991 ; it had weaponized live biological agents , including the deadly botulin and anthrax organisms , weapons never before used in warfare ; it produced a far greater quantity of chemical weapons , in more diverse forms , than it had previously admitted ; and it deliberately kept these documents hidden from the United Nations Special Commission ( UNSCOM ) , even as it was claiming that all information had been handed over .  
Despite the end of the cold war , which has lessened the probability of nuclear conflict , the Earth continues to be an arena of murderous conflicts that cause unspeakable suffering and vast humanitarian tragedies .  
Civil and external wars could occur in regions where the possession of advanced weaponry , such as medium-range missiles with chemical , biological or even nuclear warheads , by ambitious and threatened regimes becomes a potentially lethal prospect . 
First , France has not announced its intention to continue its nuclear testing indefinitely ; on the contrary , we have stated our decision to complete it by engaging in a final series limited to a few tests , which will be concluded before 31 May 1996 .  
I am certain that the establishment of a special status , with international security guarantees , consolidated financial and technical assistance and moral incentives , for countries that renounce nuclear weapons would provide a tremendous impetus for expediting the process of nuclear disarmament .  
The global order can no longer be based solely on the special position of the anti-fascist coalition or the nuclear club , or on economic or military power ; rather , first and foremost , it should be based on the real contribution of individual countries to the prevention of every form of totalitarianism and to the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; on their role within global socio-economic development ; on their democratic achievement ; and on their regional importance .  
Social disintegration has increased , the vertical development of nuclear weapons has continued and civil wars and regional conflicts have broken out in most regions in a manner that has given the impression that the globe we live on has suddenly exploded .  
The Agency 's role as a centre for international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy was confirmed , and the IAEA was expressly recognized as the competent authority responsible for verifying compliance with safeguards agreements .  
Further , as effective national accounting and protection is the basic prerequisite for preventing nuclear material from falling into unauthorized hands , the Agency is conducting training courses in the implementation of State systems of accounting and control of nuclear material and in physical protection methods and technology .  
The existence of effective national accountancy and control systems , especially in those countries possessing sensitive nuclear material , and the existence of systems to ensure physical protection are crucial elements in fighting illicit trafficking . 
We believe that , even though States themselves are responsible for an adequate and effective level of physical protection against nuclear materials , the IAEA and other international organizations can play an important role in ensuring international cooperation , including by providing technical assistance to countries in fields other than law-enforcement .  
Ukraine considers that one of the possible ways to obtain an objective analysis of and to solve the problems connected with the Chernobyl accident would be to set up an international technological research centre which would deal with issues related to the elimination of the consequences of nuclear radiological accidents and in whose work leading experts from various countries in the world could participate .  
There is no doubt that the activities undertaken and the responsibilities shouldered by the Agency are worthy of our appreciation and respect in view of their positive returns with regard to the safety and security of the whole world , on the one hand , and , on the other , their contribution to social and economic development and other activities by facilitating the transfer of nuclear technologies for peaceful use in the developing countries .  
The challenge for the Agency in this connection is to keep providing credible assurances on States Parties ' compliance with their non-proliferation commitments in an increasingly volatile international security environment and amidst a rapid quantitative increase in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and constant advances in nuclear technology .  
On the international level , it must be acknowledged that , despite the modest progress achieved in the control of nuclear , chemical and conventional weapons , these weapons have unfortunately increased qualitatively and quantitatively to an alarming degree .  
These obligations include achieving complete nuclear disarmament , expanding the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , strengthening the role and enhancing the authority of the IAEA as the only international body competent to oversee the good-faith discharge of Member States ' responsibilities under the Treaty , ensuring the universality of the NPT as an urgent priority , and establishing the Middle East as a zone free from nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction .  
The end of the cold war had fuelled hopes that the United Nations , freed from nuclear and ideological confrontation , would devote its full attention to building a peaceful and more equitable world ; tackle the challenge of world poverty ; advance regional conflicts to resolution ; distribute the benefits of peace dividends ; and move towards fulfilling the unrealized premises of the Charter , especially with regard to collective security . 
It was with a deep understanding of global interdependence in the protection of environmental safety on the European continent that the President of Ukraine took the political decision to close the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , on condition that adequate international financial and material support be provided .  
Together with other countries , including Egypt , Malaysia supported Indonesia , which , speaking in its capacity as Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement , emphasized that the five declarations by the five nuclear Powers varied in terms of structure and content , as well as remaining devoid of any legal force .  
This is an objective that is supported by the international community as a whole but , unfortunately , no progress has been made towards its achievement because Israel , who had insisted on direct negotiations with the countries concerned before such a zone could be established now refuses to enter into any negotiations on arms limitation in the nuclear field within the multilateral working group on arms limitation and regional security . 
My Government also considers that all the steps and measures taken by the Israeli occupation authorities with the aim of altering the legal status and demographic character of the Palestinian and Arab occupied territories , particularly with regard to Al-Quds , are null and void and constitute a serious breach of international law .  Peace , security , stability and development in the Middle East require the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction in the region , including nuclear weapons .  
The Conference on Disarmament has advanced towards the comprehensive test-ban treaty through sustained but slow efforts , and it has failed to begin negotiations on a convention prohibiting the production of fissionable material for nuclear weapons or other explosive devices .  
There was also established a comprehensive phased programme with agreed time-frames for progressive and balanced reduction of stockpiles of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery , leading to their ultimate and complete elimination at the earliest possible time .  
At their meeting earlier this month , the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Caribbean Community again expressed grave concern at the recurring threat posed to the region through the marine transport of irradiated nuclear fuel , plutonium and high-level radioactive wastes .  
I express my fervent hope that the successful conclusion of the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) this year and the indefinite extension of the Treaty will help to strengthen its effective implementation and speed progress towards the ultimate goal of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons .  
In this connection I should like to state that an early conclusion of an effective and verifiable comprehensive test-ban treaty by 1996 would be fundamental to real progress towards the ultimate goal of complete nuclear disarmament and to the security of non-nuclear-weapon States .  
The Organization of American States , for example , stated on 13 September that nuclear tests being carried out in the South Pacific pose a potential risk to the health and security of surrounding States and their living resources and environment , and do not take into account the precautionary principle contained in the Rio Declaration on environment and development and in other regional agreements .  
The Assembly , considering that nuclear testing was not consistent with undertakings by the nuclear-weapon States at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference , deeply concerned about the potential negative effects of underground nuclear testing and sharing the alarm expressed internationally , regionally and nationally , would strongly deplore all current nuclear testing and urge the immediate cessation of all nuclear testing .  
Besides the fact that it continues to be the most universal and fundamental instrument for the prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons , its extension demonstrated the international community 's common desire to reject all weapons of mass destruction .  
As far as the statement my delegation made that morning is concerned and here I would say that I am speaking also for the other delegations that made statements we considered the statements to be factual and to truly reflect current global public opinion against nuclear testing , both in the South Pacific and elsewhere .  
It also dispatches the strong message to the countries involved in current nuclear testing that the international community neither welcomes nor approves of their outdated , digressive and intolerable behaviour .  
It would also be serious to accept the assertion that nuclear tests are harmless and safe in the absence of convincing evidence from independent , impartial international specialized institutions .  
With the support and active cooperation of Committee members , I am certain that the First Committee of the General Assembly , at this historic fiftieth session , will be able to further contribute substantially towards attaining our common objective a world free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and with a greatly reduced level of conventional weapons and of violence in general .  
In short , the practical achievement of that purpose in the present international context entails preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , further strengthening existing conventions in this field , pursuing the process of nuclear disarmament , limiting and reducing existing conventional arsenals and establishing confidence - and security-building measures .  
Apart from the obligations to prevent proliferation derived from the existing disarmament agreements , the European Union considers the measures taken on export controls to be useful instruments in the efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , their object being to stem proliferation without detriment to transfers of material , equipment and technology for peaceful purposes in the nuclear , chemical , biological and space-research fields .  
We are deeply convinced that by making the NPT a Treaty of indefinite duration the States parties ensured its continued role as the major international legal instrument providing a basic guarantee for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons worldwide .  
We agreed , in New York in May , to the determined pursuit of global reduction of nuclear weapons , with the ultimate goal of their elimination , and of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
China is ready to work with all the other countries concerned to push forward the work of the Conference on Disarmament in a balanced manner and to contribute to the conclusion of a fair and practicable cut-off convention that will enjoy universal participation and that will be beneficial to the process of nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation .  
Kenya looks forward to the commencement of negotiations on a non-discriminatory and universally applicable convention banning the production and stockpiling of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices , and supports the convening of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , especially as it will accelerate the negotiations on pending conventions in the field of disarmament .  
It should be recalled that the General Assembly , spurred on by the awesome threat posed by atomic weapons and by the disquieting prospect of a nuclear arms race , focused attention from the very beginning on questions of disarmament , and in considering the regulation , reduction and elimination of armaments , it adopted a number of principles , many of which have retained their validity and relevance .  
Throughout this period , worldwide alarm , reflected in numerous United Nations resolutions , grew over the fact that the threat posed by nuclear weapons remained the single most critical global issue .  
These were conspicuous by the lack of specific commitments concerning : an end to the qualitative aspects of nuclear armaments ; the process of nuclear disarmament within a time-bound framework and under multilateral auspices ; assurances of the orderly flow of technology for developing countries ; and the right of non-nuclear States to credible , unconditional and legally binding security assurances .  
Calls upon all States in the Middle East to take practical steps in appropriate forums aimed at making progress towards , inter alia , the establishment of an effectively verifiable Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction , nuclear , chemical and biological , and their delivery systems , and to refrain from taking any measures that preclude the achievement of this objective .  
It is to hoped that the three interlinked decisions on principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , on the strengthening of the review process of the Treaty , and on the indefinite extension will constitute a proper basis for the future effective and comprehensive implementation of the Treaty , bringing the world closer to the ultimate objective of achieving , at the earliest possible date , the cessation of the nuclear-arms race and nuclear disarmament .  
These steps , however , constitute only a technical management of the arms race , and are insufficient : they leave the international community far short of the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons recognized by the Final Document of the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , in 1978 .  
Secondly , the elimination of nuclear weapons , whether immediate or gradual , would certainly lead to the attainment of a world free of nuclear weapons and eventually of all weapons of mass destruction and would facilitate complete and general disarmament which , in turn , would ease tensions in the world at large and help redirect financial and other resources to economic and social development .  
It is a gap that requires intensive international efforts to assuage the deep concern over the nuclear States ' degree of respect for their commitments , particularly since the indefinite extension of the Treaty , and over their dedication to strengthening the Treaty to achieve universality , an essential prerequisite for the Treaty 's credibility and for strengthening the nuclear disarmament process , and , finally , for ensuring that humankind will be safe from nuclear conflagration .  
Despite the achievements of the first half of the Decade in reducing nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and also in limiting conventional weapons , the road towards the noble objective of the Third Disarmament Decade remains a long and winding one .  
The agenda item entitled Process of nuclear disarmament in the framework of international peace and security , with the objective of the elimination of nuclear weapons has been under consideration for several years in our Commission . For various reasons , the Commission has been unable to formulate a set of satisfactory guidelines for nuclear disarmament , thus falling short of people 's expectations . 
While the countries with the largest and most sophisticated nuclear and conventional arsenals have concluded some treaties on nuclear disarmament , it must be emphasized , however , that they have a special responsibility for disarmament and should make further efforts to implement those treaties in earnest so as to bring about further drastic cuts in their nuclear armaments .  
Secondly , and as a result , all Member States share a common interest in avoiding nuclear war and in achieving nuclear disarmament , and must therefore in future increase their efforts bilateral , regional and global on the basis of negotiations conducted in a broad spirit of genuine cooperation and good faith so as to strengthen the existing mechanisms for nuclear disarmament and to agree on new procedures for achieving it . 
At its organizational session , the Commission also decided that the items entitled \ x { e4f8 } rocess of nuclear disarmament in the framework of international peace and security , with the objective of the elimination of nuclear weapons and \ x { e4fa } eview of the Declaration of the 1990s as the Third Disarmament Decade would be concluded at its 1995 substantive session . " 
In this so-called new era in which bipolar confrontation no longer exists , it is especially regrettable that the international community should be unable to arrive at a firm commitment on nuclear disarmament and on the complete elimination of these weapons of mass destruction , which continue to endanger the very survival of the human race .  
" Noting with concern situations of extreme violence , such as those rooted in terrorism and its concomitant , international drug trafficking , which have brought about major changes in the survival strategies of poor rural families , prompting their forced displacement from their places of origin and rendering even more critical the situation of the women who then become the core of the nuclear family ,  
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
Stressing the growing importance of the symbiotic relationship between disarmament and development in current international relations , and recognizing the importance of promoting social and economic development and international cooperation on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy ,  
It was important that the strengthening of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime should be linked with broader international cooperation in the sphere of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , both at the bilateral level and within the framework of the relevant international organizations .  
The attainment of that goal meant the final elimination of nuclear weapons , since the existence of such weapons still constituted a serious threat to the main purpose of the United Nations - the maintenance of international peace and security .  36 .  In the view of his delegation , there were three available options for extending the Treaty : it could be extended for an indefinite period , for an additional fixed period , or for several successive periods .  
Mr . KISLYAK ( Russian Federation ) said that the Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was an international event of paramount importance in terms of the achievement of strategic stability .  The main task of the Conference was to reach a decision on the extension of the Treaty , inasmuch as all States - large and small , nuclear and non-nuclear alike - needed the Treaty and the Treaty 's effective operation must continue in the future .  
Nuclear establishments and the transport of nuclear material required appropriate physical protection , and States needed to have effective border controls so that they had control over what left their territory and were able to carry out their non-proliferation obligations not to permit sensitive nuclear materials to be transmitted to non-peaceful programmes or to terrorist groups .  
His delegation was convinced that the duration of the Treaty and its subsequent extensions should be explicitly linked to progress in nuclear disarmament and , more specifically , to the achievement of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty as a short-term objective .  It felt that China 's proposal of 1996 as the year to achieve that goal was realistic and reasonable .  
China hoped that the United States of America and the Russian Federation would implement existing nuclear-disarmament treaties as scheduled and carry out further drastic cuts in their respective nuclear arsenals , thereby creating the necessary conditions for the commencement of multilateral nuclear disarmament negotiations with the participation of all nuclear-weapon States in order to conclude a convention on the complete prohibition and total destruction of nuclear weapons . 
Thirdly , China held that all non-nuclear-weapon States parties , particularly the developing countries , were entitled under the NPT to engage in international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to acquire relevant technology and assistance for their national economic development . 
China , as a State party and particularly as a developing country with a considerable nuclear industrial capability , strictly abided by the relevant provisions of the NPT to ensure the exclusive use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and had engaged in cooperation with other developing countries in that field , which would increase as his country continued its economic reform and development . 
Four of the five nuclear-weapon States and some of their allies had taken a clear position on the Treaty 's indefinite and unconditional extension , but with regard to such matters as the pace of the negotiations on a complete test-ban treaty , peaceful nuclear explosions , the future of nuclear energy for civilian purposes and negative security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States , the overall impression was that it was business as usual .  
Interest in the subject first arose as the general public became increasingly aware of the [ potentially ] harmful nature and effects of the fallout from atmospheric nuclear tests and as it became apparent that no region could avoid being affected by radioactive debris . 
Thus , the United States made public its view that nuclear testing was important for the security of the Western alliance , which depended on the maintenance of a reliable nuclear deterrence and that , consequently , it could consider a comprehensive test-ban treaty only as a " long-term objective " whose realization must be sought in the context of radical nuclear arms reductions , expanded confidence-building measures and , particularly , improved verification capabilities .  
In the Final Declaration of the First Review Conference ( 1975 ) , 2 / which was adopted by consensus , the participants stated that the obligations undertaken under articles I and II of the Treaty had been faithfully observed by all parties , and that the continued strict observance of those articles remained central to the shared objective of averting the further proliferation of nuclear weapons .  
On 4 October 1994 , the Governments of China and of the United States issued a joint statement whereby the two Governments agreed to work together to promote the earliest possible achievement of a multilateral , non-discriminatory and effectively verifiable convention banning the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Noting with concern situations of extreme violence , such as those rooted in terrorism and its concomitant , international drug trafficking , which have brought about major changes in the survival strategies of poor rural families , prompting their forced displacement from their places of origin and rendering even more critical the situation of the women who then become the core of the nuclear family ,  
I should be grateful if you could have the text of this letter and its annexes circulated as a document of the General Assembly , under item 68 of the preliminary list of items to be included in the provisional agenda of the fiftieth session , entitled " Conclusion of effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons " , and of the Security Council . * A / 50 / 50 . 
In the fifth subparagraph , after the words " an effective commitment to global , coordinated action " , add the words : " on mitigating and overcoming the consequences of natural disasters and major technological and anthropogenic catastrophes , such as that at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and their like , as well as on . . . " ;  
TACF provides assistance and training to developing countries in the use of nuclear technology for power generation , and for scientific , resource , agricultural , medical , environmental and industrial applications , as well as for activities relating to radiation protection , safety of nuclear installations and waste management .  
Efforts should be made to remove those unreasonable restrictions on transfer of nuclear energy technology so as to help the developing countries master the technology for peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to create favourable conditions for the establishment of a new international cooperative relationship in the field of nuclear energy .  
Accusations , such as producing and stockpiling chemical weapons and trying to develop nuclear weapons and building up conventional arms , are concocted apparently in order to frighten Iran 's neighbours , justify an illegitimate foreign military presence in the Persian Gulf , and impose a costly and unnecessary arms sale to the countries of the region .  
Needless to say that these allegations are mainly propagated by a Government which has been the primary supporter and sponsor of Israel 's State-sponsored terrorism , of its aggressive policies , and of its production of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , and has also backed despotic Governments which have not experienced parliamentarianism , consultation and elections in their political life even for a single day .  
For exports to a non-nuclear-weapon State not party to the Treaty , source or special fissionable material either directly transferred , or produced , processed , or used in the facility for which the transferred item is intended , shall not be diverted to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ;  
I have the honour to forward to you the text of a paper providing information on the activities and views of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on the three underlying objectives of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons : to prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons ; to provide a sound basis for international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy ; and to encourage negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to disarmament .  
NPT has become a strong barrier against the spread of nuclear weapons and a standard of civilized behaviour on the part of States at the current time with the rapid structural changes occurring in the world .  
At the same time , the practical activities of IAEA in implementing the safeguards should not hamper scientific and technical development or international cooperation by States in the peaceful use of nuclear energy and should be based on optimum utilization of the Agency 's human and material resources .  
The Russian Federation remains faithful to the principles of equitable international cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy and providing assistance to developing countries and regions of the world in satisfying their wishes on the basis of non-discrimination , if they are legitimate and do not run counter to the Treaty .  
It is the Russian Federation 's firm position that the Treaty , as a major international legal document of the nuclear age ensuring an optimum balance in terms of halting the spread of nuclear weapons , nuclear disarmament and cooperation in the peaceful uses of the atom , must be extended indefinitely and unconditionally .  Such a decision by the Conference will lay the foundation for further progress in the twenty-first century towards a non-nuclear world in the future .  
Since then , the country has removed strategic and tactical nuclear weapons , closed scores of bases and demobilized many thousands of military personnel , transferring to local authorities the responsibility of providing them with housing and basic services .  
However , the United States Administration , together with the south Korean puppet army , has , since 1976 , staged " team spirit " joint military exercises against us each year , mobilizing nuclear weapons instead of coming to the talks , and even cancelled the already proclaimed reduction plan of American troops in south Korea , in July 1979 .  
Section III of the IAEA 's seventh semi-annual report ( document S / 1995 / 287 dated 11 April 1995 ) on the implementation of the IAEA 's plan for ongoing monitoring and verification of Iraq 's compliance with the relevant obligations specified in UNSC resolutions 687 ( 1991 ) and 715 ( 1991 ) , addressed the implications of two , single page , documents which were represented as official Iraqi correspondence , generated in April / May 1994 , suggesting the reconstitution of a nuclear weapons programme .  
Military doctrines of the States in the region should be exclusively defensive and in all respects adapted to the international agreements on restricted use of military force and non-use of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons ;  
A special effort was made to bring to the Conference experts from industry , public and private , and to emphasize the practical issues and options of the conversion process .  The subjects covered included the nuclear industry , military machines , shipbuilding , electronics , aeronautical and aerospace industries , information , intellectual property and international cooperation .  
The Forum expressed its support for the establishment of a credible civil nuclear liability regime including adequate compensation for the victims of transboundary damage in accordance with the principles of the Rio Declaration by incorporating a dedicated transboundary fund of sufficient size .  
NULLThe Forum expressed its support for the establishment of a credible civil nuclear liability regime including adequate compensation for the victims of transboundary damage in accordance with the principles of the Rio Declaration by incorporating a dedicated transboundary fund of sufficient size .  
The Ministers expressed their support for the completion by the Conference on Disarmament of the negotiations on a universal and internationally and effectively verifiable comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty no later than 1996 as well as the early conclusion of negotiations on a non-discriminating and universally applicable convention banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Requirements were outlined in a 1992 guidance document and IAEA provides a standard basis of reference with the International Nuclear Event Scale , which allows a common understanding of nuclear events among the technical community involved , the media and the public .  
NULL CONTINI ( France ) , speaking in exercise of the right of reply , said that his delegation deeply regretted the surprising , arbitrary and unjust connection drawn at the previous meeting by the representative of Papua New Guinea between the elimination of racism and nuclear testing . 
Strongly support United Nations , regional and national efforts on arms control , limitation and disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , in all aspects , and other weapons of mass destruction , including biological and chemical weapons and other forms of particularly excessively injurious or indiscriminate weapons , in pursuit of our common commitment to a world free of all these weapons ;  
The traditional mechanisms of the international codification process had also changed and new challenges had emerged which necessitated a quick and effective response to legal emergencies ; thus , under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency , two multilateral conventions had been adopted in 1986 relating to early warning and assistance in the case of nuclear accidents .  
However , the international community 's determination to confront the new menace of illicit trafficking in nuclear material , on which the Agency is now developing a valuable database , should not distract attention from the continuing need to maintain vigilance over the dumping of radioactive wastes and other highly toxic substances in the territories of developing countries .  
An initiative put forward by the President of Russia , Mr . Yeltsin , has received broad international backing that is , the initiative on the holding in the spring of 1996 of a summit meeting on issues of nuclear security , to consider pressing problems in this area and define ways to solve them , in both the short and the long term .  
We continue to support the multifaceted activity of the Agency in such areas as halting illicit trafficking in nuclear materials , enhancing the level of their physical protection , and preparing an international convention to deal with radioactive wastes .  
On the contrary , at that meeting the participants had unanimously adopted the Brisbane Declaration , which called upon France , amongst other things , to conduct a prior assessment of any major project such as nuclear testing on the marine environment , and to make its data and studies available to the international community for independent and comprehensive assessment .  
Instead of imposing sanctions on the developing countries to prevent them from acquiring nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and for development , thereby compelling them to acquire cheap nuclear technology equipped with minimum safety features and thus maximizing the risk of accidents , the developed countries must provide the developing countries with state-of-the-art nuclear technology equipped with the highest safety standards .  
The determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goals of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
The determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goals of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
Fully convinced that an enlarged membership is desirable in order to take advantage of the current propitious international climate to negotiate and conclude , on the solid basis of a more representative participation , a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty and other important agreements requiring universal adherence ,  
Noting the expressed determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States to pursue systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
Strongly support United Nations , regional and national efforts on arms control , limitation and disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , in all aspects , and other weapons of mass destruction , including biological and chemical weapons and other forms of particularly excessively injurious or indiscriminate weapons , in pursuit of our common commitment to a world free of all these weapons ;  
Appreciating the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [ 2 ] / and acknowledging the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
Heads of Government emphasized the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
My Government therefore finds it disappointing that sponsors of draft resolution A / C . 1 / 50 / L . 39 were apparently unable to accept even a cross-reference to the contribution made to enhanced international security by the continuing strict adherence of non-nuclear-weapon States to multilateral and legally binding non-proliferation undertakings that are verified by full-scope nuclear safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency .  
The determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goals of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control , and invites them to keep States Members of the United Nations duly informed of the progress and efforts made ;  
Therefore , my delegation had proposed to the original sponsors a simple preambular paragraph which would have located the comprehensive test-ban treaty as a significant disarmament step in a phased programme leading eventually to the total elimination of nuclear weapons in a specific or even reasonable time-frame . . . . . . .  
The determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goals of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
The Chairman : It was my understanding that a revision had been made , adding the letter s to the word goal in operative paragraph 2 , where it calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goals , which is in the plural , and it is my understanding that this plural was to be repeated in the same manner in the preambular paragraph above .  
Conscious of the forthcoming tenth anniversary of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which became the largest technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
The implementation of this crash programme , if successful , would have reduced the time required to attain sufficient nuclear material for a single nuclear weapon by up to two years compared to the probable production time-scale of Iraq 's EMIS and centrifuge enrichment programmes .  
In keeping with Iraq 's former position that the political decision had not been made to proceed to the design , development and production of nuclear weapons , the purpose of this work had previously been explained as technological development with the long-term possibility of converting to metal the depleted uranium , expected to result from Iraq 's indigenous enrichment processes , as part of a waste management strategy .  
During the current discussions , the Iraqi counterparts retracted their previous explanation that the sphere had been cast merely to optimize the mass-to-surface area ratio in connection with their work on melting and purification and declared that the casting of the sphere had been done to gain some preliminary experience that would be of assistance in their eventual production of the pits of nuclear weapons .  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goals of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control , and invites them to keep States Members of the United Nations duly informed of the progress and efforts made " .  
Noting the expressed determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States to pursue systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control , was revised to read :  
The determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goals of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control , and invites them to keep States Members of the United Nations duly informed of the progress and efforts made ;  
Appreciating also the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [ 35 ] / and acknowledging the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
His Government joined all those which were protesting against recent nuclear testing , which ran counter to the constructive philosophy of the moratorium proclaimed by the other nuclear Powers and had a negative effect on the current climate which was conducive to the negotiation of a complete nuclear test-ban treaty .  
of the forthcoming tenth anniversary of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which became the largest technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
of the forthcoming tenth anniversary of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which became the largest technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
There is need for further systematic and progressive effort in order to achieve our ultimate goal of the elimination of nuclear weapons and of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
In doing so , we believe that Ukraine made an unprecedented contribution , which has not yet received adequate recognition by the international community , to diminishing the global nuclear threat and thereby demonstrated to the whole world its peaceful , consistent and reliable policy .  
Other pressing issues include the population explosion , environmental degradation , the water shortage , desertification , the food deficit , the growing gap between the North and the South , the regional arms race , the threat posed by nuclear weapons , the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , development concerns , barriers to economic and trade cooperation , the removal of restrictions on free trade and , last but not least , human rights .  
The other day I signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty on behalf of the Republic of Namibia , not out of complete satisfaction but to encourage the ongoing work towards disarmament , bearing in mind the constructive and timely advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on nuclear weapons , as well as the Treaties of Pelindaba , Rarotonga and Tlatelolco , which created nuclear-free zones in Africa , the South Pacific and Latin America respectively .  
The increased number and growing sophistication of lethal nuclear , chemical and bacteriological weapons of mass destruction and the further development of their intercontinental delivery systems heightens the threat of annihilation for many countries and peoples , especially when some of the countries which possess them lack even minimal credibility .  
The total elimination of all existing nuclear weapons , as an indispensable step towards general and complete disarmament under strict and efficient international control , is the demand of the entire Non-Aligned Movement , to which we fully subscribe . 
We believe that , with the treaties and bilateral agreements concluded , and the ongoing negotiations among the nuclear-weapon States , and also with the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons last year , the international community is now reaffirming its commitment to global disarmament and renewing the hopes for the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction .  
While political , regional and ethnic conflicts , civil wars and the menace of armaments both nuclear and conventional are a major concern , Sierra Leone believes that the greatest threat to international peace and security today lies in poverty and in economic and social deprivation .  
We consider that the unanimous opinion that there is in neither customary nor conventional international law any specific authorization of the threat or use of nuclear weapons should become the legal and political foundation for greater progress towards total denuclearization . 
On the one hand , Israel 's nuclear-weapons programme has continuously received the direct and indirect political and technical support of one State ; on the other , the interventionist policy of coercive deprivation of other countries in the same region of their inalienable right to acquire nuclear technology for peaceful purposes has become a cornerstone of the foreign policy of the very same State .  
In addition , we commend the secretariat for playing an instrumental role in fostering the development of a global nuclear safety culture based on an improved international legal framework , recommended safety standards and advisory services .  
The presentation to the General Assembly of the annual report of the IAEA provides us with a valuable opportunity to review the work which the Agency has carried out and to measure the impact and efficiency of its activities in the various fields in which it operates in accordance with its statutory functions , both in respect of its work in the prevention of nuclear proliferation and in the promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , as well as in the strengthening of international cooperation in nuclear safety , radiological protection and waste management .  
The European Union urges the Conference on Disarmament , also pursuant to the Principles and Objectives agreed to at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference , to proceed to negotiations on a non-discriminatory , multilateral , and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , a so-called cut-off convention .  
We note with satisfaction the work done by the parties concerned on guidelines for the management of civil plutonium , which would constitute an important complement to the Moscow Nuclear Summit Declaration on the safe and effective management of weapons fissile material designated as no longer required for defence purposes , inter alia , through the Nuclear Suppliers Group controls on the traffic in nuclear materials , which would be safely stored , protected and placed under IAEA safeguards .  
The European Union has taken a leading role in the strengthening of regulatory regimes , including in the establishment of the nuclear safety account , administered by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , the G 24 coordinating mechanism , the European Union 's Poland-Hungary Aid for the Reconstruction of the Economy ( PHARE ) and Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States ( TACIS ) programmes , the European Atomic Energy Community loan facility , coordinated support from the international financial institutions for the energy sector , and bilateral cooperation projects .  
While recognizing that primary responsibility for nuclear safety rests with national Governments , the European Union welcomes the initiatives taken by the IAEA to strengthen cooperation and mutual assistance and its continuing work in fostering a global nuclear safety culture , and recognizes its contribution to future work under the Convention on Nuclear Safety , which is a major accomplishment in this field .  
The IAEA 's 1995 annual report clearly demonstrates that the Agency continues to play a vital role in promoting international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and in fostering global peace and security as provided for in its statute and relevant international instruments .  
At the domestic level , the national Government , owing to radical economic reforms , has made progress in the far-reaching process of bilateral cooperation with countries committed to the peaceful use of nuclear energy .  
Fourthly , bearing in mind the major aspects of the peaceful uses of atomic energy for the benefit of our country 's economic and social development , we would once more like to stress that our country is supporting the Agency 's measures for strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime , within the context of the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) .  
There are still many who need to be convinced that nuclear technology is the inevitable option for satisfying the energy needs of developing countries and that it is worthwhile supporting nuclear-technology based programmes and activities also in the fields of fresh water , food , health and the environment .  
Despite a large degree of convergence on many of the issues that will be addressed by this convention , we feel constrained to reiterate that , for countries like India , whose nuclear programme is based on a closed fuel cycle , it would not be possible to consider including spent fuel in a convention dealing with the safety of radioactive waste management .  
The coordinated research programmes , training programmes and technical meetings must increasingly address more advanced areas of nuclear technology to benefit the increasing number of developing countries that are enhancing the level of sophistication and capabilities of their respective national nuclear programmes .  
While there is no substitute for efficient national systems for accounting and control , especially in those countries possessing sensitive nuclear material , in preventing illicit trafficking , we recognize the crucial role the Agency can play in information-sharing and in identifying the sources of stolen material .  
In particular , the Agency has rendered valuable assistance , both technical and material , to developing countries to meet their special needs in the application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and economic development .  
Morocco , which made an important contribution to the drafting of the Treaty , is convinced that this document will open the way for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons , strengthen international cooperation and promote the exchange of knowledge about the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , so that developing countries can achieve their economic and technical goals .  
Humanity can be sheltered from the tragedy of massively destructive wars only through the full and complete elimination of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons under effective international control .  
The Assembly will note that the draft convention deals with illicit traffic in drugs and psychotropic substances and money laundering ; traffic in persons ; counterfeiting currency ; illicit traffic in or stealing of cultural objects ; stealing and smuggling nuclear material , and the misuse or threat of misuse of such material to harm the public ; terrorist acts ; illicit traffic in or stealing of arms and explosive materials or devices ; illicit traffic in or stealing of motor vehicles ; and corruption of public officials .  
If the world can focus its energies on ending the testing of sophisticated and expensive nuclear weapons , we believe that there is real hope for setting ourselves the goal of ending the use of the most simple , cheap and , on a daily basis , most destructive weapon in use today , the anti-personnel landmine .  
The political controversy over the timing of a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , set at this stage for 1999 , continued in this session and remains closely linked to the desire of a large number of States to focus the special session on further measures towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons .  
Our previous bilateral efforts have demonstrated that nuclear disarmament is an extremely intricate process involving careful trade-offs , specialized and highly tailored verification , and very sensitive security calculations .  
It highlights the importance of measures to give full effect to the provisions of article VI of the NPT , including a programme of action , a treaty on the total prohibition of nuclear testing , a convention on the production of fissile material and , lastly , the commitment of nuclear-weapon States to move systematically and gradually forward so as to reduce nuclear weapons as a whole and then eliminate them , and the determination of all States to work towards general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
As I have stated before , Japan , which has experienced the calamity of atomic bombing , fervently hopes that nuclear weapons , which cause incomparable human suffering , will never again be used and firmly believes that continuous efforts should be made towards a nuclear-weapon-free world .  
Of special significance to my country , and a point we had emphasized in our own presentation to the Court , was the unanimous finding that there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control .  
It establishes clearly , among other elements , the link and interdependence that exists between the processes of nuclear and conventional disarmament , conventional disarmament at the global level , the specific features of each region which must be taken into account the need for initiatives and participation by all States of the region concerned in the search for agreements on regional disarmament , and the danger posed by the excessive accumulation of weapons by States over and above their legitimate defence needs .  
Even more recently , Africa signed the Pelindaba Treaty , making our continent a nuclear-weapon-free zone , and thus making a substantial contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security and to the process of nuclear disarmament , which , in the context of ongoing negotiations in Geneva on a comprehensive test-ban treaty , has not gained the necessary impetus to preserve the future of mankind and to save succeeding generations from the nuclear scourge . 
The long-standing bipolar nuclear confrontation has been replaced by mostly regional , subregional and intra-State conflicts arising from political , economic and social difficulties , and by massive violations of human rights , including those of ethnic minorities .  
Also recommends that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
Welcomes with special satisfaction the adoption by the African leaders of the final text of the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone Treaty ( the Pelindaba Treaty ) , 5 / which constitutes an event of historic significance in the efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to promote international peace and security and which , at the same time , recognizes the right of African countries to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in order to accelerate the economic and social development of their peoples ;  
The determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control , and invites them to keep States Members of the United Nations duly informed of the progress and efforts made ;  
Appreciating also the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 9 / and acknowledging the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
Bearing in mind paragraph 50 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , 19 / the first special session devoted to disarmament , calling for the urgent negotiation of agreements for the cessation of the qualitative improvement and development of nuclear-weapon systems , and for a comprehensive and phased programme with agreed time-frames , wherever feasible , for progressive and balanced reduction of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery , leading to their ultimate and complete elimination at the earliest possible time ,  
World wide , fossil fuels have continued to be the dominant primary energy source for electricity generation , with coal accounting for the major share and likely to remain so well into the next century , although hydro and nuclear energy have made tangible progress in many countries .  
[ Civil , ethnic and religious strife , nuclear armament , armed conflicts , alien and colonial domination , foreign occupation , international economic imbalance , coercive economic measures , poverty , organized crime , and terrorism in all its forms are destructive to sustainable human settlements development and should therefore be renounced by all States . ]  
Conscious of the forthcoming tenth anniversary of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which became the largest technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
It is the invalidation by the United States side of the key provisions of the Armistice Agreement that has paved the way for south Korea 's current status as the greatest United States overseas military base and nuclear base .  
Ten years separate us from the early-morning hours of 26 April 1986 when two powerful explosions in rapid succession destroyed the Unit 4 reactor of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , exposing the burning core and releasing 50-million curies of radioactive isotopes into the environment .  
Stressing the importance of promoting regional and international cooperation for the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in the interest of sustainable social and economic development of the African continent ,  
Most of the developed countries draw on large shares of crude oil and natural gas in their primary energy consumption ; some regions have substantial contributions of nuclear energy and modern renewable sources . 
Recognizing that the prime responsibility for nuclear safety rests with national Governments , it is of primary importance to continue to enhance international collaborative efforts to promote a high level of nuclear safety world wide .  
Nuclear safety can also be enhanced by greater international transparency in nuclear power activities , in particular by means of peer reviews , and this should lead to existing reactors that do not meet current safety requirements being brought to an acceptable level of safety or ceasing operation .  
We pledge our support for efforts to ensure that all sensitive nuclear material ( separated plutonium and highly enriched uranium ) designated as not intended for use for meeting defence requirements is safely stored , protected and placed under IAEA safeguards ( in the nuclear-weapon States , under the relevant voluntary offer IAEA safeguards agreements ) as soon as it is practicable to do so .  
Accordingly , we have concluded that increased cooperation among our Governments to combat illicit trafficking in nuclear material will contribute to increased international security and public safety , and to achievement of global non-proliferation objectives .  
Support efforts to ensure that all sensitive nuclear material ( separated plutonium and highly enriched uranium ) not intended for use in meeting defence requirements is safely and effectively stored and protected and placed under IAEA safeguards ( in the nuclear-weapon States , under the relevant " voluntary offer " IAEA safeguards agreements ) as soon as it is practicable to do so ;  
Seek to identify strategies for the safe , effective and affordable peaceful use of nuclear material no longer required for defence purposes or for its safe permanent disposal ;  
Moreover , the countless emerging transnational issues , such as environment protection , sustainable development , non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , drug prevention , overpopulation in cities , payment of debts , poverty eradication , and protection of intellectual property rights , need to be addressed from a global perspective .  
It is expected that these materials will address , among other subjects : the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty , further developments in nuclear disarmament , entry into force of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development , Production , Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction , substantive preparation for the review conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in the year 2000 , preparations for a fourth special session on disarmament , conventional disarmament and transparency , and regional arrangements .  
At a public sitting on 8 July 1996 , the International Court of Justice recognized that for the first time in history , the threat or use of nuclear weapons is generally contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict , and in particular the principles and rules of humanitarian law , while also recognizing that there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament .  
" The Argentine Republic is convinced that the conclusion of the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty would be a crucial event in fostering international trust , because it would strengthen the growing conviction that nuclear weapons are of no use for the security of nations , and would facilitate the future agenda and the negotiation of other multilateral measures regarding disarmament , non-proliferation and arms control . "  Charg d'affaires a.i .  
The need to avert the potential dangers posed by the unlawful taking and use of nuclear material and to adopt appropriate and effective measures to ensure the prevention , detection and punishment of offences relating to nuclear material , which are a matter of grave concern to the international community , led the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) to adopt the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material 13 / at Vienna on 26 October 1979 .  
Many delegations were concerned that subprogramme 1.3 emphasized the micro rather than the macro aspects of disarmament such as nuclear , chemical , bacteriological and conventional weapons .  
However , zero nuclear weapons might not be a stable , reassuring zero unless all fissile material , and the dedicated nuclear infrastructure , has been placed under satisfactory international control .  
Adopting effective controls on explosives and against illicit trafficking by criminals in certain materials and their components that are specifically designed for use in manufacturing nuclear , biological or chemical weapons and , in order to lessen risks arising from such trafficking , by becoming party to and fully implementing all relevant international treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction ;  
Concerned with the growing threat of organized crime , including the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , money laundering , illicit traffic in arms , nuclear material and explosive devices , motor vehicles , objects of arts ,  
Israel 's refusal to adhere to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , when it possesses enormous numbers of nuclear weapons , is developing other weapons of mass destruction and the means of their delivery and refuses to place its facilities under international supervision and International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards , not only flouts the wishes of the international community but also constitutes a grave and persistent threat to the security and the future of the peoples of the region and , consequently , to international peace and security .  
Considering that an expansion of technical cooperation activities relating to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy will contribute to the well-being of the peoples of the world , recognizing the special needs of the developing countries for technical assistance from the Agency and the importance of funding in order to benefit effectively from the transfer and application of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes as well as from the contribution of nuclear energy to their economic development , and desiring that the Agency 's resources for technical cooperation activities be assured and sufficient ,  
Urges all States to strive for effective and harmonious international cooperation in carrying out the work of the Agency , pursuant to its statute ; in promoting the use of nuclear energy and the application of the necessary measures to strengthen further the safety of nuclear installations and to minimize risks to life , health and the environment ; in strengthening technical assistance and cooperation for developing countries ; and in ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of the safeguards systems of the Agency ;

The determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control , and invites them to keep States Members of the United Nations duly informed of the progress and efforts made ;  
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
disarmament , calling for the urgent negotiation of agreements for the cessation of the qualitative improvement and development of nuclear weapon systems , and for a comprehensive and phased programme with agreed time frames , wherever feasible , for progressive and balanced reduction of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery , leading to their ultimate and complete elimination at the earliest possible time ,  
Recognizing that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and any proposed treaty on fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices must constitute disarmament measures , and not only non-proliferation measures , and that these measures , together with an international legal instrument on adequate security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States and an international convention prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons must be integral steps leading to the total elimination of nuclear weapons within a time-bound framework ,  
Taking note of the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice dated 8 July 1966 on the legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons , and welcoming the unanimous reaffirmation by all Judges of the Court that there exists an obligation for all States to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control ,  
The Polessk State Radiation and Environmental Reserve , located in Belarus on territory directly adjacent to the Chernobyl nuclear power station , possesses appropriate infrastructure , including highly qualified scientists and experts , and has unique conditions and research subjects , thus making it possible to develop practical approaches and establish effective methods of overcoming the consequences of nuclear disasters and ensuring environmental rehabilitation of territories polluted by radionuclides . 
Appreciating also the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [ 2 ] / and acknowledging the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
At their fourth meeting , they also expressed their concern regarding the safe and secure transportation of INF materials through the region . 187 They called on all States to maintain cooperation and exchange information on the transportation of nuclear material and radioactive waste and to continue working through IMO and IAEA in the development of additional measures which would complement the 1993 INF Code .  
In the light of current priorities , particular attention should be given to countries that make a significant , generally recognized contribution to the strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and effective efforts to strengthen regional and global security by carrying out their obligations under the major disarmament agreements and treaties in this area .  
Adopting effective controls on explosives and against illicit trafficking by criminals in certain materials and their components that are specifically designed for use in manufacturing nuclear , biological or chemical weapons and , in order to lessen risks arising from such trafficking , by becoming party to and fully implementing all relevant international treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction ;  
He regretted that the Department had not been more responsive to and supportive of Ukraine 's unprecedented contribution to nuclear disarmament and diminishing the global nuclear threat , which had not received adequate international recognition .  
The issue involved mainly activities typical of modern industrial societies , such as those connected with nuclear power plants , the chemical and space industries and maritime transport of petroleum and other dangerous or polluting substances , which certainly had undeniable political and economic value , but also posed a considerable risk for the safety of human beings and protection of the environment .  
Considering that an expansion of technical cooperation activities relating to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy will contribute to the well-being of the peoples of the world , recognizing the special needs of the developing countries for technical assistance from the Agency and the importance of funding in order to benefit effectively from the transfer and application of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes as well as from the contribution of nuclear energy to their economic development , and desiring that the Agency 's resources for technical cooperation activities be assured and sufficient ,  
In Poland 's view , the proposed new framework convention should be based on existing international instruments regulating illicit narcotic drug trafficking , trafficking in persons , the protection of nuclear material and the import and export of cultural property as well as bilateral and regional agreements on crime prevention .  
Adopting effective controls on explosives and against illicit trafficking by criminals in certain materials and their components that are specifically designed for use in manufacturing nuclear , biological or chemical weapons and , in order to lessen risks arising from such trafficking , by becoming party to and fully implementing all relevant international treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction ;  
Adopting effective controls on explosives and against illicit trafficking by criminals in certain materials and their components that are specifically designed for use in manufacturing nuclear , biological or chemical weapons and , in order to lessen risks arising from such trafficking , by becoming party to and fully implementing all relevant international treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction ;  
Decides to establish an Ad Hoc Committee , open to all States Members of the United Nations or members of specialized agencies or of the International Atomic Energy Agency , to elaborate an international convention for the suppression of terrorist bombings and , subsequently , an international convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism , to supplement related existing international instruments ; thereafter to address means of further developing a comprehensive legal framework of conventions dealing with international terrorism ;  
Decides to establish an Ad Hoc Committee , open to all States Members of the United Nations or members of specialized agencies or of the International Atomic Energy Agency , to elaborate an international convention for the suppression of terrorist bombings and , subsequently , an international convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism , to supplement related existing international instruments ; thereafter to address means of further developing a comprehensive legal framework of conventions dealing with international terrorism ;

Bearing in mind paragraph 50 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , 10 the first special session devoted to disarmament , calling for the urgent negotiation of agreements for the cessation of the qualitative improvement and development of nuclear-weapon systems , and for a comprehensive and phased programme with agreed time-frames , wherever feasible , for progressive and balanced reduction of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery , leading to their ultimate and complete elimination at the earliest possible time ,  
Recognizing that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and any proposed treaty on fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices must constitute disarmament measures , and not only non-proliferation measures , and that these measures , together with an international legal instrument on adequate security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States and an international convention prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons , must be integral steps leading to the total elimination of nuclear weapons within a time-bound framework ,  
Appreciating also the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , 23 and acknowledging the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;

Decides to establish an ad hoc committee , open to all States Members of the United Nations or members of specialized agencies or of the International Atomic Energy Agency , to elaborate an international convention for the suppression of terrorist bombings and , subsequently , an international convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism , to supplement related existing international instruments , and thereafter to address means of further developing a comprehensive legal framework of conventions dealing with international terrorism ;  
Others had felt that certain kinds of environmental damage , such as damage caused by the deliberate detonation of nuclear explosions or pollution of entire rivers , should entail the individual criminal responsibility of those responsible , particularly since the fate of future generations was at stake .  
As a State that has completed the withdrawal of strategic nuclear missiles from its territory , we believe that it is extremely important to make joint efforts to lay the foundations for a firm and peaceful future for Europe .  
It further noted that recent space technology spin-offs had resulted in products such as an anti-shock pressure suit for medical applications , a transportation guidance system , a hand-held electromagnetic probe for inspecting aircraft for cracks and other damage , an obstacle detection system to assist in automated operations , a prototype silicon detector of radiation-induced effects in humans , automated robotic gasoline pumps , force reflecting devices to assist the blind in using a computer mouse , nuclear waste facility clean-up , and field applications and demonstrations of tele-medicine systems ( " tele-clinics " ) .  
With the improvement of the international political climate , the dangers posed by nuclear war and the arms race are receding , while prospects for taking concrete steps on practical disarmament are improving .  
The international community must take specific measures designed to act on the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the obligation to pursue and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
We , who have a closed fuel cycle nuclear power programme , have consistently opposed the inclusion of spent fuel , which is a valuable resource material , along with radioactive waste in this convention .  
At a time when the international community is struggling to deal with the problems of environmental degradation resulting from the excessive use of fossil fuel , the Agency 's achievements in the area of nuclear safety underline the merits of nuclear energy as the most feasible and attractive alternative to fossil fuel .  
The Agency justifiably has a strong reputation for generating ideas and initiating practical actions aimed at enhancing nuclear safety and security by undertaking the dual functions of strengthening the international non-proliferation regime and developing peaceful cooperation in the use of atomic energy .  
Considering the increasing environmental cost to society of wastes from burnt fossil fuels and the risk of global warming , we believe in safe and peaceful nuclear energy as a cost-effective and clean source of energy for the future .  
Countries with limited mineral resources , like Armenia , will continue to view the International Atomic Energy Agency as the central medium for the safeguarded transfer of nuclear technology , operational expertise , and technical assistance to countries which explicitly adhere to international non-proliferation objectives and comply with the existing regulations .  
Despite the negative public perception created in some countries and the fears aroused about the dangers of nuclear proliferation , nuclear energy remains a viable and attractive energy option for many countries , and particularly for the fossil fuel-deficient developing countries .  
The region \ x { e5b8 } constant focus on democracy , good governance , peace , security and nuclear disarmament ; its undertaking to take responsibility for the proper and responsible management of the environment ; the protection of fish and other marine resources ; cultural and technology exchanges ; and economic cooperation and respect for human rights all stand to prove that the zone is successfully dealing with a changing global environment .  
The substantive outcome of these joint efforts relates in particular to environmental protection in its global dimension : prohibiting chemical and bacteriological weapons and reducing nuclear weapons , as well as formulating a new concept and practice of peacekeeping ; ensuring human rights ; and codifying international law on non-renewable resources .  
Japan , which experienced the calamity of atomic bombing , fervently desires that the use of nuclear weapons , which cause incomparable human suffering , should never be repeated and firmly believes that continuous efforts should be made towards creating a world free of nuclear weapons .  
From the very start of the negotiations , the main objective of many non-nuclear-weapon States was to build into the architecture of the Treaty a renewed commitment by all States , and particularly the nuclear-weapon States , to a progressive and more systematic process leading to complete I repeat , complete nuclear disarmament .  
I am certain that the First Committee can make a significant contribution towards the attainment of our common objective : a world free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and a greatly reduced level of conventional weapons .  
The International Court of Justice has declared in a historic advisory opinion that the threat or use of nuclear weapons would be contrary to the rules of international law applicable to armed conflicts .  
Similarly , the continued existence of stocks of prohibited fissile material for the production of prohibited nuclear weapons and of the illicit traffic in weapons of mass destruction , particularly biological and chemical weapons , remains a source of deep concern and threatens the stability and security of countries and entire regions .  
For these reasons , Costa Rica supports the creation of a broad region called The nuclear-weapon-free Southern Hemisphere and adjacent areas on the basis of a proposal for resolutions put forward by Brazil , which should include a total ban on the transport and transfer of nuclear materials for bellicose purposes and of atomic waste .  
The highest priority for the international community , therefore , should continue to remain the ultimate and complete elimination of nuclear weapons as was laid down in the Final Document of SSOD I . The agenda should also include measures on the elimination of the other weapons of mass destruction , in particular chemical and biological weapons , through the full implementation of relevant disarmament treaties . 
The speedy commencement and rapid conclusion of good-faith negotiations to achieve nuclear disarmament in all its aspects , under strict and effective international control , in accordance with the unanimous opinion of the International Court of Justice , is of paramount importance to the future of the international community .  
Through the Treaty of Tlatelolco , whose thirtieth anniversary is being celebrated this year , the treaties of Rarotonga , Bangkok and Pelindaba , and the Antarctic Treaty , the southern hemisphere and adjacent areas covered by these treaties are rapidly becoming free of nuclear weapons , as the General Assembly recognized with satisfaction last autumn .  
While my delegation is deeply concerned about the problem of nuclear disarmament , at a practical level it is also convinced of the need for urgent and decisive action to curtail the illicit trafficking in small arms .  
Australia 's primary goal for the Commission 's work on nuclear-weapon-free zones is an outcome in keeping with the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) decision on principles and objectives , that the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones , on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned , enhances regional and global peace and security and contributes to the ultimate objective of achieving a world entirely free of nuclear weapons .  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control , and invites them to keep States Members of the United Nations duly informed of the progress and efforts made ;  
Bearing in mind paragraph 50 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , 8 the first special session devoted to disarmament , calling for the urgent negotiation of agreements for the cessation of the qualitative improvement and development of nuclear-weapon systems , and for a comprehensive and phased programme with agreed time-frames , wherever feasible , for progressive and balanced reduction of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery , leading to their ultimate and complete elimination at the earliest possible time ,  
Recognizing that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and any proposed treaty on fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices must constitute disarmament measures , and not only non-proliferation measures , and that these measures , together with an international legal instrument on adequate security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States and an international convention prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons , must be integral steps leading to the total elimination of nuclear weapons within a time-bound framework ,  
Appreciating also the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , 27 and acknowledging the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
Environmentally induced migrations are caused by natural disasters , such as earthquakes , flash flooding , typhoons , and volcanic eruptions ; by nuclear and hazardous waste contamination ; by agricultural and rural decline , resource pollution , chronic water shortages ; or by dam construction and other large-scale development projects .  
Subsidies in the energy sector for conventional energy sources and nuclear power tend to hamper widespread development and application of renewable energy sources . 6 Policy changes that will lead to the full internalization of environmental costs in prices through the use of economic and fiscal instruments and the removal of permanent subsidies are required if a sustainable energy path is to be pursued . 
The Canberra Commission was a body of independent experts and eminent persons commissioned by the Australian Government to address the fundamental questions of whether a nuclear _ weapon _ free world is feasible and , if so , the measures which could be taken to attain that objective .  
And if nevertheless many countries did accede to it , including my own , this certainly reflects the conviction and the hope that they attach to the collective and multilateral task of disarmament , as reflected in the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice of 8 July 1996 , which reminded us that all States have an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects , and under strict and effective international control .  
In my view , the three sessions of the open _ ended informal Presidential consultations , each devoted to such issues as nuclear disarmament , a fissile material cut _ off treaty and anti _ personnel landmines , were useful and contributed to moving the overall process of the CD forward .  
It was agreed that technical experts , including experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , should be invited to the fifteenth session of the Working Group , in 1998 , in order to identify and study the current international technical standards pertinent to the use of nuclear power sources in outer space .  
The intensive consultations led by your distinguished predecessor Ambassador Yung Sun showed that within these two fields there are at least three issues commanding quite broad support , namely the fissile material cut _ off , nuclear disarmament and the complex issue of anti _ personnel landmines . 
The consultations proved to be useful , allowing me to see better where delegations stand as far as their positions on three important issues are concerned : namely , on nuclear disarmament , the fissile material cut _ off treaty and anti _ personnel landmines , as well as , in some cases , on other issues of major interest to them . 
So if we are not able to solve the daunting issue of nuclear disarmament in one great stroke now , let us attend to what is feasible and in doing so add another valuable facet , namely a treaty on fissile material cut _ off ( FMCT ) , to this multifaceted edifice .  
It is inconceivable to permit fissile materials to be manufactured while nuclear tests are being banned and existing fissile material is being destroyed .  
States that , through the rational application in outer space of the technical and technological legacy of the arms race , instead of its hasty destruction , the use of the existing nuclear missile potential of the Russian Federation , the United States of America , and other countries for the benefit of sustainable development is capable of giving impetus to the preservation and improvement of the environment by mobilizing extraterrestrial energy and material resources for the development of civilization ,  
An appeal by the special session to the Governments of the Russian Federation and the United States of America to consider the rational employment of their missile and nuclear potential as a contribution of these two countries to common efforts to ensure sustainable development and preservation of the natural environment of this earth ; to start - should the response of the two Governments be positive - developing relevant international programmes and projects ensuring respect for the regime of non-proliferation of nuclear and missile technologies and for intellectual property rights ;  
The United Nations to create an international legal basis for the process of redirecting nuclear missile potential to the objectives stipulated in Agenda 21 and to ensure the financing of an international expert analysis of the attendant positive and negative factors ,  
Recalling further its resolution 1996 / 16 , in which it requested the Secretary _ General to submit a report on information gathered on the use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel _ air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium and their consequential and cumulative effects and the danger they represent to life , physical security and other human rights ,  
While it appreciated the work being done by the United Nations to initiate and coordinate activities aimed at finding a solution to the Chernobyl problem , his Government was seriously concerned by the fact that , at a time when the closing of the Chernobyl nuclear power plan was being discussed , the search for a solution to the medical and environmental consequences of the disaster , for which Belarus was bearing the main burden , was being relegated to the background .  
The practice of dumping ageing nuclear submarines at sea or abandoning them at old naval bases where security measures were inadequate had to be stopped , and abandoned submarines should be recovered before they could cause irreparable damage to the ocean environment .  
After peaceful relations and reconciliation are established among all States in the region , Israel will endeavour to establish in the Middle East _ through direct negotiations among all its members _ a zone free of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons , as well as ballistic missiles , based on mutual and effective verification .  
Indeed , Israel has been actively supporting and participating in efforts of the international community to prevent the proliferation of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles , not least through export control mechanisms , inspired by those of the Nuclear Suppliers Group ( NSG ) , the Australian Group ( AG ) , and the Missile Technology Control Regime ( MTCR ) , of which Israel is an adherent .  
As the tensions which reflected the cold war era give way to growing global confidence and cooperation , the international community should now turn more of its attention and energies towards many as yet unresolved regional conflicts , which are characterized by unprecedented conventional arms build _ ups and , in some instances , also by the Clandestine pursuit of nuclear , chemical or biological weapons .  
It seems to us that the CD , with its accumulated experience of complex disarmament negotiations on weapons of mass destruction , is the ideal forum in which to carry forward discussions on the technical and legal questions which must be confronted if we are to achieve the elimination of nuclear weapons .  
These measures are intrinsically linked to the just and lasting resolution of conflicts , the peaceful settlement of disputes , concrete and effective measures of disarmament through the accession of all the States of the region to the multinational agreements on the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction ( the Non-Proliferation Treaty , the Chemical Weapons Convention , the Biological Weapons Convention , etc . ) , and to the placement of all nuclear installations under international control .  
With a view to promoting peace and strengthening security in the Mediterranean region , the new Government of Malta has time and time again committed itself to a foreign policy that is based on the values of democratic governance , on the upholding of fundamental human rights , on the peaceful settlement of disputes and on a policy that is in favour of disarmament and strongly opposes military aggression , and the manufacture , distribution and proliferation of all types of armaments and weapons , especially weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , chemical and biological .  
Just last month , on the bilateral level , the United States of America and the Russian Federation announced initiatives taken in the areas of strategic security and nuclear security that will make a positive and constructive contribution to the global nuclear arms control and disarmament agenda .  
The START process must be revitalized and broadened to include other nuclear-weapon States promises and intentions must be converted into actions ; the nuclear-weapon States must progressively and dynamically demonstrate their fulfilment of their NPT obligation to negotiate in good faith and to conclude negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament ; the NPT review process must continue to be a qualitatively different and enhanced exercise ; and the Conference on Disarmament must overcome its current stalemate and move forward decisively and responsibly on nuclear disarmament and a fissile material cut-off treaty .  
It stood for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , the prohibition of the development of outer space weapons , and the reduction of conventional weapons to a rational level .  
Thirdly , it is necessary to prevent a small number of countries taking advantage of their advanced military technology and economic power to seek their absolute security and military superiority over others while they focus the target of disarmament on the developing countries and deprive them of their legitimate right and means of self-defence .  Fourthly , the countries with the largest and most sophisticated conventional and nuclear arsenals should continue to bear special responsibility for disarmament .  
The decision gradually to remove up to 500 tons of highly enriched uranium and up to 50 tons of weapons-grade plutonium from nuclear military programmes is an effective contribution by Russia to ensuring that nuclear disarmament is irreversible .  The 1972 Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems ( ABM ) is of paramount importance to nuclear disarmament as a key element of strategic stability and a prerequisite for further reductions in strategic offensive arms .  
Pakistan believes that we can succeed in realizing peace through a comprehensive and sustained dialogue which would seriously address , and progressively resolve , the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir in conformity with the relevant United Nations resolutions ; achieve mutual and equitable restraint on conventional weapons to ensure equal security to both Pakistan and India ; evolve agreement for mutual and equal restraint in the nuclear field and in ballistic missiles : and conclude and strengthen confidence-building measures .  
Nuclear testing is continuing using non-explosive techniques ; existing weapons are being improved ; new types of weapons are being designed : all indications that CTBT is set to start a new technology race in the quest for more innovative and more lethal nuclear weapons .  
It is therefore our common task and responsibility to seize this historic opportunity , provided by the present international environment , to work together for the total elimination of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and for the regulation and control of other conventional tools of killing .  
Sustained pursuit of negotiation , bilateral and multilateral , is indispensable in order to achieve the goal of genuine and complete disarmament , as well as to completely eliminate the massive stockpiles of existing nuclear arsenals .  
Its main objective would be to monitor the declared fissile material production facilities or those capable of such activity for the purposes of nuclear weapons or other explosive devices .  
It is , therefore , essential to ensure that the existing favourable conditions in international relations are utilized to achieve the ultimate objective of eliminating all nuclear weapons .  
My country , Senegal , feels that , apart from the potential for destruction presented by nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , security problems are equally linked to conventional armaments in numerous conflicts and tensions raging throughout the world , especially in Africa .  
That finding by the special session was echoed by the International Court of Justice , which concluded in its epoch-making Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996 which should be a constant reminder , particularly to nuclear-weapon States that there exists an obligation for all States to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control . 
Within this framework , the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms must , if it is to be successful , be expanded to include information on other categories of armaments that are not currently covered , such as nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , in addition to advanced technology with military applications .  
Moreover , the Register must be expanded to include nuclear weapons and sophisticated technology with military applications if it is to become a more balanced instrument , free of all discriminatory criteria , and to have a more global scope and the highest possible number of participants .  
The International Atomic Energy Agency is continuing its activities and studies in such key areas as : creation of an international nuclear information system ; problems of migration of radionuclide contaminants in soils , forests and lakes ; training for the safe operation and management of nuclear power plants ; radiation monitoring and protection and radioactive waste management ; and reduction of internal radiation doses to the population .  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control , and invites them to keep States Members of the United Nations duly informed of the progress and efforts made ;  
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
As Member States will recall , this paper became a basis for General Assembly resolution 48 / 87 , by which the Assembly , among other things , further adopted a thematic approach to cluster items into 10 broad topics : nuclear weapons ; other weapons of mass destruction ; conventional weapons ; regional disarmament and security ; confidence-building measures , including transparency in armaments ; outer space disarmament aspects ; disarmament machinery ; other disarmament measures ; international security ; and related matters of disarmament and international security .  
In order to rationalize the work of the First Committee , it would be useful to consider issues as groups of items or clusters for instance , nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction ; conventional weapons ; regional disarmament and security ; transparency and confidence-building ; outer space ; reports of multilateral organs ; disarmament machinery and institutional matters ; international security ; and related matters of disarmament and international security .  
Appreciating also the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and acknowledging the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
In the context of nuclear disarmament , it is the indispensable prerequisite for the further advancement of nuclear disarmament , because it is impossible to move forward with the dismantlement of nuclear weapons unless the safe and effective management of resultant fissile material is secured .  
It is to serve as a continuing reminder to the international community of the solemn obligation set out in article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , in which the States parties pledged their commitment to pursue in good faith negotiations on effective measures relating to nuclear disarmament , and of their determined pursuit of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons .  
The Rio Group stands convinced that these treaties will not only strengthen the international non-proliferation regime but will also promote the establishment of other nuclear-weapon-free zones in other parts of the world , which will lead to the gradual expansion of nuclear-weapon-free zones until the ultimate objective of all the States Members of the Organization has been attained a world that is entirely free of nuclear weapons . 
The Movement observed that in his note the Secretary-General expressed the view that weapons of mass destruction continued to be of primary importance despite significant progress achieved to outlaw chemical and biological weapons and to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regimes .  
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
By eliminating the world 's third biggest nuclear arms stock , and by recently signing a number of basic bilateral treaties with its neighbours and the charter on special partnership with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , Ukraine has made an essential contribution to strengthening European and world security , thus having a concrete input in implementing the lofty goals enshrined in the United Nations Charter .  
We make these appeals not as an annual ritual but because of our deep conviction that the elimination of weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , will go a long way to promote international peace and security , a principal purpose for which this Organization was established .  
After the establishment , as we hope , of peace treaties between Israel and every country of the region , it will be possible to create a regional security system that would provide multilateral and shared solutions to the range of security problems in the Middle East , including a mutually and effectively verifiable Middle East free of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles .  
The immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty has repeatedly been identified by the international community as the next major goal for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament efforts , most recently by the parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty which now has more members than the United Nations itself at their first preparatory meeting for the sixth Review Conference in 2000 . 
Today we are witnessing the emergence of new forms of transnational crime : money-laundering or the investment of capital generated by activities that are usually interconnected , including drug-trafficking , corruption , traffic in weapons , terrorism , traffic in nuclear and toxic material , traffic in protected natural resources , traffic in human beings , removal of organs , and more .  
These reform proposals as a whole represent a timely and welcome initiative , given the fact that in today 's world the need has progressively increased for global common action on a number of pressing problems , such as the eradication of poverty , humanitarian emergencies , refugee problems , climate change and desertification , diminishing official development assistance funding , drugs , nuclear disarmament , the implementation of Agenda 21 , democracy and the maintenance of peace and security in various regions of the world .  
However , in spite of some positive developments in the area of arms regulation and disarmament in the past year , we can not be too sanguine about these achievements in the absence of any real or substantial progress made in the area of the further reduction of nuclear weapons leading to their total elimination .  
I must therefore underline that continued and adequate support from all member States for the Agency 's technical cooperation programme is indispensable if one is to realize the atoms for peace vision , which is the dual quest to prevent the spread of a military use of nuclear technology and to facilitate the transfer of nuclear techniques for peaceful purposes . 
And without belittling the value and potential of energy savings and of an expanded use of solar and wind power and biomass , I am also convinced that in the intensifying search for energy sources which produce little or no greenhouse gases , more Governments and broad segments of the general public will rediscover the nuclear power option .  
After extensive work involving inspections , analysis of large volumes of documentation and of information received from Member States and former suppliers of relevant items , the use of new techniques for environmental monitoring , questioning of Iraqi staff and examination of items recovered from excavations , we have been able to construct a technically coherent picture of Iraq 's past nuclear programme and to gain a good understanding of the scope of the achievements of the programme .  
The third measure in the programme of action for implementing article VI of the NPT contained in the decision on principles and objectives relates to the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons as a whole and eventually to eliminate them , and the desire of all States to work for general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
This is a significant complement to the Moscow Nuclear Summit Declaration of April 1996 on the safe and effective management of the fissile material of nuclear weapons identified as being no longer required for national defence purposes .  
Similarly , it continues to be deeply concerned by the fact that to date the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea has not provided the Agency with the information it needs to verify that it has not diverted nuclear material to illicit uses and that its initial declaration is correct and complete .  
While recognizing that the primary responsibility for nuclear safety rests with the respective national Governments , the European Union welcomes the entry into force of this Convention , which was concluded under IAEA auspices and which will strengthen cooperation and mutual assistance in a favourable climate for the development a global nuclear-safety culture . 
For that reason , we reiterate our grave concern at the increasingly frequent transport of radioactive material and nuclear waste through areas of the high seas close to our exclusive economic zone .  
The European Union underlines the importance , as acknowledged in the Principles and Objectives for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament agreed at last year \ x { e5b8 } NPT Review Conference , of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
These should be followed by concrete measures of nuclear disarmament , such as the initiation of negotiations for further deep reductions in strategic nuclear forces , which could be undertaken in a series of phased actions ; dismantlement of weapons that are withdrawn by States and an undertaking not to modernize their weapons ; genuine build-down of nuclear arsenals , an essential component of which would be multilateral monitoring of existing stocks of nuclear warheads ; reduction of operationally deployed nuclear weapons and handing over of the fissile material to multilaterally supervised storage .  
It was a positive contribution by the Court to the realization of the goal of total elimination of nuclear weapons , which must be pursued by the international community if we are to eliminate the possibility of this planet , and all the people on it , being annihilated by these horrendous weapons of mass destruction .  
The application of double standards in the area of non-proliferation and the employment of non-transparent and exclusive export control mechanisms in the areas of nuclear , chemical and biological technology for peaceful uses are most destructive of international confidence and security .  
This initiative proposes that the Conference on Disarmament negotiate a multilateral instrument committing all States to the objective of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons ; an agreement on the steps required in a phased programme with deadlines leading to their total elimination ; and a convention prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive nuclear devices .  
The Union also continues to attach great importance to the third and last measure of the action programme contained in the principles and objectives of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , namely , the determined pursuit by nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce and eventually eliminate all nuclear weapons and to the desire of all States to work for general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
In this context , we would like to emphasize the need for universal adherence to the NPT and for the signing of legally binding conventions to secure the non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or the threat of use of nuclear weapons , as well as to ban fissile materials and to end restrictions on the transfer of nuclear technology , material and equipment for peaceful purposes , which the developing countries need .  
Given that existing global stocks of nuclear arsenals number over 30,000 , with the equivalent explosive force of 200,000 Hiroshima-sized bombs , it is imperative that the international community press on , with unremitting vigour , with the global campaign for a nuclear-weapon-free world .  
Almost two years ago , the International Court of Justice , in a historic Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons , unanimously concluded that States parties to the NPT have the obligation not only to begin but also to bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control .  
General and complete disarmament is now a universal need , and it should be perceived in its original terms , namely , that there is not nor can there be any alternative to the achievement of true nuclear disarmament , which alone can free mankind from apocalypse , ensure security for all and channel nuclear energy to economic and social development by using it exclusively for peaceful means .  
In this connection , and without taking away from steps that have already been or are being taken , we feel that further efforts are needed to promote the emergence of a new approach through the adoption of meaningful measures of nuclear disarmament , which incontrovertibly remains the absolute priority in achieving the goal of general and complete disarmament which the international community set for itself at the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament .  
The quality and level of relations Algeria has developed in this connection in recent years with the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , both in the area of bringing its two experimental and radioisotope-producing nuclear reactors into the safeguards regime and in the area of technological assistance and cooperation , clearly illustrate my country 's decisive commitment to the Agency 's objectives and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy .  
With regard to disarmament , Algeria , the country in its geographical area that devotes the smallest percentage of its gross national product to national defence , fully endorses the basic right of security for all States , whose promotion necessarily entails , first , nuclear disarmament , followed by the elimination of other weapons of mass destruction and ending with the progressive and balanced reduction of conventional weapons at both the global and regional levels .  
The international community has acknowledged the extraordinary foresight of the authors of the Tlatelolco Treaty , who responded , in an intelligent and creative manner , to the challenge posed by the danger of nuclear proliferation by drafting an international legal instrument that has become an inspiration and a model for other countries wishing to establish nuclear-weapon-free zones .  
Egypt also supports the initiative launched by Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Turkmenistan , Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia and encourages full United Nations support for this newly born initiative , in the same manner as the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency supported the African States in the formulation of the Treaty of Pelindaba by assisting the Governments of the region and the Governments concerned to settle the remaining policy and technical issues , thus assisting in advancing the cause of nuclear non-proliferation .  
My delegation wishes to support the proposals put forward in this regard by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at the last substantive session of the Disarmament Commission , which called for the special session to have a wide-ranging agenda highlighting the following : review and evaluation of the current international situation ; nuclear disarmament at the global and regional levels ; elimination of other weapons of mass destruction ; effective reduction of arms and armed forces ; the relationship between disarmament and development ; and confidence-building .  
Article VII of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) and paragraphs 5 , 6 and 7 of the Principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament proclaimed at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the NPT established a sound legal foundation for creating new international nuclear-weapon-free zones on the basis of agreements freely entered into between the appropriate States for the purposes of strengthening peace and security on the global and regional levels .  
My delegation is convinced that internationally recognized nuclear-weapon-free zones , established on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned , are an effective instrument to promote nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament and confidence-building , and thereby help to enhance global and regional peace and security .  
While we consider counterproductive the ambition to expand the geographical frontiers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , and while we attach particular importance to efforts to remove nuclear weapons from the territory of foreign military bases in order to limit nuclear arsenals to the territory of the nuclear States , we are also ready to hold consultations on building a balanced system of relations between Belarus and that important military bloc and to work for political , military and strategic equilibrium with all our partners .  
Past endeavours have also shown that the primary objective of establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones is to seek the absence of nuclear weapons from various parts of the world ; to insulate the zonal States from the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons ; to prevent horizontal as well as vertical proliferation of nuclear weapons , which could pose new and unacceptable threats to the security of States ; to contribute to the process of disarmament , especially nuclear disarmament ; and to facilitate cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy .  
That will be possible only if the Security Council shoulders its full legal and political responsibilities : to defend its resolutions without applying double standards , especially since Israel , as we all know , continues to possess weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , that pose a threat to regional and international peace and security .  
Glaciers are melting ; forests are retreating ; we are changing the seasons ; we are running out of fish in the sea ; we are poisoning our children with persistent organic pollutants ; and we are accumulating nuclear waste to the peril of future generations .  
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
Decides to establish an Ad Hoc Committee , open to all States Members of the United Nations or members of specialized agencies or of the International Atomic Energy Agency , to elaborate an international convention for the suppression of terrorist bombings and , subsequently , an international convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism , to supplement related existing international instruments , and thereafter to address means of further developing a comprehensive legal framework of conventions dealing with international terrorism ;  
Such challenges include the weakening of family ties due partially to spatial mobility ; gradual shifting away from extended to nuclear and more flexible family forms ; an increasing emphasis on individual rather than communitarian social values ; and a redefining of the traditional roles and expectations of individual family members , particularly those of women as caregivers , towards more egalitarian and task-sharing partnerships within the family .  
It is inconceivable to permit fissile materials to be manufactured while nuclear tests are being banned and existing fissile material is being destroyed .  
Fortunately the 1995 Conference of NPT States parties has helped to identify the way forward by adopting the Principles and objectives for non _ proliferation and disarmament , in which the section on Nuclear disarmament sets out the importance to the international community of three specific objectives : the completion of negotiations for a comprehensive test _ ban treaty no later than 1996 ; the immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a fissile material cut _ off treaty ; and systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally .  
This brings me to the third item in the Nuclear disarmament section of the Principles and objectives _ the determined pursuit by the nuclear _ weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goals [ sic ] of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
We are of the view that given the positive global political climate following the end of the cold war , the work of the Conference has assumed even increased significance in that opportunities that did not exist during the period of heightened East _ West tension are now present , both in respect of conventional and , more importantly , nuclear disarmament .  
In most countries with nuclear programmes , the preferred method for the disposal of long-lived radioactive wastes is its long-term isolation in a system of multiple barriers located in deep and stable geological formations .  
In the nuclear area , if we consider the United Nations General Assembly , the venue for the highest expression of international public opinion , I must note that in 1993 , in resolution 48 / 75 L , the Assembly recommended by consensus the negotiation in the most appropriate forum of a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for the manufacture of nuclear weapons .  
Trying to evade the cut _ off negotiations , which constitute an essential stage , would mean remaining at the stage of declamatory phrases or placing oneself in the final perspective of nuclear disarmament in the framework of general and complete disarmament : in either case , no concrete progress can be expected in the near future .  
The first was the signing at Cairo of the African Nuclear _ Weapon _ Free Zone Treaty as a testimony to the developing countries ' commitment to the cause of nuclear disarmament worldwide and also as a positive and encouraging step which should be followed soon by the negotiation of the establishment of another zone in the Middle East in conformity with the relevant United Nations General Assembly resolutions and as a step towards the implementation of President Mubarak 's proposal concerning the establishment of a zone free from all weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East .  
Adopting all necessary legislative , administrative and technical measures to ensure the physical protection of nuclear material , nuclear fuel , radioactive products or waste , radioactive substances , nuclear installations and nuclear devices as well as protection against illegal or unauthorized access to them by third parties .  
Upon the completion of the proceedings connected with an act of nuclear terrorism , if it is considered feasible , any nuclear material , nuclear fuel , radioactive products or waste or any other radioactive substances as well as nuclear installations , nuclear explosive or radiation-dissemination devices , including homemade devices and / or their components or objects of which they are components shall be returned to the State party , to which they belong or which was the State of their origin .  
States parties shall not be required by this Convention to provide any information which they are not permitted to communicate pursuant to domestic legislation or which would jeopardize the security of the State concerned or the physical protection of nuclear material , nuclear fuel , radioactive products or waste , radioactive substances , nuclear installations , nuclear devices or their components or objects of which they are components .  
Reference is made to the sequential listing therein of three objectives under a Nuclear disarmament heading : the CTBT , the fissile materials convention , and the determined pursuit by the nuclear _ weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control . upon the prior attainment of the fissile materials production ban ? 
Although national legislation on the protection of the environment has been enacted in many countries , statutory provisions dealing with the protection of the environment were mostly spread through a whole array of legislation and regulations , mainly focusing on hazardous waste , water , soil and air pollution , trafficking in endangered species of flora and fauna , noise pollution and trafficking in nuclear substances , and contained in the various laws on these issues .  
However , to combat crimes involving , in particular , illegal trafficking in hazardous and nuclear substances and endangered species , criminal law should be used as the primary tool , since penal sanctions , by criminalizing a certain behaviour with a corresponding penalty , have a greater deterrent effect .  
Many of us believe that a multilateral , effectively verifiable treaty to prohibit the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices will constitute a prerequisite step in the way towards a nuclear _ weapon _ free world .  
As the embodiment of the world community 's conscience and the sole recognized multilateral negotiating forum on disarmament , this Conference not only shoulders the primary responsibility for finding ways and means to really deal with the problem , but is also the most appropriate venue to commence the negotiations on a universal , effectively verifiable and legally binding multilateral treaty regulating the development , production , stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons and their destruction .  
In most countries with nuclear programmes , the preferred method for the disposal of long-lived radioactive waste is its long-term isolation in a system of multiple barriers located in deep and stable geological formations .  
Many representatives noted that the topic involved mainly activities typical of modern industrial societies , such as those connected with nuclear power plants , the chemical and space industries and maritime transport of petroleum and other dangerous or polluting substances , which certainly had undeniable political and economic value , but also posed a considerable risk for the safety of human beings and protection of the environment . 
That delegation also expressed the view that the safety of those spacecraft at all stages of their operation and in the event of foreseeable accidents would be ensured by safety systems and nuclear power source structural elements designed to meet safety requirements and by special comprehensive administrative and technical measures to prevent accidents and eliminate the effects of accidents .  
Turkey considered that such a convention should also include organized transnational crimes committed in the perpetration of or linked to terrorist acts and illicit trafficking in firearms , in chemical and nuclear materials and in children and other persons .  24 .  The United States noted that Member States had not had sufficient time to discuss the question of the elaboration of an international convention against organized crime and to exchange their views on the issue .  
Concerned with the growing threat of organized crime , including the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , money-laundering , illicit traffic in arms , nuclear material and explosive devices , motor vehicles , objects of art ,  
In addition , the mechanism of nuclear _ free zones has established an entire system of agreements which also provide , in a regional context , of course , for assurances set forth in specific legal instruments .  
My delegation is not convinced that a blueprint or a timetable for the achievement of the ultimate goal in nuclear disarmament would be more conducive to , or for that matter a viable alternative to , the existing bilateral reductions in nuclear arsenals .  
Having accomplished its work on the CTBT , the CD must continue to play its role in non _ proliferation and nuclear disarmament by starting , without further delay , its overdue work on a treaty to prohibit the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , otherwise referred to as the cut _ off convention ( FMCT ) .  
On a multilateral level , the next logical step is for the CD to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator dated 24 March 1995 and contained in document CD / 1299 , and the mandate contained therein .  
We strongly agree with an eloquent remark by Italian Ambassador Balboni Acqua during his statement last Thursday : It is inconceivable to permit fissile materials to be manufactured while nuclear tests are being banned and existing fissile material is being destroyed .  
The use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel-air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium , like the dumping of other toxic and dangerous chemicals and wastes in the developing countries , violates the rights to life , health , physical security and other human rights , such as economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development .  
In the Middle East , the Palestinian people and the Arab population in the Syrian Golan , southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley continue to face serious environmental dangers as a result of the continued Israeli occupation of their territories and the growing military threat posed by nuclear , chemical and bacteriological weapons .  
Moreover , the countless emerging transnational issues , such as environmental protection , sustainable development , non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , prevention of drug trafficking and abuse , overpopulation in cities , payment of debts , eradication of poverty and protection of intellectual property rights , need to be addressed from a global perspective .  
I urge each of you to consider the reinforcing impact that an FMCT would have on parallel efforts to dismantle nuclear warheads , to place fissile material that is determined to be excess to national security requirements under safeguards , and to achieve even deeper nuclear weapons reductions leading toward their eventual elimination .  
In looking ahead toward post _ START III negotiations , nuclear arms reductions would be far more difficult without a ban on new fissile material production for weapons embodied in a treaty that provides confidence that the international community would detect clandestine production .  
The programme translated the goal of eliminating all nuclear weapons from a rhetorical objective into actual reality , setting forth requirements in terms of active efforts to identify specific measures for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons within a well-defined time-frame and under effective international control pending the achievement of the desired goals through negotiation .  
Against the backdrop of the end of the cold war and the diminished possibility of global nuclear confrontation , the Board discussed the security consequences of economic globalization , the lessening of the importance of national boundaries and the increase in intra-State conflict and illicit trafficking in small arms and other criminal activities .  
We also wish to stress the need for a highly developed international surveillance , verification and safety system , to be implemented by a specialized body associated with the International Atomic Energy Agency and applying the safeguards of the European Atomic Energy Community ( EURATOM ) , following the declaration of all stocks of fissile materials in the facilities of nuclear-weapon States and States with advanced nuclear programmes with a view to determining the fate of fissile materials stemming from the dismantling of nuclear weapons and nuclear explosive devices or as yet unused materials .  
I will not recall here the scale of the guarantees already afforded by my country , whether they be positive or negative , in the latter case through the relevant protocols to treaties establishing nuclear _ weapon _ free zones which have all been ratified by France , which therefore cover more than 100 countries , but as far as the Conference on Disarmament is concerned , the question was more simply whether an ad hoc committee on security assurances with a mandate drawn up in 1992 was still the order of the day .  
For our part , I can confirm that the United Kingdom would like to see the agenda of the Conference on Disarmament reflect our key priorities on the disarmament agenda , and for the record I confirm that on the nuclear side , our top priority is the urgent negotiation and conclusion of a fissile material cut _ off treaty , and on the conventional side , our top priority is to work towards the global ban on APLs to complement the Ottawa treaty , which we hope will be opened for signature this December . 
In our view , and as envisaged in the Register 's founding resolution ( General Assembly resolution 46 / 36 L ) , an expanded Register including data on advanced conventional weapons , on weapons of mass destruction , particularly nuclear weapons , and on high technology with military applications would represent a more balanced , more comprehensive and less discriminatory instrument attracting a larger number of regular participants . 
Recalling further its resolution 1996 / 16 , in which it requested the Secretary _ General to submit a report on information gathered on the use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel _ air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium and their consequential and cumulative effects and the danger they represent to life , physical security and other human rights ,  
Striking a balance of information priorities continued to be a problem in the work of the United Nations : there was too much emphasis on the technological aspects of the consequences of the accident , the question of nuclear power plant safety and concern for the future of the nuclear power industry , with less attention devoted to the medical and environmental repercussions of the disaster , the main burden of which was borne by Belarus .  
At the 770th plenary meeting on 26 June 1997 , the delegation of Germany , drawing on earlier statements of several representatives of other Member States , proposed the reestablishment of the Ad Hoc Committee on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator on this subject and the mandate contained therein ( CD / 1299 ) . 
We heard one such unfortunate remark at last week 's plenary when it was asserted that the five declared nuclear Powers want the CD to discuss only small items such as anti _ personnel landmines and a fissile material cut _ off treaty .  
By this all or nothing approach practised in the CD this year , concrete progress on specific and timely issues , issues ripe for multilateral negotiation , was held hostage to demands for an agreement to negotiate multilaterally nuclear disarmament in a time _ bound framework .  
The threats posed by weapons of mass destruction are far from being extinguished , and the consequences of miscalculation or deliberate acts can be horrific , as we know from the terrorist activities of a cult group armed with nerve gas in Japan , biological and toxin weapons in Iraq and persistent reports and risks of nuclear smuggling .  
We continue to be concerned at the threat to the fragile marine environment posed by the regular shipment of nuclear and other hazardous waste through the Caribbean Sea .  
This is of the utmost importance in order to send a strong and timely signal to the international community that nuclear non-proliferation and efficient legal commitments thereto have to be seen as a crucial element of global security .  
We also support IAEA activities to put a halt to illegal trafficking in nuclear materials and activities aimed at increasing the level of physical protection and developing national systems for the inventory and verification of nuclear materials .  
A universal and legally binding multilateral agreement , committed to the objective of total elimination of nuclear weapons , could be taken up , as also the convention on the prohibition of the production of fissile material .  
It is inconceivable to permit fissile materials to be manufactured while nuclear tests are being banned and existing fissile material is being destroyed .  
Looking forward to when we come to the practical realization of the ultimate goal of the elimination of nuclear weapons , multilateral negotiations on an international agreement on the subject will obviously also become essential .  
The unlawful acts committed in respect of all materials or items covered by the current draft also include unlawful acts committed in respect of nuclear material in peaceful use the subject matter covered by the Physical Protection Convention .  
We are aware of an existing view that the cut _ off of future fissile material production is a non-proliferation issue unrelated to nuclear disarmament .  
We have identified nuclear disarmament and FMCT as national priorities , although we recognize that moving these issues forward will require careful and deliberate thinking .  
To them the end of the cold war simply dictated changes in the positioning of strategic and tactical nuclear weapons and the taking of steps to develop new nuclear-weapon systems to meet the geopolitical requirements of the new international system .  
Develop a cooperation programme to address the concerns raised by maritime transport of nuclear and other waste , and to cooperate and coordinate in the relevant international fora to strengthen standards governing such transport and its safety .  
In this respect nuclear disarmament remains an inescapable objective , as the international community decided 20 years ago , one which is itself an integral component of general and complete disarmament .  
As a first step towards that objective , measures should be pursued that would enhance the transparency in surplus fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices in parallel with a fissile material cut-off treaty .  
In its advisory opinion , the Court ruled that the threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the international law applicable to armed conflict and , in particular , the principles and rules of humanitarian law .  
An FMCT is , strictly speaking , not in itself an instrument of disarmament since no single warhead will be dismantled because of it , and the quantity of fissile material available for nuclear arms will be frozen at its current level .  
Once an FMCT has been adopted , there would be a reasonable chance that the main nuclear _ weapon States would commit themselves voluntarily to placing irreversible fissile material transferred from military uses to civilian ones under full IAEA safeguards .  
It is valid only until nuclear disarmament is achieved , and resolute , systematic and progressive efforts towards the final objective of eliminating nuclear weapons worldwide are of crucial importance to it .  
What is being sought is for the international community , represented by the Conference on Disarmament and the NPT , to have focused deliberations on the practical steps for systematic and progressive efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons .  
It tries to make the discussions at the fissile material negotiations , to take place in Geneva , more meaningful and more fruitful , eventually leading , I hope soon , to a complete , effective , integrated system based on the total elimination of nuclear weapons .  
In response to specific concerns raised in chapter 17 of Agenda 21 , the IMO secretariat and its governing bodies have undertaken a number of new or expanded initiatives with respect to prevention of air pollution from ships ; new special sea areas and particularly sensitive sea areas ; irradiated nuclear fuel on board ships ; traffic separation schemes and mandatory ship-reporting systems ; port State control ; and the preparation of measures against tributyltin-based anti-fouling paints for ships .  
The Chinese delegation supports the re _ establishment of an ad hoc committee on the basis of the mandate contained in the Shannon report to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices in accordance with United Nations General Assembly resolution 48 / 75 L . 
Almost a month ago the Italian Under _ Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs , Ms . Patrizia Toia , speaking before the Conference , formulated an urgent request for the immediate re _ establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
In this regard it may be necessary to develop a separate set of verification methods and procedures that will enhance international confidence that fissile material subject to control is not returned to nuclear _ weapons programmes , while at the same time ensuring that the inspectors do not gain access to classified information .  
It is imperative that we should not wait for the end of negotiations on a fissile material treaty , the duration of which is hardly predictable at this stage , to start considering the next steps pursuant to article VI and its corollary , that is , the third commitment in the Principles and objectives document , which foresees systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons .  
There is an enormous annual turnover in markets for illegal goods , such as illegal drugs , protected wildlife , stolen works of art , illegal firearms , and nuclear and / or toxic waste , as well as for trafficking in human beings .  
There was no point in speaking of sustainable development when some countries members of the Forum faced the prospect of being submerged by the sea in the not too distant future , and atolls were being polluted by nuclear tests .  
His country therefore welcomed the outcome of the intensive negotiations held in September and October 1998 and was convinced that the current draft convention represented a positive development with respect to the international communitys endeavours to prepare a universally accepted instrument to curb or eliminate the threat of nuclear terrorism .  There were , however , a number of issues that needed to be clarified and settled .  
the substantive discussion of nuclear disarmament issues through which the international community can be better informed on a continuing basis , can express its views as to the process , and can identify issues which might be subject to multilateral negotiations .  
To re-establish , for the duration of its 1999 session , the Ad hoc Committee under item 1 of the agenda entitled " Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament " to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Also in August last year , the Conference on Disarmament established an ad hoc committee under item 1 of its agenda , to negotiate a ' non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ' .  
The situation of deadlock in which the Conference finds itself now in connection with procedural or organizational issues , which , it is true , have a very important relationship to the substantive consideration of the topics falling within the competence of the Conference , regrettably have a negative impact on its credibility , in which the international community has vested its confidence so that it will consider issues of disarmament and nuclear disarmament in particular . 
It was a timely initiative , particularly in the light of the growing threat of the use of nuclear or radioactive material by irresponsible individuals or groups .  
Thirdly , the provisions of article 4 , especially those exempting from the scope of the draft convention activities of armed forces [ of a State ] during an armed conflict , were used to sustain a questionable exception which had the effect of recognizing an alleged right of such forces to use and traffic in nuclear or radioactive material , on the pretext of the exercise of official duties and inasmuch as [ such activities ] are governed by ( . . . ) international law .  
Canada indicated in its statement of March 18 , 1999 , concerning the negotiation of a " non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices " its considered view as to how the issue of fissile material stockpiles should be addressed by those states possessing such stockpiles .  
We are all aware that it is not easy to combine differing viewpoints in a single package , but when we recall the current nuclear arms race and the massive stockpiles of nuclear arsenals with all the dangers that they entail , this should induce us to appeal to the international forums specialized in the field of disarmament to place this issue on their list of priorities and to apply its criteria thereto in a comprehensive manner and without any exception .  
We have however set forward these views , given our strong commitment to the achievement of a viable , effective and credible treaty which must reinforce the international nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation regime .  
In view of the fact that the two types of weapons of mass destruction of biological and chemical weapons have been comprehensively prohibited , there is no reason why nuclear weapons , which are of greater destructive force , should not be comprehensively banned and thoroughly destroyed .  
The research , development , deployment and proliferation of sophisticated anti _ missile systems and the revision of , or even withdrawal from , the existing disarmament treaties on which global strategic equilibrium hinges will inevitably exert an extensive negative impact on international security and stability and trigger a new round of the arms race in new areas , thereby seriously obstructing or neutralizing international efforts of nuclear disarmament and nuclear non _ proliferation .  
The view was also expressed that the scientific and technical aspects of the use of nuclear power sources in outer space should be studied in order to develop further the legal issues involved , especially in relation to collisions between nuclear-powered objects and space debris .  
The programme budget for the biennium 19961997 , as approved by the General Assembly , stated that the efforts of the international community were still focused on weapons of mass destruction , particularly nuclear ones , but were becoming increasingly concerned with the growth and proliferation of various types of conventional weapons ( A / 50 / 6 / Rev . 1,3 para .  2.81 ) .  The programme budget for the biennium 19981999 maintains the same approach .  
The readiness demonstrated by the Arab States to take practical steps towards the establishment of an effectively verifiable Middle East zone free from all weapons of mass destruction - nuclear , chemical and biological - and to refrain from taking any measures that preclude the achievement of this objective in accordance with paragraph 5 of the 1995 resolution on the Middle East as well as paragraph 14 of Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) should not go unnoticed .  
To re-establish , under item 1 of the agenda entitled " Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament " , the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
According to that paragraph , the Conference would decide to re _ establish , under item 1 of the agenda , entitled Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament , the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Reaffirmation that new supply arrangements for the transfer of sources or special fissionable material or equipment or material specially designed or prepared for the processing , use or production of special fissionable material to non-nuclear-weapon states should require as a necessary precondition , acceptance of IAEA full-scope safeguards and internationally legally binding commitments not to acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Reaffirmation of the importance attached to the work of IAEA regarding multilateral technical cooperation in the development of the applications of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and call again for every effort to be made to ensure that IAEA has the necessary financial and human resources to meet its responsibilities in the area of technical cooperation , safeguards and nuclear safety .  
Reaffirmation that new supply arrangements for the transfer of source or special fissionable material or equipment or material especially designed or prepared for the processing , use or production of special fissionable material to non-nuclear-weapon States should require , as a necessary precondition , acceptance of the Agency 's full-scope safeguards and internationally legally binding commitments not to acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Reaffirmation , in this context by the nuclear-weapons States , of their faithful commitment to the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons , and their means of delivery , and to that end , agreement to pursue vigorously systematic and progressive efforts to further reduce nuclear weapons , globally and regionally . ( delete - Declaration of commitment to the achievement of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ) .

d ) Establishment of a subsidiary body to Main Committee I of Review Conferences , and the provision of specific time at all future meetings of Preparatory Committees , for a structured opportunity to deliberate on the practical steps for systematic and progressive efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons .

Despite the cross _ regional support for such a mechanism , despite the assurances that its deliberations on nuclear disarmament would not impinge on the bilateral nuclear disarmament process , despite the safeguards provided by the rule of consensus in the CD and despite a continual lowering of ambitions in relation to the scope of work on nuclear disarmament , a consensus has not so far proved attainable .  
Thirdly , the adoption of a renewed Strategic Concept by a regional military alliance _ despite the declared end of the cold war _ is bound to generate considerable concern in the wide spectrum of nuclear and non _ nuclear States .  
This , I presume , will require a balanced approach , susceptible to reconciling enlightened pragmatism with the ideals that have inspired the creation of this forum _ first and foremost , the achievement of a nuclear _ weapon _ free world in the not _ so _ distant future .  
There is an intrinsic interrelationship between strategic offensive weapons and strategic defensive weapons , one laid down in the ABM Treaty itself in the form of a clear understanding that , given parity in terms of strategic offensive weapons , the emergence of strategic means of defence in the hands of one of the parties would be equivalent to an increase in the power of a pre _ emptive nuclear strike .  
Nevertheless , the treaty has established a legal framework for the resolve of the international community to halt all explosive nuclear testing and an appropriate basis for its appeal to all countries to commit themselves not just to a narrow literal interpretation of the provisions of the Treaty but to its substance and spirit .  
Its membership has been growing day by day and civil society has begun to identify with it as a solid basis for the hope that nuclear disarmament efforts may prove successful in the future if they take the form of firm , practical and effective steps , as reflected in General Assembly resolution 53 / 77 Y .  
This process was very complicated from both the legal and technical perspectives and required a lot of resources and international assistance , so for us it seems disgraceful and unjust that in the context of mentioning countries which have abandoned their military nuclear programmes or forsworn nuclear weapons the name of our country is sometimes not even found .  
Fifty years ago the ban on the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons was supposed to be the real tool in preventing the nuclear arms race , which had been unleashed between the two antagonistic super _ Powers .  
Following the end of cold war , the United Nations has been called upon to take up new challenges and tasks as a result of the growing threat from the existence of large stockpiles of nuclear weapons , proposals for ballistic missile defences and the weaponization of outer space , the lack of progress in the field of disarmament , the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the development and use of advanced and sophisticated conventional arms ;  
In various international forums , Cuba has expressed its unequivocal position in favour of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons and has taken action , both in the Conference on Disarmament , the sole multinational forum for negotiation on disarmament , and in the General Assembly of the United Nations , with a view to attaining that objective .  
Mexico remains convinced that it is incumbent on all States to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control as provided in resolution 53 / 77 W entitled Follow-up to the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons adopted on 4 December 1998 by the General Assembly of the United Nations at its fifty-third session . 
Another fundamental international legal instrument elaborated by the CD is the CTBT , a treaty which was a long _ sought objective of the international community and which is supposed to block any further qualitative development of nuclear weapons .  
It is with this in mind that I have requested the floor today to outline some elements South Africa regards as politically achievable and technically feasible in obtaining an effective , credible and workable fissile material treaty that would reinforce the nuclear disarmament and non _ proliferation regime .  
In its exchange , the Board took the following four elements into account : the current deadlock concerning disarmament of strategic nuclear weapons made it all the more important and timely to discuss tactical nuclear weapons ; such weapons were still not being addressed by any negotiating process ; they were present in large numbers ; and they posed specific problems in terms of the doctrines concerning their use .  
Ambassador Moher arrived four years ago , at a crucial time , when the negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear test _ ban treaty were entering their final stage , and he injected into our deliberations a remarkable blend of deep knowledge of the issues under negotiation , an ingredient of iron _ clad logic and a special ability to build bridges between opposing views .  
Allow me also to express the hope that this recently adopted decision will constitute a spur to promote the work of the Conference on Disarmament and afford us a real opportunity to share with the five new members the arduous work which the international community expects of us in negotiating multilateral disarmament treaties with particular attention to the objective of achieving a world which is free of nuclear weapons .  
The re _ establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate , on the basis of the report by the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices .  
At this critical juncture , the Nagasaki conference considered , inter alia , how to prevent further proliferation of nuclear weapons capability ; how to improve and strengthen the existing nuclear non-proliferation regime ; the multilateral approach towards nuclear disarmament and the eventual abolition of nuclear weapons ; immediate priorities to avoid accidental nuclear war ; how to promote nuclear disarmament and practical steps to that end ; and national and regional security today .  
The European Union has expressed support for the creation of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East , and emphasized the importance of additional protocols to safeguards agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency as an effective measure to prevent nuclear proliferation and foster mutual confidence .  
The recommended doctrine confirms India 's craving to be recognized as a global Power - not by acting as a responsible member of the international community but through nuclear and conventional militarization and aggressive actions .  
During the preparatory process for the Conference to review the Non _ Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) , scheduled for the year 2000 , we have seen with concern the increasing lack of political understanding between the parties _ nuclear States and non _ nuclear States _ to the said Treaty as to how to progress in a manner which is effective and satisfactory for all the interested parties towards the securing of the ultimate objectives of the NPT .  
The Agency noted moreover that one of the major objectives of the physical protection activities is to convey a basic understanding of the need to protect nuclear materials and of the tools necessary for developing and operating a national physical protection system .  
As of January 1997 , under the technical cooperation project entitled Legislative Assistance for the Utilization of Nuclear Energy , IAEA has been supporting countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the newly independent States in their national efforts to establish , develop or review the national laws governing the safe and peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to adopt implementing legislation for the international instruments to which they have adhered .  
The project is being extended to 2001 to accommodate the increased demand for legislative assistance as a result of a comprehensive review by the Governments of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the newly independent States of their nuclear legislation and regulations , including non-proliferation and physical protection of nuclear material and facilities .  
The Agency also reported that a new technical cooperation project had been initiated , entitled Physical Protection and Security of Nuclear Materials , designed to increase the national capacity in countries of Central and Eastern Europe for the physical protection of nuclear installations and nuclear materials , as well as for the prevention of illicit trafficking in radioactive materials .  
The " report " kept silent about complete abolition of nuclear weapons , the key issue of nuclear disarmament , but impudently raised the nuclear and missile issues of some countries pursuing self-defense in the face of outsiders ' constant threats , and even provoked United Nations bodies including the Geneva Conference on Disarmament .  
The European Union believes that a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable fissile material cut _ off treaty constitutes , after the CTBT , a major step towards the achievement of both the nuclear non _ proliferation and nuclear disarmament objectives envisaged in the NPT document on principles and objectives .  
But I will repeat one clear and uncontested truth : a cut _ off treaty will make a substantial , vital and practical contribution to advancing the goal of global nuclear disarmament .  
Mr . President , even at this late stage , Pakistan is committed to pursuing contacts and consultations with all the members of the international community in order to evolve a broadly agreed approach to deal with the threats to regional and global peace and security emerging from Indias political and military ambitions as revealed in its nuclear doctrine .  
First , the re _ establishment of the ad hoc committee under agenda item 1 to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices ;  
Guided by the desire to contribute , in its own way , to the cause of nuclear non-proliferation , and in line with its foreign policy aimed at contributing to regional peace and security , as well as ensuring the country 's national security by political and diplomatic means , in 1992 , Mongolia declared its territory a nuclear-weapon-free zone . 
India has also supported under Conference agenda item 1 the establishment of an ad hoc committee which shall negotiate , on the basis of the report of the special coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
The two sides further undertake to notify each other immediately in the event of any accidental , unauthorized or unexplained incident that could create the risk of fallout with adverse consequences for both sides , or an outbreak of a nuclear war between the two countries , as well as to adopt measures aimed at diminishing the possibility of such actions , or of such incidents being misrepresented by the other .  
From the IAEA perspective , the universal application of strengthened safeguards , and effective verification of compliance with agreements to eliminate existing nuclear arsenals , would provide a sound basis for verifying a world free from nuclear weapons .  
Moreover , Mexico has promoted the initiatives included in resolution 53 / 77 Y at both the regional and international levels , especially those intended to underline the extreme urgency of initiating negotiations on nuclear disarmament and the adoption of a consistent action programme that will lead us to a world free of nuclear weapons .  
Recalls the decision by the Conference on Disarmament2 to establish , under item 1 of its agenda entitled Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament , an ad hoc committee which shall negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator3 and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ;  
Recalling the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons , issued on 8 July 1996,8 and welcoming the unanimous reaffirmation by all Judges of the Court that there exists an obligation for all States to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control ,  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ;  
The intensive negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on and their early conclusion of a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator in 1995 and the mandate contained therein , and , pending its entry into force , a moratorium of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons ;  
Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons , notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile materials , and calls for continued efforts by States that possess fissile material no longer required for defence purposes to make such material available for safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) as soon as practicable ;  
The General Conference urged Member States to share information with the Secretariat regarding diagnostic and corrective actions being planned or implemented by operating and regulatory organizations at their nuclear power plants , fuel cycle and / or medical facilities which use radioactive materials to make those facilities Year 2000 ready .  
The General Conference encouraged the Secretariat , within existing resources , to act as a clearing house and central point of contact for Member States to exchange information regarding diagnostic and remediation actions being taken at nuclear power plants , fuel cycle and / or medical facilities which use radioactive materials to make these facilities Year 2000 ready .  
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ;  
Intensive negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on the early conclusion of a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator in 199532 and the mandate contained therein , and , pending its entry into force , a moratorium on the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons ;  
Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons , notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile material , and calls for continued efforts by States that possess fissile material no longer required for defence purposes to make such material available for safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency as soon as practicable ;  
Stressing that the international community must not enter the new millennium with the prospect that the possession of nuclear weapons will be considered legitimate for the indefinite future , and convinced of the imperative to proceed with determination to prohibit and eradicate them for all time ,  
Emphasizing that , for the total elimination of nuclear weapons to be achieved , effective international cooperation to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons is vital and must be enhanced through , inter alia , the extension of international controls over all fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ,  
Recalling the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons , issued on 8 July 1996,91 and welcoming the unanimous reaffirmation by all Judges of the Court that there exists an obligation for all States to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control ,  
The Panel finds that expenses relating to activation of the nuclear and radiological emergency plan are , in principle , compensable as reasonable precautionary and preventative measures to protect against a potential spillover effect from Iraqs military operations against the Israeli nuclear reactor .  However , the evidence is insufficient to enable the Panel to verify the claim .  
It was observed that the draft convention was an important complement to the existing anti-terrorist conventions , providing an effective legal framework for combating and discouraging acts of nuclear terrorism , which posed a real threat to the maintenance of international peace and security .  
Meanwhile , short - and medium-term measures include confidence-building at the regional and global levels , transparency in the field of armaments , a steady reduction of military expenditures , the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in the interim .  
This policy has also included the organization and support of armed groups ; air and naval raids against our territory ; the hatching of over 600 plots to assassinate the leader of our revolution ; a military invasion by a mercenary army ; the most serious threat ever of a global nuclear conflict , in October 1962 ; and finally , a brutal commercial and financial blockade and a ferocious economic war against my country that have now lasted 40 years .  
To this must be added the growing number of hotbeds of tension and conflict between and within States , the growing risk of outbreaks of ethnic , tribal and sectarian conflicts , greater risks of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , especially nuclear weapons , increased stockpiles of conventional weapons and the growth of terrorism as an international phenomenon that threatens democracy , human rights and international peace and security .  
These include effective export control , adequate physical protection of nuclear material and facilities , accelerated steps towards nuclear disarmament and an appropriate arrangement for global and regional security .  
For a considerable time , the European Union has steadfastly supported the commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a multilateral and internationally binding treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
The activities of the Agency in that area have been strengthened by the adoption of additional standards for the safe management and transportation of radioactive waste and for the security of nuclear power stations , which were approved by the Board of Governors , as well as by the adoption of resolutions in the General Conference on the radiological protection of patients , the safety of transport of radioactive materials and the security of radiation sources .  
The Agencys efforts in improving physical protection guidelines and assisting States in implementing effective physical protection systems at the national and facility levels serve as major steps towards better control of illicit trafficking in nuclear material .  
Regardless of its considerable benefits , nuclear energy is still problematic in one particular aspect : spent fuel and nuclear waste , its interim storage and final repository , especially in small States with limited industrial and scientific capabilities .  
However , the full knowledge of the advantages of nuclear energy and of the economic and social situation of most countries , in particular of the developing countries , has not prevented some developed countries from maintaining attitudes counter to the objectives of the IAEA trying to cut technical assistance programmes , decreasing their contributions to the fund created for such purposes or selectively putting conditions on the funds use .  
This , however , has not prevented us from taking concrete steps that demonstrate our clear desire for peace and general and complete disarmament , as well as demonstrating the transparency and peaceful nature of the nuclear programme we are developing.I have the honour to report to the plenary Assembly that last month Cuba signed a protocol additional to the safeguards agreements that it entered into on a voluntary basis with the IAEA .  
On the occasion of the signing we were able to show him some of the progress we have made and reiterate our political will to work for a strengthened , effective and efficient safeguards system , based on an equitable regime that will lead to the total elimination of nuclear weapons .  
The declared objective of the Convention is the achievement and preservation worldwide of a high level of nuclear safety through increased implementation of national measures and international cooperation .  
As we approach the new millennium , Egypt hopes that international efforts will be directed steadfastly towards the liquidation of established military arsenals , the implementation and universality of disarmament agreements and the achievement of their ultimate goal , which is the welfare of humankind and the provision of a safer world for future generations , a world free of nuclear risks and environmental threats .  
It is encouraging to note that the Agencys role in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy now covers areas ranging from power generation to a diverse array of industrial , medical and agricultural applications .  
In the context of nuclear energy development , Russia considers the reduction and disposal of nuclear armaments to be connected with the peaceful use of the tremendous scientific and technological potential that used to be the exclusive domain of military programmes .  
Without denying the importance of developing renewable power sources , we should admit that at present the only realistic industrial-scale solution to this problem is to intensify efforts to develop a safe , environmentally acceptable and economically attractive nuclear power sector.Will the nuclear power industry be equal to a task of this magnitude ?  
It plays a vital role in maintaining global nuclear non-proliferation and security through the operation of the nuclear safeguards system and in areas such as illicit trafficking of nuclear materials and the management of surplus fissile material from dismantled weapons . 
Encouraging increasing numbers of States committed to non-proliferation to sign additional protocols would serve two purposes : first , to subject the portion of the worlds nuclear fuel cycle currently under the Agencys comprehensive safeguards to a further strengthened system of safeguards and , secondly , to exert requisite influence on the States that are prone to pursuing undeclared nuclear activities , with a view to their eventual adoption of this new form .  
The Republic of Belarus notes with satisfaction the multifaceted , fruitful and useful activities of the IAEA , a unique international organization that brings together the efforts of Member States to ensure the effective and safe use of the achievements of nuclear science and technology for the good of humankind in the spirit of the lofty United Nations principles of humanism . 
In Syria we look forward to a Middle East region where a just , lasting and comprehensive peace prevails , a peace based on international legality , not on expansion , occupation and the monopoly of nuclear military power , which can only lead to increased tension in the Middle East .  
By the same token , my delegation abstained in the separate vote on the third preambular paragraph , as we have done in corresponding cases in previous years , because it is our view that the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes is an inalienable right of all States and therefore can not be made conditional on whether or not one is a party to certain international treaties .  
This year such issues include the dumping of nuclear waste and other toxic substances , the regional seas programme of the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , the increasing threat to shipping from piracy and armed robbery at sea , the importance of enhancing the safety of navigation and the continued work of the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization towards a convention on the protection of the underwater cultural heritage .  
Motivated by the need to protect the health and safety or our population and our environment , we believe that these efforts should continue , thus promoting the adoption of mechanisms that will provide sufficient guarantees to all the States concerned that the strictest safety measures will be applied in the international maritime transport of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel , and that any damage resulting from accidents in connection with such operations will be made good .  
For the island States , whether in the Caribbean or the Pacific , the international maritime transportation of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuels is a real security threat , all the more serious because most of those potentially affected are small countries lacking the resources to cope with a crisis of such magnitude , caused by big countries and by technologies that those small countries do not control .  
The delegation of India highlighted in the First Committee last year the fact that , with the end of the cold war more than a decade ago , there is no justification for thousands of nuclear weapons being maintained in a state of hair-trigger alert , creating unacceptable risks of unintentional or accidental use of nuclear weapons .  
The draft resolution is also silent on the current impasse in the Conference on Disarmament due to the inflexibility shown by a few delegations on the questions of nuclear disarmament and outer space , ignoring the express wishes of the vast majority of its members , which support the commencement of substantive negotiations as part of a balanced and comprehensive programme of work .  
Although my delegation also shares the objective of the total elimination of nuclear weapons and the need to work for a nuclear-weapon-free world , we remain unconvinced of the utility of an exercise bound by the flawed and discriminatory approaches of the NPT .  
This shows not only our deep understanding of the importance of this Treaty , but also our desire to make a real contribution towards resolving the problems of nuclear non-proliferation , improving the ecological condition of the planet and strengthening global security and regional stability .  
In the Conference on Disarmament my country will advocate the prompt initiation of negotiations on a non-discriminatory , multilateral , effective and internationally verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices , the cut-off treaty , taking into account the objectives of non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament .  
As we approach the end of this century , which surely will be remembered as the one in which mankind developed and used its most powerful weapon yet , the nuclear weapon , we must lay the foundation for a new collective consciousness directed towards the quest for peace and security by means other than armed confrontation , and give thought to the realities and contradictions involved in the disarmament process .  
Recognizing further that the use of nuclear power sources in outer space should be based on a thorough safety assessment , including probabilistic risk analysis , with particular emphasis on reducing the risk of accidental exposure of the public to harmful radiation or radioactive material ,  
For the purposes of paragraph 2 ( d ) of principle 3 , the term made critical does not include actions such as zero-power testing which are fundamental to ensuring system safety.In order to minimize the quantity of radioactive material in space and the risks involved , the use of nuclear power sources in outer space shall be restricted to those space missions which can not be operated by non-nuclear energy sources in a reasonable way .  
A launching State as defined in principle 2 , paragraph 1 , at the time of launch shall , prior to the launch , through cooperative arrangements , where relevant , with those which have designed , constructed or manufactured the nuclear power sources , or will operate the space object , or from whose territory or facility such an object will be launched , ensure that a thorough and comprehensive safety assessment is conducted .  
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure the non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
The advisory opinion also emphasized that the threat or use of nuclear weapons is generally contrary to the requirements of international law applicable in armed conflict , particularly those of the principles and rules of international humanitarian law .  
In spite of our unflinching commitment to the provisions of the NPT and repeated calls over the years to be assured , through a legally binding international instrument , against the threat or use of nuclear weapons by our powerful partners , their response has not been at all reassuring .  
Together , we must seek the objective of non-proliferation from all aspects , with a view to ensuring that the Treaty will become a true international tool for effective nuclear disarmament as well as a solid foundation for more productive international cooperation on the utilization of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes on a non-discriminatory basis , and within the context of a system of recognized international guarantees .  
In this respect , my delegation commends the timely advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice which asserts that the threat or use of nuclear weapons is generally contrary to the rules of international humanitarian law applicable to armed conflicts .  
Welcomes the decision by the Conference on Disarmament32 to establish , under item 1 of its agenda entitled Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament , an ad hoc committee which shall negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator 33 ] and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ;  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ;  
Recalling the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons , issued on 8 July 1996 , 25 and welcoming the unanimous reaffirmation by all Judges of the Court that there exists an obligation for all States to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control ,  
Stressing that the international community must not enter the third millennium with the prospect that the possession of nuclear weapons will be considered legitimate for the indefinite future , and convinced that the present juncture provides a unique opportunity to proceed to prohibit and eradicate them for all time ,  
Emphasizing that , for the total elimination of nuclear weapons to be achieved , effective international cooperation to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons is vital and must be enhanced through , inter alia , the extension of international controls over all fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ,  
Appreciating also the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , 2 and acknowledging the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
Eight Foreign Ministers of delegations represented in this Council Chamber came together on 9 June 1998 to issue a Joint Ministerial Declaration which contained the call for a new international agenda to achieve a nuclear _ weapon _ free world , through the pursuit , in parallel , of a series of mutually reinforcing measures at the bilateral , plurilateral and multilateral levels .  
The programme of action set out in that decision identified a comprehensive nuclear test _ ban treaty , a convention banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , and the determined pursuit by the nuclear _ weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate aim of eliminating those weapons .  
Yet practical results have been dismal as regard substantive measures directed toward the eventual and total elimination of nuclear weapons , which constitute the most destructive of such weapons of mass destruction .  
As the Conference on Disarmament begins its work in the new year , I want to underline the strong commitment of the United States to prompt resumption of negotiations on the next key multilateral step in the nuclear disarmament process : a treaty to ban the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Looking beyond START III negotiations , it seems clear to us that the prospects for negotiating deeper reductions would be enhanced if we have in place a dependable cap on fissile material for weapons , as well as confidence that the international community would detect illegal production.An FMCT also would help make nuclear arms reductions irreversible . 
If we truly want the Conference on Disarmament to live up to its responsibilities as the sole multilateral negotiating body on disarmament and international security , let us focus our work here on halting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , in particular nuclear weapons.Let us start today the negotiations on a fissile material cut _ off treaty !  
It should provide for detailed accounts of the fissile material produced after the cut _ off date ; safeguards against the use of this material for nuclear _ weapon purposes ; timely and effective detention of any diversion of fissile material produced after the cut _ off date , as well as of any undeclared enrichment or reprocessing after that date .  
The agreement to begin negotiations designed to secure a treaty eliminating and prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices certainly constitutes a token of political will which is positive and constructive .  
At a public sitting on 8 July 1996 , the International Court of Justice recognized for the first time in history that the threat or use of nuclear weapons is generally contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict , and in particular the principles and rules of humanitarian law , also recognizing that there exists an obligation for all States to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament .  
In May 1995 this bargain was renewed ; indeed , a second trade-off was made when , in exchange for the indefinite extension of the NPT without a vote , the nuclear-weapon States reaffirmed their commitments as stated in article VI of the Treaty to pursue in good faith negotiations on effective measures relating to nuclear disarmament and their determined pursuit of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons .  
Our appeal has received further backing from the most prestigious international judicial institution , the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) , which in its advisory opinion of 8 July 1996 called on all States to pursue in good faith negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective control .  
Secondly , some elements that were incorporated into the draft resolution are not in accordance with our own perception of nuclear disarmament , which is fully identified with the position of the Non-Aligned Movement as appropriately stated at its summit at Cartagena , Colombia , in an international setting that favoured the promotion of practical measures for the final and complete elimination of nuclear weapons .  
To try to make this topic the private domain of the nuclear Powers thus excluding the vast majority of States from the multilateral negotiations necessary in order to attain nuclear disarmament in a time-bound framework and under strict international control would only delay further the legitimate aspirations of mankind to live in a nuclear-weapon-free world .  
As a result , the cause of nuclear disarmament has now made a qualitative leap forward , and is strengthened by the unanimous response of the Court that obligations exist to continue and complete negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all is aspects under strict and effective control .  
The voting results on this counter-draft resolution and on the original Russian-United States bilateral nuclear arms negotiation that it is designed to belittle will have far more impact on my Government ' s attitude towards the concept of a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to nuclear disarmament than will all the rhetoric that we have heard alleging genuine desire in the international community to seek progress towards nuclear disarmament .  
My delegation hopes that in the future , instead of having to adopt two separate draft resolutions on the same subject , the First Committee and the General Assembly will be able to render unanimous support for a single draft resolution on nuclear disarmament negotiations that is comprehensive and acceptable to all .  
It called for parallel negotiations on a phased programme for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons and a comprehensive agreement banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices pursuant to paragraph 4 of the decision on Principles and objectives of the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference .  
The scope of such an international document should therefore cover all fissile material potentially usable in the manufacture of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices throughout the world , including the military stocks of these materials possessed by all States , on an equal footing .  
My delegation likewise supports the re _ establishment of the ad hoc committee to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral , effectively and internationally verifiable treaty prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , which will meet the goals of nuclear non _ proliferation and constitute an authentic disarmament measure .  
The PRESIDENT : On the second issue , I would like to recall that the representative of South Africa made a proposal at the first plenary meeting on 19 January 1999 to establish an ad hoc committee on nuclear disarmament to deliberate upon practical steps for systematic and progressive efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons as well as to identify if and when one or more such steps should be subject to negotiations in the Conference .  
Mr . GOOSEN ( South Africa ) : It is obviously with deep regret that we hear today that the Conference on Disarmament , which is defined as the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum of the international community and which has the primary role in substantive negotiations on priority questions of disarmament , remains unable to reach a consensus on the establishment of a mechanism to deliberate on the issue of nuclear disarmament .  
The future holds the prospect that ITs will enable us to transport electrical binary bits or pulses ( 0 s and 1 s ) instead of moving and bashing atoms and thus accurately simulate a nuclear explosion , just as we can reconstruct an analogue signal from a sampled ( quantized and coded ) series of bits cheaply and safely .  
To re-establish , for the duration of its 1999 session , the Ad hoc Committee under item 1 of the agenda entitled " Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament " to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
To our mind it is essential to design a comprehensive and universal legal regime which meets the expectations of the international community and creates sufficient confidence in international relations for the establishment of a world free of nuclear weapons .  
The Chairman announced that the Committee had concluded the consideration of agenda item 155 , entitled Measures to eliminate international terrorism , it being understood that the work of the Ad Hoc Committee established by the General Assembly to elaborate a draft international convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism would continue . 
The Conference establishes , under agenda item 1 entitled " Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament " , an ad hoc committee which shall negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices . iii .  
This overview explains why Canada remains so engaged to fully and urgently observing the objective unanimously agreed at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference , that is , the determined pursuit by the nuclear _ weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons . . . .  
We should also recommence immediately , in an ad hoc committee , negotiations on a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , as already agreed last year .  
Third and last , and in close connection with what I said earlier , I would like to place on record the support of my delegation for the early re _ establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty which would impose a prohibition on the production of fissile material for atomic bombs and other explosive nuclear devices , and for the early initiation of the negotiations .  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ;  
The intensive negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on and their early conclusion of a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator in 1995 and the mandate contained therein , and , pending its entry into force , a moratorium of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons ;  
Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons , notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile materials , and calls for continued efforts by States that possess fissile material no longer required for defence purposes to make such material available for safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) as soon as practicable ;  
In fifth place , as regards general disarmament , we emphasize the need to advance towards total elimination of nuclear , chemical and bacteriological weapons ; illicit trafficking in small arms , and the use of antipersonnel mines and explosive devices .  
Australia has long recognized that a universal and verifiable ban on nuclear tests is an essential component of regional and international peace and security , and would be a decisive step towards the goal of the elimination of nuclear weapons .  
For several years the European Union has supported the initiation of negotiations on and the rapid conclusion of , a multilateral international treaty prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other explosive nuclear devices .  
Equally important , the draft resolution draws attention to the importance of ongoing efforts to dismantle nuclear weapons and the need to ensure that excess fissile material is handled in a safe and effective way .  
In the Declaration , we also expressed our intention to carry out all the efforts required to ensure the Treatys full and universal implementation in order to promote the final objective , a world free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction .  
Therefore , as a personal wish , when the philosophical question of nuclear disarmament some day turns into a reality through the concerted efforts of the entire international community , again the mission will be complete , as in previous cases .  
The Conference underlines the role of IAEA in assisting developing countries in the peaceful use of nuclear energy through the development of effective programmes aimed at improving their scientific , technological , and regulatory capabilities .  
CARICOM member States have for many years expressed growing concern at the increasing threat to our marine environment posed by pollution and by the transportation of hazardous and nuclear waste through the Caribbean Sea .  
Instead , voluntary renouncement of the worlds third largest nuclear potential has brought its obvious dividends in the form of wide recognition and strengthened political and economic cooperation with the world .  
It still dumps nuclear waste in the occupied Arab territories and continues its programme of developing all kinds of weapons of mass destruction , biological or chemical , because of the worlds inaction and the double standards that the great Powers apply .  
An eventual convention on fissile material should be a concrete step forward in the nuclear disarmament process and should not be limited to being just another instrument of selective nonproliferation .  
All States have an urgent obligation to complete negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects , under strict and effective international control , as expressed by the International Court of Justice in its Advisory Opinion .  
The initial promise of deep , continuous and irreversible reductions in strategic nuclear forces held out by the positive climate of the early postcoldwar years appears to be fading fast .  
While weapons of mass destruction , in particular nuclear weapons , continue to be of primary concern , the international community has expressed increasing concern about the proliferation of conventional weapons , especially small arms and light weapons .  
It was of utmost importance to make systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating them under strict and effective international control .  
His delegation looked forward to the resumption and early conclusion of negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on a binding universal legal instrument banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
To promote regional cooperation for the development and practical application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in the interest of the sustainable social and economic development of the African continent ;  
His Government acknowledged the need for adequate and effective measures to interdict illicit trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive materials and believed that new and more comprehensive cooperative efforts might be required .  
The Russian Federation was contributing to the technical development of safeguards through a national support programme aimed at improving analytical methods , modernizing the technical means employed , and producing and certifying samples of nuclear material .  
In view of the huge arsenal still in the possession of the nuclear Powers , the risk of an inadvertent war had not diminished even though increasing political , moral and legal limitations had been placed on the effective use of such weapons .  
It was imperative to reverse that dangerous trend , and in that context his country fully supported the New Agenda Coalition , which represented a moderate and constructive approach to nonproliferation and nuclear disarmament .  
In the broader context of nuclearweaponfree zones , Chile attached special importance to the regulation of the international maritime transport of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel according to the highest international safety standards .  
Our efforts in biological and chemical weapons , in verifying conventional arms levels and in pursuing collective security arrangements are all an essential backdrop to creating the conditions for complete nuclear disarmament .  
Saying that the Agency did not have any assurances that there were no undeclared nuclear activities was the same as insisting that a party was guilty until proven innocent , the exact opposite of the legal principle usually applied .  
The Conference underlines the role of IAEA in assisting developing countries in the peaceful use of nuclear energy through the development of effective programmes aimed at improving their scientific , technological , and regulatory capabilities .  
The United Kingdom had published an initial report on past production of fissile material for defence purposes and was circulating a summary paper on its main conclusions and the role of such work in nuclear disarmament .  
Ad hoc regimes , acting under the pretext of nonproliferation , continued to pursue discriminatory policies with the main objective of exclusive possession of nuclear technology by developed countries .  
The Conference underlines the role of IAEA in assisting developing countries in the peaceful use of nuclear energy through the development of effective programmes aimed at improving their scientific , technological , and regulatory capabilities .  
The major issue addressed had been the peaceful use of nuclear energy , including maritime transport of such energy , radioactive materials , nuclear safety and technical cooperation and the liability and role of nuclear energy in sustainable development .  
The final report of the Conference contained a balanced review and set a realistic and achievable agenda to take forward the work to which the entire international community was committed , namely , the achievement of a world free from nuclear weapons .  
Of crucial importance was an adequate national technical , human and regulatory infrastructure in nuclear safety , radiological protection and waste management for the peaceful application of nuclear energy .  
Rather , it was designed to achieve the complete elimination of nuclear weapons and lead to a system of strict and effective international control capable of ensuring that such weapons would not be manufactured again .  
The resources devoted to huge arsenals nuclear and conventional take up the funds that could be devoted to economic development and social progress , which is of great importance to the people of developed and developing countries alike .  
On the technological level , new weapons research and development has continued unabated , with the emergence of more accurate nuclear ballistic missile systems and the deployment of highly accurate nuclear armed cruise missiles .  
All missiles capable of carrying warheads with nuclear , bacteriological and chemical agents should be banned from future production and current stockpiles should be gradually reduced and finally destroyed .  
In connection with the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , the vital importance of security in the international maritime transport of radioactive waste is quite evident .  
The proliferation of nuclear weapons and the growing emphasis on military doctrines , missile proliferation and the potential deployment of national missile defence are additional factors that pose alarming dangers to international security .  
They pledged to make new efforts aimed at the total elimination of nuclear arsenals , halting the global spread of nuclear weapons and strengthening the essential standards governing the peaceful uses of nuclear energy .  
It is imperative that even as we work towards developing the requisite political will , in the interim the international community accepts the need for urgent practical steps that will diminish nuclear dangers .  
The tragedy at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , almost 15 years ago , affected almost the entire territory of Europe but most of all Ukraine and the neighbouring areas of Belarus and the Russian Federation and caused long-lasting , complex problems .  The human suffering caused by the accident can not be measured , and its environmental impact was partly irreversible .  
Mexico will continue encouraging the adoption of measures aimed at consolidating the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , including the universalization and full validity of the various international treaties on the matter , as well as the negotiation of new bilateral and multilateral agreements whose objective is the complete elimination of nuclear weapons , as a step towards the agreed goal of general and complete disarmament under effective international control .  
Sanctions should be restricted to the acquisition of arms , military equipment and dual-use materials as stipulated in relevant Security Council resolutions , especially the resolutions relating to the elimination of weapons of mass destruction , be they nuclear , chemical or biological , and of any other military potential that might endanger the sovereignty , safety , security and stability of neighbouring countries .  
The States members of MERCOSUR and the associated countries considered that the strictest safety requirements should be observed in the international maritime transport of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel , which posed great danger to the marine environment and the health of populations in affected areas .  
The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya considered that regional efforts should be focused on ensuring that scientific achievements in the nuclear field were used for peaceful purposes and hoped that a regular exchange between countries of information on the research undertaken would be set up .  
Pakistan believed that in years to come the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee should devote special attention to the following issues : matters relating to remote sensing , use of nuclear power sources in outer space , means of and mechanisms for strengthening inter-agency cooperation and increasing the use of space applications and services within and among entities of the United Nations system , implementation of an integrated , space-based global natural disaster management system and the physical nature and technical attributes of the geostationary orbit and of its utilization and applications .  
Mr . President , I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate Egypts total commitment to work earnestly and diligently towards the achievement of the objectives of general and complete disarmament , which require maintenance of the minimum defence requirements and the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction , especially nuclear weapons , in accordance with the priorities adopted by the international community at the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , in 1978 .  
Further , except for certain ultra hazardous activities which are mostly the subject of special regulation , e.g . , in the nuclear field or in the context of activities in outer space , the risk that flows from an activity is primarily a function of the particular application , the specific context and the manner of operation .  
We firmly believe that the Final Document of the General Assemblys special session devoted to disarmament in 1978 rightly stated that the main priority should be granted to nuclear disarmament and weapons of mass destruction , and , afterward , conventional weapons .  
Applying transparency in the Middle East region to seven categories of conventional weapons while ignoring more advanced , more sophisticated or more lethal armaments , such as weapons of mass destruction and , in particular , nuclear weapons , is an approach that is neither balanced nor comprehensive .  
We have seen how such major issues facing the international community as , among others , the nuclear weapons reduction process , CTBT and the negotiation of a BWC protocol have come up against unwarranted challenges : it is very likely that weapons and weapon systems will be introduced into outer space ; while last year the entire international community , including the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council , recognized the ABM Treaty as a cornerstone of global stability , this year we hear voices calling for the total abrogation of this treaty .  
In the context of active and ongoing negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty , the United States is prepared to agree to an overall work programme that calls for the establishment of an ad hoc committee on nuclear disarmament and another ad hoc committee that would conduct exploratory discussions on outer space issues .  
Following these positive changes of the last few years that have strengthened the need for a renewed strategic vision of peace and stability throughout the world , it is necessary that international security be separated from military factors and go beyond security concepts based on nuclear weapons .  
Therefore , besides the legal instruments prohibiting weapons of mass destruction , it is vitally important today for the international community to promote closer cooperation to upgrade the physical protection of nuclear material , combat illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and other radioactive sources and enhance the protection and control of nuclear facilities against acts of terrorism and sabotage .  
Welcomes the ongoing dialogue between the Russian Federation and the United States of America on a new strategic framework premised on openness , mutual confidence and real opportunities for cooperation , which is of paramount importance , especially in a changing security environment , and hopes that this dialogue will successfully lead to substantial reductions in offensive nuclear forces and contribute to the maintenance of international stability ;  
In the new millennium , other priorities include eliminating the so-called tactical nuclear weapons ; banning fissile materials for weapons purposes ; arresting the acquisition of advanced weapons of mass destruction ; maintaining the credibility of the non-proliferation regime ; and concluding an international convention against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons against the non-nuclear-weapon States .  
In their continuing endeavours to render the Treaty fully operable through the accession to its Protocol by the nuclear Powers , members States of the Association of South-East Asian Nations have been engaged in a series of intense consultations with the nuclear Powers in an earnest effort to seek a mutually satisfactory solution to the outstanding problems .  
Among such steps are the strengthening of International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) safeguards , revising the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material , improving national standards of security and physical protection of nuclear material , establishing stronger regulatory control over radioactive sources and enhancing international cooperation against illicit trafficking in nuclear material .  
In that Opinion , the Court stated that , given the unique characteristics of those weapons , in particular their destructive capacity , their capacity to cause untold human suffering , and their ability to cause damage to generations to come , the threat or use of nuclear weapons would be a potential catastrophe .  
We also draw the attention of the Committee to the initiative put forward to the President of the Russian Federation at the Millennium Summit with regard to ensuring energy supplies for the sustainable development of humankind , a radical solution to the problems posed by the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to the problem of global environmental improvement .  
In the light of the follow-up to the Millennium Declaration adopted last year by our leaders , we urge all Member States to undertake continued negotiations within the framework of the United Nations and its subsidiary bodies , leading to total nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control .  
Moreover , the international community must take action to bolster existing mechanisms and instruments and to set out a specific timetable for the successive stages of general disarmament and for the elimination of weapons of mass destruction nuclear , chemical and biological in particular .  
Israels possession of excessive quantities of weapons , its stupendous arsenal of highly destructive and unconventional weapons and its categorical refusal to place its nuclear installations under International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) safeguards constitute a flagrant challenge to the international community .  
The international community continues to witness an accelerated race to develop strategic nuclear reactors for military purposes and increase the range and power of ballistic missiles and rockets with nuclear , chemical and biological warheads despite the pledges of the heads of State and Government at the Millennium Summit last year for , among other things , the gradual multilateral reduction of arsenals of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction .  
The United Arab Emirates , which joined the NPT , the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) and the Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) , in order to reinforce its international position , believes that establishing zones free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction is the key to establishing balances in international and regional strategic relations .  
In this framework , we also call for the discontinuation of all financial , technological and scientific aid used in developing Israels dangerous nuclear installations , which threaten not only the peace efforts and attempts to find a solution to the Palestine question and the Middle East problem , but also the security , stability and real interests of the peoples in the area and their natural , economic and environmental resources .  
Still , the asymmetry of modern warfare , the existence of shadowy guerrillas with global reach , and the vulnerability of nuclear devices to theft or unauthorized use or simply to the chance that a madman might get his hands on them are today more than ever before eroding the logic and rationale behind the justifications for thousands of weapons designated for mutual assured destruction .  
We note with the deepest concern the close connections between international terrorism and the illegal movement of nuclear , chemical , biological and other deadly materials , as a paramount threat to international peace and security at the dawn of the new millennium .  
Accordingly , the political reality in our region mandates a practical step-by-step approach , culminating in a comprehensive peace and the eventual establishment of a mutually verifiable zone free of ballistic missiles and of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .  
The outcome of the 2000 Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) , in which the nuclear-weapon States agreed to an unequivocal undertaking to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals , proved that the NPT is the main and most effective legal basis for actions to prohibit and to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons . 
I should like once again to refer to the Final Document of the tenth special session of the General Assembly , the first special session devoted to disarmament , which called upon the international community to take steps against nuclear proliferation and to renounce weapons of mass destruction , including those held for deterrent purposes .  
Our close cooperation becomes urgent when it is realized that a small group of terrorists can actually possess weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , biological and chemical ones , and destroy large areas of the world and millions of innocent people with wilful abandon , senselessly and indiscriminately .  
To date , conventions have been developed covering the safety of power reactors , radioactive waste and spent fuel management , early notification and assistance in case of a nuclear accident or radiological emergency , and the physical protection of nuclear material .  
It is gratifying to note that the Commission on Sustainable Development has recognized the value of nuclear energy in the context of sustainable development and has agreed that the choice to use appropriate energy sources should be left to the countries concerned .  
As part of the rigid economic , financial and commercial blockade imposed on Cuba for more than 40 years , various actions have targeted our programme for the peaceful use of nuclear energy to prevent its advance .  
We believe that , apart from unilateral and bilateral steps in the area of nuclear disarmament , the time has come to start discussions on strategic issues within the framework of multilateral mechanisms , including among the five permanent members of the Security Council , who bear special responsibility for the fate of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) , the CTBT and other international agreements .  
The terrorist attacks in New York and Washington , D.C . , almost two months ago highlight the urgent need for an effective system of protection for fissile material and nuclear facilities , to combat illicit trafficking in such material and to strengthen the non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament regime through the immediate implementation of the 13 points agreed by consensus at the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons .  
The Government of the Czech Republic has already approved the amended text of the national report , which provides an update on the existing regulatory and legal framework as well as a case study of the Dukovany and Temeln nuclear power plants .  We look forward to the second Review Meeting of the Contracting Parties , scheduled for April 2002 , to demonstrate our full compliance with the requirements of the Convention .  
In conclusion , let me reassure the Assembly of my Governments continued commitment to supporting and expanding the Agencys role in international cooperation in the peaceful and safe use of nuclear energy and ionizing radiation for the benefit of all member States . I would like also to express the Czech Republics appreciation for the personal involvement of the Director General , Mr . Mohamed ElBaradei , in the promotion of the Agencys activities .  
If the Agency were unable effectively to track the location and use of nuclear material worldwide , or to give adequate support to national nuclear safety measures , the consequences to the global community could be grave .  
Bearing in mind paragraph 50 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , [ 3 ] the first special session devoted to disarmament , calling for the urgent negotiation of agreements for the cessation of the qualitative improvement and development of nuclear-weapon systems , and for a comprehensive and phased programme with agreed time frames , wherever feasible , for the progressive and balanced reduction of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery , leading to their ultimate and complete elimination at the earliest possible time ,  
Recalling the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the Legality of the Threat or use of Nuclear Weapons , issued on 8 July 1996 , [ 9 ] and welcoming the unanimous reaffirmation by all Judges of the Court that there exists an obligation for all States to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control ,  
How can we be expected to view as legitimate norms of conduct dictated by the Security Council , when some of its members are responsible for the fact that there are more than 30,000 nuclear weapons in the world , directly threatening the international peace and security that the Council is supposed to defend ?  
Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons , notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile materials and calls for arrangements by all the nuclear-weapon States to place , as soon as practicable , the fissile material designated by each of them as no longer required for military purposes under the International Atomic Energy Agency or other relevant international verification and arrangements for the disposition of such material for peaceful purposes in order to ensure that such material remains permanently outside military programmes ;  
Recognizing further the close connection between international terrorism and illicit arms-trafficking and the illegal movement of nuclear , chemical , biological and other potentially deadly materials ,  
Consideration needed to be given to issues such as space debris , the status of low near-Earth orbits as a limited natural resource , the use of nuclear energy sources in outer space , intellectual property protection in respect of space vehicles , use of space technology and legal aspects of global navigation systems .  
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and complexity and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
Together with the problem of anti-missile defence , the laying down in legal terms of the agreements reached on further radical , irreversible and verifiable reductions of strategic offensive weapons , in our opinion , down to the level of 1,500 to 2,200 nuclear warheads for each party is becoming particularly important under these circumstances .  
Significant investments have been made in the draft resolution , with hard compromises made on key issues such as integrated safeguards , the role of innovative nuclear technology and the safe transport of radioactive material .  
As previously recorded , there are no indications of Iraq having retained any physical capability for the indigenous production of weapon-usable nuclear material in amounts of any practical significance , nor any indication Iraq has acquired or produced weapon-usable nuclear material other than the nuclear material verified by IAEA and removed from Iraq in accordance with paragraph 13 of resolution 687 ( 1991 ) .  
Exerting greater and more positive efforts towards achieving integration between environmental and health strategies , especially in terms of providing safe drinking water and food , treating waste-water and solid waste , controlling or limiting the potential dangers of chemicals , various types of pollution and genetically modified substances ; and achieving nuclear safety in the Arab region ;  
Limitation of the individual radiation dose received from fission products emerging from a nuclear unit that has returned to Earth in some particular geographical region as a consequence of an accident to the level of the maximum permissible dose as established by the International Commission on Radiological Protection ;  
Combining , as appropriate , the increased use of renewable energy sources , more efficient use of energy , the use of advanced fossil fuel technologies and other [ Sustainable ] advanced technologies [ ] [ and nuclear technologies ] and the sustainable use of traditional energy resources , which could meet the growing needs of energy services [ in the longer term ] to achieve sustainable development ;  
Even with such capability , however , the power station has still put nuclear safety first and never lowered vigilance .  It has established a virtual protective screen more secure than steel reinforced concrete - - a nuclear safety culture deeply rooted in people 's hearts .  
The detachment also made use of the technological advantages of colleges , and launched several special firing experiments under the guidance of college experts , including antitank missile cross-water firing , pitch angle firing , and firing in nuclear and chemical warfare .  They obtained a huge amount of first-hand information , and accumulated precious experiences .  Based on their training results , they compiled the " training outlines , " which were promulgated and implemented by the whole army .  
Cao Gangchuan indicated : Such a large-span development in the scientific and technological undertaking for national defense and weaponry development has also brought along the progress of the entire country in the field of high technologies ; given a great impetus to the industrialization of such high-tech sectors as nuclear power , aviation , space flight , shipbuilding , machinery , and electronics ; and has made considerable contribution to promoting the economic construction and enhancing the comprehensive national strength of our country .  
Its main function is to undertake the treatment and disposal of nuclear energy , nuclear material , nuclear fuel , exhausted fuel , and radioactive waste , the prospecting and excavation of uranium deposits , the scientific research and development as well as the construction , production , and operation of nuclear energy and nuclear-related fields , such as nuclear instrument and equipment , isotope , nuclear technology application , and economic cooperation with foreign countries and import-export businesses .  
[ Li Dingfan ] Our country 's nuclear industry was established in 1955 .  In the past 40 years or so , the industry developed tremendously from scratch and succeeded in developing " two bombs and one boat , " thus enabling China to become one of the nuclear countries in the world , smashing the nuclear monopoly and blackmail by the imperialists and hegemonists , greatly boosting its comprehensive national strength , and making tremendous contributions in maintaining world peace .  
Our country has signed government-to-government agreements on peaceful utilization of nuclear energy with 16 countries , including Britain , France , Russia , and Japan , and established economic , technological , and trade relations with more than 40 countries and regions , thus playing a positive role in promoting international cooperation in peaceful utilization of nuclear energy .  
[ Li Dingfan ] For many years while making efforts to enter the international market for peaceful utilization of nuclear energy , China 's nuclear industry has fully developed and utilized nuclear energy resources to serve the construction of the national economy and the livelihood of the people ; constructed many nuclear power projects , such as the Qinshan and Daya Bay nuclear power stations ; developed newly rising high-tech industries in which nuclear fuel , civilian-use nuclear technology , and production of nonnuclear civilian goods support and complement one another ;  
[ Li Dingfan ] In the new century , the CNNC 's entire line of thinking on development is to further cut the new development path of " integrating military and civilian production , developing nuclear energy power generation , readjusting the structure , giving prominence to efficiency , strengthening management , and invigorating the nuclear industry with science and technology . "  
do a good job in diverting redundant workers to other jobs and increasing efficiency with reduced staff ; put it in a prominent place to improve efficiency ; and establish a new-type small and efficient nuclear technology industrial system based on the integration of military and civilian production .  
On the basis of its geopolitics and its domestic and foreign " realistic " situation , Russia has gradually formed its own unique " practical containment " nuclear strategy : to prevent the outbreak of a nuclear war and a large-scale conventional war by means of nuclear deterrence and to first use nuclear weapons in a regional war , local war or armed conflict to attain the goal of safeguarding national security and maintaining the status of a big country .  
In the military reform conducted in Russia in the past few years , the size of various arms and services has been cut by a big margin , but the strategic missile troops alone have been strengthened and they have absorbed the military aerospace troops and the missile space defense troops .  Russia 's strength for launching nuclear attacks and for reconnaissance , early warning and resistance have been strengthened .  
Relying on its super economic and technological strength while possessing a huge nuclear arsenal , an individual military power has vigorously developed the national missile defense system in an attempt to seek absolute security of its own .  
Such a practice is a covert unilateral nuclear arms expansion in essence , which not only is unfavorable to the safeguarding of the global strategic balance and stability , but will also shake the prerequisite and basis for international nuclear nonproliferation .  
According a leading member of the State Civil Air Defense Office , as modern warfare principally is expressed in local hi-tech wars , nuclear and chemical protection is predicated on the safe use of the civil air defense engineering projects .  
It has set up a number of specialized laboratories for nuclear and chemical protection research and experiments .  It has a high-level contingent of scientists and researchers .  Over the years , it has attained a number of scientific research achievements that are up to advanced world standards in the field of nuclear and chemical protection .  
China has always devoted its efforts to international cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy , advocating efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons .  But we should not ignore the legitimate right of all countries , particularly developing countries , to use nuclear energy peacefully , even less so applying a double standard , to exploit anti-proliferation as the means for restricting and obstructing cooperation by all countries in the peaceful use of nuclear energy .  
The move in fact represents unilateral nuclear arms build-up in disguised form .  The move will not only bring severe damage to the integrity and vitality of the ABM treaty and the global strategic balance and stability , but will also seriously disrupt the basis for the US-Russia bilateralnuclear reductions , impede the international nuclear disarmament process , thus shatter the prerequisite and basis for international nuclear non-proliferation .  
In 1972 , the heads of state of the United States and the Soviet Union had no alternative but held talks to sign the " Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty " , which explicitly restricted both sides in the establishment of an anti-ballistic missile defense system , thus ruling out the possibility that one side could launch a nuclear attack without being punished .  This was acclaimed by the international community .  
Even more serious , the " ABM Treaty " is built on the basis of the theory of relative security ; it brought about relative balance of US and Soviet nuclear offensive and defensive forces through " mutually assured destruction " and prevented either side from carrying out a preemptive nuclear strike , while the US NMD is aimed at achieving its unilateral absolute military superiority and absolute security .  
The 1987 " MRBM Treaty " , the 1991 US-Soviet treaty on reduction of tactical nuclear weapons , and START-1 and START-2 respectively of 1991 and 1993 were agreed between the United States and the Soviet Union ( Russia ) after the signing of the " ABM Treaty " , in the firm belief that their own nuclear retaliatory force retained sufficient deterrent capability .  
The lightning pace of the advance of modern technology is right now influencing the earth on which we live with its mysterious power .  It is creating an unprecedented productive force , but at the same time , it also brings a host of problems like energy crises , environmental pollution , filth from the Internet , and increased polarization on a global scale .  Humanity even has the " nuclear threat " , with which it can destroy itself many times over .  
With its huge nuclear arsenal and policy of insisting on a nuclear first strike , the United States put all its strength behind developing and deploying NMD . This is in the hope of weakening or even depriving other nations with nuclear capabilities of their anti-missile capabilities , and , extending the threat one step further , this will have a deep and far-reaching negative effect on the global strategic order .  
At the same time , China also can not sit back and watch her legitimate national security interests be damaged , but rather must take the necessary measures based on changes to the global and regional security situation To ensure the minimum level of nuclear counterstrike ability , because China absolutely will not be subject to a nuclear threat ever again .  
Since the convening of the third plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , those involved in civil air defense work have constantly emancipated the mind , deepened reforms , aggressively explored new ways in China 's peacetime civil air defense building , and helped bring about a strategic transformation in the guiding thought of civil air defense building , namely , a transformation from preparation for fighting " an early war , a major war , a nuclear war " to the track of modernization building centering on the economic construction in peacetime ; 
If the United States deploys NMD , this will mean that the currently fragile Russian-US strategic balance will be broken , that Russia 's nuclear deterrent force will " be rendered ineffective , " and that the previous Russian-US nuclear disarmament will turn to be a disguised move for doing away with Russia 's nuclear weapons .  
That Putin lost no time in putting forward his proposals before attending the informal meeting of APEC leaders on 15 November shows that Russia is ready to continue to greatly reduce and finally eliminate nuclear arms on the basis of maintaining strategic stability ; and using the forum of the unofficial meeting of APEC leaders to publicize Russia 's ideas was for the purpose of gaining further international support on this issue .  
On the contrary , the gap between weaponry based on new scientific principles and old-fashioned weaponry can not be readily bridged with tactics .  Examples are the gaps between hot weapons and cold weapons , between mechanized weapons and human power , between nuclear weapons and conventional weapons .  These days developed countries are researching and developing " new concept weapons " such as kinetic energy weapons , directional energy weapons , meteorological weapons , subsonic weapons , and artificial intelligence weapons , which may lead to a breakthrough in the nature of weaponry .  
In order to develop the capacity for protection against nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , an anti-chemical warfare corps school was set up 50 years ago to train anti-chemical warfare cadres for the armed forces .  This raised the curtain of the building of the anti-chemical warfare corps in New China . In the past 50 years , our armed forces have organized troops with a relatively high quality to deal with nuclear , chemical and biological weapons .  
At present , the equipment of our armed forces for reconnoitering nuclear and chemical weapons has the technical means to reconnoiter and monitor attacks by all kinds of nuclear and chemical weapons and to give alarm .  Such equipment also includes advanced equipment for reconnoitering nuclear and chemical weapons , which is based on modern analysis and testing technology , detecting and alarming technology , and digital telecommunications technology , and is represented by armored anti-chemical reconnaissance vehicles .  
Serial equipment and complete sets of equipment for reconnoitering nuclear and chemical weapons in field operation can dash about in toxic and contaminated areas under all circumstances .  This has provided a firm material basis for increasing the capacity of our armed forces for protection against nuclear , chemical and biological weapons .  
The promulgation of the " Regulations on the Operation of the Anti-chemical Warfare Corps " of the new generation marked an important breakthrough made by our armed forces in their research on the characteristics and objective laws of operation under the threats of nuclear and chemical weapons , and marked a change from emphasizing protection on the same plane in the combined operation of the ground force to three-dimension protection in the joint operation of different armed services .  
With the efforts made in the past years , a system for training a new type of anti-chemical-warfare capable personnel has been formed in our armed forces .  At present , major combat equipment , including tanks , airplanes and vessels can better resist nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , and both the armed forces and the civilian basically have complete sets of equipment for protection against such weapons .  
The equipment for the mass defense of military units is in the main complete with quality reaching a good standard .  The preventive capability by specialized anti-chemical warfare units and the overall preventive capability of the Army , the Navy , the Air Force and the Second Artillery Corps have all been significantly improved .  The military units ' fighting capability under the threat of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons has been significantly strengthened .  
Such equipment is based on modern analytic and laboratory test technology , detecting and warning technology , automatic control technology , and digital communication technology as well as represented by armored chemical agent-detecting vehicles and nuclear agent-detecting robots .  This kind of equipment for detecting nuclear and chemical agents in the battlefield - - with wheel-type chassis-mounted vehicles as the backbone and with series of chassis-mounted vehicles as supplements - - can operate in contaminated areas under all kinds of situations .  
At present , our military units have composite decontamination equipment , multifunctional and rapid decontamination equipment , and one-man decontamination equipment , thus forming a complete equipment system .  Such a system , which is comprehensive in function and in technical means , can do a good job in decontaminating the pollution caused by nuclear , chemical , and biological weapons .  Our military units can enter an area contaminated by nuclear and chemical pollution to carry out decontamination work .  
To establish the structural design of nuclear weapons devices , Guo Yonghuai proposed " proceeding along two parallel roads and choosing the superior one in the end " in order to determine the optimum plan for the first nuclear bomb detonation , which played a decisive role in deciding several critical questions .  
Look !  In the cyber warfare drill room of the training center of the brigade , a " nuclear warfare " broke out on the screen .  The " blue army " took advantage of its strong military force to give a sudden nuclear attack against the " red army , " thus bringing myriad changes to the battlefield .  
On 20 April 2000 , Japan 's House of Representatives approved " Amendment to the Law on Formation of Defense Agency " and decided to set up several new research posts in the Defense Agency , including those for research on nuclear weapons , biological weapons research , and other special weapons as well .  It also decided to set up a research forum for nonmilitary experts on medical science and military science .  
Second , the US military may plan to use Guam as an experimental site for US nuclear submarines in the new century .  For instance , a submarine 's deep-water communications and data image transmission and the suitability of undersea launching of missiles under new fighting conditions can all be tested at the base in Guam .  
It was reported that the circulation line of US nuclear attack submarine has the problem of metal embrittlement and so it has been criticized by the people .  If nuclear submarines are reinforced in Japan , local people are expected to show objections .  Therefore , Guam has become the best choice of the US military .  
At a meeting to deliberate the " Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty " held at the UN headquarters in New York on 24 April 2000 , on behalf of the international community , UN Secretary General Kofi Annan explicitly voiced his opposition to NMD and his strong misgivings about the enormous destruction the US arbitrary move might bring to the international arms control and nuclear disarmament .  
The " Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty " was extended for an indefinite period with the support of many developing countries in 1995 , and the " Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty " was adopted by the United Nations in 1996 .  This is because the international community confirmed that the world would ultimately move toward a " nuclear-free " prospect and believed that the major nuclear arms powers would , in the end , gradually achieve balanced arms disarmament on the basis of cooperation among major powers .  
The starting point of this assumption ( namely , guarding against the threat of missile attacks ) of the United States failed to convince Germany . A considerably large number of personages from the military and political circles believed that this is not reasonable .  Because during the Cold War period , the threat of the nuclear arsenal of the Soviet Union to West Europe was many , many times bigger than it is now , did not the East-West balanced posture based on nuclear deterrent ensure the security of Germany ?  
In just three weeks after President Bush entered the White House , he was anxious to increase military spending again .  The objective is to make the United States , which presently holds the largest store of nuclear weapons and the world 's most advanced and strongest standing military , always capable of maintaining its absolute military dominance , as well as further distance itself from all other major countries ' military capacity and consolidating the US position as the world 's " only superpower " .  
The operational concept of " full dimensional protection " which was proposed by the US military in 1996 calls for the establishment of both offensive and defensive measures to deal with information warfare , guided missiles , and nuclear , biological , and chemical weapons of mass destruction .  
Deputy Chief of General Staff Wu Quanxu , who instructed the drill , claimed that to protect the people 's personal and property safety and to minimize the loss from the possible nuclear accidents , the PLA has established and perfected the rescue and commanding system , whereby the servicemen are combined with the people , the peacetime need is combined with the wartime need , and the three armed services are integrated , and has already possessed the capabilities of providing rapid rescue to all sorts of nuclear accidents .  
This reporter noticed from the scene of the drill that it took only a dozen of minutes during the whole process from the nuclear accident rescue and commanding center , that was organized by the army , the navy , and the air force , received the report of " nuclear accident " to the switching on of the emergency and rescue commanding automatic system and the transmission of rescue order to the three armed forces .  
Wu Quanxu , deputy chief of the General Staff Department , who had come to direct the training exercise , told us reporters : In order to protect people 's life and property and reduce to a minimum possible losses during a nuclear accident , the PLA has established and refined a rescue command system marked by integration of military forces with civil forces , peacetime needs with wartime needs , and forces of three services and have cultivated capabilities of launching an emergency rescue operation in all types of nuclear power accidents .  
These officials believe that the new US administration has two " nails in the eye and thorns in the flesh " : The first is what Americans say is Iraq 's concealed underground biological and chemical weapons stores , and the second is the nuclear command centers which , they say , Russia is hurrying to build , hidden deep in the mountains .  
If the target firing tests of the unmanned Stealth fighter are successful , and the program for development of the new type of nuclear weapons is approved , this will mean that the Bush Administration will pour more and more funds into developing futuristic military technology in the hope of maintaining the US hegemonist status in the world through pursuing absolute superiority in military technology ; and still more , it will mean that the United States will make the world still less peaceful and secure , and this is bound to trigger a large-scale arms race worldwide .  
Robert Wilson , a thermonuclear weapons expert at Princeton University , warned that the US military has simply got dizzy , as there can not be any such thing as a nuclear weapon that can destroy enemy underground bunkers without threatening the local inhabitants .  
Academician Pan said : With regard to the chronic effect of radiation , on the basis of analyzing and studying large amounts of the existing data , the UN Scientific Committee on the Radiation Effect of Atomic Energy has drawn a conclusion : apart from an increase in thyroid gland cancer observed among children exposed to radiation , no major members of the public have been found to be physically affected in relation to ionizing radiation 14 years after the Chernobyl nuclear accident .  
During the visit , Shi Yunsheng also respectively met with Kelche , chief of staff the French armed forces ; Le Chiavez , the French defense minister 's foreign affairs adviser ; and others .  He visited the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle , a La Fayette-class frigate equipped with guided missiles , and a strategic missile nuclear submarine - - which are the French Navy 's latest vessels , and France 's naval college .  
The exhibition reflected Tsinghua 's major scientific and technological innovations as well as the achievements attained in the tackling of major technological hurdles , basic research , and technological research for national defense .  The fields involved information , nuclear energy and technology , life science and technology , new materials , energy and environment , and advanced manufacturing .  
In recent years , India has formulated a military strategy of " guarding against China northward , fighting against Pakistan westward , dominating the Indian Ocean southward , and expanding its sphere of influence eastward " in addition to its efforts to build nuclear deterrent power .  Expanding its sphere of influence eastward means extending its sphere of influence to the South China Sea and a part of the Pacific region .  
The article notes that while the United States indeed faces certain new threats in the " new strategic environment " that has appeared after the Cold War , the main threat the United States faces today is not intercontinental ballistic missiles , but terrorism , such as the ignition of chemical , biological , or nuclear weapons that terrorists have smuggled into US ports . 
A series of erroneous policies , such as the sudden announcements on the termination , and then the resumption of the construction of the fourth nuclear plant and the use of large sums from the " national stabilization fund " to support the stock market in order to fulfill political promises , have wasted energy , resulting in the loss of hope for Taiwan in the next decade .  
the development of enterprises in the war industry will promote the development of the US economy ; the building of the super shield will guarantee the United States ' absolute security and offset the nuclear deterring capacity of other nuclear states and shake off the binding of the anti-missile treaty , thus leading to the establishment of a new world security system with the United States at the center .  All these factors were included in the strategic consideration of the United States .  
The Gulf War and Kosovo War have demonstrated the trend of information war .  The United States has realized that , under the situation of a new military revolution , the pattern of future war will have a qualitative difference from a mechanized war with nuclear weapons .  US military strategy must be adjusted to suit the changing patterns of war .  
Under the situation of weakness of comprehensive national strength and being inferior to NATO in conventional forces , nuclear weapons will remain an effective deterrent power of Russia in the future period and the " tower of strength " to support Russia 's desire to be a major military power .  
In its annual report released on 31 May the Defense Ministry of India once again spread the sheer fallacy of the so-called " theory of China threat " , alleging that there is an exceptionally great imbalance in nuclear power between China and India with China enjoying a huge superiority , that " all major cities in India are within the range of China 's guided missiles " and , fabricating rumors out of thin air , that China is assisting Pakistan in developing the latter 's missile and nuclear capability .  
Since the nuclear tests , India has stepped up the process to become nuclear armed in disregard of international community 's opposition .  Successively , it has established the " minimum nuclear deterrence " strategy , called for the establishment of a " three in one " nuclear strike system , frequently carried out various kinds of guided missile tests , and stepped up importing and developing advanced fighter planes .  
Quite a few serving generals , and retired generals who have just left active service , maintained : Taiwan has to develop such weapons as medium-range missiles for the sake of strategic deterrent , even if such missiles are armed with no nuclear warheads .  They stated : The more the mainland economy develops , the more deterrent Taiwan 's medium-range missiles will have .  
Ground-to-air missiles , aviation missiles , ship-to-ship missiles , anti-tank missiles , conventional missiles , offensive tactical missiles , strategic nuclear missiles , and continental strategic missiles moved through Tiananmen Square , and almost all the new missile types from China 's guided missile family made their appearances .  
Many large-scale military exercises have shown the newest achievements that China 's military has obtained from the traditional " three attacks and three defenses " - - attacking tanks , planes , and airborne troops , and defending against nuclear , chemical , and biological attacks - - to the " new three attacks and three defenses " of attacking stealth aircraft , cruise missiles , and helicopter gun ships , and defending against precision strikes , electronic jamming , and reconnaissance and surveillance .  
While facing the overbearing offensive launched by the United States , to preserve its own national strategic and security interests , on the one hand , Russia insisted that the ABM Treaty could not be revised or abolished and indicated that if the United States deploys the national missile defense system , Russian will take corresponding countermeasures , including increasing the quantity of nuclear warheads , and even threatened to scrap other concluded treaties on reducing nuclear weapons ;  
So far India has not decided to shrink back from its nuclear weapons development program ; on the contrary it is stepping up the development of various missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads , including ICBM 's with a range exceeding 20,000 km , and three months ago it carried out a major nuclear war exercise close to the India-Pakistan border ; why then has the United States decided to lift the sanctions at this time ?  
Then , under Helen 's command , the US special mixed fleet turned and fled toward the open waters .  In 1996 , when the PLA conducted a military exercise including test-firing its guided missiles , the United States also sent aircraft carriers to the Taiwan Strait . After the PLA 's nuclear submarines departed from their military port and disappeared in the vast seas , the US aircraft carriers immediately left the region .  
He said : By adopting a foreign policy of going our own way , the Bush Administration will disrupt international security , hurt our economic and environmental protection interests , and stop a historical chance for us to agree with China and Russia on limiting weapons and reducing nuclear weapons .  " These examples demonstrate that a country 's unilateral actions can not possibly form a lasting strategic framework that has the submission of all other countries . "  
The scientist Lee Wen-ho , born in Taiwan , has made special trips to China and held discussions and exchanges with Chinese nuclear scientists , moreover he still has " convenient conditions for contacts , and for dropping and transferring top secret reports , and it is completely possible that he has revealed to China material on America 's most sophisticated nuclear weapons technology . "  
But nuclear deterrence can never reach the fringe territories and the hot zones where the major powers ' interests overlap , and as far as the medium-sized and small countries are concerned , war is still an effective political means , and because their instruments of war are relatively simple , wars that erupt in those regions are still going to be traditional wars , and the modes of combat are still going to be the traditional forms of anti-personnel firepower .  
Thus , although a formation of U.S . aircraft carriers had shown up more than 100 nautical miles east of Taiwan to make its military presence known during our army 's military exercises in 1996 , it had not actually sailed into the Taiwan Straits . Moreover , as soon as the U.S . forces learned that a number of Chinese nuclear submarines had lifted anchor and left the port , the aircraft carrier battle group immediately moved back 100 nautical miles .

In order to achieve its strategic intention of building a " US unipolar world , " the United States aims to possess the world 's most advanced conventional and nuclear weapons and to maintain the world 's most powerful conventional and nuclear arsenal and to comprehensively raise its technical superiority , in a bid to ensure its " overwhelmingly superior dominant status in every kind of conflict " and " successfully fight two major theater wars that occur almost simultaneously . "  
In spite of the extremely low probability of a release of nuclear radioactive substance from nuclear power stations and nuclear facilities , various countries are taking strict preventive and nuclear emergency measures to prevent the damage to and adverse effect on the environment and public if a serious nuclear accident should happen by any chance .  
As regards the fourth nuclear plant , whose construction has begun , involving some NT36.4 billion of construction funds ( with more than 30 percent of the project completed ) to date , Taiwan 's new leader stated : The issue of scrapping or building the fourth nuclear plant is still at an appraisal stage .  It is by no means a simple question of right or wrong .  We have to take into account issues like how much we would lose if the " fourth nuclear plant " were not built ;  
The remarks of Xin Qi , a Chinese expert on the Taiwan issue , made at a discussion held recently by the Society for the Chinese in western America were reported by a newspaper under an eye-catching title of " Surely attack if independence , and surely win if attacking - - no fear of launching a nuclear war to fight a decisive battle . "  The newspaper also claimed that by voicing the " appalling words , " he will " definitely reinforce his image of commonly deemed the spokesman for the People 's Liberation Army . "  
They said they started the war to keep stable the Yugoslav Federation 's situation and to halt military conflicts and disputes , namely , with good intentions , but what followed was : The people were plunged into misery and suffering , the national economy fell back 20 years , and the natural environment and people 's lives were threatened by prolonged pollution from nuclear radiation and chemical and poisonous gases We can not help asking : Can a war solve any problem ? 
The two sides are committed to a world free from nuclear , biological or chemical weapons .  They stressed that the international regime for eliminating and prohibiting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction should be permanently and indiscriminately applicable to all regions and countries with no exception .  
And at the same time both sides took note of the legitimate rights of any country for peaceful uses of nuclear energy , chemical and biological technology in a transparent manner under the supervision of the relevant international organizations .  
He believes : If the plan for star wars is approved , the consequences of global arms race will be very serious : It will undermine existing international agreements on arms and on destruction of nuclear weapons , including international treaties banning nuclear tests , treaties on reducing strategic weapons , and agreements on controlling and stopping nuclear weapons .  
The United States has already possessed the world 's most advanced nuclear and conventional weapons and now it is making great efforts to develop NMD . This goes against the trend of the times and is also unfavorable to international arms control and efforts in disarmament .  It will have a serious and negative impact on maintaining a global and regional strategic balance and stability in the 21st century .  
With regard to the attempt of the United States to deploy its advanced TMD [ theatre missile defense ] in northeast Asia in the course of developing its NMD , Sha Zukang pointed out that this has constituted a direct threat to the effectiveness of China 's existing limited nuclear force .  
At today 's news conference held by the Foreign Ministry , Sun Yuxi , while answering a reporter 's question regarding the failure of the US missile interception test , said : The US development of the NMD system will break the global strategic equilibrium and stability , hinder the nuclear disarmament process , spoil the efforts of the international community on non-proliferation , and may trigger off another round of the arms race .  This is against the interests of all nations across the world , including the United States itself .  
He will have an official meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin tomorrow morning .  After the meeting , the two sides are expected to sign a joint declaration on promoting the development of bilateral relations , accelerating the process of multipolarization , and opposing the theater missile defense [ TMD ] system .  The two sides will also sign a series of documents on cooperation in the spheres of nuclear energy , economy and trade , crude oil and gas , communications , banking , education , and culture .  
Thanks to this " three attacks and three defenses " training , all military units generally acquired the skills of attacking tanks , aircraft , and paratroopers and the skills of defending against nuclear attack , chemical warfare , and biological weapons .  At the same time , People 's Liberation Army [ PLA ] training has developed by leaps and bounds as a result .  
To further intensify scientific and technological cooperation , the Chinese Government and the Japanese Government have decided to cooperatively develop a new round of 89 scientific and technological projects in the biological , nuclear energy , agricultural , medical , resources , and environmental protection fields .  
In the several years when Wen Ho Lee was investigated and prosecuted and in the days when the Cox Report was out , some quite reputable media in the United States tore off the " fair , objective , and factual " mask and , totally disregarding the most basic journalistic ethics , showered false accusations on China about the stealing of US nuclear secrets , and fanned up enmity against China among unknowledgeable American people .  
It is closed that there is great potential for cooperation of mutual benefit between China and Russia . For example , cooperation in the fields of petroleum , natural gas , nuclear energy , machine building , civil aviation , telecommunications and aviation [ sic ] will be discussed by the Chinese and Russian prime ministers during their regular meeting in Beijing this October .  
The 44th session of the IAEA General Conference , which started on 18 September , will review the IAEA 's 1999 annual report , as well as reports on stepping up international cooperation in nuclear safety , radiation safety , and radioactive waste safety , on intensifying the IAEA 's technological cooperation , and on preventing illicit trafficking in nuclear materials . 
This reporter has learned from the China National Nuclear Corporation that on 26 September , China and Pakistan held a ceremony in Islamabad , capital of Pakistan , to sign a temporary acceptance certificate for Pakistan 's Chashma Nuclear Power Plant , the first nuclear power plant designed , built , and exported by China .  
In a special article , China Times described the coming together and eventual parting of ways between Chen and Tang as " the nuclear explosion of the Chen-Tang system " with devastating results to all sides , saying that it not only put a full-stop to " government of the whole people " but cast unpredictable variables to the already disturbing political situation .  
In recent years , the China Research Institute of Atomic Energy Science has been geared toward facilitating perspective and basic researches .  It has been designated as a comprehensive research base for nuclear science and technology .  Its four key missions of scientific studies are to maintain China 's status as a nuclear power , to facilitate a sustained development of nuclear energy , to conduct studies of basic nuclear science , and to industrialize nuclear technology .  
The nuclear convention signed between the DPRK and the United States in Geneva in October 1994 has stipulated clearly that the two countries would realize complete normalization in political and economic relations , and the two countries would establish liaison offices in each other 's capital until a diplomatic relationship at ambassadorial level is built .  
After Taiwan 's " Executive Yuan " announced the halt of the construction of the fourth nuclear plant , it set off an intense backlash from the opposition parties .  [ In remarks ] targeted at the problem of the halt of the construction of the fourth nuclear plant , James Soong indicated today that an absolute majority of public opinion supports construction of the " fourth nuclear plant " .  
However , because some mass organizations threatened to surround the Legislative Yuan to express their anti-nuclear opinions and dismiss legislators who advocate the construction of nuclear power plant and because some legislators received threats , those legislators who support the nuclear power plant have to ask for personal protection .  The Legislative Yuan is permeated with an atmosphere of howling winds before a storm .  The Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan has maintained a high degree of caution to prevent accidents .  
It was learned that regarding the new government 's immediate announcement on the cessation of the building of the fourth nuclear power plant only half an hour after the " meeting between Chen Shui-bian and Lien Chan " last Friday , Lien Chan indeed was unhappy and had some doubts .  Lien Chan held that " it is imperative to maintain some social morality and justice . "  
Hoping to Possess Sophisticated Secret WeaponsAccording to the informed source , the meeting emphasized that in view of the ever-changing international situation and the havoc wrought by hegemonism and power politics in the new period , our army must possess high-tech deterrence conventional weapons , high-tech deterrence nuclear weapons and two or three types of high-tech deterrence sophisticated secret weapons to guarantee national security and territorial integrity and ensure that China 's sovereignty will not be violated . 
Since the reform and opening up began , they have , in chronological order , undertaken the construction of Daya Bay , Qinshan , Lingao , and other nuclear power generation projects and accomplished , with flying colors , a batch of ordnance-related scientific research projects , including the electron-positron collider , controlled nuclear fusion device , low-temperature heat reactor , high-temperature gas-cooled reactor , submarine base , and space simulation capsule .  
The Statistics Department pointed out that , during the period from 1994 to 1998 , our country purchased $ 13.3 billion , or 11.9 percent , of regular weapons ( excluding controlled nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , and biochemical weapons ) sold around the world , making our country the world 's largest weapon importing country .  The major countries where Taiwan purchased its weapons from were : The United States , $ 8.1 billion ; and France , $ 5.15 billion .  
The US military 's expansion of its nuclear submarine base in Guam has a relatively particular purpose .  It wants to use Guam as an experimental site for US nuclear submarines in the new century .  For instance , a submarine 's deep-water communications and data image transmission and the suitability of undersea launching of missiles under new fighting conditions can all be tested at the base in Guam .  
By 2005 , two new-generation submarines and a new nuclear submarine will be commissioned and 15 submarines will complete their reequipment and renovation ; destroyers and frigates will have their electronics , radar and missile equipment renewed ; and 10 new-type naval vessels will be launched and some of them will be armed with deterrent weapons .  
Russia has three major weapons : strategic nuclear missiles , anti-satellite weaponry , and directional anti-missile high-energy laser and particle beam weaponry .  But Russia today does not have the money to continue to develop them .  Taking advantage of the other 's problem , the United States is setting a trap for Russia by using its NMD program to egg Russia on to develop high-expense anti-missile system , thereby causing Russia 's national economy to be bled white by huge outlay of military expenses .  
The licensing control on strategic commodities aims at ensuring Hong Kong 's continued access to high - technology goods and up-to-date technology which are essential for maintaining Hong Kong 's status as a regional centre of finance , trade , banking and telecommunication , and preventing Hong Kong from being used as a conduit for the proliferation of strategically - sensitive goods , arms , munitions or chemical / biological / nuclear weapons .  
Furthermore , hydraulic power has been exploited to the maximum in Taiwan already . Though there is great potential in the development of nuclear power , the sources of raw material are mainly overseas , and the radioactive residue is difficult to dispose of .  
Though progress has been made in heavy industry , and nuclear weapons have been produced , India 's grassroots social construction work lags far behind . Most of the people are poverty-stricken , and disparity in the distribution of wealth between rich and poor is tremendous . When floods and droughts occur , many die of hunger . " What uses are such highly educated people to their country if they live in exile ? "  
To date , except for the fourth nuclear power plant , on which work has temporarily been stopped , for the Tai-chung coal-fired power plant , the number two northern highway , and the Taipei metropolitan rapid transit system , for which preparatory work is being undertaken , and for the Ssuchunghsi reservoir and the Mingtan electric power peaking facility , the plans for which are now being examined , the other 24 projects are all under way and from 20 to 70 percent completed , so that in general things can be considered to be running smoothly .  
However , in the face of this rapidly growing cohort , all countries have exhibited chaos . Some elderly are rejected from the nuclear family or are thought of as an unproductive burden on the national economy . Even more disconcerting is that health care for the elderly can lead not only to family frictions , but can overwhelm national health care systems . Aging is an unavoidable process for us .  
Liu Yu-shan , secretory-general of the Council for Economic Planning and Development , notes that right now the projects in which the Europeans , Americans , and Japanese are most interested are the high-tech ones . The main ones can be categorized as transportation ( the mass rapid transit system and the high-speed railroad ) , energy ( the fourth nuclear power and electrical generators ) , environmental protection ( incinerators ) , and the modernization of the postal and telecommunications networks .  
The places to which they have scattered are unusual , as well . Some live high up at the Sun Yat-sen Hall atop Yangming Mountain , and some live down low near Keelung Harbor . Some can be found in tightly guarded army ammunition factories , and in nuclear power plants . Several generations of students and teachers meet to have fun together , and everybody feels as close as one big family .  
For example , Taipower has always claimed that the costs of nuclear power are low . But as yet there is no way to finally dispose of nuclear waste , and it will impose enormous costs on the next generation . The maximum for compensation in the event of an accident at a nuclear power plant has been set at NT $ 1.4 billion , and the law says that anything over that amount will be paid by the government , thus artificially lowering the calculated costs of nuclear power immensely .  
For over a year , there have been frequent reports of Taiwan 's taxi drivers being involved in street protests and disputes . They have featured in campaigns ranging from opposition to the system of affiliation to cab companies and the introduction of compulsory third-Party motor insurance , to protests against the planned fourth nuclear power plant .  
Two years ago , preparations were being made for Taiwan 's fourth nuclear power plant , to be built in Kungliao Rural Township . When they began digging , they uncovered objects suspected of being ancient relics of the Ketagalan . Pan Huo-yen blocked the excavating machines with his own body , and the photograph of this act became a symbol of the conflict between culture and economic development .  
But from the point of view of international goodwill and the natural reaction most people have toward anything nuclear , it might have been best to give more attention to the issues raised by concerned observers . For example , Michael Kau , a scholar at Brown University in the US , and Fang Chien , a well-known environmental activist , pointed out that no one wants nuclear waste in their back yard , and disregarding the sentiments of a neighbor does not conform to Chinese ethics .  
A military gap ? Professor Chung has considerable confidence in the current naval forces of the ROC . He says that , leaving aside nuclear weapons , Taiwan 's maritime defense level , including ships , weapons systems , and personnel quality , is ahead of the PRC by 10 to 15 years .  
Following local opposition to the fourth nuclear power station , the sixth naphtha cracker and other major projects , Bayer of Germany has , almost on the eve of the start of construction work , called a halt to its plan to build a chemical plant in the Taichung Harbor zone . This followed the newly elected county magistrate 's insistence that a referendum would be called to decide whether the plan should be allowed to go ahead . Although the central government is attempting to mediate , the future of the Bayer plan is now uncertain .  
In an industrial society , as extended families living under one roof have given way to smaller and smaller nuclear families , the family can no longer serve the same functions it once did in supporting the needs of all segments of the population . Yet traditional Eastern attitudes , morality and values rooted in thousands of years of history are not easy to change , and they have a big effect on how policy toward the elderly is set .  
But a name can not be changed on a whim-the content of courses and research programs has to be planned beforehand . Chou is also aware how quickly times are changing : even the situation five years from now can not be predicted , and someone who is only familiar with one branch of knowledge can not respond to change . The orientation of systems science is for students to learn how to " integrate " knowledge of different fields such as materials science , thermal flux and nuclear engineering .  
The PRC has an enormous undersea force and has been developing nuclear subs . Meanwhile , Taiwan has only four subs , two of which are re-fitted submarines used by the US in World War II ( they are outdated and useful only for training ) . The current ROC submarine force can not effectively undertake counter blockade missions . Therefore , the purchase of new submarines is urgent .  
These are some of the main arguments that constitute Lin 's 1988 book China 's Nuclear Weapons Strategy , which is now available for the first time in a Taiwan translation in Lin 's recently published The Nuclear Hegemon . Although China 's Nuclear Weapons Strategy was published back in 1988 , it is still very enlightening for readers today to find out how Communist China 's nuclear weapons strategy is very much tied to Chinese strategic tradition . Anyone studying Communist China 's military can not ignore the influence of traditional strategic culture .  
In sum , by reading Lin 's new book , The Nuclear Hegemon , the reader can enjoy , first , a systematic look back at Communist China 's long road to becoming a nuclear power and its subtle use of traditional Chinese strategic thinking , as seen through the eyes of a Chinese . The reader can also come to understand the true capabilities of the PLA through the essays on PLA military modernization .  
The public is very wary of the nuclear plant , however , and environmental groups have been engaged in a raging debate with plant supporters over industrial policy and nuclear safety . There have been numerous street demonstration against the plant , and many members of the Democratic Progressive Party , including former DPP chairman Lin Yi-hsiung , are among the plant 's leading detractors . Opposition to the plant is one of the DPP 's key policy positions .  
Since Chen Shui-bian assumed the presidency , however , the new administration has been concerned that a sudden termination of the nuclear plant might hamper economic development and strike a heavy blow to the business community . The administration accordingly instructed the Ministry of Economic Affairs ( MOEA ) to set up the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant Re-Evaluation Committee to weigh the relative merits of building versus scrapping the plant .  
The 15-member committee finished its three-month review on September 15 without coming to a conclusive decision , with individual committee members in sharp disagreement over the per-kilowatt cost of nuclear power , the cost of canceling construction , and the cost to society of having a nuclear plant in operation . Many have criticized the Re-Evaluation Committee as " a complete waste of money , time , and energy . "  
But in the months that followed the members of this team seemed to be marching to different drummers . They often contradicted each other , and their efforts seemed generally uncoordinated . A chorus of criticism rose up over the government 's handling of the Pachang Creek rescue incident , and criticism grew even more intense when the government moved to halt the construction of Taiwan 's fourth nuclear power plant .  
Plans for the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant have triggered an intense struggle between opponents of nuclear power and those more concerned about industrial development . A constitutional ruling by the Council of Grand Justices appears to have moved the debate back to square one , with the ruling and opposition parties slugging it out once again .

After work on the plant resumes , there will be neither an immediate nuclear risk nor an immediate benefit of power generation . But environmentalists are convinced that the marine habitat of Yenliao , lying within a marine resource conservation area immensely rich in both the number of species and their populations , will be devastated , and that the three-kilometer golden beach of fine quartz sand which runs from Yenliao to Fulung , one of the priceless ecological and tourist resources of the northeast coast , may be lost along with it .  
The Council for Economic and Development ( CEPD ) , which is supposed to take overall charge of economic development policy , failed to play its proper coordinating role . The Ministry of Economic Affairs was consumed by the struggle over nuclear power , and failed to pay enough attention to the need to adjust Taiwan 's industrial structure . The Ministry of Finance was busy trying to support share prices on Taiwan 's stock market , but in doing so resorted to measures that violated market principles .  
Although nuclear power does not produce greenhouse gases , the controversies that rage over the safety of nuclear plants and the disposal of nuclear waste are prohibitive ; nor does the COP encourage countries to develop nuclear energy . Thus , " renewable energy " sources such as wind and solar power , despite the high costs of researching and developing these alternatives , are inevitable . Next year Taiwan Power Company will finally take the plunge and invest a large amount of money in a wind power program .  
In the past Taiwan placed excessive importance on fossil fuels and nuclear energy , and created a monopoly of electrical power supply , thereby excluding opportunities for development of renewable sources of energy . Thus the President emphasized , " In the future we should , acting through liberalization of the power market and various subsidy measures , increase incentives for diversification of sources of energy . "  
( Laura Li / tr . by Anthony W . Sariti ) The recent referendum held in Pinglin Township favoring the opening of a Pinglin exit on the Taipei-Ilan Freeway led to the resignation of Environmental Protection Administrator Hao Lung-bin and focused public opinion on the issue of advisory referendums . The possibility that during the March presidential election next year referendums will be simultaneously held on entry into the World Health Organization , the fourth nuclear power station , and the reform of the National Assembly is also drawing close attention from observers .  
Before the 1960s , one third of Taiwan families were classified as " patriarchal families . " These were " extended families " consisting of both direct and co-lateral family members living together . After the 1980s the proportion of " blended families " ( a " stem " family composed of three directly related generations ) increased . Today it is the " nuclear family " of husband , wife and children that has become the norm .  
The search for alternative sources of energy has become an important issue worldwide . In Taiwan , the debate four years ago over whether to continue building a fourth nuclear power plant produced a popular consensus that the island should be made a nuclear-free zone . Thus we urgently need to find clean , safe , sustainable energy sources .  
Pakistan , saying it would conduct successive missile tests from 25th to 28th , paid no attention to UN 's call for constraint , having launched 2 missiles , which can be equipped with nuclear warheads .  One of the missiles was Hatf-v ( Ghauri ) missile that can hit targets deep inside India and the other was newly developed short ranged Ghaznavi missile .  
( AFP , Washington ) Citing the confidential assessment report from the Pentagon , a US defense official pointed out that if a nuclear war broke out between India and Pakistan , the worst scenario would be the loss of lives ranging from 9 million to 12-million .  That figure could merely be the instant death toll resulting from the nuclear war , not including the deaths from diseases , starvation and polluted water supplies that accompanied the war .  
At a time when the north and the south have signed a joint declaration of mutual non aggression and when the nuclear framework agreement between the DPRK and the U S has entered the stage of implementation , conditions are now ripe for Washington and Pyongyang to strike a new peace deal , which is also imperative , the paper said  
Iran fully adheres to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) on nuclear weapons , and all its atomic programs are based on " peaceful use of nuclear energy for medical , agricultural and energy generation purposes " and " within the framework of the internationally recognized absolute rights of any country "  
ukrainian foreign minister anatoly alenko in his written speech at the meeting said ukraine posed no nuclear threat to europe for the buttons of the nuclear weapons were controlled by russia ukraine was only waiting for a " safe environment "  
Sergeyev told a press that NATO 's new concept has made it imperative for Russia to review some of the principles of the national military theory designed to defend Russia 's security , saying that the revision of the military theory will involve the entire armed forces , including the nuclear deterrent  
It may refer to the total of the future doses committed by that source or unit of practice , as for instance , the collective effective dose committed by atmospheric nuclear explosions or by one year of medical exposures .  
Notwithstanding the positive initiative taken by the major nuclear Powers since the end of the cold war , there is still a need to establish a close link between disarmament and international peace in the years ahead .  
The primary threat to humankind is now posed not by the possibility of the eruption of a nuclear conflict between the major Powers , but by regional crises of a national , ethnic or religious nature .  
However , even more worrying is the potential proliferation of nuclear , chemical , biological and ballistic missiles - the danger of their falling into the wrong hands .  
As agreed , separate expert groups in the chemical , biological , ballistic missile and nuclear areas met to pursue the objectives outlined above .  
Because of the physical nature of such material , the uncontrolled movement of nuclear material , in conjunction with the interests of organized crime , creates favourable conditions for the production of the socalled personal weapons of mass destruction .  
The principle has been referred to and applied at the national level in relation to human activities with potentially severe effects on human health ( engineering , the pharmaceutical and chemical industries , nuclear power plants , etc . ) .  
The key to resolving the nuclear issue is a fair and stepbystep solution befitting the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea 's unique status based on its temporary suspension of the effectuation of its announced withdrawal from NPT .  
Determined to promote regional cooperation for the development and practical application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in the interest of sustainable social and economic development of the African continent ,  
Calls upon all States to take urgent , effective measures to terminate all collaboration with the racist regime of South Africa , in particular in the military and nuclear fields , and to refrain from entering into other relations which run counter to the maintenance of existing sanctions against the regime in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and of the Organization of African Unity ;  
Noting with grave concern the extensive links and collaboration between the apartheid regime of South Africa and certain countries in the political , diplomatic , economic , nuclear , military and other fields , and the growing military and nuclear cooperation between racist Pretoria and Israel ,  
Condemns the extensive links and collaboration between the apartheid regime of South Africa and certain countries in the political , diplomatic , economic , nuclear , military and other fields , and the growing military and nuclear cooperation between the racist regime and Israel ;  
At its organizational session , the Commission also decided that the items entitled " Process of nuclear disarmament in the framework of international peace and security , with the objective of the elimination of nuclear weapons " and " Review of the Declaration of the 1990s as the Third Disarmament Decade " would be concluded at its 1995 substantive session .  
In certain key areas , there is an evident and growing trend in the trafficking and use of chemical and fissionable materials in conflicts , as well as the hidden or overt desire of some countries to possess nuclear weapons .  
High expectations violently oscillated with the doldrums of despair ; the exuberant relief of peoples ridding themselves of totalitarian rule alternated with the miserable anguish of occupation and ethnic cleansing ; rays of hope were paralleled by violent explosions of civil strife ; nuclear non-proliferation was countered by a devastating spread in the traffic in conventional weaponry ; peace for some was matched by wanton slaughter for others .  
Hungary had supported from the very beginning the idea of indefinite extension , for we are convinced that this major international instrument promotes stability by preventing the spread of the nuclear arsenal and at the same time aims at the orderly development of nuclear cooperation for peaceful purposes .  
We also stress the need to complete without delay comprehensive and verifiable treaties to ban nuclear-weapon tests and to cut off the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices .  
We are confident that a Middle East zone free of nuclear and weapons of mass destruction would enhance the peace process and lead to a situation wherein enormous financial resources would be saved and channelled towards the economic prosperity and social development of the peoples of the region .  
However , the nuclear testing undertaken right afterwards caused disillusion in international public opinion and has made it imperative for all nations first and foremost the nuclear-weapon States to redouble their efforts in a fully responsible manner , so as to complete the comprehensive test-ban treaty in the course of the next year .  
It had a crash programme to build a nuclear weapon in 1990-1991 ; it had weaponized live biological agents , including the deadly botulin and anthrax organisms , weapons never before used in warfare ; it produced a far greater quantity of chemical weapons , in more diverse forms , than it had previously admitted ; and it deliberately kept these documents hidden from the United Nations Special Commission ( UNSCOM ) , even as it was claiming that all information had been handed over .  
Despite the end of the cold war , which has lessened the probability of nuclear conflict , the Earth continues to be an arena of murderous conflicts that cause unspeakable suffering and vast humanitarian tragedies .  
Civil and external wars could occur in regions where the possession of advanced weaponry , such as medium-range missiles with chemical , biological or even nuclear warheads , by ambitious and threatened regimes becomes a potentially lethal prospect . 
First , France has not announced its intention to continue its nuclear testing indefinitely ; on the contrary , we have stated our decision to complete it by engaging in a final series limited to a few tests , which will be concluded before 31 May 1996 .  
I am certain that the establishment of a special status , with international security guarantees , consolidated financial and technical assistance and moral incentives , for countries that renounce nuclear weapons would provide a tremendous impetus for expediting the process of nuclear disarmament .  
The global order can no longer be based solely on the special position of the anti-fascist coalition or the nuclear club , or on economic or military power ; rather , first and foremost , it should be based on the real contribution of individual countries to the prevention of every form of totalitarianism and to the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; on their role within global socio-economic development ; on their democratic achievement ; and on their regional importance .  
Social disintegration has increased , the vertical development of nuclear weapons has continued and civil wars and regional conflicts have broken out in most regions in a manner that has given the impression that the globe we live on has suddenly exploded .  
The Agency 's role as a centre for international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy was confirmed , and the IAEA was expressly recognized as the competent authority responsible for verifying compliance with safeguards agreements .  
Further , as effective national accounting and protection is the basic prerequisite for preventing nuclear material from falling into unauthorized hands , the Agency is conducting training courses in the implementation of State systems of accounting and control of nuclear material and in physical protection methods and technology .  
The existence of effective national accountancy and control systems , especially in those countries possessing sensitive nuclear material , and the existence of systems to ensure physical protection are crucial elements in fighting illicit trafficking . 
We believe that , even though States themselves are responsible for an adequate and effective level of physical protection against nuclear materials , the IAEA and other international organizations can play an important role in ensuring international cooperation , including by providing technical assistance to countries in fields other than law-enforcement .  
Ukraine considers that one of the possible ways to obtain an objective analysis of and to solve the problems connected with the Chernobyl accident would be to set up an international technological research centre which would deal with issues related to the elimination of the consequences of nuclear radiological accidents and in whose work leading experts from various countries in the world could participate .  
There is no doubt that the activities undertaken and the responsibilities shouldered by the Agency are worthy of our appreciation and respect in view of their positive returns with regard to the safety and security of the whole world , on the one hand , and , on the other , their contribution to social and economic development and other activities by facilitating the transfer of nuclear technologies for peaceful use in the developing countries .  
The challenge for the Agency in this connection is to keep providing credible assurances on States Parties ' compliance with their non-proliferation commitments in an increasingly volatile international security environment and amidst a rapid quantitative increase in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and constant advances in nuclear technology .  
On the international level , it must be acknowledged that , despite the modest progress achieved in the control of nuclear , chemical and conventional weapons , these weapons have unfortunately increased qualitatively and quantitatively to an alarming degree .  
These obligations include achieving complete nuclear disarmament , expanding the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , strengthening the role and enhancing the authority of the IAEA as the only international body competent to oversee the good-faith discharge of Member States ' responsibilities under the Treaty , ensuring the universality of the NPT as an urgent priority , and establishing the Middle East as a zone free from nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction .  
The end of the cold war had fuelled hopes that the United Nations , freed from nuclear and ideological confrontation , would devote its full attention to building a peaceful and more equitable world ; tackle the challenge of world poverty ; advance regional conflicts to resolution ; distribute the benefits of peace dividends ; and move towards fulfilling the unrealized premises of the Charter , especially with regard to collective security . 
It was with a deep understanding of global interdependence in the protection of environmental safety on the European continent that the President of Ukraine took the political decision to close the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , on condition that adequate international financial and material support be provided .  
Together with other countries , including Egypt , Malaysia supported Indonesia , which , speaking in its capacity as Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement , emphasized that the five declarations by the five nuclear Powers varied in terms of structure and content , as well as remaining devoid of any legal force .  
This is an objective that is supported by the international community as a whole but , unfortunately , no progress has been made towards its achievement because Israel , who had insisted on direct negotiations with the countries concerned before such a zone could be established now refuses to enter into any negotiations on arms limitation in the nuclear field within the multilateral working group on arms limitation and regional security . 
My Government also considers that all the steps and measures taken by the Israeli occupation authorities with the aim of altering the legal status and demographic character of the Palestinian and Arab occupied territories , particularly with regard to Al-Quds , are null and void and constitute a serious breach of international law .  Peace , security , stability and development in the Middle East require the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction in the region , including nuclear weapons .  
The Conference on Disarmament has advanced towards the comprehensive test-ban treaty through sustained but slow efforts , and it has failed to begin negotiations on a convention prohibiting the production of fissionable material for nuclear weapons or other explosive devices .  
There was also established a comprehensive phased programme with agreed time-frames for progressive and balanced reduction of stockpiles of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery , leading to their ultimate and complete elimination at the earliest possible time .  
At their meeting earlier this month , the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Caribbean Community again expressed grave concern at the recurring threat posed to the region through the marine transport of irradiated nuclear fuel , plutonium and high-level radioactive wastes .  
I express my fervent hope that the successful conclusion of the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) this year and the indefinite extension of the Treaty will help to strengthen its effective implementation and speed progress towards the ultimate goal of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons .  
In this connection I should like to state that an early conclusion of an effective and verifiable comprehensive test-ban treaty by 1996 would be fundamental to real progress towards the ultimate goal of complete nuclear disarmament and to the security of non-nuclear-weapon States .  
The Organization of American States , for example , stated on 13 September that nuclear tests being carried out in the South Pacific pose a potential risk to the health and security of surrounding States and their living resources and environment , and do not take into account the precautionary principle contained in the Rio Declaration on environment and development and in other regional agreements .  
The Assembly , considering that nuclear testing was not consistent with undertakings by the nuclear-weapon States at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference , deeply concerned about the potential negative effects of underground nuclear testing and sharing the alarm expressed internationally , regionally and nationally , would strongly deplore all current nuclear testing and urge the immediate cessation of all nuclear testing .  
Besides the fact that it continues to be the most universal and fundamental instrument for the prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons , its extension demonstrated the international community 's common desire to reject all weapons of mass destruction .  
As far as the statement my delegation made that morning is concerned and here I would say that I am speaking also for the other delegations that made statements we considered the statements to be factual and to truly reflect current global public opinion against nuclear testing , both in the South Pacific and elsewhere .  
It also dispatches the strong message to the countries involved in current nuclear testing that the international community neither welcomes nor approves of their outdated , digressive and intolerable behaviour .  
It would also be serious to accept the assertion that nuclear tests are harmless and safe in the absence of convincing evidence from independent , impartial international specialized institutions .  
With the support and active cooperation of Committee members , I am certain that the First Committee of the General Assembly , at this historic fiftieth session , will be able to further contribute substantially towards attaining our common objective a world free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and with a greatly reduced level of conventional weapons and of violence in general .  
In short , the practical achievement of that purpose in the present international context entails preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , further strengthening existing conventions in this field , pursuing the process of nuclear disarmament , limiting and reducing existing conventional arsenals and establishing confidence - and security-building measures .  
Apart from the obligations to prevent proliferation derived from the existing disarmament agreements , the European Union considers the measures taken on export controls to be useful instruments in the efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , their object being to stem proliferation without detriment to transfers of material , equipment and technology for peaceful purposes in the nuclear , chemical , biological and space-research fields .  
We are deeply convinced that by making the NPT a Treaty of indefinite duration the States parties ensured its continued role as the major international legal instrument providing a basic guarantee for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons worldwide .  
We agreed , in New York in May , to the determined pursuit of global reduction of nuclear weapons , with the ultimate goal of their elimination , and of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
China is ready to work with all the other countries concerned to push forward the work of the Conference on Disarmament in a balanced manner and to contribute to the conclusion of a fair and practicable cut-off convention that will enjoy universal participation and that will be beneficial to the process of nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation .  
Kenya looks forward to the commencement of negotiations on a non-discriminatory and universally applicable convention banning the production and stockpiling of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices , and supports the convening of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , especially as it will accelerate the negotiations on pending conventions in the field of disarmament .  
It should be recalled that the General Assembly , spurred on by the awesome threat posed by atomic weapons and by the disquieting prospect of a nuclear arms race , focused attention from the very beginning on questions of disarmament , and in considering the regulation , reduction and elimination of armaments , it adopted a number of principles , many of which have retained their validity and relevance .  
Throughout this period , worldwide alarm , reflected in numerous United Nations resolutions , grew over the fact that the threat posed by nuclear weapons remained the single most critical global issue .  
These were conspicuous by the lack of specific commitments concerning : an end to the qualitative aspects of nuclear armaments ; the process of nuclear disarmament within a time-bound framework and under multilateral auspices ; assurances of the orderly flow of technology for developing countries ; and the right of non-nuclear States to credible , unconditional and legally binding security assurances .  
Calls upon all States in the Middle East to take practical steps in appropriate forums aimed at making progress towards , inter alia , the establishment of an effectively verifiable Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction , nuclear , chemical and biological , and their delivery systems , and to refrain from taking any measures that preclude the achievement of this objective .  
It is to hoped that the three interlinked decisions on principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , on the strengthening of the review process of the Treaty , and on the indefinite extension will constitute a proper basis for the future effective and comprehensive implementation of the Treaty , bringing the world closer to the ultimate objective of achieving , at the earliest possible date , the cessation of the nuclear-arms race and nuclear disarmament .  
These steps , however , constitute only a technical management of the arms race , and are insufficient : they leave the international community far short of the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons recognized by the Final Document of the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , in 1978 .  
Secondly , the elimination of nuclear weapons , whether immediate or gradual , would certainly lead to the attainment of a world free of nuclear weapons and eventually of all weapons of mass destruction and would facilitate complete and general disarmament which , in turn , would ease tensions in the world at large and help redirect financial and other resources to economic and social development .  
It is a gap that requires intensive international efforts to assuage the deep concern over the nuclear States ' degree of respect for their commitments , particularly since the indefinite extension of the Treaty , and over their dedication to strengthening the Treaty to achieve universality , an essential prerequisite for the Treaty 's credibility and for strengthening the nuclear disarmament process , and , finally , for ensuring that humankind will be safe from nuclear conflagration .  
Despite the achievements of the first half of the Decade in reducing nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and also in limiting conventional weapons , the road towards the noble objective of the Third Disarmament Decade remains a long and winding one .  
The agenda item entitled Process of nuclear disarmament in the framework of international peace and security , with the objective of the elimination of nuclear weapons has been under consideration for several years in our Commission . For various reasons , the Commission has been unable to formulate a set of satisfactory guidelines for nuclear disarmament , thus falling short of people 's expectations . 
While the countries with the largest and most sophisticated nuclear and conventional arsenals have concluded some treaties on nuclear disarmament , it must be emphasized , however , that they have a special responsibility for disarmament and should make further efforts to implement those treaties in earnest so as to bring about further drastic cuts in their nuclear armaments .  
Secondly , and as a result , all Member States share a common interest in avoiding nuclear war and in achieving nuclear disarmament , and must therefore in future increase their efforts bilateral , regional and global on the basis of negotiations conducted in a broad spirit of genuine cooperation and good faith so as to strengthen the existing mechanisms for nuclear disarmament and to agree on new procedures for achieving it . 
At its organizational session , the Commission also decided that the items entitled \ x { e4f8 } rocess of nuclear disarmament in the framework of international peace and security , with the objective of the elimination of nuclear weapons and \ x { e4fa } eview of the Declaration of the 1990s as the Third Disarmament Decade would be concluded at its 1995 substantive session . " 
In this so-called new era in which bipolar confrontation no longer exists , it is especially regrettable that the international community should be unable to arrive at a firm commitment on nuclear disarmament and on the complete elimination of these weapons of mass destruction , which continue to endanger the very survival of the human race .  
" Noting with concern situations of extreme violence , such as those rooted in terrorism and its concomitant , international drug trafficking , which have brought about major changes in the survival strategies of poor rural families , prompting their forced displacement from their places of origin and rendering even more critical the situation of the women who then become the core of the nuclear family ,  
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
Stressing the growing importance of the symbiotic relationship between disarmament and development in current international relations , and recognizing the importance of promoting social and economic development and international cooperation on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy ,  
It was important that the strengthening of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime should be linked with broader international cooperation in the sphere of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , both at the bilateral level and within the framework of the relevant international organizations .  
The attainment of that goal meant the final elimination of nuclear weapons , since the existence of such weapons still constituted a serious threat to the main purpose of the United Nations - the maintenance of international peace and security .  36 .  In the view of his delegation , there were three available options for extending the Treaty : it could be extended for an indefinite period , for an additional fixed period , or for several successive periods .  
Mr . KISLYAK ( Russian Federation ) said that the Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was an international event of paramount importance in terms of the achievement of strategic stability .  The main task of the Conference was to reach a decision on the extension of the Treaty , inasmuch as all States - large and small , nuclear and non-nuclear alike - needed the Treaty and the Treaty 's effective operation must continue in the future .  
Nuclear establishments and the transport of nuclear material required appropriate physical protection , and States needed to have effective border controls so that they had control over what left their territory and were able to carry out their non-proliferation obligations not to permit sensitive nuclear materials to be transmitted to non-peaceful programmes or to terrorist groups .  
His delegation was convinced that the duration of the Treaty and its subsequent extensions should be explicitly linked to progress in nuclear disarmament and , more specifically , to the achievement of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty as a short-term objective .  It felt that China 's proposal of 1996 as the year to achieve that goal was realistic and reasonable .  
China hoped that the United States of America and the Russian Federation would implement existing nuclear-disarmament treaties as scheduled and carry out further drastic cuts in their respective nuclear arsenals , thereby creating the necessary conditions for the commencement of multilateral nuclear disarmament negotiations with the participation of all nuclear-weapon States in order to conclude a convention on the complete prohibition and total destruction of nuclear weapons . 
Thirdly , China held that all non-nuclear-weapon States parties , particularly the developing countries , were entitled under the NPT to engage in international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to acquire relevant technology and assistance for their national economic development . 
China , as a State party and particularly as a developing country with a considerable nuclear industrial capability , strictly abided by the relevant provisions of the NPT to ensure the exclusive use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and had engaged in cooperation with other developing countries in that field , which would increase as his country continued its economic reform and development . 
Four of the five nuclear-weapon States and some of their allies had taken a clear position on the Treaty 's indefinite and unconditional extension , but with regard to such matters as the pace of the negotiations on a complete test-ban treaty , peaceful nuclear explosions , the future of nuclear energy for civilian purposes and negative security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States , the overall impression was that it was business as usual .  
Interest in the subject first arose as the general public became increasingly aware of the [ potentially ] harmful nature and effects of the fallout from atmospheric nuclear tests and as it became apparent that no region could avoid being affected by radioactive debris . 
Thus , the United States made public its view that nuclear testing was important for the security of the Western alliance , which depended on the maintenance of a reliable nuclear deterrence and that , consequently , it could consider a comprehensive test-ban treaty only as a " long-term objective " whose realization must be sought in the context of radical nuclear arms reductions , expanded confidence-building measures and , particularly , improved verification capabilities .  
In the Final Declaration of the First Review Conference ( 1975 ) , 2 / which was adopted by consensus , the participants stated that the obligations undertaken under articles I and II of the Treaty had been faithfully observed by all parties , and that the continued strict observance of those articles remained central to the shared objective of averting the further proliferation of nuclear weapons .  
On 4 October 1994 , the Governments of China and of the United States issued a joint statement whereby the two Governments agreed to work together to promote the earliest possible achievement of a multilateral , non-discriminatory and effectively verifiable convention banning the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Noting with concern situations of extreme violence , such as those rooted in terrorism and its concomitant , international drug trafficking , which have brought about major changes in the survival strategies of poor rural families , prompting their forced displacement from their places of origin and rendering even more critical the situation of the women who then become the core of the nuclear family ,  
I should be grateful if you could have the text of this letter and its annexes circulated as a document of the General Assembly , under item 68 of the preliminary list of items to be included in the provisional agenda of the fiftieth session , entitled " Conclusion of effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons " , and of the Security Council . * A / 50 / 50 . 
In the fifth subparagraph , after the words " an effective commitment to global , coordinated action " , add the words : " on mitigating and overcoming the consequences of natural disasters and major technological and anthropogenic catastrophes , such as that at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and their like , as well as on . . . " ;  
TACF provides assistance and training to developing countries in the use of nuclear technology for power generation , and for scientific , resource , agricultural , medical , environmental and industrial applications , as well as for activities relating to radiation protection , safety of nuclear installations and waste management .  
Efforts should be made to remove those unreasonable restrictions on transfer of nuclear energy technology so as to help the developing countries master the technology for peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to create favourable conditions for the establishment of a new international cooperative relationship in the field of nuclear energy .  
Accusations , such as producing and stockpiling chemical weapons and trying to develop nuclear weapons and building up conventional arms , are concocted apparently in order to frighten Iran 's neighbours , justify an illegitimate foreign military presence in the Persian Gulf , and impose a costly and unnecessary arms sale to the countries of the region .  
Needless to say that these allegations are mainly propagated by a Government which has been the primary supporter and sponsor of Israel 's State-sponsored terrorism , of its aggressive policies , and of its production of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , and has also backed despotic Governments which have not experienced parliamentarianism , consultation and elections in their political life even for a single day .  
For exports to a non-nuclear-weapon State not party to the Treaty , source or special fissionable material either directly transferred , or produced , processed , or used in the facility for which the transferred item is intended , shall not be diverted to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ;  
I have the honour to forward to you the text of a paper providing information on the activities and views of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on the three underlying objectives of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons : to prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons ; to provide a sound basis for international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy ; and to encourage negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to disarmament .  
NPT has become a strong barrier against the spread of nuclear weapons and a standard of civilized behaviour on the part of States at the current time with the rapid structural changes occurring in the world .  
At the same time , the practical activities of IAEA in implementing the safeguards should not hamper scientific and technical development or international cooperation by States in the peaceful use of nuclear energy and should be based on optimum utilization of the Agency 's human and material resources .  
The Russian Federation remains faithful to the principles of equitable international cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy and providing assistance to developing countries and regions of the world in satisfying their wishes on the basis of non-discrimination , if they are legitimate and do not run counter to the Treaty .  
It is the Russian Federation 's firm position that the Treaty , as a major international legal document of the nuclear age ensuring an optimum balance in terms of halting the spread of nuclear weapons , nuclear disarmament and cooperation in the peaceful uses of the atom , must be extended indefinitely and unconditionally .  Such a decision by the Conference will lay the foundation for further progress in the twenty-first century towards a non-nuclear world in the future .  
Since then , the country has removed strategic and tactical nuclear weapons , closed scores of bases and demobilized many thousands of military personnel , transferring to local authorities the responsibility of providing them with housing and basic services .  
However , the United States Administration , together with the south Korean puppet army , has , since 1976 , staged " team spirit " joint military exercises against us each year , mobilizing nuclear weapons instead of coming to the talks , and even cancelled the already proclaimed reduction plan of American troops in south Korea , in July 1979 .  
Section III of the IAEA 's seventh semi-annual report ( document S / 1995 / 287 dated 11 April 1995 ) on the implementation of the IAEA 's plan for ongoing monitoring and verification of Iraq 's compliance with the relevant obligations specified in UNSC resolutions 687 ( 1991 ) and 715 ( 1991 ) , addressed the implications of two , single page , documents which were represented as official Iraqi correspondence , generated in April / May 1994 , suggesting the reconstitution of a nuclear weapons programme .  
Military doctrines of the States in the region should be exclusively defensive and in all respects adapted to the international agreements on restricted use of military force and non-use of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons ;  
A special effort was made to bring to the Conference experts from industry , public and private , and to emphasize the practical issues and options of the conversion process .  The subjects covered included the nuclear industry , military machines , shipbuilding , electronics , aeronautical and aerospace industries , information , intellectual property and international cooperation .  
The Forum expressed its support for the establishment of a credible civil nuclear liability regime including adequate compensation for the victims of transboundary damage in accordance with the principles of the Rio Declaration by incorporating a dedicated transboundary fund of sufficient size .  
NULLThe Forum expressed its support for the establishment of a credible civil nuclear liability regime including adequate compensation for the victims of transboundary damage in accordance with the principles of the Rio Declaration by incorporating a dedicated transboundary fund of sufficient size .  
The Ministers expressed their support for the completion by the Conference on Disarmament of the negotiations on a universal and internationally and effectively verifiable comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty no later than 1996 as well as the early conclusion of negotiations on a non-discriminating and universally applicable convention banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Requirements were outlined in a 1992 guidance document and IAEA provides a standard basis of reference with the International Nuclear Event Scale , which allows a common understanding of nuclear events among the technical community involved , the media and the public .  
NULL CONTINI ( France ) , speaking in exercise of the right of reply , said that his delegation deeply regretted the surprising , arbitrary and unjust connection drawn at the previous meeting by the representative of Papua New Guinea between the elimination of racism and nuclear testing . 
Strongly support United Nations , regional and national efforts on arms control , limitation and disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , in all aspects , and other weapons of mass destruction , including biological and chemical weapons and other forms of particularly excessively injurious or indiscriminate weapons , in pursuit of our common commitment to a world free of all these weapons ;  
The traditional mechanisms of the international codification process had also changed and new challenges had emerged which necessitated a quick and effective response to legal emergencies ; thus , under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency , two multilateral conventions had been adopted in 1986 relating to early warning and assistance in the case of nuclear accidents .  
However , the international community 's determination to confront the new menace of illicit trafficking in nuclear material , on which the Agency is now developing a valuable database , should not distract attention from the continuing need to maintain vigilance over the dumping of radioactive wastes and other highly toxic substances in the territories of developing countries .  
An initiative put forward by the President of Russia , Mr . Yeltsin , has received broad international backing that is , the initiative on the holding in the spring of 1996 of a summit meeting on issues of nuclear security , to consider pressing problems in this area and define ways to solve them , in both the short and the long term .  
We continue to support the multifaceted activity of the Agency in such areas as halting illicit trafficking in nuclear materials , enhancing the level of their physical protection , and preparing an international convention to deal with radioactive wastes .  
On the contrary , at that meeting the participants had unanimously adopted the Brisbane Declaration , which called upon France , amongst other things , to conduct a prior assessment of any major project such as nuclear testing on the marine environment , and to make its data and studies available to the international community for independent and comprehensive assessment .  
Instead of imposing sanctions on the developing countries to prevent them from acquiring nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and for development , thereby compelling them to acquire cheap nuclear technology equipped with minimum safety features and thus maximizing the risk of accidents , the developed countries must provide the developing countries with state-of-the-art nuclear technology equipped with the highest safety standards .  
The determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goals of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
The determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goals of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
Fully convinced that an enlarged membership is desirable in order to take advantage of the current propitious international climate to negotiate and conclude , on the solid basis of a more representative participation , a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty and other important agreements requiring universal adherence ,  
Noting the expressed determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States to pursue systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
Strongly support United Nations , regional and national efforts on arms control , limitation and disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , in all aspects , and other weapons of mass destruction , including biological and chemical weapons and other forms of particularly excessively injurious or indiscriminate weapons , in pursuit of our common commitment to a world free of all these weapons ;  
Appreciating the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [ 2 ] / and acknowledging the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
Heads of Government emphasized the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
My Government therefore finds it disappointing that sponsors of draft resolution A / C . 1 / 50 / L . 39 were apparently unable to accept even a cross-reference to the contribution made to enhanced international security by the continuing strict adherence of non-nuclear-weapon States to multilateral and legally binding non-proliferation undertakings that are verified by full-scope nuclear safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency .  
The determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goals of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control , and invites them to keep States Members of the United Nations duly informed of the progress and efforts made ;  
Therefore , my delegation had proposed to the original sponsors a simple preambular paragraph which would have located the comprehensive test-ban treaty as a significant disarmament step in a phased programme leading eventually to the total elimination of nuclear weapons in a specific or even reasonable time-frame . . . . . . .  
The determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goals of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
The Chairman : It was my understanding that a revision had been made , adding the letter s to the word goal in operative paragraph 2 , where it calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goals , which is in the plural , and it is my understanding that this plural was to be repeated in the same manner in the preambular paragraph above .  
Conscious of the forthcoming tenth anniversary of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which became the largest technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
The implementation of this crash programme , if successful , would have reduced the time required to attain sufficient nuclear material for a single nuclear weapon by up to two years compared to the probable production time-scale of Iraq 's EMIS and centrifuge enrichment programmes .  
In keeping with Iraq 's former position that the political decision had not been made to proceed to the design , development and production of nuclear weapons , the purpose of this work had previously been explained as technological development with the long-term possibility of converting to metal the depleted uranium , expected to result from Iraq 's indigenous enrichment processes , as part of a waste management strategy .  
During the current discussions , the Iraqi counterparts retracted their previous explanation that the sphere had been cast merely to optimize the mass-to-surface area ratio in connection with their work on melting and purification and declared that the casting of the sphere had been done to gain some preliminary experience that would be of assistance in their eventual production of the pits of nuclear weapons .  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goals of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control , and invites them to keep States Members of the United Nations duly informed of the progress and efforts made " .  
Noting the expressed determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States to pursue systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control , was revised to read :  
The determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goals of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control , and invites them to keep States Members of the United Nations duly informed of the progress and efforts made ;  
Appreciating also the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [ 35 ] / and acknowledging the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
His Government joined all those which were protesting against recent nuclear testing , which ran counter to the constructive philosophy of the moratorium proclaimed by the other nuclear Powers and had a negative effect on the current climate which was conducive to the negotiation of a complete nuclear test-ban treaty .  
of the forthcoming tenth anniversary of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which became the largest technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
of the forthcoming tenth anniversary of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which became the largest technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
There is need for further systematic and progressive effort in order to achieve our ultimate goal of the elimination of nuclear weapons and of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
In doing so , we believe that Ukraine made an unprecedented contribution , which has not yet received adequate recognition by the international community , to diminishing the global nuclear threat and thereby demonstrated to the whole world its peaceful , consistent and reliable policy .  
Other pressing issues include the population explosion , environmental degradation , the water shortage , desertification , the food deficit , the growing gap between the North and the South , the regional arms race , the threat posed by nuclear weapons , the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , development concerns , barriers to economic and trade cooperation , the removal of restrictions on free trade and , last but not least , human rights .  
The other day I signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty on behalf of the Republic of Namibia , not out of complete satisfaction but to encourage the ongoing work towards disarmament , bearing in mind the constructive and timely advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on nuclear weapons , as well as the Treaties of Pelindaba , Rarotonga and Tlatelolco , which created nuclear-free zones in Africa , the South Pacific and Latin America respectively .  
The increased number and growing sophistication of lethal nuclear , chemical and bacteriological weapons of mass destruction and the further development of their intercontinental delivery systems heightens the threat of annihilation for many countries and peoples , especially when some of the countries which possess them lack even minimal credibility .  
The total elimination of all existing nuclear weapons , as an indispensable step towards general and complete disarmament under strict and efficient international control , is the demand of the entire Non-Aligned Movement , to which we fully subscribe . 
We believe that , with the treaties and bilateral agreements concluded , and the ongoing negotiations among the nuclear-weapon States , and also with the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons last year , the international community is now reaffirming its commitment to global disarmament and renewing the hopes for the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction .  
While political , regional and ethnic conflicts , civil wars and the menace of armaments both nuclear and conventional are a major concern , Sierra Leone believes that the greatest threat to international peace and security today lies in poverty and in economic and social deprivation .  
We consider that the unanimous opinion that there is in neither customary nor conventional international law any specific authorization of the threat or use of nuclear weapons should become the legal and political foundation for greater progress towards total denuclearization . 
On the one hand , Israel 's nuclear-weapons programme has continuously received the direct and indirect political and technical support of one State ; on the other , the interventionist policy of coercive deprivation of other countries in the same region of their inalienable right to acquire nuclear technology for peaceful purposes has become a cornerstone of the foreign policy of the very same State .  
In addition , we commend the secretariat for playing an instrumental role in fostering the development of a global nuclear safety culture based on an improved international legal framework , recommended safety standards and advisory services .  
The presentation to the General Assembly of the annual report of the IAEA provides us with a valuable opportunity to review the work which the Agency has carried out and to measure the impact and efficiency of its activities in the various fields in which it operates in accordance with its statutory functions , both in respect of its work in the prevention of nuclear proliferation and in the promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , as well as in the strengthening of international cooperation in nuclear safety , radiological protection and waste management .  
The European Union urges the Conference on Disarmament , also pursuant to the Principles and Objectives agreed to at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference , to proceed to negotiations on a non-discriminatory , multilateral , and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , a so-called cut-off convention .  
We note with satisfaction the work done by the parties concerned on guidelines for the management of civil plutonium , which would constitute an important complement to the Moscow Nuclear Summit Declaration on the safe and effective management of weapons fissile material designated as no longer required for defence purposes , inter alia , through the Nuclear Suppliers Group controls on the traffic in nuclear materials , which would be safely stored , protected and placed under IAEA safeguards .  
The European Union has taken a leading role in the strengthening of regulatory regimes , including in the establishment of the nuclear safety account , administered by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , the G 24 coordinating mechanism , the European Union 's Poland-Hungary Aid for the Reconstruction of the Economy ( PHARE ) and Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States ( TACIS ) programmes , the European Atomic Energy Community loan facility , coordinated support from the international financial institutions for the energy sector , and bilateral cooperation projects .  
While recognizing that primary responsibility for nuclear safety rests with national Governments , the European Union welcomes the initiatives taken by the IAEA to strengthen cooperation and mutual assistance and its continuing work in fostering a global nuclear safety culture , and recognizes its contribution to future work under the Convention on Nuclear Safety , which is a major accomplishment in this field .  
The IAEA 's 1995 annual report clearly demonstrates that the Agency continues to play a vital role in promoting international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and in fostering global peace and security as provided for in its statute and relevant international instruments .  
At the domestic level , the national Government , owing to radical economic reforms , has made progress in the far-reaching process of bilateral cooperation with countries committed to the peaceful use of nuclear energy .  
Fourthly , bearing in mind the major aspects of the peaceful uses of atomic energy for the benefit of our country 's economic and social development , we would once more like to stress that our country is supporting the Agency 's measures for strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime , within the context of the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) .  
There are still many who need to be convinced that nuclear technology is the inevitable option for satisfying the energy needs of developing countries and that it is worthwhile supporting nuclear-technology based programmes and activities also in the fields of fresh water , food , health and the environment .  
Despite a large degree of convergence on many of the issues that will be addressed by this convention , we feel constrained to reiterate that , for countries like India , whose nuclear programme is based on a closed fuel cycle , it would not be possible to consider including spent fuel in a convention dealing with the safety of radioactive waste management .  
The coordinated research programmes , training programmes and technical meetings must increasingly address more advanced areas of nuclear technology to benefit the increasing number of developing countries that are enhancing the level of sophistication and capabilities of their respective national nuclear programmes .  
While there is no substitute for efficient national systems for accounting and control , especially in those countries possessing sensitive nuclear material , in preventing illicit trafficking , we recognize the crucial role the Agency can play in information-sharing and in identifying the sources of stolen material .  
In particular , the Agency has rendered valuable assistance , both technical and material , to developing countries to meet their special needs in the application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and economic development .  
Morocco , which made an important contribution to the drafting of the Treaty , is convinced that this document will open the way for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons , strengthen international cooperation and promote the exchange of knowledge about the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , so that developing countries can achieve their economic and technical goals .  
Humanity can be sheltered from the tragedy of massively destructive wars only through the full and complete elimination of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons under effective international control .  
The Assembly will note that the draft convention deals with illicit traffic in drugs and psychotropic substances and money laundering ; traffic in persons ; counterfeiting currency ; illicit traffic in or stealing of cultural objects ; stealing and smuggling nuclear material , and the misuse or threat of misuse of such material to harm the public ; terrorist acts ; illicit traffic in or stealing of arms and explosive materials or devices ; illicit traffic in or stealing of motor vehicles ; and corruption of public officials .  
If the world can focus its energies on ending the testing of sophisticated and expensive nuclear weapons , we believe that there is real hope for setting ourselves the goal of ending the use of the most simple , cheap and , on a daily basis , most destructive weapon in use today , the anti-personnel landmine .  
The political controversy over the timing of a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , set at this stage for 1999 , continued in this session and remains closely linked to the desire of a large number of States to focus the special session on further measures towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons .  
Our previous bilateral efforts have demonstrated that nuclear disarmament is an extremely intricate process involving careful trade-offs , specialized and highly tailored verification , and very sensitive security calculations .  
It highlights the importance of measures to give full effect to the provisions of article VI of the NPT , including a programme of action , a treaty on the total prohibition of nuclear testing , a convention on the production of fissile material and , lastly , the commitment of nuclear-weapon States to move systematically and gradually forward so as to reduce nuclear weapons as a whole and then eliminate them , and the determination of all States to work towards general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
As I have stated before , Japan , which has experienced the calamity of atomic bombing , fervently hopes that nuclear weapons , which cause incomparable human suffering , will never again be used and firmly believes that continuous efforts should be made towards a nuclear-weapon-free world .  
Of special significance to my country , and a point we had emphasized in our own presentation to the Court , was the unanimous finding that there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control .  
It establishes clearly , among other elements , the link and interdependence that exists between the processes of nuclear and conventional disarmament , conventional disarmament at the global level , the specific features of each region which must be taken into account the need for initiatives and participation by all States of the region concerned in the search for agreements on regional disarmament , and the danger posed by the excessive accumulation of weapons by States over and above their legitimate defence needs .  
Even more recently , Africa signed the Pelindaba Treaty , making our continent a nuclear-weapon-free zone , and thus making a substantial contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security and to the process of nuclear disarmament , which , in the context of ongoing negotiations in Geneva on a comprehensive test-ban treaty , has not gained the necessary impetus to preserve the future of mankind and to save succeeding generations from the nuclear scourge . 
The long-standing bipolar nuclear confrontation has been replaced by mostly regional , subregional and intra-State conflicts arising from political , economic and social difficulties , and by massive violations of human rights , including those of ethnic minorities .  
Also recommends that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
Welcomes with special satisfaction the adoption by the African leaders of the final text of the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone Treaty ( the Pelindaba Treaty ) , 5 / which constitutes an event of historic significance in the efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to promote international peace and security and which , at the same time , recognizes the right of African countries to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in order to accelerate the economic and social development of their peoples ;  
The determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control , and invites them to keep States Members of the United Nations duly informed of the progress and efforts made ;  
Appreciating also the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 9 / and acknowledging the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
Bearing in mind paragraph 50 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , 19 / the first special session devoted to disarmament , calling for the urgent negotiation of agreements for the cessation of the qualitative improvement and development of nuclear-weapon systems , and for a comprehensive and phased programme with agreed time-frames , wherever feasible , for progressive and balanced reduction of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery , leading to their ultimate and complete elimination at the earliest possible time ,  
World wide , fossil fuels have continued to be the dominant primary energy source for electricity generation , with coal accounting for the major share and likely to remain so well into the next century , although hydro and nuclear energy have made tangible progress in many countries .  
[ Civil , ethnic and religious strife , nuclear armament , armed conflicts , alien and colonial domination , foreign occupation , international economic imbalance , coercive economic measures , poverty , organized crime , and terrorism in all its forms are destructive to sustainable human settlements development and should therefore be renounced by all States . ]  
Conscious of the forthcoming tenth anniversary of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which became the largest technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
It is the invalidation by the United States side of the key provisions of the Armistice Agreement that has paved the way for south Korea 's current status as the greatest United States overseas military base and nuclear base .  
Ten years separate us from the early-morning hours of 26 April 1986 when two powerful explosions in rapid succession destroyed the Unit 4 reactor of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , exposing the burning core and releasing 50-million curies of radioactive isotopes into the environment .  
Stressing the importance of promoting regional and international cooperation for the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in the interest of sustainable social and economic development of the African continent ,  
Most of the developed countries draw on large shares of crude oil and natural gas in their primary energy consumption ; some regions have substantial contributions of nuclear energy and modern renewable sources . 
Recognizing that the prime responsibility for nuclear safety rests with national Governments , it is of primary importance to continue to enhance international collaborative efforts to promote a high level of nuclear safety world wide .  
Nuclear safety can also be enhanced by greater international transparency in nuclear power activities , in particular by means of peer reviews , and this should lead to existing reactors that do not meet current safety requirements being brought to an acceptable level of safety or ceasing operation .  
We pledge our support for efforts to ensure that all sensitive nuclear material ( separated plutonium and highly enriched uranium ) designated as not intended for use for meeting defence requirements is safely stored , protected and placed under IAEA safeguards ( in the nuclear-weapon States , under the relevant voluntary offer IAEA safeguards agreements ) as soon as it is practicable to do so .  
Accordingly , we have concluded that increased cooperation among our Governments to combat illicit trafficking in nuclear material will contribute to increased international security and public safety , and to achievement of global non-proliferation objectives .  
Support efforts to ensure that all sensitive nuclear material ( separated plutonium and highly enriched uranium ) not intended for use in meeting defence requirements is safely and effectively stored and protected and placed under IAEA safeguards ( in the nuclear-weapon States , under the relevant " voluntary offer " IAEA safeguards agreements ) as soon as it is practicable to do so ;  
Seek to identify strategies for the safe , effective and affordable peaceful use of nuclear material no longer required for defence purposes or for its safe permanent disposal ;  
Moreover , the countless emerging transnational issues , such as environment protection , sustainable development , non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , drug prevention , overpopulation in cities , payment of debts , poverty eradication , and protection of intellectual property rights , need to be addressed from a global perspective .  
It is expected that these materials will address , among other subjects : the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty , further developments in nuclear disarmament , entry into force of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development , Production , Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction , substantive preparation for the review conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in the year 2000 , preparations for a fourth special session on disarmament , conventional disarmament and transparency , and regional arrangements .  
At a public sitting on 8 July 1996 , the International Court of Justice recognized that for the first time in history , the threat or use of nuclear weapons is generally contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict , and in particular the principles and rules of humanitarian law , while also recognizing that there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament .  
" The Argentine Republic is convinced that the conclusion of the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty would be a crucial event in fostering international trust , because it would strengthen the growing conviction that nuclear weapons are of no use for the security of nations , and would facilitate the future agenda and the negotiation of other multilateral measures regarding disarmament , non-proliferation and arms control . "  Charg d'affaires a.i .  
The need to avert the potential dangers posed by the unlawful taking and use of nuclear material and to adopt appropriate and effective measures to ensure the prevention , detection and punishment of offences relating to nuclear material , which are a matter of grave concern to the international community , led the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) to adopt the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material 13 / at Vienna on 26 October 1979 .  
Many delegations were concerned that subprogramme 1.3 emphasized the micro rather than the macro aspects of disarmament such as nuclear , chemical , bacteriological and conventional weapons .  
However , zero nuclear weapons might not be a stable , reassuring zero unless all fissile material , and the dedicated nuclear infrastructure , has been placed under satisfactory international control .  
Adopting effective controls on explosives and against illicit trafficking by criminals in certain materials and their components that are specifically designed for use in manufacturing nuclear , biological or chemical weapons and , in order to lessen risks arising from such trafficking , by becoming party to and fully implementing all relevant international treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction ;  
Concerned with the growing threat of organized crime , including the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , money laundering , illicit traffic in arms , nuclear material and explosive devices , motor vehicles , objects of arts ,  
Israel 's refusal to adhere to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , when it possesses enormous numbers of nuclear weapons , is developing other weapons of mass destruction and the means of their delivery and refuses to place its facilities under international supervision and International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards , not only flouts the wishes of the international community but also constitutes a grave and persistent threat to the security and the future of the peoples of the region and , consequently , to international peace and security .  
Considering that an expansion of technical cooperation activities relating to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy will contribute to the well-being of the peoples of the world , recognizing the special needs of the developing countries for technical assistance from the Agency and the importance of funding in order to benefit effectively from the transfer and application of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes as well as from the contribution of nuclear energy to their economic development , and desiring that the Agency 's resources for technical cooperation activities be assured and sufficient ,  
Urges all States to strive for effective and harmonious international cooperation in carrying out the work of the Agency , pursuant to its statute ; in promoting the use of nuclear energy and the application of the necessary measures to strengthen further the safety of nuclear installations and to minimize risks to life , health and the environment ; in strengthening technical assistance and cooperation for developing countries ; and in ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of the safeguards systems of the Agency ;

The determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control , and invites them to keep States Members of the United Nations duly informed of the progress and efforts made ;  
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
disarmament , calling for the urgent negotiation of agreements for the cessation of the qualitative improvement and development of nuclear weapon systems , and for a comprehensive and phased programme with agreed time frames , wherever feasible , for progressive and balanced reduction of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery , leading to their ultimate and complete elimination at the earliest possible time ,  
Recognizing that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and any proposed treaty on fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices must constitute disarmament measures , and not only non-proliferation measures , and that these measures , together with an international legal instrument on adequate security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States and an international convention prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons must be integral steps leading to the total elimination of nuclear weapons within a time-bound framework ,  
Taking note of the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice dated 8 July 1966 on the legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons , and welcoming the unanimous reaffirmation by all Judges of the Court that there exists an obligation for all States to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control ,  
The Polessk State Radiation and Environmental Reserve , located in Belarus on territory directly adjacent to the Chernobyl nuclear power station , possesses appropriate infrastructure , including highly qualified scientists and experts , and has unique conditions and research subjects , thus making it possible to develop practical approaches and establish effective methods of overcoming the consequences of nuclear disasters and ensuring environmental rehabilitation of territories polluted by radionuclides . 
Appreciating also the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [ 2 ] / and acknowledging the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
At their fourth meeting , they also expressed their concern regarding the safe and secure transportation of INF materials through the region . 187 They called on all States to maintain cooperation and exchange information on the transportation of nuclear material and radioactive waste and to continue working through IMO and IAEA in the development of additional measures which would complement the 1993 INF Code .  
In the light of current priorities , particular attention should be given to countries that make a significant , generally recognized contribution to the strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and effective efforts to strengthen regional and global security by carrying out their obligations under the major disarmament agreements and treaties in this area .  
Adopting effective controls on explosives and against illicit trafficking by criminals in certain materials and their components that are specifically designed for use in manufacturing nuclear , biological or chemical weapons and , in order to lessen risks arising from such trafficking , by becoming party to and fully implementing all relevant international treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction ;  
He regretted that the Department had not been more responsive to and supportive of Ukraine 's unprecedented contribution to nuclear disarmament and diminishing the global nuclear threat , which had not received adequate international recognition .  
The issue involved mainly activities typical of modern industrial societies , such as those connected with nuclear power plants , the chemical and space industries and maritime transport of petroleum and other dangerous or polluting substances , which certainly had undeniable political and economic value , but also posed a considerable risk for the safety of human beings and protection of the environment .  
Considering that an expansion of technical cooperation activities relating to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy will contribute to the well-being of the peoples of the world , recognizing the special needs of the developing countries for technical assistance from the Agency and the importance of funding in order to benefit effectively from the transfer and application of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes as well as from the contribution of nuclear energy to their economic development , and desiring that the Agency 's resources for technical cooperation activities be assured and sufficient ,  
In Poland 's view , the proposed new framework convention should be based on existing international instruments regulating illicit narcotic drug trafficking , trafficking in persons , the protection of nuclear material and the import and export of cultural property as well as bilateral and regional agreements on crime prevention .  
Adopting effective controls on explosives and against illicit trafficking by criminals in certain materials and their components that are specifically designed for use in manufacturing nuclear , biological or chemical weapons and , in order to lessen risks arising from such trafficking , by becoming party to and fully implementing all relevant international treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction ;

Bearing in mind paragraph 50 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , 10 the first special session devoted to disarmament , calling for the urgent negotiation of agreements for the cessation of the qualitative improvement and development of nuclear-weapon systems , and for a comprehensive and phased programme with agreed time-frames , wherever feasible , for progressive and balanced reduction of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery , leading to their ultimate and complete elimination at the earliest possible time ,  
Recognizing that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and any proposed treaty on fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices must constitute disarmament measures , and not only non-proliferation measures , and that these measures , together with an international legal instrument on adequate security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States and an international convention prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons , must be integral steps leading to the total elimination of nuclear weapons within a time-bound framework ,  
Appreciating also the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , 23 and acknowledging the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;

Others had felt that certain kinds of environmental damage , such as damage caused by the deliberate detonation of nuclear explosions or pollution of entire rivers , should entail the individual criminal responsibility of those responsible , particularly since the fate of future generations was at stake .  
As a State that has completed the withdrawal of strategic nuclear missiles from its territory , we believe that it is extremely important to make joint efforts to lay the foundations for a firm and peaceful future for Europe .  
It further noted that recent space technology spin-offs had resulted in products such as an anti-shock pressure suit for medical applications , a transportation guidance system , a hand-held electromagnetic probe for inspecting aircraft for cracks and other damage , an obstacle detection system to assist in automated operations , a prototype silicon detector of radiation-induced effects in humans , automated robotic gasoline pumps , force reflecting devices to assist the blind in using a computer mouse , nuclear waste facility clean-up , and field applications and demonstrations of tele-medicine systems ( " tele-clinics " ) .  
With the improvement of the international political climate , the dangers posed by nuclear war and the arms race are receding , while prospects for taking concrete steps on practical disarmament are improving .  
The international community must take specific measures designed to act on the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the obligation to pursue and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
We , who have a closed fuel cycle nuclear power programme , have consistently opposed the inclusion of spent fuel , which is a valuable resource material , along with radioactive waste in this convention .  
At a time when the international community is struggling to deal with the problems of environmental degradation resulting from the excessive use of fossil fuel , the Agency 's achievements in the area of nuclear safety underline the merits of nuclear energy as the most feasible and attractive alternative to fossil fuel .  
The Agency justifiably has a strong reputation for generating ideas and initiating practical actions aimed at enhancing nuclear safety and security by undertaking the dual functions of strengthening the international non-proliferation regime and developing peaceful cooperation in the use of atomic energy .  
Considering the increasing environmental cost to society of wastes from burnt fossil fuels and the risk of global warming , we believe in safe and peaceful nuclear energy as a cost-effective and clean source of energy for the future .  
Countries with limited mineral resources , like Armenia , will continue to view the International Atomic Energy Agency as the central medium for the safeguarded transfer of nuclear technology , operational expertise , and technical assistance to countries which explicitly adhere to international non-proliferation objectives and comply with the existing regulations .  
Despite the negative public perception created in some countries and the fears aroused about the dangers of nuclear proliferation , nuclear energy remains a viable and attractive energy option for many countries , and particularly for the fossil fuel-deficient developing countries .  
The region \ x { e5b8 } constant focus on democracy , good governance , peace , security and nuclear disarmament ; its undertaking to take responsibility for the proper and responsible management of the environment ; the protection of fish and other marine resources ; cultural and technology exchanges ; and economic cooperation and respect for human rights all stand to prove that the zone is successfully dealing with a changing global environment .  
The substantive outcome of these joint efforts relates in particular to environmental protection in its global dimension : prohibiting chemical and bacteriological weapons and reducing nuclear weapons , as well as formulating a new concept and practice of peacekeeping ; ensuring human rights ; and codifying international law on non-renewable resources .  
Japan , which experienced the calamity of atomic bombing , fervently desires that the use of nuclear weapons , which cause incomparable human suffering , should never be repeated and firmly believes that continuous efforts should be made towards creating a world free of nuclear weapons .  
From the very start of the negotiations , the main objective of many non-nuclear-weapon States was to build into the architecture of the Treaty a renewed commitment by all States , and particularly the nuclear-weapon States , to a progressive and more systematic process leading to complete I repeat , complete nuclear disarmament .  
I am certain that the First Committee can make a significant contribution towards the attainment of our common objective : a world free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and a greatly reduced level of conventional weapons .  
The International Court of Justice has declared in a historic advisory opinion that the threat or use of nuclear weapons would be contrary to the rules of international law applicable to armed conflicts .  
Similarly , the continued existence of stocks of prohibited fissile material for the production of prohibited nuclear weapons and of the illicit traffic in weapons of mass destruction , particularly biological and chemical weapons , remains a source of deep concern and threatens the stability and security of countries and entire regions .  
For these reasons , Costa Rica supports the creation of a broad region called The nuclear-weapon-free Southern Hemisphere and adjacent areas on the basis of a proposal for resolutions put forward by Brazil , which should include a total ban on the transport and transfer of nuclear materials for bellicose purposes and of atomic waste .  
The highest priority for the international community , therefore , should continue to remain the ultimate and complete elimination of nuclear weapons as was laid down in the Final Document of SSOD I . The agenda should also include measures on the elimination of the other weapons of mass destruction , in particular chemical and biological weapons , through the full implementation of relevant disarmament treaties . 
The speedy commencement and rapid conclusion of good-faith negotiations to achieve nuclear disarmament in all its aspects , under strict and effective international control , in accordance with the unanimous opinion of the International Court of Justice , is of paramount importance to the future of the international community .  
Through the Treaty of Tlatelolco , whose thirtieth anniversary is being celebrated this year , the treaties of Rarotonga , Bangkok and Pelindaba , and the Antarctic Treaty , the southern hemisphere and adjacent areas covered by these treaties are rapidly becoming free of nuclear weapons , as the General Assembly recognized with satisfaction last autumn .  
While my delegation is deeply concerned about the problem of nuclear disarmament , at a practical level it is also convinced of the need for urgent and decisive action to curtail the illicit trafficking in small arms .  
Australia 's primary goal for the Commission 's work on nuclear-weapon-free zones is an outcome in keeping with the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) decision on principles and objectives , that the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones , on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned , enhances regional and global peace and security and contributes to the ultimate objective of achieving a world entirely free of nuclear weapons .  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control , and invites them to keep States Members of the United Nations duly informed of the progress and efforts made ;  
Bearing in mind paragraph 50 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , 8 the first special session devoted to disarmament , calling for the urgent negotiation of agreements for the cessation of the qualitative improvement and development of nuclear-weapon systems , and for a comprehensive and phased programme with agreed time-frames , wherever feasible , for progressive and balanced reduction of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery , leading to their ultimate and complete elimination at the earliest possible time ,  
Recognizing that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and any proposed treaty on fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices must constitute disarmament measures , and not only non-proliferation measures , and that these measures , together with an international legal instrument on adequate security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States and an international convention prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons , must be integral steps leading to the total elimination of nuclear weapons within a time-bound framework ,  
Appreciating also the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , 27 and acknowledging the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
Environmentally induced migrations are caused by natural disasters , such as earthquakes , flash flooding , typhoons , and volcanic eruptions ; by nuclear and hazardous waste contamination ; by agricultural and rural decline , resource pollution , chronic water shortages ; or by dam construction and other large-scale development projects .  
Subsidies in the energy sector for conventional energy sources and nuclear power tend to hamper widespread development and application of renewable energy sources . 6 Policy changes that will lead to the full internalization of environmental costs in prices through the use of economic and fiscal instruments and the removal of permanent subsidies are required if a sustainable energy path is to be pursued . 
The Canberra Commission was a body of independent experts and eminent persons commissioned by the Australian Government to address the fundamental questions of whether a nuclear _ weapon _ free world is feasible and , if so , the measures which could be taken to attain that objective .  
And if nevertheless many countries did accede to it , including my own , this certainly reflects the conviction and the hope that they attach to the collective and multilateral task of disarmament , as reflected in the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice of 8 July 1996 , which reminded us that all States have an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects , and under strict and effective international control .  
In my view , the three sessions of the open _ ended informal Presidential consultations , each devoted to such issues as nuclear disarmament , a fissile material cut _ off treaty and anti _ personnel landmines , were useful and contributed to moving the overall process of the CD forward .  
It was agreed that technical experts , including experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , should be invited to the fifteenth session of the Working Group , in 1998 , in order to identify and study the current international technical standards pertinent to the use of nuclear power sources in outer space .  
The intensive consultations led by your distinguished predecessor Ambassador Yung Sun showed that within these two fields there are at least three issues commanding quite broad support , namely the fissile material cut _ off , nuclear disarmament and the complex issue of anti _ personnel landmines . 
The consultations proved to be useful , allowing me to see better where delegations stand as far as their positions on three important issues are concerned : namely , on nuclear disarmament , the fissile material cut _ off treaty and anti _ personnel landmines , as well as , in some cases , on other issues of major interest to them . 
So if we are not able to solve the daunting issue of nuclear disarmament in one great stroke now , let us attend to what is feasible and in doing so add another valuable facet , namely a treaty on fissile material cut _ off ( FMCT ) , to this multifaceted edifice .  
It is inconceivable to permit fissile materials to be manufactured while nuclear tests are being banned and existing fissile material is being destroyed .  
States that , through the rational application in outer space of the technical and technological legacy of the arms race , instead of its hasty destruction , the use of the existing nuclear missile potential of the Russian Federation , the United States of America , and other countries for the benefit of sustainable development is capable of giving impetus to the preservation and improvement of the environment by mobilizing extraterrestrial energy and material resources for the development of civilization ,  
An appeal by the special session to the Governments of the Russian Federation and the United States of America to consider the rational employment of their missile and nuclear potential as a contribution of these two countries to common efforts to ensure sustainable development and preservation of the natural environment of this earth ; to start - should the response of the two Governments be positive - developing relevant international programmes and projects ensuring respect for the regime of non-proliferation of nuclear and missile technologies and for intellectual property rights ;  
The United Nations to create an international legal basis for the process of redirecting nuclear missile potential to the objectives stipulated in Agenda 21 and to ensure the financing of an international expert analysis of the attendant positive and negative factors ,  
Recalling further its resolution 1996 / 16 , in which it requested the Secretary _ General to submit a report on information gathered on the use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel _ air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium and their consequential and cumulative effects and the danger they represent to life , physical security and other human rights ,  
While it appreciated the work being done by the United Nations to initiate and coordinate activities aimed at finding a solution to the Chernobyl problem , his Government was seriously concerned by the fact that , at a time when the closing of the Chernobyl nuclear power plan was being discussed , the search for a solution to the medical and environmental consequences of the disaster , for which Belarus was bearing the main burden , was being relegated to the background .  
The practice of dumping ageing nuclear submarines at sea or abandoning them at old naval bases where security measures were inadequate had to be stopped , and abandoned submarines should be recovered before they could cause irreparable damage to the ocean environment .  
After peaceful relations and reconciliation are established among all States in the region , Israel will endeavour to establish in the Middle East _ through direct negotiations among all its members _ a zone free of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons , as well as ballistic missiles , based on mutual and effective verification .  
Indeed , Israel has been actively supporting and participating in efforts of the international community to prevent the proliferation of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles , not least through export control mechanisms , inspired by those of the Nuclear Suppliers Group ( NSG ) , the Australian Group ( AG ) , and the Missile Technology Control Regime ( MTCR ) , of which Israel is an adherent .  
As the tensions which reflected the cold war era give way to growing global confidence and cooperation , the international community should now turn more of its attention and energies towards many as yet unresolved regional conflicts , which are characterized by unprecedented conventional arms build _ ups and , in some instances , also by the Clandestine pursuit of nuclear , chemical or biological weapons .  
It seems to us that the CD , with its accumulated experience of complex disarmament negotiations on weapons of mass destruction , is the ideal forum in which to carry forward discussions on the technical and legal questions which must be confronted if we are to achieve the elimination of nuclear weapons .  
These measures are intrinsically linked to the just and lasting resolution of conflicts , the peaceful settlement of disputes , concrete and effective measures of disarmament through the accession of all the States of the region to the multinational agreements on the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction ( the Non-Proliferation Treaty , the Chemical Weapons Convention , the Biological Weapons Convention , etc . ) , and to the placement of all nuclear installations under international control .  
With a view to promoting peace and strengthening security in the Mediterranean region , the new Government of Malta has time and time again committed itself to a foreign policy that is based on the values of democratic governance , on the upholding of fundamental human rights , on the peaceful settlement of disputes and on a policy that is in favour of disarmament and strongly opposes military aggression , and the manufacture , distribution and proliferation of all types of armaments and weapons , especially weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , chemical and biological .  
Just last month , on the bilateral level , the United States of America and the Russian Federation announced initiatives taken in the areas of strategic security and nuclear security that will make a positive and constructive contribution to the global nuclear arms control and disarmament agenda .  
The START process must be revitalized and broadened to include other nuclear-weapon States promises and intentions must be converted into actions ; the nuclear-weapon States must progressively and dynamically demonstrate their fulfilment of their NPT obligation to negotiate in good faith and to conclude negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament ; the NPT review process must continue to be a qualitatively different and enhanced exercise ; and the Conference on Disarmament must overcome its current stalemate and move forward decisively and responsibly on nuclear disarmament and a fissile material cut-off treaty .  
It stood for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , the prohibition of the development of outer space weapons , and the reduction of conventional weapons to a rational level .  
Thirdly , it is necessary to prevent a small number of countries taking advantage of their advanced military technology and economic power to seek their absolute security and military superiority over others while they focus the target of disarmament on the developing countries and deprive them of their legitimate right and means of self-defence .  Fourthly , the countries with the largest and most sophisticated conventional and nuclear arsenals should continue to bear special responsibility for disarmament .  
The decision gradually to remove up to 500 tons of highly enriched uranium and up to 50 tons of weapons-grade plutonium from nuclear military programmes is an effective contribution by Russia to ensuring that nuclear disarmament is irreversible .  The 1972 Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems ( ABM ) is of paramount importance to nuclear disarmament as a key element of strategic stability and a prerequisite for further reductions in strategic offensive arms .  
Pakistan believes that we can succeed in realizing peace through a comprehensive and sustained dialogue which would seriously address , and progressively resolve , the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir in conformity with the relevant United Nations resolutions ; achieve mutual and equitable restraint on conventional weapons to ensure equal security to both Pakistan and India ; evolve agreement for mutual and equal restraint in the nuclear field and in ballistic missiles : and conclude and strengthen confidence-building measures .  
Nuclear testing is continuing using non-explosive techniques ; existing weapons are being improved ; new types of weapons are being designed : all indications that CTBT is set to start a new technology race in the quest for more innovative and more lethal nuclear weapons .  
It is therefore our common task and responsibility to seize this historic opportunity , provided by the present international environment , to work together for the total elimination of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and for the regulation and control of other conventional tools of killing .  
Sustained pursuit of negotiation , bilateral and multilateral , is indispensable in order to achieve the goal of genuine and complete disarmament , as well as to completely eliminate the massive stockpiles of existing nuclear arsenals .  
Its main objective would be to monitor the declared fissile material production facilities or those capable of such activity for the purposes of nuclear weapons or other explosive devices .  
It is , therefore , essential to ensure that the existing favourable conditions in international relations are utilized to achieve the ultimate objective of eliminating all nuclear weapons .  
My country , Senegal , feels that , apart from the potential for destruction presented by nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , security problems are equally linked to conventional armaments in numerous conflicts and tensions raging throughout the world , especially in Africa .  
That finding by the special session was echoed by the International Court of Justice , which concluded in its epoch-making Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996 which should be a constant reminder , particularly to nuclear-weapon States that there exists an obligation for all States to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control . 
Within this framework , the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms must , if it is to be successful , be expanded to include information on other categories of armaments that are not currently covered , such as nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , in addition to advanced technology with military applications .  
Moreover , the Register must be expanded to include nuclear weapons and sophisticated technology with military applications if it is to become a more balanced instrument , free of all discriminatory criteria , and to have a more global scope and the highest possible number of participants .  
The International Atomic Energy Agency is continuing its activities and studies in such key areas as : creation of an international nuclear information system ; problems of migration of radionuclide contaminants in soils , forests and lakes ; training for the safe operation and management of nuclear power plants ; radiation monitoring and protection and radioactive waste management ; and reduction of internal radiation doses to the population .  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control , and invites them to keep States Members of the United Nations duly informed of the progress and efforts made ;  
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
As Member States will recall , this paper became a basis for General Assembly resolution 48 / 87 , by which the Assembly , among other things , further adopted a thematic approach to cluster items into 10 broad topics : nuclear weapons ; other weapons of mass destruction ; conventional weapons ; regional disarmament and security ; confidence-building measures , including transparency in armaments ; outer space disarmament aspects ; disarmament machinery ; other disarmament measures ; international security ; and related matters of disarmament and international security .  
In order to rationalize the work of the First Committee , it would be useful to consider issues as groups of items or clusters for instance , nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction ; conventional weapons ; regional disarmament and security ; transparency and confidence-building ; outer space ; reports of multilateral organs ; disarmament machinery and institutional matters ; international security ; and related matters of disarmament and international security .  
Appreciating also the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and acknowledging the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
In the context of nuclear disarmament , it is the indispensable prerequisite for the further advancement of nuclear disarmament , because it is impossible to move forward with the dismantlement of nuclear weapons unless the safe and effective management of resultant fissile material is secured .  
It is to serve as a continuing reminder to the international community of the solemn obligation set out in article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , in which the States parties pledged their commitment to pursue in good faith negotiations on effective measures relating to nuclear disarmament , and of their determined pursuit of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons .  
The Rio Group stands convinced that these treaties will not only strengthen the international non-proliferation regime but will also promote the establishment of other nuclear-weapon-free zones in other parts of the world , which will lead to the gradual expansion of nuclear-weapon-free zones until the ultimate objective of all the States Members of the Organization has been attained a world that is entirely free of nuclear weapons . 
The Movement observed that in his note the Secretary-General expressed the view that weapons of mass destruction continued to be of primary importance despite significant progress achieved to outlaw chemical and biological weapons and to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regimes .  
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
By eliminating the world 's third biggest nuclear arms stock , and by recently signing a number of basic bilateral treaties with its neighbours and the charter on special partnership with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , Ukraine has made an essential contribution to strengthening European and world security , thus having a concrete input in implementing the lofty goals enshrined in the United Nations Charter .  
We make these appeals not as an annual ritual but because of our deep conviction that the elimination of weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , will go a long way to promote international peace and security , a principal purpose for which this Organization was established .  
After the establishment , as we hope , of peace treaties between Israel and every country of the region , it will be possible to create a regional security system that would provide multilateral and shared solutions to the range of security problems in the Middle East , including a mutually and effectively verifiable Middle East free of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles .  
The immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty has repeatedly been identified by the international community as the next major goal for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament efforts , most recently by the parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty which now has more members than the United Nations itself at their first preparatory meeting for the sixth Review Conference in 2000 . 
Today we are witnessing the emergence of new forms of transnational crime : money-laundering or the investment of capital generated by activities that are usually interconnected , including drug-trafficking , corruption , traffic in weapons , terrorism , traffic in nuclear and toxic material , traffic in protected natural resources , traffic in human beings , removal of organs , and more .  
These reform proposals as a whole represent a timely and welcome initiative , given the fact that in today 's world the need has progressively increased for global common action on a number of pressing problems , such as the eradication of poverty , humanitarian emergencies , refugee problems , climate change and desertification , diminishing official development assistance funding , drugs , nuclear disarmament , the implementation of Agenda 21 , democracy and the maintenance of peace and security in various regions of the world .  
However , in spite of some positive developments in the area of arms regulation and disarmament in the past year , we can not be too sanguine about these achievements in the absence of any real or substantial progress made in the area of the further reduction of nuclear weapons leading to their total elimination .  
I must therefore underline that continued and adequate support from all member States for the Agency 's technical cooperation programme is indispensable if one is to realize the atoms for peace vision , which is the dual quest to prevent the spread of a military use of nuclear technology and to facilitate the transfer of nuclear techniques for peaceful purposes . 
And without belittling the value and potential of energy savings and of an expanded use of solar and wind power and biomass , I am also convinced that in the intensifying search for energy sources which produce little or no greenhouse gases , more Governments and broad segments of the general public will rediscover the nuclear power option .  
After extensive work involving inspections , analysis of large volumes of documentation and of information received from Member States and former suppliers of relevant items , the use of new techniques for environmental monitoring , questioning of Iraqi staff and examination of items recovered from excavations , we have been able to construct a technically coherent picture of Iraq 's past nuclear programme and to gain a good understanding of the scope of the achievements of the programme .  
The third measure in the programme of action for implementing article VI of the NPT contained in the decision on principles and objectives relates to the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons as a whole and eventually to eliminate them , and the desire of all States to work for general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
This is a significant complement to the Moscow Nuclear Summit Declaration of April 1996 on the safe and effective management of the fissile material of nuclear weapons identified as being no longer required for national defence purposes .  
Similarly , it continues to be deeply concerned by the fact that to date the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea has not provided the Agency with the information it needs to verify that it has not diverted nuclear material to illicit uses and that its initial declaration is correct and complete .  
While recognizing that the primary responsibility for nuclear safety rests with the respective national Governments , the European Union welcomes the entry into force of this Convention , which was concluded under IAEA auspices and which will strengthen cooperation and mutual assistance in a favourable climate for the development a global nuclear-safety culture . 
For that reason , we reiterate our grave concern at the increasingly frequent transport of radioactive material and nuclear waste through areas of the high seas close to our exclusive economic zone .  
The European Union underlines the importance , as acknowledged in the Principles and Objectives for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament agreed at last year \ x { e5b8 } NPT Review Conference , of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
These should be followed by concrete measures of nuclear disarmament , such as the initiation of negotiations for further deep reductions in strategic nuclear forces , which could be undertaken in a series of phased actions ; dismantlement of weapons that are withdrawn by States and an undertaking not to modernize their weapons ; genuine build-down of nuclear arsenals , an essential component of which would be multilateral monitoring of existing stocks of nuclear warheads ; reduction of operationally deployed nuclear weapons and handing over of the fissile material to multilaterally supervised storage .  
It was a positive contribution by the Court to the realization of the goal of total elimination of nuclear weapons , which must be pursued by the international community if we are to eliminate the possibility of this planet , and all the people on it , being annihilated by these horrendous weapons of mass destruction .  
The application of double standards in the area of non-proliferation and the employment of non-transparent and exclusive export control mechanisms in the areas of nuclear , chemical and biological technology for peaceful uses are most destructive of international confidence and security .  
This initiative proposes that the Conference on Disarmament negotiate a multilateral instrument committing all States to the objective of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons ; an agreement on the steps required in a phased programme with deadlines leading to their total elimination ; and a convention prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive nuclear devices .  
The Union also continues to attach great importance to the third and last measure of the action programme contained in the principles and objectives of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , namely , the determined pursuit by nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce and eventually eliminate all nuclear weapons and to the desire of all States to work for general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
In this context , we would like to emphasize the need for universal adherence to the NPT and for the signing of legally binding conventions to secure the non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or the threat of use of nuclear weapons , as well as to ban fissile materials and to end restrictions on the transfer of nuclear technology , material and equipment for peaceful purposes , which the developing countries need .  
Given that existing global stocks of nuclear arsenals number over 30,000 , with the equivalent explosive force of 200,000 Hiroshima-sized bombs , it is imperative that the international community press on , with unremitting vigour , with the global campaign for a nuclear-weapon-free world .  
Almost two years ago , the International Court of Justice , in a historic Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons , unanimously concluded that States parties to the NPT have the obligation not only to begin but also to bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control .  
General and complete disarmament is now a universal need , and it should be perceived in its original terms , namely , that there is not nor can there be any alternative to the achievement of true nuclear disarmament , which alone can free mankind from apocalypse , ensure security for all and channel nuclear energy to economic and social development by using it exclusively for peaceful means .  
In this connection , and without taking away from steps that have already been or are being taken , we feel that further efforts are needed to promote the emergence of a new approach through the adoption of meaningful measures of nuclear disarmament , which incontrovertibly remains the absolute priority in achieving the goal of general and complete disarmament which the international community set for itself at the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament .  
The quality and level of relations Algeria has developed in this connection in recent years with the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , both in the area of bringing its two experimental and radioisotope-producing nuclear reactors into the safeguards regime and in the area of technological assistance and cooperation , clearly illustrate my country 's decisive commitment to the Agency 's objectives and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy .  
With regard to disarmament , Algeria , the country in its geographical area that devotes the smallest percentage of its gross national product to national defence , fully endorses the basic right of security for all States , whose promotion necessarily entails , first , nuclear disarmament , followed by the elimination of other weapons of mass destruction and ending with the progressive and balanced reduction of conventional weapons at both the global and regional levels .  
The international community has acknowledged the extraordinary foresight of the authors of the Tlatelolco Treaty , who responded , in an intelligent and creative manner , to the challenge posed by the danger of nuclear proliferation by drafting an international legal instrument that has become an inspiration and a model for other countries wishing to establish nuclear-weapon-free zones .  
Egypt also supports the initiative launched by Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Turkmenistan , Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia and encourages full United Nations support for this newly born initiative , in the same manner as the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency supported the African States in the formulation of the Treaty of Pelindaba by assisting the Governments of the region and the Governments concerned to settle the remaining policy and technical issues , thus assisting in advancing the cause of nuclear non-proliferation .  
My delegation wishes to support the proposals put forward in this regard by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at the last substantive session of the Disarmament Commission , which called for the special session to have a wide-ranging agenda highlighting the following : review and evaluation of the current international situation ; nuclear disarmament at the global and regional levels ; elimination of other weapons of mass destruction ; effective reduction of arms and armed forces ; the relationship between disarmament and development ; and confidence-building .  
Article VII of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) and paragraphs 5 , 6 and 7 of the Principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament proclaimed at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the NPT established a sound legal foundation for creating new international nuclear-weapon-free zones on the basis of agreements freely entered into between the appropriate States for the purposes of strengthening peace and security on the global and regional levels .  
My delegation is convinced that internationally recognized nuclear-weapon-free zones , established on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned , are an effective instrument to promote nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament and confidence-building , and thereby help to enhance global and regional peace and security .  
While we consider counterproductive the ambition to expand the geographical frontiers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , and while we attach particular importance to efforts to remove nuclear weapons from the territory of foreign military bases in order to limit nuclear arsenals to the territory of the nuclear States , we are also ready to hold consultations on building a balanced system of relations between Belarus and that important military bloc and to work for political , military and strategic equilibrium with all our partners .  
Past endeavours have also shown that the primary objective of establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones is to seek the absence of nuclear weapons from various parts of the world ; to insulate the zonal States from the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons ; to prevent horizontal as well as vertical proliferation of nuclear weapons , which could pose new and unacceptable threats to the security of States ; to contribute to the process of disarmament , especially nuclear disarmament ; and to facilitate cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy .  
That will be possible only if the Security Council shoulders its full legal and political responsibilities : to defend its resolutions without applying double standards , especially since Israel , as we all know , continues to possess weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , that pose a threat to regional and international peace and security .  
Glaciers are melting ; forests are retreating ; we are changing the seasons ; we are running out of fish in the sea ; we are poisoning our children with persistent organic pollutants ; and we are accumulating nuclear waste to the peril of future generations .  
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
Decides to establish an Ad Hoc Committee , open to all States Members of the United Nations or members of specialized agencies or of the International Atomic Energy Agency , to elaborate an international convention for the suppression of terrorist bombings and , subsequently , an international convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism , to supplement related existing international instruments , and thereafter to address means of further developing a comprehensive legal framework of conventions dealing with international terrorism ;  
Such challenges include the weakening of family ties due partially to spatial mobility ; gradual shifting away from extended to nuclear and more flexible family forms ; an increasing emphasis on individual rather than communitarian social values ; and a redefining of the traditional roles and expectations of individual family members , particularly those of women as caregivers , towards more egalitarian and task-sharing partnerships within the family .  
It is inconceivable to permit fissile materials to be manufactured while nuclear tests are being banned and existing fissile material is being destroyed .  
Fortunately the 1995 Conference of NPT States parties has helped to identify the way forward by adopting the Principles and objectives for non _ proliferation and disarmament , in which the section on Nuclear disarmament sets out the importance to the international community of three specific objectives : the completion of negotiations for a comprehensive test _ ban treaty no later than 1996 ; the immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a fissile material cut _ off treaty ; and systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally .  
This brings me to the third item in the Nuclear disarmament section of the Principles and objectives _ the determined pursuit by the nuclear _ weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goals [ sic ] of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
We are of the view that given the positive global political climate following the end of the cold war , the work of the Conference has assumed even increased significance in that opportunities that did not exist during the period of heightened East _ West tension are now present , both in respect of conventional and , more importantly , nuclear disarmament .  
In most countries with nuclear programmes , the preferred method for the disposal of long-lived radioactive wastes is its long-term isolation in a system of multiple barriers located in deep and stable geological formations .  
In the nuclear area , if we consider the United Nations General Assembly , the venue for the highest expression of international public opinion , I must note that in 1993 , in resolution 48 / 75 L , the Assembly recommended by consensus the negotiation in the most appropriate forum of a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for the manufacture of nuclear weapons .  
Trying to evade the cut _ off negotiations , which constitute an essential stage , would mean remaining at the stage of declamatory phrases or placing oneself in the final perspective of nuclear disarmament in the framework of general and complete disarmament : in either case , no concrete progress can be expected in the near future .  
The first was the signing at Cairo of the African Nuclear _ Weapon _ Free Zone Treaty as a testimony to the developing countries ' commitment to the cause of nuclear disarmament worldwide and also as a positive and encouraging step which should be followed soon by the negotiation of the establishment of another zone in the Middle East in conformity with the relevant United Nations General Assembly resolutions and as a step towards the implementation of President Mubarak 's proposal concerning the establishment of a zone free from all weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East .  
Adopting all necessary legislative , administrative and technical measures to ensure the physical protection of nuclear material , nuclear fuel , radioactive products or waste , radioactive substances , nuclear installations and nuclear devices as well as protection against illegal or unauthorized access to them by third parties .  
Upon the completion of the proceedings connected with an act of nuclear terrorism , if it is considered feasible , any nuclear material , nuclear fuel , radioactive products or waste or any other radioactive substances as well as nuclear installations , nuclear explosive or radiation-dissemination devices , including homemade devices and / or their components or objects of which they are components shall be returned to the State party , to which they belong or which was the State of their origin .  
States parties shall not be required by this Convention to provide any information which they are not permitted to communicate pursuant to domestic legislation or which would jeopardize the security of the State concerned or the physical protection of nuclear material , nuclear fuel , radioactive products or waste , radioactive substances , nuclear installations , nuclear devices or their components or objects of which they are components .  
Reference is made to the sequential listing therein of three objectives under a Nuclear disarmament heading : the CTBT , the fissile materials convention , and the determined pursuit by the nuclear _ weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control . upon the prior attainment of the fissile materials production ban ? 
Although national legislation on the protection of the environment has been enacted in many countries , statutory provisions dealing with the protection of the environment were mostly spread through a whole array of legislation and regulations , mainly focusing on hazardous waste , water , soil and air pollution , trafficking in endangered species of flora and fauna , noise pollution and trafficking in nuclear substances , and contained in the various laws on these issues .  
However , to combat crimes involving , in particular , illegal trafficking in hazardous and nuclear substances and endangered species , criminal law should be used as the primary tool , since penal sanctions , by criminalizing a certain behaviour with a corresponding penalty , have a greater deterrent effect .  
Many of us believe that a multilateral , effectively verifiable treaty to prohibit the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices will constitute a prerequisite step in the way towards a nuclear _ weapon _ free world .  
As the embodiment of the world community 's conscience and the sole recognized multilateral negotiating forum on disarmament , this Conference not only shoulders the primary responsibility for finding ways and means to really deal with the problem , but is also the most appropriate venue to commence the negotiations on a universal , effectively verifiable and legally binding multilateral treaty regulating the development , production , stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons and their destruction .  
In most countries with nuclear programmes , the preferred method for the disposal of long-lived radioactive waste is its long-term isolation in a system of multiple barriers located in deep and stable geological formations .  
Many representatives noted that the topic involved mainly activities typical of modern industrial societies , such as those connected with nuclear power plants , the chemical and space industries and maritime transport of petroleum and other dangerous or polluting substances , which certainly had undeniable political and economic value , but also posed a considerable risk for the safety of human beings and protection of the environment . 
That delegation also expressed the view that the safety of those spacecraft at all stages of their operation and in the event of foreseeable accidents would be ensured by safety systems and nuclear power source structural elements designed to meet safety requirements and by special comprehensive administrative and technical measures to prevent accidents and eliminate the effects of accidents .  
Turkey considered that such a convention should also include organized transnational crimes committed in the perpetration of or linked to terrorist acts and illicit trafficking in firearms , in chemical and nuclear materials and in children and other persons .  24 .  The United States noted that Member States had not had sufficient time to discuss the question of the elaboration of an international convention against organized crime and to exchange their views on the issue .  
Concerned with the growing threat of organized crime , including the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , money-laundering , illicit traffic in arms , nuclear material and explosive devices , motor vehicles , objects of art ,  
In addition , the mechanism of nuclear _ free zones has established an entire system of agreements which also provide , in a regional context , of course , for assurances set forth in specific legal instruments .  
My delegation is not convinced that a blueprint or a timetable for the achievement of the ultimate goal in nuclear disarmament would be more conducive to , or for that matter a viable alternative to , the existing bilateral reductions in nuclear arsenals .  
Having accomplished its work on the CTBT , the CD must continue to play its role in non _ proliferation and nuclear disarmament by starting , without further delay , its overdue work on a treaty to prohibit the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , otherwise referred to as the cut _ off convention ( FMCT ) .  
On a multilateral level , the next logical step is for the CD to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator dated 24 March 1995 and contained in document CD / 1299 , and the mandate contained therein .  
We strongly agree with an eloquent remark by Italian Ambassador Balboni Acqua during his statement last Thursday : It is inconceivable to permit fissile materials to be manufactured while nuclear tests are being banned and existing fissile material is being destroyed .  
The use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel-air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium , like the dumping of other toxic and dangerous chemicals and wastes in the developing countries , violates the rights to life , health , physical security and other human rights , such as economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development .  
In the Middle East , the Palestinian people and the Arab population in the Syrian Golan , southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley continue to face serious environmental dangers as a result of the continued Israeli occupation of their territories and the growing military threat posed by nuclear , chemical and bacteriological weapons .  
Moreover , the countless emerging transnational issues , such as environmental protection , sustainable development , non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , prevention of drug trafficking and abuse , overpopulation in cities , payment of debts , eradication of poverty and protection of intellectual property rights , need to be addressed from a global perspective .  
I urge each of you to consider the reinforcing impact that an FMCT would have on parallel efforts to dismantle nuclear warheads , to place fissile material that is determined to be excess to national security requirements under safeguards , and to achieve even deeper nuclear weapons reductions leading toward their eventual elimination .  
In looking ahead toward post _ START III negotiations , nuclear arms reductions would be far more difficult without a ban on new fissile material production for weapons embodied in a treaty that provides confidence that the international community would detect clandestine production .  
The programme translated the goal of eliminating all nuclear weapons from a rhetorical objective into actual reality , setting forth requirements in terms of active efforts to identify specific measures for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons within a well-defined time-frame and under effective international control pending the achievement of the desired goals through negotiation .  
Against the backdrop of the end of the cold war and the diminished possibility of global nuclear confrontation , the Board discussed the security consequences of economic globalization , the lessening of the importance of national boundaries and the increase in intra-State conflict and illicit trafficking in small arms and other criminal activities .  
We also wish to stress the need for a highly developed international surveillance , verification and safety system , to be implemented by a specialized body associated with the International Atomic Energy Agency and applying the safeguards of the European Atomic Energy Community ( EURATOM ) , following the declaration of all stocks of fissile materials in the facilities of nuclear-weapon States and States with advanced nuclear programmes with a view to determining the fate of fissile materials stemming from the dismantling of nuclear weapons and nuclear explosive devices or as yet unused materials .  
I will not recall here the scale of the guarantees already afforded by my country , whether they be positive or negative , in the latter case through the relevant protocols to treaties establishing nuclear _ weapon _ free zones which have all been ratified by France , which therefore cover more than 100 countries , but as far as the Conference on Disarmament is concerned , the question was more simply whether an ad hoc committee on security assurances with a mandate drawn up in 1992 was still the order of the day .  
For our part , I can confirm that the United Kingdom would like to see the agenda of the Conference on Disarmament reflect our key priorities on the disarmament agenda , and for the record I confirm that on the nuclear side , our top priority is the urgent negotiation and conclusion of a fissile material cut _ off treaty , and on the conventional side , our top priority is to work towards the global ban on APLs to complement the Ottawa treaty , which we hope will be opened for signature this December . 
In our view , and as envisaged in the Register 's founding resolution ( General Assembly resolution 46 / 36 L ) , an expanded Register including data on advanced conventional weapons , on weapons of mass destruction , particularly nuclear weapons , and on high technology with military applications would represent a more balanced , more comprehensive and less discriminatory instrument attracting a larger number of regular participants . 
Recalling further its resolution 1996 / 16 , in which it requested the Secretary _ General to submit a report on information gathered on the use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel _ air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium and their consequential and cumulative effects and the danger they represent to life , physical security and other human rights ,  
Striking a balance of information priorities continued to be a problem in the work of the United Nations : there was too much emphasis on the technological aspects of the consequences of the accident , the question of nuclear power plant safety and concern for the future of the nuclear power industry , with less attention devoted to the medical and environmental repercussions of the disaster , the main burden of which was borne by Belarus .  
At the 770th plenary meeting on 26 June 1997 , the delegation of Germany , drawing on earlier statements of several representatives of other Member States , proposed the reestablishment of the Ad Hoc Committee on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator on this subject and the mandate contained therein ( CD / 1299 ) . 
We heard one such unfortunate remark at last week 's plenary when it was asserted that the five declared nuclear Powers want the CD to discuss only small items such as anti _ personnel landmines and a fissile material cut _ off treaty .  
By this all or nothing approach practised in the CD this year , concrete progress on specific and timely issues , issues ripe for multilateral negotiation , was held hostage to demands for an agreement to negotiate multilaterally nuclear disarmament in a time _ bound framework .  
The threats posed by weapons of mass destruction are far from being extinguished , and the consequences of miscalculation or deliberate acts can be horrific , as we know from the terrorist activities of a cult group armed with nerve gas in Japan , biological and toxin weapons in Iraq and persistent reports and risks of nuclear smuggling .  
We continue to be concerned at the threat to the fragile marine environment posed by the regular shipment of nuclear and other hazardous waste through the Caribbean Sea .  
This is of the utmost importance in order to send a strong and timely signal to the international community that nuclear non-proliferation and efficient legal commitments thereto have to be seen as a crucial element of global security .  
We also support IAEA activities to put a halt to illegal trafficking in nuclear materials and activities aimed at increasing the level of physical protection and developing national systems for the inventory and verification of nuclear materials .  
A universal and legally binding multilateral agreement , committed to the objective of total elimination of nuclear weapons , could be taken up , as also the convention on the prohibition of the production of fissile material .  
It is inconceivable to permit fissile materials to be manufactured while nuclear tests are being banned and existing fissile material is being destroyed .  
Looking forward to when we come to the practical realization of the ultimate goal of the elimination of nuclear weapons , multilateral negotiations on an international agreement on the subject will obviously also become essential .  
The unlawful acts committed in respect of all materials or items covered by the current draft also include unlawful acts committed in respect of nuclear material in peaceful use the subject matter covered by the Physical Protection Convention .  
We are aware of an existing view that the cut _ off of future fissile material production is a non-proliferation issue unrelated to nuclear disarmament .  
We have identified nuclear disarmament and FMCT as national priorities , although we recognize that moving these issues forward will require careful and deliberate thinking .  
To them the end of the cold war simply dictated changes in the positioning of strategic and tactical nuclear weapons and the taking of steps to develop new nuclear-weapon systems to meet the geopolitical requirements of the new international system .  
Develop a cooperation programme to address the concerns raised by maritime transport of nuclear and other waste , and to cooperate and coordinate in the relevant international fora to strengthen standards governing such transport and its safety .  
In this respect nuclear disarmament remains an inescapable objective , as the international community decided 20 years ago , one which is itself an integral component of general and complete disarmament .  
As a first step towards that objective , measures should be pursued that would enhance the transparency in surplus fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices in parallel with a fissile material cut-off treaty .  
In its advisory opinion , the Court ruled that the threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the international law applicable to armed conflict and , in particular , the principles and rules of humanitarian law .  
An FMCT is , strictly speaking , not in itself an instrument of disarmament since no single warhead will be dismantled because of it , and the quantity of fissile material available for nuclear arms will be frozen at its current level .  
Once an FMCT has been adopted , there would be a reasonable chance that the main nuclear _ weapon States would commit themselves voluntarily to placing irreversible fissile material transferred from military uses to civilian ones under full IAEA safeguards .  
It is valid only until nuclear disarmament is achieved , and resolute , systematic and progressive efforts towards the final objective of eliminating nuclear weapons worldwide are of crucial importance to it .  
What is being sought is for the international community , represented by the Conference on Disarmament and the NPT , to have focused deliberations on the practical steps for systematic and progressive efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons .  
It tries to make the discussions at the fissile material negotiations , to take place in Geneva , more meaningful and more fruitful , eventually leading , I hope soon , to a complete , effective , integrated system based on the total elimination of nuclear weapons .  
In response to specific concerns raised in chapter 17 of Agenda 21 , the IMO secretariat and its governing bodies have undertaken a number of new or expanded initiatives with respect to prevention of air pollution from ships ; new special sea areas and particularly sensitive sea areas ; irradiated nuclear fuel on board ships ; traffic separation schemes and mandatory ship-reporting systems ; port State control ; and the preparation of measures against tributyltin-based anti-fouling paints for ships .  
The Chinese delegation supports the re _ establishment of an ad hoc committee on the basis of the mandate contained in the Shannon report to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices in accordance with United Nations General Assembly resolution 48 / 75 L . 
Almost a month ago the Italian Under _ Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs , Ms . Patrizia Toia , speaking before the Conference , formulated an urgent request for the immediate re _ establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
In this regard it may be necessary to develop a separate set of verification methods and procedures that will enhance international confidence that fissile material subject to control is not returned to nuclear _ weapons programmes , while at the same time ensuring that the inspectors do not gain access to classified information .  
It is imperative that we should not wait for the end of negotiations on a fissile material treaty , the duration of which is hardly predictable at this stage , to start considering the next steps pursuant to article VI and its corollary , that is , the third commitment in the Principles and objectives document , which foresees systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons .  
There is an enormous annual turnover in markets for illegal goods , such as illegal drugs , protected wildlife , stolen works of art , illegal firearms , and nuclear and / or toxic waste , as well as for trafficking in human beings .  
There was no point in speaking of sustainable development when some countries members of the Forum faced the prospect of being submerged by the sea in the not too distant future , and atolls were being polluted by nuclear tests .  
His country therefore welcomed the outcome of the intensive negotiations held in September and October 1998 and was convinced that the current draft convention represented a positive development with respect to the international communitys endeavours to prepare a universally accepted instrument to curb or eliminate the threat of nuclear terrorism .  There were , however , a number of issues that needed to be clarified and settled .  
the substantive discussion of nuclear disarmament issues through which the international community can be better informed on a continuing basis , can express its views as to the process , and can identify issues which might be subject to multilateral negotiations .  
To re-establish , for the duration of its 1999 session , the Ad hoc Committee under item 1 of the agenda entitled " Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament " to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Also in August last year , the Conference on Disarmament established an ad hoc committee under item 1 of its agenda , to negotiate a ' non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ' .  
The situation of deadlock in which the Conference finds itself now in connection with procedural or organizational issues , which , it is true , have a very important relationship to the substantive consideration of the topics falling within the competence of the Conference , regrettably have a negative impact on its credibility , in which the international community has vested its confidence so that it will consider issues of disarmament and nuclear disarmament in particular . 
It was a timely initiative , particularly in the light of the growing threat of the use of nuclear or radioactive material by irresponsible individuals or groups .  
Thirdly , the provisions of article 4 , especially those exempting from the scope of the draft convention activities of armed forces [ of a State ] during an armed conflict , were used to sustain a questionable exception which had the effect of recognizing an alleged right of such forces to use and traffic in nuclear or radioactive material , on the pretext of the exercise of official duties and inasmuch as [ such activities ] are governed by ( . . . ) international law .  
Canada indicated in its statement of March 18 , 1999 , concerning the negotiation of a " non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices " its considered view as to how the issue of fissile material stockpiles should be addressed by those states possessing such stockpiles .  
We are all aware that it is not easy to combine differing viewpoints in a single package , but when we recall the current nuclear arms race and the massive stockpiles of nuclear arsenals with all the dangers that they entail , this should induce us to appeal to the international forums specialized in the field of disarmament to place this issue on their list of priorities and to apply its criteria thereto in a comprehensive manner and without any exception .  
We have however set forward these views , given our strong commitment to the achievement of a viable , effective and credible treaty which must reinforce the international nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation regime .  
In view of the fact that the two types of weapons of mass destruction of biological and chemical weapons have been comprehensively prohibited , there is no reason why nuclear weapons , which are of greater destructive force , should not be comprehensively banned and thoroughly destroyed .  
The research , development , deployment and proliferation of sophisticated anti _ missile systems and the revision of , or even withdrawal from , the existing disarmament treaties on which global strategic equilibrium hinges will inevitably exert an extensive negative impact on international security and stability and trigger a new round of the arms race in new areas , thereby seriously obstructing or neutralizing international efforts of nuclear disarmament and nuclear non _ proliferation .  
The view was also expressed that the scientific and technical aspects of the use of nuclear power sources in outer space should be studied in order to develop further the legal issues involved , especially in relation to collisions between nuclear-powered objects and space debris .  
The programme budget for the biennium 19961997 , as approved by the General Assembly , stated that the efforts of the international community were still focused on weapons of mass destruction , particularly nuclear ones , but were becoming increasingly concerned with the growth and proliferation of various types of conventional weapons ( A / 50 / 6 / Rev . 1,3 para .  2.81 ) .  The programme budget for the biennium 19981999 maintains the same approach .  
The readiness demonstrated by the Arab States to take practical steps towards the establishment of an effectively verifiable Middle East zone free from all weapons of mass destruction - nuclear , chemical and biological - and to refrain from taking any measures that preclude the achievement of this objective in accordance with paragraph 5 of the 1995 resolution on the Middle East as well as paragraph 14 of Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) should not go unnoticed .  
To re-establish , under item 1 of the agenda entitled " Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament " , the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
According to that paragraph , the Conference would decide to re _ establish , under item 1 of the agenda , entitled Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament , the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Reaffirmation that new supply arrangements for the transfer of sources or special fissionable material or equipment or material specially designed or prepared for the processing , use or production of special fissionable material to non-nuclear-weapon states should require as a necessary precondition , acceptance of IAEA full-scope safeguards and internationally legally binding commitments not to acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .

Despite the cross _ regional support for such a mechanism , despite the assurances that its deliberations on nuclear disarmament would not impinge on the bilateral nuclear disarmament process , despite the safeguards provided by the rule of consensus in the CD and despite a continual lowering of ambitions in relation to the scope of work on nuclear disarmament , a consensus has not so far proved attainable .  
Thirdly , the adoption of a renewed Strategic Concept by a regional military alliance _ despite the declared end of the cold war _ is bound to generate considerable concern in the wide spectrum of nuclear and non _ nuclear States .  
This , I presume , will require a balanced approach , susceptible to reconciling enlightened pragmatism with the ideals that have inspired the creation of this forum _ first and foremost , the achievement of a nuclear _ weapon _ free world in the not _ so _ distant future .  
There is an intrinsic interrelationship between strategic offensive weapons and strategic defensive weapons , one laid down in the ABM Treaty itself in the form of a clear understanding that , given parity in terms of strategic offensive weapons , the emergence of strategic means of defence in the hands of one of the parties would be equivalent to an increase in the power of a pre _ emptive nuclear strike .  
Nevertheless , the treaty has established a legal framework for the resolve of the international community to halt all explosive nuclear testing and an appropriate basis for its appeal to all countries to commit themselves not just to a narrow literal interpretation of the provisions of the Treaty but to its substance and spirit .  
Its membership has been growing day by day and civil society has begun to identify with it as a solid basis for the hope that nuclear disarmament efforts may prove successful in the future if they take the form of firm , practical and effective steps , as reflected in General Assembly resolution 53 / 77 Y .  
This process was very complicated from both the legal and technical perspectives and required a lot of resources and international assistance , so for us it seems disgraceful and unjust that in the context of mentioning countries which have abandoned their military nuclear programmes or forsworn nuclear weapons the name of our country is sometimes not even found .  
Fifty years ago the ban on the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons was supposed to be the real tool in preventing the nuclear arms race , which had been unleashed between the two antagonistic super _ Powers .  
Following the end of cold war , the United Nations has been called upon to take up new challenges and tasks as a result of the growing threat from the existence of large stockpiles of nuclear weapons , proposals for ballistic missile defences and the weaponization of outer space , the lack of progress in the field of disarmament , the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the development and use of advanced and sophisticated conventional arms ;  
In various international forums , Cuba has expressed its unequivocal position in favour of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons and has taken action , both in the Conference on Disarmament , the sole multinational forum for negotiation on disarmament , and in the General Assembly of the United Nations , with a view to attaining that objective .  
Mexico remains convinced that it is incumbent on all States to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control as provided in resolution 53 / 77 W entitled Follow-up to the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons adopted on 4 December 1998 by the General Assembly of the United Nations at its fifty-third session . 
Another fundamental international legal instrument elaborated by the CD is the CTBT , a treaty which was a long _ sought objective of the international community and which is supposed to block any further qualitative development of nuclear weapons .  
It is with this in mind that I have requested the floor today to outline some elements South Africa regards as politically achievable and technically feasible in obtaining an effective , credible and workable fissile material treaty that would reinforce the nuclear disarmament and non _ proliferation regime .  
In its exchange , the Board took the following four elements into account : the current deadlock concerning disarmament of strategic nuclear weapons made it all the more important and timely to discuss tactical nuclear weapons ; such weapons were still not being addressed by any negotiating process ; they were present in large numbers ; and they posed specific problems in terms of the doctrines concerning their use .  
Ambassador Moher arrived four years ago , at a crucial time , when the negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear test _ ban treaty were entering their final stage , and he injected into our deliberations a remarkable blend of deep knowledge of the issues under negotiation , an ingredient of iron _ clad logic and a special ability to build bridges between opposing views .  
Allow me also to express the hope that this recently adopted decision will constitute a spur to promote the work of the Conference on Disarmament and afford us a real opportunity to share with the five new members the arduous work which the international community expects of us in negotiating multilateral disarmament treaties with particular attention to the objective of achieving a world which is free of nuclear weapons .  
The re _ establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate , on the basis of the report by the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices .  
At this critical juncture , the Nagasaki conference considered , inter alia , how to prevent further proliferation of nuclear weapons capability ; how to improve and strengthen the existing nuclear non-proliferation regime ; the multilateral approach towards nuclear disarmament and the eventual abolition of nuclear weapons ; immediate priorities to avoid accidental nuclear war ; how to promote nuclear disarmament and practical steps to that end ; and national and regional security today .  
The European Union has expressed support for the creation of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East , and emphasized the importance of additional protocols to safeguards agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency as an effective measure to prevent nuclear proliferation and foster mutual confidence .  
The recommended doctrine confirms India 's craving to be recognized as a global Power - not by acting as a responsible member of the international community but through nuclear and conventional militarization and aggressive actions .  
During the preparatory process for the Conference to review the Non _ Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) , scheduled for the year 2000 , we have seen with concern the increasing lack of political understanding between the parties _ nuclear States and non _ nuclear States _ to the said Treaty as to how to progress in a manner which is effective and satisfactory for all the interested parties towards the securing of the ultimate objectives of the NPT .  
The Agency noted moreover that one of the major objectives of the physical protection activities is to convey a basic understanding of the need to protect nuclear materials and of the tools necessary for developing and operating a national physical protection system .  
As of January 1997 , under the technical cooperation project entitled Legislative Assistance for the Utilization of Nuclear Energy , IAEA has been supporting countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the newly independent States in their national efforts to establish , develop or review the national laws governing the safe and peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to adopt implementing legislation for the international instruments to which they have adhered .  
The project is being extended to 2001 to accommodate the increased demand for legislative assistance as a result of a comprehensive review by the Governments of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the newly independent States of their nuclear legislation and regulations , including non-proliferation and physical protection of nuclear material and facilities .  
The Agency also reported that a new technical cooperation project had been initiated , entitled Physical Protection and Security of Nuclear Materials , designed to increase the national capacity in countries of Central and Eastern Europe for the physical protection of nuclear installations and nuclear materials , as well as for the prevention of illicit trafficking in radioactive materials .  
The " report " kept silent about complete abolition of nuclear weapons , the key issue of nuclear disarmament , but impudently raised the nuclear and missile issues of some countries pursuing self-defense in the face of outsiders ' constant threats , and even provoked United Nations bodies including the Geneva Conference on Disarmament .  
The European Union believes that a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable fissile material cut _ off treaty constitutes , after the CTBT , a major step towards the achievement of both the nuclear non _ proliferation and nuclear disarmament objectives envisaged in the NPT document on principles and objectives .  
But I will repeat one clear and uncontested truth : a cut _ off treaty will make a substantial , vital and practical contribution to advancing the goal of global nuclear disarmament .  
Mr . President , even at this late stage , Pakistan is committed to pursuing contacts and consultations with all the members of the international community in order to evolve a broadly agreed approach to deal with the threats to regional and global peace and security emerging from Indias political and military ambitions as revealed in its nuclear doctrine .  
First , the re _ establishment of the ad hoc committee under agenda item 1 to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices ;  
Guided by the desire to contribute , in its own way , to the cause of nuclear non-proliferation , and in line with its foreign policy aimed at contributing to regional peace and security , as well as ensuring the country 's national security by political and diplomatic means , in 1992 , Mongolia declared its territory a nuclear-weapon-free zone . 
India has also supported under Conference agenda item 1 the establishment of an ad hoc committee which shall negotiate , on the basis of the report of the special coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
The two sides further undertake to notify each other immediately in the event of any accidental , unauthorized or unexplained incident that could create the risk of fallout with adverse consequences for both sides , or an outbreak of a nuclear war between the two countries , as well as to adopt measures aimed at diminishing the possibility of such actions , or of such incidents being misrepresented by the other .  
From the IAEA perspective , the universal application of strengthened safeguards , and effective verification of compliance with agreements to eliminate existing nuclear arsenals , would provide a sound basis for verifying a world free from nuclear weapons .  
Moreover , Mexico has promoted the initiatives included in resolution 53 / 77 Y at both the regional and international levels , especially those intended to underline the extreme urgency of initiating negotiations on nuclear disarmament and the adoption of a consistent action programme that will lead us to a world free of nuclear weapons .  
Recalls the decision by the Conference on Disarmament2 to establish , under item 1 of its agenda entitled Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament , an ad hoc committee which shall negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator3 and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ;

Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ;  
The intensive negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on and their early conclusion of a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator in 1995 and the mandate contained therein , and , pending its entry into force , a moratorium of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons ;  
Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons , notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile materials , and calls for continued efforts by States that possess fissile material no longer required for defence purposes to make such material available for safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) as soon as practicable ;  
The General Conference urged Member States to share information with the Secretariat regarding diagnostic and corrective actions being planned or implemented by operating and regulatory organizations at their nuclear power plants , fuel cycle and / or medical facilities which use radioactive materials to make those facilities Year 2000 ready .  
The General Conference encouraged the Secretariat , within existing resources , to act as a clearing house and central point of contact for Member States to exchange information regarding diagnostic and remediation actions being taken at nuclear power plants , fuel cycle and / or medical facilities which use radioactive materials to make these facilities Year 2000 ready .  
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ;  
Intensive negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on the early conclusion of a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator in 199532 and the mandate contained therein , and , pending its entry into force , a moratorium on the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons ;  
Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons , notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile material , and calls for continued efforts by States that possess fissile material no longer required for defence purposes to make such material available for safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency as soon as practicable ;  
Stressing that the international community must not enter the new millennium with the prospect that the possession of nuclear weapons will be considered legitimate for the indefinite future , and convinced of the imperative to proceed with determination to prohibit and eradicate them for all time ,  
Emphasizing that , for the total elimination of nuclear weapons to be achieved , effective international cooperation to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons is vital and must be enhanced through , inter alia , the extension of international controls over all fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ,  
Recalling the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons , issued on 8 July 1996,91 and welcoming the unanimous reaffirmation by all Judges of the Court that there exists an obligation for all States to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control ,  
The Panel finds that expenses relating to activation of the nuclear and radiological emergency plan are , in principle , compensable as reasonable precautionary and preventative measures to protect against a potential spillover effect from Iraqs military operations against the Israeli nuclear reactor .  However , the evidence is insufficient to enable the Panel to verify the claim .  
It was observed that the draft convention was an important complement to the existing anti-terrorist conventions , providing an effective legal framework for combating and discouraging acts of nuclear terrorism , which posed a real threat to the maintenance of international peace and security .  
Meanwhile , short - and medium-term measures include confidence-building at the regional and global levels , transparency in the field of armaments , a steady reduction of military expenditures , the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in the interim .  
This policy has also included the organization and support of armed groups ; air and naval raids against our territory ; the hatching of over 600 plots to assassinate the leader of our revolution ; a military invasion by a mercenary army ; the most serious threat ever of a global nuclear conflict , in October 1962 ; and finally , a brutal commercial and financial blockade and a ferocious economic war against my country that have now lasted 40 years .  
To this must be added the growing number of hotbeds of tension and conflict between and within States , the growing risk of outbreaks of ethnic , tribal and sectarian conflicts , greater risks of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , especially nuclear weapons , increased stockpiles of conventional weapons and the growth of terrorism as an international phenomenon that threatens democracy , human rights and international peace and security .  
These include effective export control , adequate physical protection of nuclear material and facilities , accelerated steps towards nuclear disarmament and an appropriate arrangement for global and regional security .  
For a considerable time , the European Union has steadfastly supported the commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a multilateral and internationally binding treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
The activities of the Agency in that area have been strengthened by the adoption of additional standards for the safe management and transportation of radioactive waste and for the security of nuclear power stations , which were approved by the Board of Governors , as well as by the adoption of resolutions in the General Conference on the radiological protection of patients , the safety of transport of radioactive materials and the security of radiation sources .  
The Agencys efforts in improving physical protection guidelines and assisting States in implementing effective physical protection systems at the national and facility levels serve as major steps towards better control of illicit trafficking in nuclear material .  
Regardless of its considerable benefits , nuclear energy is still problematic in one particular aspect : spent fuel and nuclear waste , its interim storage and final repository , especially in small States with limited industrial and scientific capabilities .  
However , the full knowledge of the advantages of nuclear energy and of the economic and social situation of most countries , in particular of the developing countries , has not prevented some developed countries from maintaining attitudes counter to the objectives of the IAEA trying to cut technical assistance programmes , decreasing their contributions to the fund created for such purposes or selectively putting conditions on the funds use .  
This , however , has not prevented us from taking concrete steps that demonstrate our clear desire for peace and general and complete disarmament , as well as demonstrating the transparency and peaceful nature of the nuclear programme we are developing.I have the honour to report to the plenary Assembly that last month Cuba signed a protocol additional to the safeguards agreements that it entered into on a voluntary basis with the IAEA .  
On the occasion of the signing we were able to show him some of the progress we have made and reiterate our political will to work for a strengthened , effective and efficient safeguards system , based on an equitable regime that will lead to the total elimination of nuclear weapons .  
The declared objective of the Convention is the achievement and preservation worldwide of a high level of nuclear safety through increased implementation of national measures and international cooperation .  
As we approach the new millennium , Egypt hopes that international efforts will be directed steadfastly towards the liquidation of established military arsenals , the implementation and universality of disarmament agreements and the achievement of their ultimate goal , which is the welfare of humankind and the provision of a safer world for future generations , a world free of nuclear risks and environmental threats .  
It is encouraging to note that the Agencys role in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy now covers areas ranging from power generation to a diverse array of industrial , medical and agricultural applications .  
In the context of nuclear energy development , Russia considers the reduction and disposal of nuclear armaments to be connected with the peaceful use of the tremendous scientific and technological potential that used to be the exclusive domain of military programmes .  
Without denying the importance of developing renewable power sources , we should admit that at present the only realistic industrial-scale solution to this problem is to intensify efforts to develop a safe , environmentally acceptable and economically attractive nuclear power sector.Will the nuclear power industry be equal to a task of this magnitude ?  
It plays a vital role in maintaining global nuclear non-proliferation and security through the operation of the nuclear safeguards system and in areas such as illicit trafficking of nuclear materials and the management of surplus fissile material from dismantled weapons . 
Encouraging increasing numbers of States committed to non-proliferation to sign additional protocols would serve two purposes : first , to subject the portion of the worlds nuclear fuel cycle currently under the Agencys comprehensive safeguards to a further strengthened system of safeguards and , secondly , to exert requisite influence on the States that are prone to pursuing undeclared nuclear activities , with a view to their eventual adoption of this new form .  
The Republic of Belarus notes with satisfaction the multifaceted , fruitful and useful activities of the IAEA , a unique international organization that brings together the efforts of Member States to ensure the effective and safe use of the achievements of nuclear science and technology for the good of humankind in the spirit of the lofty United Nations principles of humanism . 
In Syria we look forward to a Middle East region where a just , lasting and comprehensive peace prevails , a peace based on international legality , not on expansion , occupation and the monopoly of nuclear military power , which can only lead to increased tension in the Middle East .  
By the same token , my delegation abstained in the separate vote on the third preambular paragraph , as we have done in corresponding cases in previous years , because it is our view that the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes is an inalienable right of all States and therefore can not be made conditional on whether or not one is a party to certain international treaties .  
This year such issues include the dumping of nuclear waste and other toxic substances , the regional seas programme of the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , the increasing threat to shipping from piracy and armed robbery at sea , the importance of enhancing the safety of navigation and the continued work of the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization towards a convention on the protection of the underwater cultural heritage .  
Motivated by the need to protect the health and safety or our population and our environment , we believe that these efforts should continue , thus promoting the adoption of mechanisms that will provide sufficient guarantees to all the States concerned that the strictest safety measures will be applied in the international maritime transport of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel , and that any damage resulting from accidents in connection with such operations will be made good .  
For the island States , whether in the Caribbean or the Pacific , the international maritime transportation of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuels is a real security threat , all the more serious because most of those potentially affected are small countries lacking the resources to cope with a crisis of such magnitude , caused by big countries and by technologies that those small countries do not control .  
The delegation of India highlighted in the First Committee last year the fact that , with the end of the cold war more than a decade ago , there is no justification for thousands of nuclear weapons being maintained in a state of hair-trigger alert , creating unacceptable risks of unintentional or accidental use of nuclear weapons .  
The draft resolution is also silent on the current impasse in the Conference on Disarmament due to the inflexibility shown by a few delegations on the questions of nuclear disarmament and outer space , ignoring the express wishes of the vast majority of its members , which support the commencement of substantive negotiations as part of a balanced and comprehensive programme of work .  
Although my delegation also shares the objective of the total elimination of nuclear weapons and the need to work for a nuclear-weapon-free world , we remain unconvinced of the utility of an exercise bound by the flawed and discriminatory approaches of the NPT .  
This shows not only our deep understanding of the importance of this Treaty , but also our desire to make a real contribution towards resolving the problems of nuclear non-proliferation , improving the ecological condition of the planet and strengthening global security and regional stability .  
In the Conference on Disarmament my country will advocate the prompt initiation of negotiations on a non-discriminatory , multilateral , effective and internationally verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices , the cut-off treaty , taking into account the objectives of non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament .  
As we approach the end of this century , which surely will be remembered as the one in which mankind developed and used its most powerful weapon yet , the nuclear weapon , we must lay the foundation for a new collective consciousness directed towards the quest for peace and security by means other than armed confrontation , and give thought to the realities and contradictions involved in the disarmament process .  
Recognizing further that the use of nuclear power sources in outer space should be based on a thorough safety assessment , including probabilistic risk analysis , with particular emphasis on reducing the risk of accidental exposure of the public to harmful radiation or radioactive material ,  
For the purposes of paragraph 2 ( d ) of principle 3 , the term made critical does not include actions such as zero-power testing which are fundamental to ensuring system safety.In order to minimize the quantity of radioactive material in space and the risks involved , the use of nuclear power sources in outer space shall be restricted to those space missions which can not be operated by non-nuclear energy sources in a reasonable way .  
A launching State as defined in principle 2 , paragraph 1 , at the time of launch shall , prior to the launch , through cooperative arrangements , where relevant , with those which have designed , constructed or manufactured the nuclear power sources , or will operate the space object , or from whose territory or facility such an object will be launched , ensure that a thorough and comprehensive safety assessment is conducted .  
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure the non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
The advisory opinion also emphasized that the threat or use of nuclear weapons is generally contrary to the requirements of international law applicable in armed conflict , particularly those of the principles and rules of international humanitarian law .  
In spite of our unflinching commitment to the provisions of the NPT and repeated calls over the years to be assured , through a legally binding international instrument , against the threat or use of nuclear weapons by our powerful partners , their response has not been at all reassuring .  
Together , we must seek the objective of non-proliferation from all aspects , with a view to ensuring that the Treaty will become a true international tool for effective nuclear disarmament as well as a solid foundation for more productive international cooperation on the utilization of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes on a non-discriminatory basis , and within the context of a system of recognized international guarantees .  
In this respect , my delegation commends the timely advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice which asserts that the threat or use of nuclear weapons is generally contrary to the rules of international humanitarian law applicable to armed conflicts .  
Welcomes the decision by the Conference on Disarmament32 to establish , under item 1 of its agenda entitled Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament , an ad hoc committee which shall negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator 33 ] and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ;  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ;  
Recalling the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons , issued on 8 July 1996 , 25 and welcoming the unanimous reaffirmation by all Judges of the Court that there exists an obligation for all States to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control ,  
Stressing that the international community must not enter the third millennium with the prospect that the possession of nuclear weapons will be considered legitimate for the indefinite future , and convinced that the present juncture provides a unique opportunity to proceed to prohibit and eradicate them for all time ,  
Emphasizing that , for the total elimination of nuclear weapons to be achieved , effective international cooperation to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons is vital and must be enhanced through , inter alia , the extension of international controls over all fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ,  
Appreciating also the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , 2 and acknowledging the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
Eight Foreign Ministers of delegations represented in this Council Chamber came together on 9 June 1998 to issue a Joint Ministerial Declaration which contained the call for a new international agenda to achieve a nuclear _ weapon _ free world , through the pursuit , in parallel , of a series of mutually reinforcing measures at the bilateral , plurilateral and multilateral levels .  
The programme of action set out in that decision identified a comprehensive nuclear test _ ban treaty , a convention banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , and the determined pursuit by the nuclear _ weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate aim of eliminating those weapons .  
Yet practical results have been dismal as regard substantive measures directed toward the eventual and total elimination of nuclear weapons , which constitute the most destructive of such weapons of mass destruction .  
As the Conference on Disarmament begins its work in the new year , I want to underline the strong commitment of the United States to prompt resumption of negotiations on the next key multilateral step in the nuclear disarmament process : a treaty to ban the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Looking beyond START III negotiations , it seems clear to us that the prospects for negotiating deeper reductions would be enhanced if we have in place a dependable cap on fissile material for weapons , as well as confidence that the international community would detect illegal production.An FMCT also would help make nuclear arms reductions irreversible . 
If we truly want the Conference on Disarmament to live up to its responsibilities as the sole multilateral negotiating body on disarmament and international security , let us focus our work here on halting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , in particular nuclear weapons.Let us start today the negotiations on a fissile material cut _ off treaty !  
It should provide for detailed accounts of the fissile material produced after the cut _ off date ; safeguards against the use of this material for nuclear _ weapon purposes ; timely and effective detention of any diversion of fissile material produced after the cut _ off date , as well as of any undeclared enrichment or reprocessing after that date .  
The agreement to begin negotiations designed to secure a treaty eliminating and prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices certainly constitutes a token of political will which is positive and constructive .  
At a public sitting on 8 July 1996 , the International Court of Justice recognized for the first time in history that the threat or use of nuclear weapons is generally contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict , and in particular the principles and rules of humanitarian law , also recognizing that there exists an obligation for all States to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament .  
In May 1995 this bargain was renewed ; indeed , a second trade-off was made when , in exchange for the indefinite extension of the NPT without a vote , the nuclear-weapon States reaffirmed their commitments as stated in article VI of the Treaty to pursue in good faith negotiations on effective measures relating to nuclear disarmament and their determined pursuit of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons .  
Our appeal has received further backing from the most prestigious international judicial institution , the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) , which in its advisory opinion of 8 July 1996 called on all States to pursue in good faith negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective control .  
Secondly , some elements that were incorporated into the draft resolution are not in accordance with our own perception of nuclear disarmament , which is fully identified with the position of the Non-Aligned Movement as appropriately stated at its summit at Cartagena , Colombia , in an international setting that favoured the promotion of practical measures for the final and complete elimination of nuclear weapons .  
To try to make this topic the private domain of the nuclear Powers thus excluding the vast majority of States from the multilateral negotiations necessary in order to attain nuclear disarmament in a time-bound framework and under strict international control would only delay further the legitimate aspirations of mankind to live in a nuclear-weapon-free world .  
As a result , the cause of nuclear disarmament has now made a qualitative leap forward , and is strengthened by the unanimous response of the Court that obligations exist to continue and complete negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all is aspects under strict and effective control .  
The voting results on this counter-draft resolution and on the original Russian-United States bilateral nuclear arms negotiation that it is designed to belittle will have far more impact on my Government ' s attitude towards the concept of a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to nuclear disarmament than will all the rhetoric that we have heard alleging genuine desire in the international community to seek progress towards nuclear disarmament .  
My delegation hopes that in the future , instead of having to adopt two separate draft resolutions on the same subject , the First Committee and the General Assembly will be able to render unanimous support for a single draft resolution on nuclear disarmament negotiations that is comprehensive and acceptable to all .  
It called for parallel negotiations on a phased programme for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons and a comprehensive agreement banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices pursuant to paragraph 4 of the decision on Principles and objectives of the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference .  
The scope of such an international document should therefore cover all fissile material potentially usable in the manufacture of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices throughout the world , including the military stocks of these materials possessed by all States , on an equal footing .  
My delegation likewise supports the re _ establishment of the ad hoc committee to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral , effectively and internationally verifiable treaty prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , which will meet the goals of nuclear non _ proliferation and constitute an authentic disarmament measure .  
The PRESIDENT : On the second issue , I would like to recall that the representative of South Africa made a proposal at the first plenary meeting on 19 January 1999 to establish an ad hoc committee on nuclear disarmament to deliberate upon practical steps for systematic and progressive efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons as well as to identify if and when one or more such steps should be subject to negotiations in the Conference .  
Mr . GOOSEN ( South Africa ) : It is obviously with deep regret that we hear today that the Conference on Disarmament , which is defined as the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum of the international community and which has the primary role in substantive negotiations on priority questions of disarmament , remains unable to reach a consensus on the establishment of a mechanism to deliberate on the issue of nuclear disarmament .  
The future holds the prospect that ITs will enable us to transport electrical binary bits or pulses ( 0 s and 1 s ) instead of moving and bashing atoms and thus accurately simulate a nuclear explosion , just as we can reconstruct an analogue signal from a sampled ( quantized and coded ) series of bits cheaply and safely .  
To re-establish , for the duration of its 1999 session , the Ad hoc Committee under item 1 of the agenda entitled " Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament " to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
To our mind it is essential to design a comprehensive and universal legal regime which meets the expectations of the international community and creates sufficient confidence in international relations for the establishment of a world free of nuclear weapons .  
The Chairman announced that the Committee had concluded the consideration of agenda item 155 , entitled Measures to eliminate international terrorism , it being understood that the work of the Ad Hoc Committee established by the General Assembly to elaborate a draft international convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism would continue . 
The Conference establishes , under agenda item 1 entitled " Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament " , an ad hoc committee which shall negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices . iii .  
This overview explains why Canada remains so engaged to fully and urgently observing the objective unanimously agreed at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference , that is , the determined pursuit by the nuclear _ weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons . . . .  
We should also recommence immediately , in an ad hoc committee , negotiations on a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , as already agreed last year .  
Third and last , and in close connection with what I said earlier , I would like to place on record the support of my delegation for the early re _ establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty which would impose a prohibition on the production of fissile material for atomic bombs and other explosive nuclear devices , and for the early initiation of the negotiations .  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ;  
The intensive negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on and their early conclusion of a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator in 1995 and the mandate contained therein , and , pending its entry into force , a moratorium of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons ;  
Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons , notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile materials , and calls for continued efforts by States that possess fissile material no longer required for defence purposes to make such material available for safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) as soon as practicable ;  
In fifth place , as regards general disarmament , we emphasize the need to advance towards total elimination of nuclear , chemical and bacteriological weapons ; illicit trafficking in small arms , and the use of antipersonnel mines and explosive devices .  
Australia has long recognized that a universal and verifiable ban on nuclear tests is an essential component of regional and international peace and security , and would be a decisive step towards the goal of the elimination of nuclear weapons .  
For several years the European Union has supported the initiation of negotiations on and the rapid conclusion of , a multilateral international treaty prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other explosive nuclear devices .  
Equally important , the draft resolution draws attention to the importance of ongoing efforts to dismantle nuclear weapons and the need to ensure that excess fissile material is handled in a safe and effective way .  
In the Declaration , we also expressed our intention to carry out all the efforts required to ensure the Treatys full and universal implementation in order to promote the final objective , a world free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction .  
Therefore , as a personal wish , when the philosophical question of nuclear disarmament some day turns into a reality through the concerted efforts of the entire international community , again the mission will be complete , as in previous cases .  
The Conference underlines the role of IAEA in assisting developing countries in the peaceful use of nuclear energy through the development of effective programmes aimed at improving their scientific , technological , and regulatory capabilities .  
CARICOM member States have for many years expressed growing concern at the increasing threat to our marine environment posed by pollution and by the transportation of hazardous and nuclear waste through the Caribbean Sea .  
Instead , voluntary renouncement of the worlds third largest nuclear potential has brought its obvious dividends in the form of wide recognition and strengthened political and economic cooperation with the world .  
It still dumps nuclear waste in the occupied Arab territories and continues its programme of developing all kinds of weapons of mass destruction , biological or chemical , because of the worlds inaction and the double standards that the great Powers apply .  
An eventual convention on fissile material should be a concrete step forward in the nuclear disarmament process and should not be limited to being just another instrument of selective nonproliferation .  
All States have an urgent obligation to complete negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects , under strict and effective international control , as expressed by the International Court of Justice in its Advisory Opinion .  
The initial promise of deep , continuous and irreversible reductions in strategic nuclear forces held out by the positive climate of the early postcoldwar years appears to be fading fast .  
While weapons of mass destruction , in particular nuclear weapons , continue to be of primary concern , the international community has expressed increasing concern about the proliferation of conventional weapons , especially small arms and light weapons .  
It was of utmost importance to make systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating them under strict and effective international control .  
His delegation looked forward to the resumption and early conclusion of negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on a binding universal legal instrument banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
To promote regional cooperation for the development and practical application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in the interest of the sustainable social and economic development of the African continent ;  
His Government acknowledged the need for adequate and effective measures to interdict illicit trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive materials and believed that new and more comprehensive cooperative efforts might be required .  
The Russian Federation was contributing to the technical development of safeguards through a national support programme aimed at improving analytical methods , modernizing the technical means employed , and producing and certifying samples of nuclear material .  
In view of the huge arsenal still in the possession of the nuclear Powers , the risk of an inadvertent war had not diminished even though increasing political , moral and legal limitations had been placed on the effective use of such weapons .  
It was imperative to reverse that dangerous trend , and in that context his country fully supported the New Agenda Coalition , which represented a moderate and constructive approach to nonproliferation and nuclear disarmament .  
In the broader context of nuclearweaponfree zones , Chile attached special importance to the regulation of the international maritime transport of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel according to the highest international safety standards .  
Our efforts in biological and chemical weapons , in verifying conventional arms levels and in pursuing collective security arrangements are all an essential backdrop to creating the conditions for complete nuclear disarmament .  
Saying that the Agency did not have any assurances that there were no undeclared nuclear activities was the same as insisting that a party was guilty until proven innocent , the exact opposite of the legal principle usually applied .  
The Conference underlines the role of IAEA in assisting developing countries in the peaceful use of nuclear energy through the development of effective programmes aimed at improving their scientific , technological , and regulatory capabilities .  
The United Kingdom had published an initial report on past production of fissile material for defence purposes and was circulating a summary paper on its main conclusions and the role of such work in nuclear disarmament .  
Ad hoc regimes , acting under the pretext of nonproliferation , continued to pursue discriminatory policies with the main objective of exclusive possession of nuclear technology by developed countries .  
The Conference underlines the role of IAEA in assisting developing countries in the peaceful use of nuclear energy through the development of effective programmes aimed at improving their scientific , technological , and regulatory capabilities .  
The major issue addressed had been the peaceful use of nuclear energy , including maritime transport of such energy , radioactive materials , nuclear safety and technical cooperation and the liability and role of nuclear energy in sustainable development .  
The final report of the Conference contained a balanced review and set a realistic and achievable agenda to take forward the work to which the entire international community was committed , namely , the achievement of a world free from nuclear weapons .  
Of crucial importance was an adequate national technical , human and regulatory infrastructure in nuclear safety , radiological protection and waste management for the peaceful application of nuclear energy .  
Rather , it was designed to achieve the complete elimination of nuclear weapons and lead to a system of strict and effective international control capable of ensuring that such weapons would not be manufactured again .  
The resources devoted to huge arsenals nuclear and conventional take up the funds that could be devoted to economic development and social progress , which is of great importance to the people of developed and developing countries alike .  
On the technological level , new weapons research and development has continued unabated , with the emergence of more accurate nuclear ballistic missile systems and the deployment of highly accurate nuclear armed cruise missiles .  
All missiles capable of carrying warheads with nuclear , bacteriological and chemical agents should be banned from future production and current stockpiles should be gradually reduced and finally destroyed .  
In connection with the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , the vital importance of security in the international maritime transport of radioactive waste is quite evident .  
The proliferation of nuclear weapons and the growing emphasis on military doctrines , missile proliferation and the potential deployment of national missile defence are additional factors that pose alarming dangers to international security .  
They pledged to make new efforts aimed at the total elimination of nuclear arsenals , halting the global spread of nuclear weapons and strengthening the essential standards governing the peaceful uses of nuclear energy .  
It is imperative that even as we work towards developing the requisite political will , in the interim the international community accepts the need for urgent practical steps that will diminish nuclear dangers .  
The tragedy at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , almost 15 years ago , affected almost the entire territory of Europe but most of all Ukraine and the neighbouring areas of Belarus and the Russian Federation and caused long-lasting , complex problems .  The human suffering caused by the accident can not be measured , and its environmental impact was partly irreversible .  
Mexico will continue encouraging the adoption of measures aimed at consolidating the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , including the universalization and full validity of the various international treaties on the matter , as well as the negotiation of new bilateral and multilateral agreements whose objective is the complete elimination of nuclear weapons , as a step towards the agreed goal of general and complete disarmament under effective international control .  
Sanctions should be restricted to the acquisition of arms , military equipment and dual-use materials as stipulated in relevant Security Council resolutions , especially the resolutions relating to the elimination of weapons of mass destruction , be they nuclear , chemical or biological , and of any other military potential that might endanger the sovereignty , safety , security and stability of neighbouring countries .  
The States members of MERCOSUR and the associated countries considered that the strictest safety requirements should be observed in the international maritime transport of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel , which posed great danger to the marine environment and the health of populations in affected areas .  
The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya considered that regional efforts should be focused on ensuring that scientific achievements in the nuclear field were used for peaceful purposes and hoped that a regular exchange between countries of information on the research undertaken would be set up .  
Pakistan believed that in years to come the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee should devote special attention to the following issues : matters relating to remote sensing , use of nuclear power sources in outer space , means of and mechanisms for strengthening inter-agency cooperation and increasing the use of space applications and services within and among entities of the United Nations system , implementation of an integrated , space-based global natural disaster management system and the physical nature and technical attributes of the geostationary orbit and of its utilization and applications .  
Mr . President , I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate Egypts total commitment to work earnestly and diligently towards the achievement of the objectives of general and complete disarmament , which require maintenance of the minimum defence requirements and the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction , especially nuclear weapons , in accordance with the priorities adopted by the international community at the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , in 1978 .  
Further , except for certain ultra hazardous activities which are mostly the subject of special regulation , e.g . , in the nuclear field or in the context of activities in outer space , the risk that flows from an activity is primarily a function of the particular application , the specific context and the manner of operation .  
We firmly believe that the Final Document of the General Assemblys special session devoted to disarmament in 1978 rightly stated that the main priority should be granted to nuclear disarmament and weapons of mass destruction , and , afterward , conventional weapons .  
Applying transparency in the Middle East region to seven categories of conventional weapons while ignoring more advanced , more sophisticated or more lethal armaments , such as weapons of mass destruction and , in particular , nuclear weapons , is an approach that is neither balanced nor comprehensive .  
We have seen how such major issues facing the international community as , among others , the nuclear weapons reduction process , CTBT and the negotiation of a BWC protocol have come up against unwarranted challenges : it is very likely that weapons and weapon systems will be introduced into outer space ; while last year the entire international community , including the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council , recognized the ABM Treaty as a cornerstone of global stability , this year we hear voices calling for the total abrogation of this treaty .  
In the context of active and ongoing negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty , the United States is prepared to agree to an overall work programme that calls for the establishment of an ad hoc committee on nuclear disarmament and another ad hoc committee that would conduct exploratory discussions on outer space issues .  
Following these positive changes of the last few years that have strengthened the need for a renewed strategic vision of peace and stability throughout the world , it is necessary that international security be separated from military factors and go beyond security concepts based on nuclear weapons .  
Therefore , besides the legal instruments prohibiting weapons of mass destruction , it is vitally important today for the international community to promote closer cooperation to upgrade the physical protection of nuclear material , combat illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and other radioactive sources and enhance the protection and control of nuclear facilities against acts of terrorism and sabotage .  
Welcomes the ongoing dialogue between the Russian Federation and the United States of America on a new strategic framework premised on openness , mutual confidence and real opportunities for cooperation , which is of paramount importance , especially in a changing security environment , and hopes that this dialogue will successfully lead to substantial reductions in offensive nuclear forces and contribute to the maintenance of international stability ;  
In the new millennium , other priorities include eliminating the so-called tactical nuclear weapons ; banning fissile materials for weapons purposes ; arresting the acquisition of advanced weapons of mass destruction ; maintaining the credibility of the non-proliferation regime ; and concluding an international convention against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons against the non-nuclear-weapon States .  
In their continuing endeavours to render the Treaty fully operable through the accession to its Protocol by the nuclear Powers , members States of the Association of South-East Asian Nations have been engaged in a series of intense consultations with the nuclear Powers in an earnest effort to seek a mutually satisfactory solution to the outstanding problems .  
Among such steps are the strengthening of International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) safeguards , revising the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material , improving national standards of security and physical protection of nuclear material , establishing stronger regulatory control over radioactive sources and enhancing international cooperation against illicit trafficking in nuclear material .  
In that Opinion , the Court stated that , given the unique characteristics of those weapons , in particular their destructive capacity , their capacity to cause untold human suffering , and their ability to cause damage to generations to come , the threat or use of nuclear weapons would be a potential catastrophe .  
We also draw the attention of the Committee to the initiative put forward to the President of the Russian Federation at the Millennium Summit with regard to ensuring energy supplies for the sustainable development of humankind , a radical solution to the problems posed by the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to the problem of global environmental improvement .  
In the light of the follow-up to the Millennium Declaration adopted last year by our leaders , we urge all Member States to undertake continued negotiations within the framework of the United Nations and its subsidiary bodies , leading to total nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control .  
Moreover , the international community must take action to bolster existing mechanisms and instruments and to set out a specific timetable for the successive stages of general disarmament and for the elimination of weapons of mass destruction nuclear , chemical and biological in particular .  
Israels possession of excessive quantities of weapons , its stupendous arsenal of highly destructive and unconventional weapons and its categorical refusal to place its nuclear installations under International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) safeguards constitute a flagrant challenge to the international community .  
The international community continues to witness an accelerated race to develop strategic nuclear reactors for military purposes and increase the range and power of ballistic missiles and rockets with nuclear , chemical and biological warheads despite the pledges of the heads of State and Government at the Millennium Summit last year for , among other things , the gradual multilateral reduction of arsenals of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction .  
The United Arab Emirates , which joined the NPT , the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) and the Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) , in order to reinforce its international position , believes that establishing zones free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction is the key to establishing balances in international and regional strategic relations .  
In this framework , we also call for the discontinuation of all financial , technological and scientific aid used in developing Israels dangerous nuclear installations , which threaten not only the peace efforts and attempts to find a solution to the Palestine question and the Middle East problem , but also the security , stability and real interests of the peoples in the area and their natural , economic and environmental resources .  
Still , the asymmetry of modern warfare , the existence of shadowy guerrillas with global reach , and the vulnerability of nuclear devices to theft or unauthorized use or simply to the chance that a madman might get his hands on them are today more than ever before eroding the logic and rationale behind the justifications for thousands of weapons designated for mutual assured destruction .  
We note with the deepest concern the close connections between international terrorism and the illegal movement of nuclear , chemical , biological and other deadly materials , as a paramount threat to international peace and security at the dawn of the new millennium .  
Accordingly , the political reality in our region mandates a practical step-by-step approach , culminating in a comprehensive peace and the eventual establishment of a mutually verifiable zone free of ballistic missiles and of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .  
The outcome of the 2000 Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) , in which the nuclear-weapon States agreed to an unequivocal undertaking to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals , proved that the NPT is the main and most effective legal basis for actions to prohibit and to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons . 
I should like once again to refer to the Final Document of the tenth special session of the General Assembly , the first special session devoted to disarmament , which called upon the international community to take steps against nuclear proliferation and to renounce weapons of mass destruction , including those held for deterrent purposes .  
Our close cooperation becomes urgent when it is realized that a small group of terrorists can actually possess weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , biological and chemical ones , and destroy large areas of the world and millions of innocent people with wilful abandon , senselessly and indiscriminately .  
To date , conventions have been developed covering the safety of power reactors , radioactive waste and spent fuel management , early notification and assistance in case of a nuclear accident or radiological emergency , and the physical protection of nuclear material .  
It is gratifying to note that the Commission on Sustainable Development has recognized the value of nuclear energy in the context of sustainable development and has agreed that the choice to use appropriate energy sources should be left to the countries concerned .  
As part of the rigid economic , financial and commercial blockade imposed on Cuba for more than 40 years , various actions have targeted our programme for the peaceful use of nuclear energy to prevent its advance .  
We believe that , apart from unilateral and bilateral steps in the area of nuclear disarmament , the time has come to start discussions on strategic issues within the framework of multilateral mechanisms , including among the five permanent members of the Security Council , who bear special responsibility for the fate of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) , the CTBT and other international agreements .  
The terrorist attacks in New York and Washington , D.C . , almost two months ago highlight the urgent need for an effective system of protection for fissile material and nuclear facilities , to combat illicit trafficking in such material and to strengthen the non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament regime through the immediate implementation of the 13 points agreed by consensus at the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons .  
The Government of the Czech Republic has already approved the amended text of the national report , which provides an update on the existing regulatory and legal framework as well as a case study of the Dukovany and Temeln nuclear power plants .  We look forward to the second Review Meeting of the Contracting Parties , scheduled for April 2002 , to demonstrate our full compliance with the requirements of the Convention .  
In conclusion , let me reassure the Assembly of my Governments continued commitment to supporting and expanding the Agencys role in international cooperation in the peaceful and safe use of nuclear energy and ionizing radiation for the benefit of all member States . I would like also to express the Czech Republics appreciation for the personal involvement of the Director General , Mr . Mohamed ElBaradei , in the promotion of the Agencys activities .  
If the Agency were unable effectively to track the location and use of nuclear material worldwide , or to give adequate support to national nuclear safety measures , the consequences to the global community could be grave .  
Bearing in mind paragraph 50 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , [ 3 ] the first special session devoted to disarmament , calling for the urgent negotiation of agreements for the cessation of the qualitative improvement and development of nuclear-weapon systems , and for a comprehensive and phased programme with agreed time frames , wherever feasible , for the progressive and balanced reduction of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery , leading to their ultimate and complete elimination at the earliest possible time ,  
Recalling the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the Legality of the Threat or use of Nuclear Weapons , issued on 8 July 1996 , [ 9 ] and welcoming the unanimous reaffirmation by all Judges of the Court that there exists an obligation for all States to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control ,  
How can we be expected to view as legitimate norms of conduct dictated by the Security Council , when some of its members are responsible for the fact that there are more than 30,000 nuclear weapons in the world , directly threatening the international peace and security that the Council is supposed to defend ?  
Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons , notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile materials and calls for arrangements by all the nuclear-weapon States to place , as soon as practicable , the fissile material designated by each of them as no longer required for military purposes under the International Atomic Energy Agency or other relevant international verification and arrangements for the disposition of such material for peaceful purposes in order to ensure that such material remains permanently outside military programmes ;  
Recognizing further the close connection between international terrorism and illicit arms-trafficking and the illegal movement of nuclear , chemical , biological and other potentially deadly materials ,  
Consideration needed to be given to issues such as space debris , the status of low near-Earth orbits as a limited natural resource , the use of nuclear energy sources in outer space , intellectual property protection in respect of space vehicles , use of space technology and legal aspects of global navigation systems .  
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and complexity and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
Together with the problem of anti-missile defence , the laying down in legal terms of the agreements reached on further radical , irreversible and verifiable reductions of strategic offensive weapons , in our opinion , down to the level of 1,500 to 2,200 nuclear warheads for each party is becoming particularly important under these circumstances .  
Significant investments have been made in the draft resolution , with hard compromises made on key issues such as integrated safeguards , the role of innovative nuclear technology and the safe transport of radioactive material .  
As previously recorded , there are no indications of Iraq having retained any physical capability for the indigenous production of weapon-usable nuclear material in amounts of any practical significance , nor any indication Iraq has acquired or produced weapon-usable nuclear material other than the nuclear material verified by IAEA and removed from Iraq in accordance with paragraph 13 of resolution 687 ( 1991 ) .  
Exerting greater and more positive efforts towards achieving integration between environmental and health strategies , especially in terms of providing safe drinking water and food , treating waste-water and solid waste , controlling or limiting the potential dangers of chemicals , various types of pollution and genetically modified substances ; and achieving nuclear safety in the Arab region ;  
Limitation of the individual radiation dose received from fission products emerging from a nuclear unit that has returned to Earth in some particular geographical region as a consequence of an accident to the level of the maximum permissible dose as established by the International Commission on Radiological Protection ;  
Combining , as appropriate , the increased use of renewable energy sources , more efficient use of energy , the use of advanced fossil fuel technologies and other [ Sustainable ] advanced technologies [ ] [ and nuclear technologies ] and the sustainable use of traditional energy resources , which could meet the growing needs of energy services [ in the longer term ] to achieve sustainable development ;
