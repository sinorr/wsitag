The expert evaluation panel , including Professor Chen Huanchun from Huazhong Agricultural University who was also a member of the Academy of Engineering , said research of these key technologies had reached an advanced level domestically and some were leading the world level , which offered firm technological backing to the ecological environment as well as the social and economic development of the Three Gorges Dam area .  
At around midnight the same day , the relevant leading official from Chongqing municipal government led the district commission of Wansheng District , the district government , and leaders from departments concerned to visit the resettled people from the disaster area and the families of the people who were killed and missing .  They also visited the wounded at the hospital .  
In the coming 5 years , the Bonded Area of Shatoujiao in Shenzhen will bring its location advantages and policy advantages into full play , and use the new high level technology industry as the forerunner , actively restructuring its product structure , and implement an operating strategy assisted by transit trade and warehousing , and build the Shatoujiao Bonded Area into a special comprehensive economic zone operating in accordance with international practices while leading domestically , and make it a rapid growth area of the city 's export-oriented economy .  
At present , nearly 70 large projects , with 10-million US dollars being invested in each , have already spread out in a belt standing tall with more than 100 square kilometers along the 20 kilometer Gold Coast of Ningbo 's Beilun district , forming a recently emerging large industrial economic belt with leading industries such as petrochemical , iron and steel and developing subsidiary industries such as electric power , machinery , electronics , light industry and textile , building materials , plastic cement , etc .  
The court held : By wantonly accepting and extorting a huge amount of bribes and seeking interests for others by taking advantage of his position , Hu Changqing , the accused , had committed the crime of bribery in his capacity as a state functionary and a senior government leading cadre .  Given the huge amount involved , Hu 's crime has caused heavy losses to the state property and had a pernicious influence in the society .  Hu 's crime is extremely serious in nature and should be severely handled in accordance with the law .  
Hu 's case of accepting and offering bribes and failing to identify sources of a huge amount of wealth is an extremely serious economic crime case involving a senior leading cadre .  The way his crime , one of serious nature , was committed was absolutely vile and has exerted a pernicious influence in the society .  
Wen Jiabao suggested organizing all Party leading cadres to seriously study the important speech made by Comrade Jiang Zemin at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission , deeply carrying out the spirit of the plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission , working in line with the actual condition of the financial sector , setting up specific measures and taking practical actions to carry forward improving the Party ï¿½s work style and building a clean and honest government and fighting corruption within the financial sector .  
It has been learned that , last year , Sichuan 's procuratorial organs focused on investigating economic criminal cases involving leading cadres at and above the county and departmental levels ' state-owned enterprises , and 122 leading cadres were found to have been involved in major cases , of which 97 were at the departmental or bureau level .  
Practice proves that this round of the " three stresses " education is a creative exploration in strengthening and improving party building in the new period , especially in ideological and political building of leading bodies and cadres .  It carries forward and enriches in the period the Yanan rectification spirit and the party 's " three great styles , " and is an important measure in promoting and implementing the principle that " the party must manage itself " and the principle of " sternly governing the party . "  
The ideological and political quality , the mental state and the work of cadres at this level have a direct bearing on the implementation of the party 's line , principles and policies , influence local reform , development and stability , and influence party-people and cadre-people relations .  On the whole , the situation of the contingent of the leading bodies and leading cadres of over 2,000 counties ( cities ) across the country is good .  
7 .  After receiving this circular , CPC committees and people 's governments of the provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities under direct central jurisdiction should immediately carry out a round of comprehensive cleaning up of their respective places ' projects of building or expanding facilities commemorating late leading comrades , register the projects one by one carefully , propose a plan of handling commemorative facilities in violation of the rules , make responsible reports on the issues to the CPC Central Committee and the State Council .  
If any grave turn occurs in Taiwan leading to the separation of Taiwan from China in any name , if Taiwan is invaded and occupied by a foreign country , and if the Taiwan authorities refuse , sine die , the peaceful settlement of cross-strait reunification through negotiation , it will then be impossible to have peaceful reunification and the Chinese Government will only be forced to adopt necessary measures to smash the separatist scheme for " Taiwan independence " and safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
In the face of the strategic readjustment of the agricultural and rural economic structures , we should quickly change the ideas , concepts , leading methods , and the quality of cadres and the masses that are not compatible with the situation in structural readjustment and bring about a tremendous change in the way of thinking and working methods .  
To successfully reinforce the ideological and political work , the key is to practice what one preaches .  Communist party members must set an example for the entire society to follow , while leading cadres are required to play an exemplary role for the whole party .  
He stressed : Conducting the " Three Stresses " education at the county and city level is of great significance , because in our party 's organizational structure and the structure of state power , counties and cities are both leading organizations and basic units .  They play a pivotal role in forming a link between the provincial and central authorities on the one hand and the countryside , including townships and towns , on the other hand .  
Because the leadership posts at the county and city level are also schools to foster outstanding leadership talent , and because counties and cities have complete functions just as " the sparrow may be small but it has all the vital organs , " the posts are the most suitable places to temper cadres ; a considerable number of senior and medium-level leading cadres have grown to maturity after being tempered at such posts .  
Li Peng hoped that the leading group and cadres in Zhangjiagang City will , from the high plane of laying emphasis on politics , identify problems from the development and dialectical viewpoint , adhere to the high standard and strict demands , exert pressure on themselves , go all out to forge ahead , and conscientiously investigate , look for , and resolve the existing outstanding problems , as well as lead the people throughout the city to open up new prospects in the reform and opening up and modernization construction in Zhangjiagang City .  
Their ideological and political quality , work style , words and deeds have a direct bearing on the implementation of the party 's line , principles and policies in rural areas , on the reform , development and stability in rural areas , and on the relations between the party and the masses and between the cadres and the masses .  Generally speaking , the great majority of township ( town ) leading cadres are good , diligent , honest in performing official duties and working hard regardless of criticism ;  
For this reason , while we are focusing on improving the party style and the ethical integrity among the leading cadres at and above the county ( department ) level , we must also seriously solve the conspicuous problems existing among the grassroots cadres , particularly the township ( town ) leading cadres .  Wei Jianxing emphasized : All the township ( town ) leading cadres across the country should keep firmly in mind the party 's purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly .  
During the theoretical study , the central study teams of the party committees at all levels of the Navy elaborated the major realistic issues in the Navy 's modernization program and preparations for military struggles to more than 100 specific topics for study and practice .  Focused on these topics , they guided the reading , investigations , research , exchanges , and application of the leading cadres at all levels .  
During study and discussion , these localities generally said that the speech made by General Secretary Jiang Zemin at Guangdong 's Gaozhou City and the speeches delivered by the six standing committee members of the Central Political Bureau in these six localities are profound , rich and realistic in content , out of an overall strategic consideration and in light of the actual situation of the building of the county ( city ) leading groups and the leading cadre ranks .  
The central leading comrades have come to the grassroots units , directly heard grassroots cadres ' briefings and pertinently pointed out problems .  This fact fully shows their understanding , trust and loving care of grassroots cadres , shows the high degree of importance attached by the Party Central Committee to the " three stresses " education at the county ( city ) level , shows their firm conviction in Marxism and the strategic vision of them as party and state leaders , and shows the correctness of the policy decision made by the Party Central Committee .  
The members of Jingyang County 's leading group said : In the past , we always thought economic work meant inflexible tasks and targets while the party building and the building of spiritual civilization were flexible tasks , dealing with ideological work , not " grain production . "  So , we did not have a profound understanding of the principle of " building both material and spiritual civilizations and attaching equal importance to both " and our understanding of it was lopsided .  
To our knowledge , these localities , after seriously studying and discussing the central leading comrades ' important speeches , made a further mobilization and set aside more than a week 's time for a concentrated theoretical study .  Following the extensive reading in the preceding stage , they practiced intensive reading , conducted special-subject education , and pondered theories in light of reality .  
The spouse and children of a leading cadre are prohibited from accepting any cash gifts , negotiable securities , and valuables by making use of the official authority or the official influences of this leading cadre ; prohibited from engaging in any business or enterprise-running activities in an area or within the professional scope under the jurisdiction of this leading cadre that may conflict with public interests ;  
China 's basic rural changes are attributable to the correct guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory and to the firm leadership of the third-generation leading core .  Zhulin has developed from a hillside village short of water and food into a modern town with all kinds of functions .  Its people , who had worked as farmers for generations , have become town dwellers who created and enjoyed modern civilization .  
The historical experiences gained by our party in leading the socialist cause have proved , from both the positive and negative aspects , that whenever the party represents the development demands of advanced productive forces , our cause will flourish and grow ;  
After the third plenary session of the 11th party central committee , the party 's second generation of leading collective with Deng Xiaoping at the core put forward the great goal of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , adhered to the party 's basic line of one center and two basic points , and scored achievements that attracted worldwide attention .  
A group of leading cadres in Liaoning Province who violated policies by occupying too many houses , illegally taking funds for housing purchases , illegally turning public houses into private ones , and using public funds to renovate houses beyond the standard were investigated and handled sternly .  Party and government disciplinary measures were taken against 62 cadres at or above the county department level in the province , and eight people were transferred to judicial organs to be investigated and affixed criminal responsibilities .  
However , if a grave turn of events occurs leading to the separation of Taiwan from China in any name , or if Taiwan is invaded and occupied by foreign countries , or if the Taiwan authorities refuse , sine die , the peaceful settlement of cross-Strait reunification through negotiations , then the Chinese Government will only be forced to adopt all drastic measures possible , including the use of force , to safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and fulfill the great cause of reunification .  
Hu Jintao emphasized that the key to seizing and using well the opportunity of the great development of the west to speed up economic and social development lies in doing a good job in building the party organizations at all levels ; in particular , the leading cadres at all levels must play a model role , firmly advance in the forefront of emancipating and developing the productive forces and promoting the building of the two civilizations , and unite and lead the masses to work hard together .  
The basic spirit of the speech is suited to the county ( or city ) level as well as to the leadership at various levels ; the speech is particularly aimed at improving the ideological and political qualities of leading cadres at various levels ; so it is of great practical and far-reaching historical significance .  
He then pointed out : In studying Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech , we should base ourselves on the purpose of enabling leading cadres at various levels to clearly understand the importance and necessity of doing a good job in conducting the " three stresses " education at the county ( or city ) level , on the purpose of improving the ideological and political quality of cadres at all levels , and on the purpose of solving problems in a down-to-earth manner .  
Some delegates indicated : During the current building of a spiritual civilization , the trend of promoting material progress to the neglect of cultural and ideological progress has yet to be checked permanently , and a major factor leading to such a situation is that the related legislation work remains relatively weak ; in view of such a problem , we ought to vigorously strengthen the legislation concerning the building of a socialist spiritual civilization .  
It is necessary to establish and perfect a system , under the unified leadership of the party committees , in which the party and government departments and the mass bodies share the work and coordinate with each other and the leading cadres at all levels take on dual responsibilities in their posts ; it is necessary to establish a work mechanism for integrating ideological and political work with work in all aspects , and to form a good " integration " of mutual stimulation between them .  
to ensure the implementation of the party 's basic line and basic policies systematically and legally ; to ensure the party will always give play to the leading and central role of controlling overall situation and of coordinating all interests .  To develop socialist democratic politics , there is a need to persist in the four cardinal principles , in the national policy of the people 's democratic dictatorship , and in the political body of the national people 's congress system .  
At a time when we are about to finish the first two steps , the party 's leading collective of the third generation has made the third-step strategic goals more specific , drawn up a new program , and clearly defined the goals of the new " three-step " strategy .  This will help people throughout the country to maintain their fighting spirit and to firmly , steadily , and in a down-to-earth manner , stride toward the grand goal of building China into a modern socialist country .  
In the fields of electronic information , new materials , biological engineering , integration of light , machines , and electricity [ guang ji dian yi ti hua , 0342-2623-7193-0001-7555-0553 ] , new energy sources , and environmental protection , the high-tech zones are more and more becoming important bases for the development of China 's high-tech industries and have played a active role in promoting industrial restructuring and in leading forward sustained economic development .  
We must keep a sober mind on this issue .  The leading comrades of the State Council have stressed the need for many times to make a proper use of the practice of " changing debt into equity , " for it is an effective means for us to assist key state enterprises with well-marketable products , a sound management foundation , and a broad development prospect to lower their liabilities ratio and to turn their deficits into profits .  
In the group study of the " three stresses " education , Party committee groups and leading cadres received deep Marxist theoretical education ; some prominent problems in the aspects of Party characteristics and Party working styles were touched and solved ; the Party 's excellent traditions and working styles were carried forth ; Party committee groups ' cohesiveness and fighting power were strengthened ; and people 's confidence in building socialism with Chinese characteristics and in the transcentury development of our military 's construction was strengthened .  
This should be of important theoretical and practical significance to our party under the new historical conditions in further strengthening self building , always maintaining advanced nature , leading the people of the whole country in waging concerted struggles , pushing forward reform and opening up and modernization building , and realizing the magnificent transcentury objectives .  
Speaking in this sense , the " three represents " is the foundation for our establishing the party , the source of our strength , and the basics of our life as well as the concrete embodiment of those excellent traditions of our Party like integrating theories with practice , maintaining close links with the masses , waging arduous struggles , and so on in the practice of our party leading the people to develop social productive forces , flourish advanced culture , and realize fundamental interests of the people and the intrinsic excellent characters of the party .  
To respond to the call of the grand western development , the provincial party committee and government are prepared to adopt the method of the " government putting up the stage and enterprises acting on it , " organizing and leading the enterprises having advantages to expand their businesses at low costs in the central and western regions with their own product brands , production lines , and funds , and help the hinterland develop its economy .  
This reporter learned from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the Ministry of Supervision that the discipline inspection and supervision organs of Qinghai and Hunan Provinces had strictly investigated and dealt with two typical cases of violation of the rules of integrity and self-discipline for leading cadres and the responsible persons concerned were subjected to stern party disciplinary actions and administrative punishments .  
Kuang Chushen , secretary of the leading party group and director of the audit bureau of Chenzhou City in Hunan Province ; Tao Jianzhong , deputy director of the audit bureau ; and Lei Yuande , deputy secretary of the leading party group and vice chairman of the city foreign trade and economic cooperation committee and deputy director of the committee 's foreign investment solicitation office , violated the rules by organizing a disguised overseas ( extraterritorial ) group tour at public expense , which resulted in the accidental death of a person .  
At present , party committees and governments at various levels in the central and western regions have come to fully realize their resources advantages for the development of tourism in their areas , and are unifying thinking and making greater determination to take the development of tourism as a major leading industry in the great development of China 's west by doing intensive and down-to-earth work .  
The " Honest Government Standards " formulated and implemented by the Party during the past few years have not only regulated political behavior for leading Party and government cadres under the socialist market economy , they also have advanced construction and development of the market economic system .  
It is hoped that leading cadres at all levels and comrades in the scientific and technological circles would further unify understanding , clearly identify their target , make joint efforts to promote the innovation of knowledge , and raise our basic research work to a new level in order to add brilliance to the world treasure-house of science and make greater contributions to China 's socialist modernization .  
Hosts of facts proved that through fabricating a set of heresies , Li Hongzhi absorbed and controlled spiritually a great number of kindhearted people who want to keep themselves strong and healthy .  At the same time , he trained his key members to establish a compact organizational setup and he himself sat in a leading position and gave remote controls and commands .  
According to a relevant leading official from the Ministry of Public Security , public security organs can fully and promptly prevent and discover security risks and loopholes in the construction and use of computer information systems through standardized , scientific , and fair assessments and supervision .  This will help to raise public security organs ' level of supervision and management of security protection for computer information systems .  
We have attached great importance to developing good neighborly and friendly relations , as well as relations of all-round cooperation , with Vietnam ; and are willing to make common efforts with Vietnam 's new leading collective in opening up a brighter future prospect for the relations between our two parties and two countries .  
The tremendous achievements in economic and social development , which have been attained in the past 20 years by Shenzhen , the special economic zone personally founded by Deng Xiaoping and formed with the painstaking efforts of the second and third generations of the leading collectives of the party 's central committee , are the powerful evidence of our party 's endeavor to act as the " Three Represents " in the new period , and have laid the solid foundation for Shenzhen to take the lead in basically realizing socialist modernization .  
The tremendous achievements in economic and social development , which have been attained in the past 20 years by Shenzhen , the special economic zone personally founded by Deng Xiaoping and formed with the painstaking efforts of the second and third generations of the leading collectives of the party 's central committee , are the powerful evidence of our party 's endeavor to act as the " Three Represents " in the new period , and have laid the solid foundation for Shenzhen to take the lead in basically realizing socialist modernization .  
In accordance with the arrangements of the central and provincial authorities , we have conscientiously organized the " three-stress " education and , combining it with the activities of setting up " united , clean , and good leading groups with a pioneering spirit " launched in the entire city , lost no time in resolving the problems unsuited to the new situation and new tasks facing the party building and the SEZ development .  
Structural readjustment of enterprises means to concentrate effective resources through the market on the industries that concern the state 's economic lifeline and whose scale merit is particularly evident to enable them to establish an appropriate scale of production and operation , so that they will become important industries of the national economy , the pillars of the essential areas , the leaders in economic restructuring , the representatives to international competition , and the leading forces in the state 's regulation and control of the state .  
In doing practical work , first political commissars should resolve problems in a timely manner , study and arrange the major work of reserve forces , clearly understand the ideological pulse of leading cadres , and organize and convene meetings to study and resolve major problems so as to ensure that reserve forces are developing toward a correct orientation .  
Early this year , in formulating plans for advanced scientific and technological training , leading members of the subdistrict held that the future advanced scientific and technological war would mainly be a theater battle .  The reserve forces and militiamen must be capable of providing highly efficient and swift logistical supply and give full play to their role of protecting the theater of war .  
The supervision and control of the leading cadres is a regular , arduous task that requires the relentless efforts of the party organizations at all levels , but it is also a real and urgent task that requires the party organizations to make very sure that the supervision and control measures are implemented in accordance with their supervisory and control duties .  
The 15th National Party Congress has formulated the strategic program of gearing the construction of a socialism with Chinese characteristics to the 21st century .  The completion of this new historical task depends on the leading groups and the leading cadres at all levels , on the continuous upgrading of their leadership standard and government standard , and on the continuous strengthening of their ability to resist corruption and degeneration , and on their work to further solidify the party and the people , so that together we can struggle to move forward with our grand undertaking .  
For the principal leading cadres at provincial and ministerial level to concentrate a period of time for specific discussions on some major issues of reform and development is an effective move adopted by the central authorities in order to enhance the ability of high-ranking cadres to implement the party 's line and principles and to manage the economy and society in the new situation .  
and we should take earnest steps to strengthen leadership over the ideological and political building in military academies , give priority to selecting highly capable cadres to form the leading bodies of military academies , and see to it that the school-running work can keep to its correct orientation and that the able personnel we bring up are all politically qualified .  
In recent years Comrade Jiang Zemin has repeatedly emphasized that leading cadres must stress study , politics , and healthy trends , work hard to enhance the ideological and political quality of the ranks of party members and cadres , do a good job in resolving problems of world view , view of life , and values , and firmly embrace correct ideals and beliefs .  
According a leading member of the State Civil Air Defense Office , as modern warfare principally is expressed in local hi-tech wars , nuclear and chemical protection is predicated on the safe use of the civil air defense engineering projects .  
Party members , especially leading cadres , must establish a correct world outlook , outlook on life and value , stress theoretical study , political awareness and good conduct , keep firmly in mind the party 's purpose , maintain close ties with the people , be clean and self-disciplined , oppose corruption , maintain the fine style of doing hard work , maintain a good spiritual state , and withstand the test of power , money and attractive women .  
Today , with the reforms and opening to the outside , only when leading cadres at all levels possess noble values , strive to become pure people , noble people , people detached from base interests , people benefiting the people , thinking what the masses think , feeling the anxiety of the masses , suffering first , enjoying later , content to live an austere life , and having far-reaching ambitions , can they unite and lead the masses to approach common prosperity sooner .  
On 18 May , at a report meeting on " three stresses " and " review and reexamination " among leading bodies at the municipal level , Jia Qinglin , member of the CPC Central Political Bureau and secretary of the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee , required that party organizations at all levels of the municipality implement the " three represents " requirement set forth by General Secretary Jiang Zemin in their firm and correct implementation of the party 's line , principles , and policies and in the strict enforcement of party discipline .  
Zhang Lichang , secretary of the municipal party committee , said that leading cadres at all levels must stand at the high plain of historical development to fully understand the urgency of implementing the important concept of " three represents " in close connection with the profound changes in the domestic and international situation and with the actual conditions of Tianjin 's work , further emancipate people 's minds , further break new ground and make new progress , grasp opportunities , and develop by leaps and bounds .  
Yu Yongbo said : From a overall-situation and strategic perspective , Chairman Jiang 's important speech scientifically analyzed the situation and tasks facing party building , elaborated in depth the extreme importance of enhancing the party 's governing and leading ability according to the requirements of the " three represents , " and laid down an important plan on completely advancing the new great project of party building .  
He revised the draft resolution over and over again , wrote such important sections as the " Cultural Revolution " by himself , fully implemented what was demanded by the second-generation leading collective with Comrade Deng Xiaoping as the core , seriously summed up the historical experience , correctly evaluated Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought , and made a major contribution to reaching a Party-wide common understanding .  
The organization work is an important component part of our democratic and political building ; and to make the party 's organization work to effectively serve the country 's central task of economic construction and to provide both a firm and powerful organizational guarantee and a personnel support for the country 's reform , opening up , and modernization building , we must adapt the party 's organization work to the needs of the situation , improve work methods , and strive to enhance the quality of both leading bodies and the contingent of cadres .  
Building up a high-quality , unified , and standardized central database for examination questions at the national level in line with high standards is a major way for enhancing the scientific level of examinations , and is also an effective measure for enhancing the work efficiency .  Examinations designed to serve the purpose of an open selection and promotion of leading cadres are different from those designed for national education , and also different from those designed for the employment of state functionaries .  
However , a handful of leading cadres have actually failed to withstand the tests and therefore swerved their ideals and belief , lost their revolutionary integrity , abused power for personal gain , accepted bribes in violation of laws , and become corrupt and degenerate .  
Given the new condition of opening to the outside world and vigorously developing socialist market economy , leading cadres should , just like a lotus , stick to the revolutionary integrity , keep honest and clean , and always be a loyal representative of the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people so that they can make due contribution to further improving party style , strengthening administrative honesty , and opposing corruption .  
To strengthen the awareness of leaders at all levels in leading troops in war , the group army has promoted innovations centered on existing equipment , explored the battle method of winning against the enemy 's superiority under an unfavorable situation ; mastered automated field operation command ; enhanced comprehensive quality of officers and men ;  
We should recommend the non-party cadres who possess both ability and political integrity and meet the requirements of being more revolutionary , younger in age , better educated , and more professionally competent to hold appropriate leading posts in the government and judicial organs at various levels , give support to their work , let them display their special skill and knowledge , and ensure that they have duties , powers , as well as responsibilities .  
Various democratic parties and personalities without party affiliation holding leading posts in government and judicial organs at various levels , taking part in the state power , and participating in the management of state affairs are an important feature of the democratic parties ' participation in public affairs , which is the concrete embodiment of multiparty cooperation and political consultation system and the organizational guarantee for the practice of this basic political system .  
In taking the lead in implementing the important concept of " three represents , " leading cadres should , above all , have firm ideals and convictions and take realizing the common ideal of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and achieving the long-term , grand communist goal as their unchangeable lifelong conviction and pursuance .  
In practicing the " three represents , " leading cadres must have a correct attitude toward work and bring about a major change in leadership methods and the style of work ; they must be truthful and realistic and do solid work in a down-to-earth manner ; and they must earnestly and vigorously carry out policies and measures and achieve actual results through unremitting efforts .  
In the course of studying the " three represents , " party committees of the armed forces and armed police units at and above the army level felt that party committees and leading cadres not only should act as model practitioners of the " three represents " but they should also shoulder the responsibility of guiding the party committees of subordinate military units in meeting the " three represents " requirements and advance party building in the military units in an all-round way .  
In the march toward the new century , in order to conscientiously implement Comrade Jiang Zemin 's requirement on the " three represents " and " comprehensively advance party building around the two major historical topics , that is , constantly raising our leading and governing ability and improving our ability to guard against corruption and degeneration and withstand risks , " it is necessary to thoroughly implement the principle of strictly administering the party and satisfactorily resolve the ideological , organizational , and work style problems that exist in our party .  
In the protracted and complex revolutionary struggle , our party , growing from small to big and from weak to strong , has become the force at the core leading the Chinese revolution and construction .  A fundamental experience is that we have always upheld the principle of strictly administering the party .  
In recent years , the Chinese military has greatly improved war readiness , training , routine work , living conditions , and other infrastructure conditions .  Basic construction in operational command at the army corps level organs , in war readiness duty , and in automatic network centers has taken initial shape , reached a relatively advanced level , thus providing excellent conditions and effective guarantees for leading organs to practice effective organization , command , and routine management over the troop units .  
It is necessary to safeguard the unity of leading groups to enhance the cohesion force of party committees , uphold collective leadership to strengthen the fighting force of party committees , stay honest , upright , and free from corruption to enhance the appealing force of party committees , and realistically build party committees at all levels into strong leading collectives which can consciously uphold and comprehensively practice the " three represents " .  
The central leading comrades concerned personally convened a conference , laid out arrangements for investigating and handling the matter , and required that it be treated as an especially important case in centralized activities to " eliminate pornography and fight illegal publications " .  
In light of the rampant momentum of illegal publishing activities , in December 1998 , with emphasis from the central leading comrades , the Director of the Working Group on " Eliminating Pornography and Fighting Illegal Publications " , Wang Maolin , convened a conference attended by a dozen or so central organizations .  The conference studies ways to make full use of legal weapons and increase the use of criminal penalties .  
The PLA General Political Department held a training course for the party secretaries of its directly subordinate units from 10 May to 15 June to conscientiously study and implement Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of " three represents " .  The training course aimed to further improve the ideological level and the ability of leadership of the secretaries and deputy secretaries of party committees , and to enhance the coherent force and the fighting capacity of the leading bodies of party committees .  
Even the leading cadres with workers ' or farmers ' backgrounds had raised their ideological and theoretical proficiency and knowledge and cultural qualities up to a considerable level through their diligent learning .  
In leading our army 's modernization , Comrade Jiang Zemin is applying Mao Zedong 's military thinking and Deng Xiaoping 's army-building thinking for the new period while adopting some new practices .  He has put forward the task of " ideological and political education " which is of great importance and epochal significance , emphasized the necessity to put ideological and political education above all else in the army , discussed in many ways how to strengthen ideological and political education , and advanced a series of important thinking .  
Ours is a huge country with very low starting point .  And with difficult tasks ahead , it would be very difficult for us to face with complex contradictions , to organize and guide hundreds and millions of people to plunge into fierce competition in the new century , to realize our grand goals , and to find a foothold for the Chinese nation if we do not have a large number of the " solid rock " leading cadres who are trusted and supported by the masses .  
At present and in a future period , we must continue to have leading cadres set self-discipline and be clean and honest , investigate cases of violating discipline and law , penetratingly correct unhealthy practice and make special efforts to handle corrupt cases .  In the mean time , we should prevent and stop corruption from the sources .  
Local party committees are responsible to the central leading body and shoulder the responsibility for comprehensively leading local political , economic , cultural , and social development .  
To give play to the role of local party committees as the core of leadership among all organizations at the same level through controlling the across-the-board situation and coordinating all quarters concerned , it is necessary to further reinforce the leading body of the local party committee itself , actually pursue democratic decision-making , and ensure collective leadership according to the principle of democratic centralism .  
Sometimes , members of the party leading groups in the municipal people 's congress standing committee , the municipal government , and the CPPCC municipal committee , as well as comrades in relevant departments , are also invited to the meeting so that the collective decision made by the standing committee may give full consideration to the needs of all quarters concerned .  The fourth category is " implementation " .  After a decision is made by the standing committee , responsibilities are also made explicit .  
In some localities today , there exist such phenomena as requesting for official positions , buying and selling official positions , being responsible to only superiors but not subordinates , currying favor with the powerful , adjusting behavior to the leading cadre 's expression .  A very important cause for such phenomena is that the selection and appointment of cadres are decided by a few persons only without being subject to an effective democratic supervision .  
Nevertheless , it should also be noticed that some leading cadres still do not have sufficient understanding about the importance of ideological and political work and that they grasp economic work in a relatively solid way but grasp the ideological and political work and the building of spiritual civilization in a relatively vague way .  
Since the end of the Cold War , in order to maintain its leading position as " the only superpower capable of lording it over " , the United States has gradually cultivated a global strategy such as " controlling two oceans and striking from both sides " in light of a new international strategic pattern .  
In 1986 , Qingdao started to openly select and appoint the deputy directors of its planning commission , economic commission and financial committee .  In 1993 , it selected deputy administrators and assistants from applicants all over the country for its five departments including the city 's science and technology commission , bureau for tourism , and high-tech industrial park .  In 1999 , it had selected and appointed six leading cadres at the deputy bureau chief level from applicants in the whole city .  
A group of universally recognized cadres who have both ability and political integrity and made outstanding administrative performances have clinched their leading posts by means of competition .  All this has generally lowered the average age of middle-ranking cadres in various city party and government organizations .  The educational level and the overall quality of these cadres are notably raised .  
This is aimed at helping party organizations further check , understand , and use cadres , discover and assist incompetent cadres , and make adjustments at an earlier stage .

The probation period is one year .  
The final statement and action program adopted by the first Southern Ministerial Meeting called for the establishment of a fair and rational international economic order , reform of the irrational international financial system and the unequal international trade system , and for the UN to play a leading role in the economic affairs of the world so that the developing countries would be able to participate more in global economic decisions .

A Japanese reporter said in the Tokyo Shimbun that the circum-Pacific military exercise in which the United States plays a leading role was designed to enhance the technological level of naval vessels in a decisive battle , but its nature has changed a great deal " .  " The recent military exercises are a part of the ' non-war military operations ' strategy drawn up by the US Army " .  
Instead of confining the research of the network offensive and defensive operation to leading organs and laboratories , this army unit has incorporated the subject into the training of its troops as a training content ; and this has enabled its troops to initially master the ability of conducting a network offensive and defensive operation .  
Apart from bringing true a seamless combination between the " soft " and the " tough " powers of the US strategy , high technologies have also , by making use technological export controls and related policies , found a strategic means that lies between the two powers , that is , the " dominating position of the United States " as described by Brzezinski . All this means that with a sustained effort , the United States will seek to keep firm control over the leading zone on the scientific and technological front in the 21st century .  
On the battlefield of the Liaoning-Shenyang Camp of the old days , a certain motorized infantry brigade conducted a special live-ammunition practice : Operating tanks , firing antiaircraft guns , and launching missiles , the " leading members " of the brigade 's party committee operated some 10 authorized main-battle firearms , and not a single shot missed its target ;  
In view of the some 100 specialties that had emerged under the new structure , the " leading members " of the brigade 's party committee focused their attention on a " combined capability " which proved to be a key link in the generation of fighting capacity , and issued a " written pledge " : Vying with one another to become " an expert in making a combined use of weapons " in studies , research , training , appraisals , and military exercises .  
The party 's central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core not only consistently upholds Deng Xiaoping Theory and holds high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , but has also enriched and developed Deng Xiaoping Theory in combination with the new conditions and new experience in the economic , political , scientific and technological , educational , cultural , ethnical policy , military , diplomatic , united front , and party building fields , and added new contents to scientific system of Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
To implement the policy of managing the party strictly , the most fundamental measure is to draw up a set of practical and binding rules and mechanisms to strengthen ideological and institutional construction at the same time , to give full scope to the role of party committees being the leading cores , the role of party branches being the fighting fortresses , and the role of party members being vanguards and models .  
After he assumed the post of executive vice minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , under the leadership and support of Premier Zhou , he intensified the building of the ministry 's leading body , upheld collective leadership , developed democracy , regularly held meetings on the ministry 's affairs and discussions on ideological guidelines , and instituted a system of daily meeting and timely report of the situation .

The achievements of the " Ninth 5-Year Plan " have been attained on the basis of the rapid developments of reform and opening up , which are not easily won .  They can fully demonstrate the super leading part of the Party 's third generation collective leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core in mastering the overall macroscopic situation , handling various complicated situations , and leading the people of the whole country to advance in a pioneering spirit .  
Scientific and technological progress and innovation are decisive factors for developing productive forces and are increasingly becoming the leading force for the economic and social developments .  Only by quickening scientific and technological progress and improving the capability of technical innovation can we promote structural readjustment , enhance the overall quality of national economy , and realize bigger development of social productive forces .  
In modern history , almost all debates on major issues concerning the country 's development orientation occurred against a background of domestic chaos or external threats or when the nation was facing profound crises .  In such circumstances , people did not have the objective environment for discussing such issues calmly and patiently .  As a result , people could not avoid reaching conclusions leading to rash actions for quick successes and instant benefits at the expense of long-term interests .  
When we are exultant at the great achievements made in the implementation of the Ninth Five-Year Plan and review the extraordinary course traversed by the people in the whole country under the leadership of the party central body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , we deeply feel that the party central leading body indeed has the superb ability to bring the overall situation under control and apply regulatory mechanisms to scientifically handle complicated situations while exercising leadership , and this was the fundamental guarantee for the great achievements in the implementation of the Ninth Five-Year Plan .  
The making of such a change was an important and timely strategic decision made by the party central leading body and the State Council according to its correct analysis of the domestic and international situation and development tendencies , with principal contradictions being grasped accurately .  
Chen Mingduan demanded that through the forum , all units popularize the experience and practice of advanced units in light of actual conditions and fully strengthen the building of grass-roots party branches of provincial military district units , so as to push forward the implementation of various tasks .  Chen pointed out the need to step up grass-roots party branch building ; properly select cadres and form leading bodies ; enhance training in the military and political quality of party branch members ; implement well party rules and regulations ;  
A number of large and medium cities seized the opportunity of the rapid development of capital construction , quickly building new large and medium leading projects to make products for both peacetime and wartime use , and building underground bomb shelters integrated with civilian buildings , for a simultaneous growth of war readiness , social , and economic efficiency .  
The ongoing vigilance education among our party and government leading bodies and leading cadres at and above the county level , which uses the negative examples of Hu Changqing , Cheng Kejie , and other major and typical cases as teaching material , is a major move we have taken to ensure the sound implementation of the guidelines put forward by the party Central Committee on running the party strictly .  
The entire process of Cheng Kejie 's moral degeneration has told us that although many factors led to his reduction from a high-ranking leading cadre to a typical corrupt element , it can not be denied that a major reason for Cheng Kejie 's moral degeneration was our failure to stress education , our failure to maintain tight control , and our failure to exercise close supervision .  
The Cheng Kejie case has exposed the weak links in our work , yet it has also given us a profound warning concerning our work : It is necessary to severely punish corrupt elements ; yet viewing from the angle of resisting corruption and guarding against moral degeneration , it is of a greater importance to impose strict education , strict control , and strict supervision on party-member leading cadres .  
Party organizations , governments , and departments in charge at all levels are required to inspect their work on a regular basis , including major incidents , emergencies , heavy economic losses , persons and affairs which have aroused strong resentment among the masses , as well as problems with relation to the families of leading cadres .  Based on the results of supervision and inspection , any party-member leading cadres found to be involved should be dealt with according to relevant responsibility affixation stipulations ;  
We should investigate and take actions against any leading cadre or any leading collective that has committed dereliction of duty in the building of a sound party style and clean administration and in anti-corruption work ; and if an individual leading cadre is found to be responsible , we should never allow anyone to shirk the responsibility on the excuse of collective responsibility , still less allow such a situation wherein no one is held responsible .  
Every communist , especially the leading cadres , must take warning from this , and truly succeed in being completely upright and uncorrupted , resist the lure of power , money , and sex with noble communist uprightness , and uphold and carry forward the quality and demeanor of communists .  
Whether or not we can uphold democratic centralism , regularly and consciously take up the weapon of criticism and self-criticism , and unfold active and healthy ideological struggle represent an important yardstick for measuring whether a leadership group is strong and effective and whether a leading cadre is truly upright .  
The party organizations at all levels must act in light of developments , proceed from the characteristics of leadership work at different levels and in different posts , and actively explore ways of exercising effective supervision over the leading cadres ; they should make efforts to enhance the level of supervision , to ensure that unhealthy trends are promptly and effectively discovered and corrected and that corrupt behavior is promptly exposed and deal with . 
In particular , the several prohibitions laid down by the central authorities must be carried out .  That is , spouses and children of leading cadres at the provincial ( ministerial ) and prefecture ( bureau ) levels are prohibited from engaging in any commercial and business activities that may cause conflicts with the public interests within the scope under the administrative jurisdiction of those leading cadres ;  
The fact that Cheng Kejie committed serious crimes once again showed that it is of critical importance to establish and perfect a whole set of scientific and rational mechanisms with binding force for management and supervising leading cadres in preventing and checking corruption .  
Each member of a leading body must be given explicit tasks and be subject to a well-defined scope of functions and duties .  Thus , no one is allowed to pass the buck irresponsibly or shift the blame onto others , and collective leadership can be properly combined with individual responsibilities in the division of work .  
This requires the maintenance of the democratic centralist system and the effective implementation of the collective leadership system and the regulations for making decisions through collective discussion .  The internal supervision and the check-and-balance capacity inside leading bodies must be increased .  
Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory shine in the annals of the public , which have recorded the glorious course traversed by the people of all ethnic groups in their arduous struggle led by the CPC , engraved the great achievements made in the process of creating and building socialism with Chinese characteristics , and crystallized the wisdom and strategies of the party 's three generations of leading collectives with Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping , and Jiang Zemin as their cores .  
The splendid achievements in the Ninth Five-year Plan period have again told the world the indisputable fact : Deng Xiaoping Theory is the great banner leading us from victory to victory , and the party 's third-generation leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has the superb leading ability of controlling the overall situation , dealing with all kinds of complicated situation , and leading all the people of the whole country in forging ahead in a pioneering spirit , and is a powerful and reliable leading collective .  
As far as party building is concerned , while ensuring the party 's leading status , how are we going to further perfect the party 's leadership , truly enhance the ideological and political quality of our cadres at all levels , ensure that our party is always the " loyal representative in three aspects " , and effectively curb the corrosive influence of corrupt phenomena on our party 's ranks of cadres ?  
In the use of personnel , we should persist in the correct guidance of " using personnel to meet the need in war " , train versatile personnel who know both management and command and who have both rich knowledge and practice experience , have the courage to use outstanding young cadres with better education , moral character , ability , and performance , and improve the structure of leading bodies to raise their overall quality .

They sufficiently respected , trusted and supported brigades and regiments in executing their rights for independently administering grassroots units , and allowed brigades and regiments to have leading roles in devoting efforts to grassroots units .  But some institutions above the level of division still adhere to traditional practices and outdated ways of thinking .  They believe that only when they promote a certain number of activities can they receive wide attention and only when they hold a certain number of meetings can they show their great concern .  
The " Proposal " elevates science and technology progress to the same high plane as reform and opening up and puts it forward as an impetus to national economic and social development .  This is a new improvement to the understanding of the impetus to the development of socialism , as well as an innovation and development in Deng Xiaoping Theory made by the third-generation central leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core .  
Since 1996 when the five-year northern border defense construction program was officially kicked off , leading organs concerned at all levels have laid emphasis on improving the border defense infrastructure , enhancing the use of high technologies in carrying out defense duties , strengthening the construction of basic command and communications networks , and boosting the rapid reaction capability to deal with emergency situations along the border .  For this , they have acquired funds from various sources and made an overall plan to work in a scientific way .  
Party committees and governments in all localities included the warmth-giving activities in their overall work arrangements .  In the whole country , 358,000 leading cadres at all levels set up fixed connection with 45,000 enterprises encountering business difficulties and 629,000 worker families living in difficult condition for helping and supporting them .  This further advanced the process of constantly carrying out the warmth-giving activities and institutionalizing such activities on the basis of taking them as regular social activities .  
Mao Zedong applied the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism in combination with concrete Chinese reality , to give accurate answers to a number of problems : the nature of society and revolution in China , the revolution 's leading class and its allies , China 's unique revolutionary road , etc .  While pointing the Chinese revolution in the right direction , he also creatively developed the theory of Marxism-Leninism .  
The party 's third-generation leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core , as a faithful , reliable , enterprising and promising successor to the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics initiated by Deng Xiaoping , has been leading the people of all nationalities cross the country in working hard together , keeping forging ahead and exerting themselves to make the country prosperous .  
" Special privilege " mentality , patriarchal style , obsession of hierarchy and other feudal things , in conjunction with the corrosion by decadent capitalist ideas and culture , have inflicted damage on the party building with regard to ideology , organization , and style of work , such that some leading cadres have obscured the nature and purpose of the party , even to the deterioration of the socialist democratic legal system .  
Therefore , leaders and institution cadres at all levels , cadres of grassroots units and cadets should all take the management education as a compulsory course , study it hard , temper themselves in a painstaking manner , continuously improving their abilities in organizing , planning , and guiding troops through the management education , fully master the basic methods , meet the requirements for scientifically leading and correctly managing soldiers , and become qualified leaders of soldiers in the new period .  
When moving into the new century , we have all reasons to believe that under the guidance of the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and under the strong leadership of the party central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , we will certainly be able to surmount all challenges and risks from either domestic or foreign factors , and the banner of socialism will flutter high on the vast land of China for ever .

"  
The Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission was rich in substance .  Take the question of honesty and self-discipline for example .  While upholding the existing regulations , the session put forward , in line with the basic rules of the socialist market economy , six moral requirements on leading cadres to ensure that they are honest in performing official duties .  
On the basis of inheriting and carrying forward the fine compositions of the thought of " rule by virtue " in ancient China and discarding the bad portions of the thought , the new type of " rule by virtue " takes serving the people as its core and collectivism as its principle , attaches importance to the functions of moral education and transformation with moral education , stresses the importance of selecting and promoting cadres with political integrity and professional ability , and enables leading cadres and state functionaries to play an exemplary role .  
To unite and ally all social strata , ethnic groups , political parties and groups to the greatest degree , and form an enormous and powerful revolutionary and constructive army is the fundamental strategy of the Communist Party of China in leading the people to fulfill national liberation and rejuvenation .  
In recent years , relevant mass organizations such as various democratic parties and associations of industry and commerce have gradually experienced political transitions where new leading members have replaced old ones , united and mutually beneficial national relations have been further consolidated , and major progress has been made in relations between religion and socialist society ; the most fundamental reason for all of this is that a high-quality contingent of non-party leaders has been cultivated .  
Since the 20 years of reform and opening up , we have attached prime importance to people 's right of existence in accordance with China 's national conditions , succeeded in realizing two historical leaps - - moving from poverty to having enough food and clothing and then to leading a comparatively comfortable life , and achieved comprehensive economic and social development .  World-shaking changes have taken place in China 's human rights situation , and China has been generally praised by the international community for these changes .  
Deputies Shi Yuxiao and Zhang Guochu held that today , facing the new task of regarding economic construction as the central task , the important thinking of Comrade Jiang Zemin on " three represents " has given a highly refined interpretation in fundamentally answering the questions of how to build the party , what kind of party to build , and how to act well as the " force at the core " in leading the cause of socialist modernization in the new historical conditions .  
The facts have fully proven that Deng Xiaoping Theory is forever the great banner guiding us in continually advancing from victory to victory , and that the party 's third-generation leadership collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has superlative skill and ability in mastering complex situations and leading socialist modernization , and is profoundly trusted and revered by the whole party , the whole army , and the people of all nationalities throughout the country .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin has scientifically summed up the historical experiences of the world socialist movement and of our party in leading the Chinese revolution and construction , and creatively put forward the important thinking on " three represents , " thus answering in scientific fashion a series of major issues that we face in stepping up party building in the new situation .  
Deputy Chen Jinbiao noted : Under the present new historical conditions , to judge whether the building of party organizations in the military has been reinforced , our ultimate criterion is to see whether the coherent force and the fighting capacity of the party organizations at all levels have been reinforced ; and whether the role of party committees as a leading core , the role of party branches as a powerful fighting force , and the exemplary vanguard role of party members have all been brought into full play .  
Reality shows that the third-generation leading collective of the Central Party Committee led by Comrade Jiang Zemin is a sophisticated leading core which is completely capable of mastering any kind of complicated situation and which carries the hopes of the Party and the nation on its shoulders .  Without such a solid leading collective , our nation would not be able to enjoy the current auspicious conditions .  
maintain sharp vigilance against the attempts of " westernization " and " disintegration " made by western hostile forces , and against the infiltration and erosion of such erroneous ideological trends as " the non-party affiliation of the army " ; resolutely resist the corrosive influence and the attacks of decadent ideologies and cultures ; and firmly defend the authority of the party 's leading collective of the third generation with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core .  
Although the " 17 August Communique limits the quality and quantity of weapons and notes that sales will be reduced , leading to " a final resolution " , this is based on the principle that Communist China will adopt a " peaceful solution " to the Taiwan issue .  If this basis is shaken or nonexistent , the United States will have sufficient reason to sell weapons to Taiwan according to the cross-strait military balance and Taiwan 's need .  
The leading body invited military technology experts to teach its members the military space technology , guided missile precision control and guide , automatic commanding technology , and other frontier military knowledge of the contemporary world .  Members of the leading body went deep into the training fields and launching pads to carry out technical practices and scientific and technological research , and to guide troops in completing a number of projects on scientific and technical drills .  
They upheld selecting the best of the best to correctly select and assign capable commanding officers for brigades and regiments , adopted various patterns to strengthen the training for the leading organs of brigades and regiments , implemented patterns like armies and divisions working together , members of party standing committees having division of labor , and so on to examine and assist the building of brigades and regiments one by one , and unfolded the activities of appraising through comparison the advanced brigades and regiments to fully mobilize the initiative and creativity of brigades and regiments .  
It is necessary to speed up the development of central and western China and , at the same time , continue to let eastern coastal areas play a leading role in promoting structural renovation , scientific and technological innovation , the process of opening up to the outside world , and economic growth .  This is an important part of and a strategic step toward the readjustment of the economic structure .  
In recent years , Communist China has rapidly promoted military modernization and its national strength has continued to grow , while economic and trade relations between the two sides of the strait have become increasingly closer .  Besides , the succession of Communist China 's leading power will also take place in the near future .

Quite a large number of cadres lack sufficient understanding of the current new situation and tasks in agricultural and rural economic development ; they are relatively slow to change their concepts , and are rather lacking in knowledge of market economy and agricultural science and technology ; they lack strong capability and methods for leading the peasant masses to carry out restructuring and develop the economy , and do not sufficiently play their role as leaders ;  
Nowadays , in Tibet , the new Tibetan leading clique represent the biggest vested interests , which are sharing interests with the Chinese communists in reality and acting as the most formidable opponent to Dalai . Especially , the Chinese communists have concentrated their united front work on lamaseries .  
On the other hand , sources from Jiangxi said that Shu Shengyou had actually lost his powers as provincial governor and did not perform any active duty .  The new provincial governor will be announced after the candidate is approved by the provincial people 's congress .  The two people 's dismissal from the top provincial leading positions was related to the explosion incident on 6 March in a primary school , where 42 people were killed .  
We must strictly hold the leading cadres concerned accountable for failure to attach importance to public order work , which results in major incidents or accidents , in inability to crack down for a long time on local major crimes and criminal forces , in failure to resolve major public order problems over a long period , and in failure to transform for a long time areas and units where public order is chaotic .  
Party committees and governments at all levels must provide the political and legal front with carefully selected cadres , who are ideologically and politically sound , proficient in professional work , bold and resolute , and able to meet the needs of the political and legal front , and strengthen the leading bodies at all levels of the political and legal front .  
The unexpected collision of US and PRC military aircraft at a point 140 km southeast of Hainan , leading to the PRC F-8 fighter plane crashing , and the US EP-3 reconnaissance plane making a forced landing at Lingshui Airbase , is a test of the crisis management ability of both the PRC and the US . It also makes it clear that the strategic partnership relationship is finished , and determines even more how the two regard each other as strategic competitors .  
At the meeting , attendees diligently studied the important speeches of Jiang Zemin , Zhu Rongji , and other central leading comrades concerning the work related to public order , as well as the spirits of the national public order work conference and the national work conference on rectifying and standardizing market economic order ; and mapped out arrangements for launching a nationwide struggle to strike hard and put things in order .  
The leading cadres at all levels shoulder heavy responsibility for comprehensively implementing the party 's basic line and adhering to the four cardinal principles ; they must take a firm and clear-cut stand on major issues of principle , keep clear heads amid complex struggle , strengthen their political sensitivity and political distinguishing ability , and wage resolute struggle against all phenomena that jeopardize party and state interests .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : In the future , if serious crimes and the activities of criminal gangs are not severely suppressed over a long period , if major law-and-order problems are not resolved effectively over a long period , if the chaotic conditions in public order are not changed over a long period , then local leading cadres and leaders of the relevant departments will be punished for neglecting their duties .  
During this ongoing fight against the evil forces , leading party and government comrades must act firmly , take a clear-cut stand , earnestly strengthen their organizational guidance , and carefully plan and organize every move so as to wipe out the evil forces completely , pull up their roots , deal ruinous blows to all forms of evil forces , and create a peaceful and harmonious environment that can facilitate the realization of the grand objective of national revitalization .  
The vicious growth of criminal syndicates and evil forces has become a prominent issue that affects China 's public security and social order .  It has also become a major disaster that prevents the people from leading a peaceful and happy life .  
Observers believe that the Chinese government carried out a reasonable , beneficial , and moral struggle in the process of handling this matter , and forced the downright hegemonic United States government to capitulate and admit that the American spy plane had encroached upon Chinese air space leading to the collision with a Chinese fighter plane and subsequent loss of its pilot .  The US government was compelled to make multiple expressions of regret , sadness , and apology , thereby strongly protecting China 's national dignity and the country 's sovereignty .  
First of all , leading cadres in the public security organs at and above the county ( section ) level must abide by the rule that their spouses and children are not allowed to get involved in the activities of independently running or joining others in running such entertainment businesses as singing and dancing parlors , game rooms , night clubs and such service businesses as bath rooms and massage rooms in the geographical areas where the leading cadres are performing duties ;  
When selecting candidates , we should consistently adhere to the standards and strictly guarantee the political quality of those to be promoted .  Outstanding female cadres who can fully , correctly , actively implement the party 's basic line , persistently take the role of socialism with Chinese characteristics , can distinguish the right from the wrong on major principle issues , and can withstand tests at critical junctures should be selected and promoted to leading bodies .  
Second , more female cadres should be appointed to the principal leading posts in party and government organizations , and in particular , candidates should be properly selected for the leading posts at the intermediate and higher levels .  Bold actions should be taken to select and promote outstanding young women to leading posts .  
The meeting required that party committees and organization departments at all levels should further unify thinking , enhance understanding , improve the style of work , effectively guarantee the fulfillment of the assignments , seize the opportune moment when local leading bodes at various levels will be changed , and raise the work of selecting , promoting , and training young cadres to a new level .  
Third , the reserve cadre contingent was strengthened to a new degree .  According to the working guideline of " replenishing leading bodies and strengthening reserve force , " through the procedures of democratic recommendation and strict evaluation by the party organizations , outstanding young cadres were added to the reserve cadre contingents at various levels .  These promising young cadres have good political quality and strong work ability , and they are now selected as candidates for leading positions at a higher level .  
Since the beginning of last year , more than 400 outstanding young cadres have been appointed to the leading positions at the provincial departmental level in more than 20 provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities by means of open recruitment from the general public ; meanwhile , more than 110,000 young cadres have been appointed to leading posts at all levels by means of competition .  
Those who deviate from the party 's basic line and behave in a double-dealing manner , those who fail to stand tests at critical moments of the political struggle or hold an ambiguous attitude in an attempt to dodge the struggle , those who disregard the interests of the party and the people and are only keen on seeking personal fame and power through getting official positions by means of bribery or currying favor with influential people or playing defrauds must not be allowed to enter leading bodies .  
Recently the Navy Party Committee adopted a decision on developing a wide-scale campaign in all naval units to emulate Wang Wei with the aim of leading the broad masses of officers and men to carry forward the spirit of unremitting struggle , faithfully fulfill their sacred missions , and make new contributions to defending the state sovereignty , safeguarding national dignity , and achieving the reunification of the motherland .

This caused strong repercussions in the whole plant .  
After water storage of the Three Gorges Project is completed , the water level will be raised by a dozen meters or even nearly 100 meters .  The original landslides , collapses , and deformed areas , and the stability of the banks will be affected , leading to a bigger possibility for occurrence of geological disasters .  
His violations of law and disciple are serious and disgusting and have given the public a very bad impression .  This is a typical case of a leading cadre of a law-enforcement department bending the law to serve personal interests and abusing official power for selfish ends .  A severe punishment is absolutely necessary .  
Some of the right wing figures in the moderate group even believed that , based on this , trade contact is helping to increase China 's overall national power and leading to an increased military threat of Taiwan by the mainland , and that the risk of the United States being involved in a regional conflict is even greater .  
With regard to the leading cadres and state organ personnel who exercised ineffective leadership in the special work to put things to rights , neglected their duties , or engaged in embezzlement must be sternly investigated and dealt with by the supervisory departments , and those who committed crime should be investigated to affix their criminal responsibility in accordance with the law .

The Chinese working class is indeed the representative of advanced social productive forces and production relations , is indeed the basic driving force that promotes social development and historical advances , is indeed the main force in the building of socialist material and spiritual civilization , and is indeed the leading class of the people 's republic .  
Such a judgment that sets academic backgrounds and knowledge against practice is a mentality of finding fault with and making excessive demands on high-quality talent ; and in the eyes of people with such a mentality , high-quality talent " are not bold and vigorous enough in their work but are holding themselves aloof , " lack mature skills in leading the troops , have insufficient drive in exercising control , and are engaged in impractical scientific research and studies .  
Apart from the fact that the mental concepts of certain cadres are outdated and they long for the stuff of planned economy , an important reason why regional blockades persist in some areas despite repeated prohibition is that instead of doing their work in a thoroughly sound way , certain leading cadres depend on improper methods such as regional blockades to pursue " achievements in their official career , " and do not hesitate to sacrifice the interests of the masses and the state for the sake of pursuing their own benefit .  
The leading cadres at all levels in all localities must seriously study General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents , " be faithful representatives of the development requirements of the advanced social productive forces and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people , and fully understand the harm done by regional blockades .

Local institutions for national defense education at provincial , prefectural , and county levels should conscientiously perform their duty of organizing , guiding , coordinating , and inspecting the work on national defense education within their own administrative divisions , under the unified leadership of the local committees for national defense education or leading groups for national defense education .

As market competition gets increasingly sharp , state-owned enterprises , especially state-owned large companies and enterprise groups must strive to become international advanced enterprises , have an accurate grasp of the changes in domestic and international markets and the development direction of leading technology , find out the gap with international advanced enterprises , formulate a scientific and rational development strategy and a technological innovation plan , and clearly define what they endeavor to catch up with and surpass and where they should develop themselves .  
If Taiwan takes all that is offered , an increase in its military strength is bound to inspire misgivings of the communist China , the two sides of the strait are bound to head for an arms race , and , no doubt , the current cross-strait relations will go from bad to worse .  The arms sales , in which the Chen Shui-bian Government believes it has achieved a major breakthrough , may become a cause leading Taiwan to wars .  
the development of enterprises in the war industry will promote the development of the US economy ; the building of the super shield will guarantee the United States ' absolute security and offset the nuclear deterring capacity of other nuclear states and shake off the binding of the anti-missile treaty , thus leading to the establishment of a new world security system with the United States at the center .  All these factors were included in the strategic consideration of the United States .  
The state of the leading bodies and cadres under their administration has a vital bearing on the party 's image and prestige among the masses and determines whether or not our nation 's economic construction and social undertakings can achieve sustained , healthy , and fast development .

Today , Tibet is enjoying fast economic growth , great social progress , a stable situation , a sound national unity , and a strong and consolidated border defense ; and its people are leading a happy and contended life .

According to sources , to speed the process of lowering the average age of leading cadres and ensure that officials at the provincial and ministerial level will be able to smoothly enter the CPC Central Committee at the 16th party congress next year , the CPC Central Organization Department has made a decision on completing major changes in the leading bodies of all provinces and ministries by the end of this year .  
At present , some incumbent provincial governors and ministers are close to the retirement age of 65 years , and may be asked to retire before the end of their current tenure .  The relevant central department decided that it should be arranged for younger cadres to take over their leading positions so that the successors may smoothly enter the new central committee at the 16th party congress to be held in October 2002 .  
Last year , the CPC 's personnel policy of lowering the average age of senior leading cadres was put into practice , and the changes were made mainly among officials at the level of provincial departments and the departments under the ministries .  This year , the cadre changes were moved up to the provincial and ministerial level .  
Reportedly , the main reason for arranging the retirement of ministers and provincial governors ahead of time was that these officials will reach or exceed the retirement age of 65 years by the time the CPC holds its 16th national congress next year , and they will no longer be able to remain in leading positions at that time .  If these people still remain in the current leading positions , they will be included in the name list of the new central committee membership , and this may prevent their successors from entering the central committee .  
Conducting propaganda and education on the socialist legal system in a thoroughgoing way and enhancing the legal sense and quality of the all the citizens , leading cadres at all levels in the first place , is an important aspect of the implementation of the basic general plan for managing the country according to the law and building a socialist country ruled by law and also an important task set by the 10th Five-Year Plan and an important legal guarantee for the implementation of the 10th Five-Year Plan .  
All comrades of the party , leading cadres at all levels in particular , must unceasingly enhance their legal sense and ability to act according to the law and strive to promote the improvement of the entire people 's legal sense and quality and lay a solid foundation for building a socialist country ruled by law .  
Attention should be paid to raising the theoretical level of the socialist legal system among large numbers of cadres , especially among the leading cadres , and increasing their ability to make decisions , perform their official duties , and exercise management according to law .  
There are 21 provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities that have formulated rules and regulations on the study and application of laws among the leading cadres , and have clearly defined that whether a cadre possesses necessary legal knowledge and whether he is capable of managing affairs strictly according to law should be taken as a major content for the assessment of his work performance .  
Zhang Fusen stressed that in performing the work of popularizing laws in the next five years , emphasis will be laid on the key points and efforts will be made to attain still more remarkable progress in the study and application of laws among the leading cadres , the training of civil servants , and the education on legal system among youngsters and students , so as to ensure that the popularization of laws will make a good start at a still higher standard in the new century .

In view of such a situation , the party 's leading collective of the second generation with Deng Xiaoping at the core successfully clarified confusions and brought things back to order in the political and ideological field , stood up to pressure , and removed all obstacles ; as a result , the ship of reform set sail smoothly .  
It is necessary to increase the pertinence of legal system education for leading cadres .  The practice of replacing laws with their own words or trying to transcend laws with the powers in their hands among a small number of leading cadres should be overcome .  Leading cadres should use their own exemplary behavior of abiding by the laws to influence the broad masses and promote the forming of a benign social atmosphere of studying , applying , observing , and safeguarding laws .  
Profoundly conducting legal system propaganda and education and enhancing the law-abiding quality of the entire citizens and first of all , leading cadres at all levels , is an important requirement and prerequisite for the implementation of the basic principle of governing the country on the basis of laws and building a socialist rule-by-law country , and is also an important task in the Tenth Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development . This also provides a legal guarantee for the implementation of the Tenth Five-Year Plan .  
The objective of the Fourth 5-Year Plan on Law Popularization is to realize " two points of improvement " and " two transformations .

He said : A Chinese intellectual should contribute his or her knowledge to the state , contribute ideas and proposals for national construction , and do down-to-earth work benefiting the country and the people .  
Under the condition of developing a socialist market economy , a qualified leading cadre must not only have a relatively high political quality and a relatively strong professional ability but must also have relatively high legal quality .  
They should associate strategies and policies issued by the central government with realities in their own region and department , combine needs with possibilities , unite the spirit of forging ahead with that of seeking the truth and being realistic .  They should align working enthusiasm with being scientific .  All comrades in the Party , particularly leading cadres , should work in a creative manner and use innovations in their leadership styles and skills to look toward a new horizon in building the Party and socialist modernization construction .

The united front made historic contributions to China 's revolution , construction , and reforms and scored brilliant achievements .  
Mao Zedong 's thinking on the untied front , Deng Xiaoping 's theory on the united front in the new period , and the theses of the party 's third-generation leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core on the united front provide the powerful ideological weapons for guiding the triumphant advanced of the united front .

One important reason , Jiang Zemin emphasized at the fourth plenary meeting of the Central Disciplinary Inspection Commission in January of this year , for the failure to prevent some negative and corrupt phenomena , increasingly serious in some cases , in the party despite repeated interdiction efforts has been the failure on the part of CPC organizations and leaders of some localities and units to strictly administer the party in the form of failing to strictly educate , manage , and supervise CPC-member cadres , especially leading cadres .  
Meanwhile , the consumption structure of cars in China has gradually changed from mainly institutional purchase to mainly individual purchase to meet various demands .  The increasing rise in the ratio of individual purchase of cars has determined the pattern of China 's car market .  That is , economic cars and medium-class cars should be the leading car models in the market .  
An informed source disclosed that , worried about their future , some ICAC personnel kept close to members of the Ministry of State Security in the period leading to 1997 , hoping to maintain their posts after Hong Kong 's reversion .  But the ICAC stayed unconnected with the Ministry of State Security after Hong Kong 's reversion , strictly banning private contacts between its subordinates and sensitive people .  If " violations of rules " are discovered among its subordinates , they will be thoroughly expelled from the commission .  
Since reform and opening up , urban and rural residents have increased their incomes by a relatively big margin , the masses have obtained actual benefits but , on the whole , the people 's living standards are still low , the laid-off staff and workers in cities and towns are leading a relatively difficult life , and more than 30 million people have not resolved the food and clothing problem yet .  Therefore , long-term and painstaking efforts are still needed to enhance the people 's living standards .  
All party-member leading cadres , especially high and middle-level cadres , should draw a profound lesson from Cheng Kejie 's case on discipline and law breaches , persist in paying attention to study , politics , and healthy trends , and firmly foster a correct world outlook , outlook on life , and the concept of value .  They must be able to stand the test of temptation and maintain forever the ideal , conviction and moral virtue of communist party members .  
In his speech , Zhang Bolin said : The changes in the principal leaders of the State Sports General Bureau were decided by the party central leadership for the purpose of promoting cadre exchanges to meet the actual needs in enhancing the leading body .  The decision was based on giving consideration to the general situation and was a normal change in the organizational work .  
Zhang Bolin also said : Yuan Weimin has been in the leading body of the State Sports Commission since 1984 .  He is politically firm , always willing to study , proficient in sports management , and has rich administrative experience and strong organizational and leading ability .  He works in a down-to-earth manner , firmly adheres to principles , has courage to manage things , and set strict demands on himself .  
The Shuguang 2000-II SuperServer is a major achievement in the State 863 Project and in the knowledge innovation project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences . Effecting major breakthroughs in its key technologies and in realizing its production , this super-server has attained the advanced level that similar products in the world attained at the end of the 1990 ' s , and has already edged into the international leading ranks in terms of machine operation systems .  
The strategy for large-scale development of western China , which President Jiang Zemin put forth early last year , and the national economic conference held late last year and the State Council conference held last January on developing the west all show that large-scale development of western China had become a common understanding of central and local leading hierarchies across the country .  
At the time when the heat wave of developing West China gradually ran high , the recently established leading group for the development of the western region under the State Council held a meeting , at which it was pointed out that on the basis of thorough investigation and study , it is imperative to draw up a realistic and feasible overall plan and some special plans now , and include them into the Tenth Five-Year Plan for national economic and social development .  
As analyzed by a pertinent expert , the reasons for the negative growth of foreign capital actually used in China last year were as follows : 1 ) Tremendous changes have taken place in the mode of international capital movement , and the international funds have returned to the developed countries , leading to the decline of direct investment in the developing countries .  
Due to these objective factors , neither the broad masses of people nor the leading elite of democratic movement has conducted profound thinking from a rational viewpoint before they adopt democracy , which is considered as a good medicine to cure China 's political and social problems .  As a result , the above-mentioned abnormal phenomena have been created .  In fact , no one should be blamed for the phenomena .

This is an important development of the party building theory made by the third generation of leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core .  It is also a practical issue that must be studied and resolved in order to uphold , strengthen , and improve party leadership under the new historical conditions .  The Shanghai municipal party committee must continue to play well the role of the core of leadership , commanding the whole situation and coordinating the efforts of all quarters .  
The first group of county ( municipal ) " three stresses " educational work have the following special characteristics : First , through emphasis on taking hold of theoretical learning , in particular conscientiously learning Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important ideology of the " three represents " , leading cadres have received a rather systematic theoretical education .  Second , leading cadres are living in the villages and going into the households resulting in extensive arousal of the masses to action , introduction of the " three stresses " , and warm welcomes by the masses .  
Following investigation , the discipline inspection and supervision departments of Chongqing Municipality maintained that former Fendu Country Secretary Gao Rongmiao , being the principal person responsible for improving the party 's work style and ensuring honest government administration , was negligent of management and supervision and that he is held for major leading responsibility in Huang Faxiang 's case that occurred in his term of office .  
Li Renfu , former head of Fendu County and incumbent deputy county secretary , was held for major leading responsibility in Huang Faxiang 's case that occurred in his term of office .  Besides , he also violated regulations in accepting " awards " and cash gifts .  He was dismissed from the posts as deputy secretary , member of the standing committee , and member , of the county party committee .  
Huang Faxiang 's wife Chen Zhiqiong , former Fengdu County deputy secretary , was held for major leading responsibility in issuing awards at random by the Fengdu County Financial Bureau and Local Taxation Bureau . She also violated regulations in accepting enormous amounts of " awards " and cash gifts , and in illegally allowing her husband to use 15,000 yuan of public funds .  She was expelled from the party .  
The party 's leading organs or grassroots organizations , the party 's organizations in both the enterprises and the rural areas , and our work in economic , scientific , technological , education , ideological , or political fields should embody in an all-round way the requirement of " three represents . "  
Things are greatly different in the modern society ; however , judging from the vicious criminal cases committed by juveniles in recent years , we can see that a major factor leading to the situation lies with the education of families and schools , lies with the impractical mentality of parents who " hope their children to become dragons one day " as well as their way to " push their children to become dragons , " and lies with our stress on an exam-oriented education in the past instead of a quality education .  
Can China 's cause of socialism be consolidated and developed ?  Can China remain powerful and prosperous in face of the acute international competition in the future ?  The key lies in whether or not our party is able to continuously train a large number of high-quality leading personnel .  
Right now , our party is ruling in a large nation with a population of more than 1.2 billion , Jiang Zemin pointed out .  Without a large number of leading cadres that combine political integrity with professional ability , it is definitely impossible to lead the people of all nationalities throughout the country to push forward our arduous cause of modernization under the complex international and domestic situation .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out that to build our party well , we must , in the first place , help our party 's leading cadres at all levels improve their ideological and political quality .  Particularly we must strive to help the middle-aged and young leading cadres improve their ideological and political quality so that they will become a new generation of statesmen who remain loyal to Marxism and unswervingly adhere to the socialist road with Chinese characteristics , and are capable of running the party and the country .  
Many units have organized leading officers to refute certain non-Marxist and anti-Marxist notions in society , analyze the root cause of the generation and dissemination of " Falungong " doctrines , reflect on the painful lessons learned from the degeneration of certain corrupt elements in the party , and fully understand the utmost importance of continuing to pursue their ideals and convictions and establishing the correct outlook on the world , life , and values .  
Second , in the past 20 years , a major factor leading to an increase in China 's total-factor productivity is a large-scale allocation of key production factors resulted from structural changes .  What are particularly important are the transfer of rural labor forces and other resources to township and town enterprises and to the secondary and tertiary industries in cities , as well as a rapid development in non-state-owned economies .  
We should attach great importance to the work , lay stress on key issues , work perseveringly and unremittingly , be practical results-minded , ensure that work is done in a down-to-earth manner , and ensure that leading bodies of public security , judicial , and procuratorial departments are truly strengthened and the overall quality of cadres and policemen is notably improved , so that they can more effectively perform the mission entrusted to them by the party and people .  
Third , we must work hard to build up a contingent of high-quality community workers ; and while giving full play to the role of existing committee cadres , we should also adopt effective measures to promptly replenish the contingent of community cadres .  Particularly , we should promote to the leading posts of communities a number of outstanding young cadres who have sound political qualities , a fairly high educational level , and a relatively strong work ability and who love the community work , so as to enhance the vigor and vitality of community leading bodies .  
Unremitting efforts should be made to build leading bodies of courts at all levels into a strong and powerful core of leadership that meets the " three represents " demand and that is able to shoulder the trans-century , historical , and heavy tasks so as to ensure that the judicial authority of the state is firmly grasped in the hands of the judges who are loyal to the party , the people , the Constitution , and the laws and in an effort to obviously improve the overall quality and judicial expertise of the courts .  
The Mukang public security frontier inspection station is just dozen kilometers away from the drug-growing center known as the " Golden Triangle . " Its main task is to inspect the entry and exit of personnel , vehicles , and goods through the Sino-Burmese border management zone using the 320 National Route leading to the interlined and crack down on all illegal and criminal activities in the zone .  
Having made achievements of world interest during the five decades since it came into power in leading the people in carrying out socialist revolution and construction as well as the reform and opening to the outside world and in unremittingly struggling to build a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized socialist modern country , our party is worthy of being the choice of history and the people .  
Viewed as a whole , all of our party 's efforts in leading the revolution , construction , and reform have been for emancipating and developing the productive forces and for advancing the development of China 's socialist democratic politics and culture and thus have complied with the objective law of social development , conformed to the advanced trends of development of the times , safeguarded the overall interests of the Chinese nation , and accorded with the fundamental demands of the masses of the people .  
When selecting members of leading groups of people 's courts at the grassroots level , intermediate and higher courts should provide conscientious assistance to local CPC committees .  They must make sure to select them from excellent judges .  
He stressed in particular : Law has entrusted to the various provincial ( regional , municipal ) governments the duty of ensuring the total area of farmland in their own administrative areas does not decrease .  This should be made an important index for assessing local party and government leaderships so that it will become a conscious action of leading cadres at all levels .  
At the same time , marked results were achieved in developing the contingent of ethnic minority leading cadres .  A large number of ethnic minority cadres with high political quality and courage for doing pioneering work were selected and appointed to leading posts at various levels .  
From the launching of party-wide activities to study Deng Xiaoping Theory and the effort to combat corruption , promote clean and honest administration , and severely punish corrupt elements to the launching of centralized education for leading bodies and leading cadres of the county - and sectional-level and upwards on the " stress on study , stress on politics , and stress on healthy trends , " the CPC 's third-generation collective leadership with Jiang Zemin as the core has been trying hard to answer this fundamental question theoretically and practically .  
Responsible official of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission stressed today that all party committees , governments , and discipline inspection and supervisory organs should strengthen the supervision over the behaviors of enterprise leading cadres in doing operational and managerial activities , should earnestly implement the relevant regulations on the responsibility system for building party style and administrative honesty , and should resolutely investigate and deal with without any lenient behaviors that have caused tremendous losses to the state due to duty dereliction .  
It was learned that the age limit for various leading posts set by the party Central Committee this time is mainly to make cadres younger and more intelligent and raise the quality of the ranks of cadres .  In the mean time , it is designed to enable new cadres to receive promotion earlier and encourage leading cadres of various units to adopt new thinking in their administration .  
Third , the legal system for urban and rural planning is unsound and the plans drawn up are lacking in authority .  Some leading cadres have a weak legal concept .  They make decisions as they please and do not act according to plan .  
In his " 20 May " inaugural speech , he made a comprehensive paraphrase of the new middle-of-the-road line and maintained that it would be a road leading Taiwan to a heavenly state as " an example in democracy and human rights in the world . "  After assuming presidency , he has also indeed worked hard for it .  
and heighten their own leading capability or decisionmaking standard .  Various areas should set clear-cut and concrete requirements for the leading cadres to go deep into the grassroots level ; live in the villages ; or call on the households ; should step up supervision and examination in this connection ; and should conscientiously carry out the work to the letter .  
The members of the central joint conference on the " three stresses " education and the leaders of the central inspection teams for the " three stresses " education , who were in Beijing , attended the conference at its main venue in Beijing .  The members of the leading groups in charge of the " three stresses " education and the members of the " three stresses " offices of various provincial ( regional , or municipal ) and prefecture ( city ) party committees ;  
The central authorities repeatedly stressed that the rate of progress should be subordinated to quality .  Stressing the importance of the " three stresses " education in counties ( cities ) is , in essence , determined by the specific important position of counties ( cities ) , and by the condition of the leading bodies and the rank of leading cadres at this level .  
The party and government leading bodies and leading cadres at the county ( city ) level are standing at the forefront of reform , development , and stability , have a direct link with the vast numbers of workers , peasants , and intellectuals , and directly assume the important tasks of carrying out the party 's line , principles , and policies in the grass roots of the urban and rural areas , which has a direct bearing on the image of the party and government among the masses .  
Under the main orientation of orderly and gradual development of Hong Kong 's democratic political system , the Basic Law lays down the method for producing the chief executive and legislative organs of the SAR , and there are clear regulations on the emergence and appointment of the chief executive and the leading officials .  
Shandong Province has changed the fixed mental attitudes of " noexamination unless at the changeover of term " and " examination means promotionfor the cadres " and instituted responsibility systems for annual targets andintensified the annual examinations ; in connection with the changeover of termof leading cadres , it has also readjusted and dealt with incompetent cadres andthose who have proven definitely inferior .  
Wei Jianxing emphasized : In undertaking the large-scale development of the western region , leading bodies at various levels should do better in making decisions in a democratic and scientific way ; all major decisions , such as those concerning construction and development , key construction projects , and defrayal of a large amount of funds , we must act according to the principles of democratic centralism , hold collective discussions , and carefully make decisions in order to prevent what a few leaders say counts or to avoid taking hasty decisions .  
To seize the crucial issue means to ensure leading cadres will take the lead in setting high demands on themselves , be impartial , upright , and honest , set good examples , and establish a good image before the people .  To lay a good foundation means to properly grasp the work at the grass-roots level .  
Making administrative affairs transparent , setting up a set of standards and mechanisms to restrict the use of powers , and making the use of powers transparent are channels through which the broad masses of the people are able to directly supervise the performances of the government in the most extensive manner .  Administrative transparency is not only conducive to supervising leading cadres but it can also provide a systematic guarantee for preventing " secret operations " and abuse of powers .  
After hearing the reports , the State Council leading comrades pointed out : The development of high-energy physics and advanced accelerators is of great significance to raising the standard of science and technology in the country .  We should continue listening to the ideas of domestic and foreign experts to achieve good results with relatively small investment by transforming existing facilities .  
established and perfected rules and regulations ; and have satisfactorily resolved many " long-standing , big , and difficult " issues which long defied solution .  Through the education and rectification activity , the vast numbers of cadres in leading organs have enhanced their political awareness and the awareness of responsibility , and have pledged one after another to set an example for the troops with their own conduct in fulfilling the requirement of " three represents . "  
striving to practice Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thought on the " three represents " ; on maintaining and carrying forward the fine tradition and work style of waging arduous struggles ; promoting honest administration and strict adherence to party discipline and state law among party and government leading cadres ; conscientiously implementing the policy of governing the party sternly ; earnestly strengthening education , management , and supervision of party members and cadres ; and maintaining the party 's progressive character .  
So , it is necessary to make evaluation , investigation of responsibility , and division of work into a coordinate process .  At present , prominent attention should be paid to major economic losses , serious accidents , and serious incidents cropping up due to leading cadres ' failure in improving party style and administrative honesty .  We should find out who is to blame for long-lasting serious unhealthy trends and investigate leading cadres ' spouses and children who abuse leading cadres ' functions and influential power to obtain unlawful benefits and to create bad influence .  
The report believes that although the Chinese communists ' military threat against our troops has changed from mere advantage in quantity to competition in quality , leading to a disparity between the two sides of the strait and the Chinese communists are eager to settle the " Taiwan issue , " thus imposing a greater threat to our security , both sides of the strait should still create conditions for cooperation with goodwill , jointly deal with the issue of " a future China , " and seek a win-win result on the basis of mutual trust .  
Reportedly , among the corrupt officials dismissed from the official posts in the first half of this year , the people with the highest rank were the four leading cadres at the department and bureau levels .  They were Du Baocheng ( department director level ) , former chairman of the Sizhuang Limited Company in Guangxi , who was suspected of taking bribes ;  
Secondly , the reform has cut internal bureaucracy and personnel through eliminating bodies unsuited for current work on the basis of functional adjustments and changes and eliminating and merging bodies characterized by excessive division of labor and functional overlapping , leading to an average personnel cut of 20 percent .  
The film exposes the disgraceful end of certain leading cadres who are unable to withstand the lure of desire for material things , fall into the abyss of evil , and embark on the path of crime , and reveals the ugly ways of corrupt elements in going all-out to rig up a network of connections , open a breach through people at the side of the leaders , and end up by dragging the leading cadres into the water .  
According to information , the province-wide centralized activity for admonitory education will last for two months from August to September . The educational subjects will mainly be leading bodies and leading cadres of party , people 's congress , administrative , Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference [ CPPCC ] , and judicial organs at or above the county level in the entire province ; people 's groups ; and enterprises and institutions .  Other party members-cum-cadres will participate in the study sessions and discussions at the same time .  
Huang Yuanzhi , standing committee member of the provincial party committee and secretary of the provincial discipline inspection commission , said : " It is very necessary to carry out admonitory education among party members-cum-cadres .  People like Cheng Kejie , Hu Changqing , and Jin Jianpei followed different orbits of transformation , but they had things in common .  They gave party members-cum-cadres these warnings : First , party members-cum-cadres , particularly leading cadres , must intensify theoretical study , and foster correct outlooks on the world , life , and value .  
As officials directly responsible for maintaining social stability , the leading comrades responsible for political and legal work and for comprehensive management of social order should vigorously organize and coordinate with all the departments concerned , share the work with individual responsibility , pool efforts , create a situation of everyone getting involved in the work , and promote the investigation and handling of contradictions and disputes .  
An informed figure revealed : To eliminate social destabilizing factors and tighten management over mass organizations , the CPC Central Committee Organization Department and the State Council 's Ministry of Civil Affairs recently issued a circular , urging all active-duty leading cadres to stop taking up concurrent posts in mass organizations .  However , it also simultaneously stressed that they must very carefully and prudently deal with mass organizations so as to avoid aggravating the contradictions .  
It has been learned : To prevent mass organizations from getting out of hand again since Beijing declared Falungong as a cult organization and banned it , China decided to tighten its management over mass organizations .  Previously , most mass organizations normally " invited " local officials to take up leading posts so that the organizations would sound more impressive .  Meanwhile , officials also liked to accept concurrent posts in mass organizations to show others that they " were treasured . "  
Yan Haiwang stressed that to intensify the ideological and political work , it is imperative to strengthen the leadership , so the leading bodies at all levels must persist in " stressing theoretical study , stressing political awareness , and stressing ethical conduct , " place the ideological and political work in an important position , establish and amplify the ideological and political work responsibility system , make regular study , step up examination , and earnestly " do two types of work simultaneously and attach equal importance to both . "  
( 7 ) in light of the five basic requirements that the " leading bodies are staunch and powerful , the party member cadres are pure and up to the mark , the work system of party building is sound , the mechanisms of ideological and political work are perfect , and the work performance is outstanding , " and the three basic conditions of " firm political stand , prominent professional abilities , and excellent work style , " launching activities on creating advanced grassroots party organizations and striving to be fine Communist party members ;  
4 ) Speed up the process of making the leading and ruling systems more scientific , democratic , and institutionalized ; perfect the supervisory mechanisms of the party , the masses , and the media so that those with the motive to commit craft can not do so .  
At the same time , he chaired a CIS summit and visited six CIS countries .  He settled the debt , gas shipment , common border defense issues with the countries concerned and , using security and energy cooperation as cohesive power , improved Russia 's leading role in the CIS . This has further solidified Russia 's security in the adjacent region and its strategic buffer zone .  
Confronted with the new situation marked by increasingly frequent updating and upgrade of naval weapon systems and equipment and their constantly rising technological level , the academy has given full play to the leading and service-ensuring roles of the ideological and political work in meeting the requirements of this new situation .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out : Both the international situation and the domestic situation are changing very rapidly and drastically , and our tasks are very arduous and complex .  To do a good job in reform and development and in ensuring stability , the leading cadres must possess a Marxist political sensitivity , know how to discover problems from a high political vantage point and solve them , and adhere to principle , take a systematic approach , and enhance their foresight and creativity in work .  
Appointment to posts by competition has now developed from being a transitional means in the early stage of instituting the civil servant system into a systematized and standardized method of selecting and employing people by which civil servants are promoted , posts rotate , and people are selected for popular posts ; and the scope of appointment to posts by competition has expanded from middle-grade leading cadres to non-leadership posts and departmental leadership posts .  
According to the current conditions in ideological and political work in the state security organs , Xu Yongyue put forward eight measures for reinforcing and improving ideological and political work , strengthening ideal and belief education , building and managing the cadre contingent , and consolidating leading bodies and grass-roots party organizations .  
This demands that the leadership groups and leading cadres of these institutes possess a high degree of political sensitivity and ability to make political distinctions ; they must take a firm and clear-cut stand on questions of political orientation and fundamental principles ; they must conduct education and put things right with regard to erroneous ideology and political viewpoints that run counter to regarding economic construction as the central task , to reform and opening up , and to the four cardinal principles ;  
Our party can certainly shoulder the historical heavy task of leading China 's socialist cause so long as we keenly grasp the demand for the development of China 's advanced social productive forces and the direction of China 's advanced culture and the fundamental interests and benefits of the overwhelming majority of people in China , do a good job in various work according the requirements of the " three represents , " and further improve the building of out party .  
Wang Zhaoguo emphasized that strengthening the training of young and middle-aged leading cadres among the democratic parties and establishing a contingent of high-caliber cadres of democratic parties is a strategic task with a vital bearing on the overall situation of multiparty cooperation , a basic guarantee for upholding and perfecting the system of multiparty cooperation and system of political consultation under the leadership of the CPC , as well as the pressing need for bringing into play the role of parties participating in the administration of state affairs and an effective measure for further realizing political handover .  
Leading bodies and leading cadres in colleges and universities have universally received education in basic Marxist tenets , party spirit , and party conduct and tempering in relatively strict inner-party political life and thus achieved new improvement in their ideological and political quality .  
In its effort to strengthen leading body construction and ideological and political work and build itself into a domestically first-class and internationally renown university , Beijing Institute of Technology conscientiously worked out numerous rules and regulations and adopted a lot of effective and practical measures .  After its rectification and reform plan was made public , the masses responded to it strongly and maintained that leaders of the institute had grasped the crux of the matter and something significant could be achieved in its development .  
While making positive contributions to economic development and social progress in countries in which they settle , overseas compatriots have supported China with great enthusiasm in many aspects : With their advantages in capital , technology , and talent , they have actively participated in the great practice of China 's reform and opening up and in the implementation of the strategy for the extensive development of the western region .  They have played a leading role and served as a bridge in China 's exchanges with foreign countries .  
During the first half of the year , State Council counsellors focused on the central work of the Party and the government , responding enthusiastically to the call from the CPC Central Committee for the " large-scale development of western China . " Eight separate groups made arduous journeys to the midwestern region - - particularly to frontier areas and poor areas - - to conduct survey studies , writing a number of high-quality research reports and making excellent suggestions , which won the high regard and full affirmation of leading comrades in the State Council .  
In order to enable the people 's congresses to further play their leading role in the building of legal system and provide perfect legal protection and better service to the large-scale western development , the " Seminar on Large-scale Western Development and Legal System Building " was held in Chongqing this morning , which was attended by the personalities in charge of the standing committees of the people 's congresses from various provinces , autonomous regions , and municipality in western China .  
In particular , since the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee , the party central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has set forth comprehensive and profound theses on cadre supervision around the two historical themes of enhancing the party 's leading and ruling capability and enhancing the party 's ability to resist corruption and degeneration and overcome risks , and has set forth explicit guidelines , basic principles , targets , and requirements for cadre supervision work in the new period .  
To strengthen supervision over leading cadres at the bureau level , the party leading group of the Xinhua News Agency formulated its " Opinion on Strengthening Supervision Over Leading Cadres at the Bureau Level , " explicitly specifying the contents of supervision and the measures for exercising such supervision .  The responsibilities for such supervision were also explicitly specified .  The Organization Department of the Hunan Provincial CPC Committee established and perfected a set of supervision system and built a set of effective check-and-balance mechanism for strengthening cadre supervision .  
It successively formulated regulations for prevention , admonition , warning , and penalties .  Various supervision measures were combined properly and implemented comprehensively .  Through more intensive ideological education , stricter internal supervision inside the leading bodies , effective organizational adjustments , and serious handling of problems and cases , the sense of self-discipline among leading cadres was raised and the effectiveness of organizational supervision was also enhanced .  
In Anhui Province , Jilin Province , and Zhengzhou City , information providers were appointed among people in various social circles so that the departments concerned could be aware of the opinions and comments from the masses in good time , and could take more relevant actions to strengthen and improve the supervision over leading cadres and over the work of selecting and appointing cadres .  All this has won favorable comments form the masses and the cadres .  
Zhi Xiaoquan , party committee secretary of an organ of Fujian 's provincial development planning committee , said , Cheng Kejie was a high-ranking leading cadre who abused his power and colluded with his mistress , Li Ping , to collect huge amounts of bribes , because he was never properly supervised .  This only proved that we need a sound supervision and restraining mechanism to control leading cadres , and in particular , we need to supervise and restrain the leading cadres who are in control of concrete power .  
Every year throughout the military , over one thousand leading cadres at or above the army level have gone among the soldiers to understand the situations , give guidance and lectures , answer and solve hot and difficult educational issues , and give effective guidance on education .  This has produced a lively situation where party committees have attached great importance to education , leaders have worked together to manage it , and officers and men participated in it enthusiastically .  
This responsible person noted that ever since the true features the " Falungong " as a religious cult were revealed , over 98 percent of the " Falungong " practitioners have seen the error of their ways and are determined to make a clean break with their past .  Today , they have successfully extricated themselves from Li Hongzhi 's spiritual control , and are leading a normal life .  
Only the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) was capable of leading the Chinese people to national independence , the liberation of the people , and the victory of socialism , and only by resolutely upholding the leading position of Deng Xiaoping theory in the entire Party and insisting unwaveringly on the Party 's basic line of " one center and two basic points " have we been able to achieve national revitalization , a strong and prosperous state , and happiness for the people .

From these discussions , they derived realistic enlightenment and education .  
To achieve economic development and across-the-board social progress , we must launch intensive education regarding the socialist legal system , raising the concept of the legal system on the part of all the people , but first of all the leading cadres at each level .  
The 15th national party congress called on the entire party to set off a new upsurge of studying Deng Xiaoping Theory , for which the central authorities have taken a series of important measures .

Leading enterprises are shouldered with the heavy responsibility of bringing along the growth of peasant households , exploring new markets , making scientific and technological innovations , and boosting the development of the regional economy .

George W . Bush , who was leading by a razor-thin majority in Florida early this morning , announced on television networks that he had won 25 electoral votes in Florida , accumulating more than 270 votes - - the threshold to be crossed for the presidency .

" Not only did they cause the foreign media to commit the same mistake , they also made many countries ' governments issue congratulatory messages by mistake , leading to major diplomatic blunders .

"  
With regard to the leading groups and leading cadres who failed to distinctly enhance their ideological understanding , fully mobilize the masses , and properly resolve their conspicuous problems earlier on , they should be examined one by one in the current activities of " reviewing the past " to have them resolved in a conscientious way .  As regards the problems which have been settled during the concentrated " three stresses " education but have cropped up again , solution should be worked out through intensified education , appropriate criticism , and proper handling .  
Due to the limitations of the country 's structure and mechanisms , the problem of regional barriers and departmental protectionism does exist , to a certain extent , with the use of the country 's urban cultural resources ; and there is no an authoritative and integrated leading organ to exercise an effective management , and there lacks an overall planning in its real sense .

"  
General Party Secretary Jiang Zemin pointed out that theoretical building is the basis for Party building , theoretical quality is the soul of the ideological and political quality of leading cadres , and strengthening the study of Marxist theory is still an urgent and important task confronting the whole party which must be pushed forward in a persistent way .  
With reference to these issues , the city party committee organized people concerned to earnestly study relevant documents and analyze the case example of former city mayor Mo Miaorong who took up the road of crime , and let the people concerned understand that under the new situation of carrying out reform and opening up and developing socialist market economy , in order to keep cool-headedness and withstand rigorous tests , leading cadres must stress study , politics , and healthy tendencies .

The people 's uniformity has tremendously increased in terms of fundamental interests , common ideals , and target of endeavor .  
First , we will conscientiously study the important speeches by Jiang Zemin and other central leading comrades as well as the relevant spirit of the current conference .

The collective corruption and dereliction-of-duty case of senior Shenyang City officials has only expedited the process of adjusting Liaoning provincial leading body .  
While continuing to investigate and deal with cases such as corruption , bribery , embezzlement of public funds , smuggling and peddling contraband , tax and foreign exchange fraud , and financial swindling , we must pay attention to investigating and handling serious cases of violations of political , organizational , and personnel discipline by leading cadres ; cases of serious dereliction of duty ; cases of leading cadres ' spouses , sons and daughters , and relatives taking advantage of the influence of the leading cadres ' powers and position to pursue illegal profit ;

In addition , because of the state 's limited financial power , public servants ' pay is low .  
Li : A report system on the family assets of leading cadres will be implemented in 2001 .  This system will first be enforced among provincial level cadres who will be required to report on their own assets and the assets of their spouses and of their sons and daughters .

Every leading cadre should correctly handle the relationship between the interests of the state , the collective , and the individual , pass the tests placed on them by their dependants and offspring , cultivate a noble and upright spirit , maintain an honest style of work , avoid being led astray by material or affections , build a strong ideological and ethical defense line , and enhance their capacity to reject corruption and prevent degeneracy .

The gravity of his discipline - and law-breaking act has seriously damaged the party and government 's prestige among the masses and resulted in bad political and social influence .

The system of leading cadres taking the blame and resigning should be comprehensively introduced .  Those leading cadres who are directly responsible for major cases of law or discipline violation should not only be given appropriate disciplinary penalties , but also offer to resign on their own initiative .  If such a person fails to tender his resignation himself , it is suggested that the people 's congress at the same level and its standing committee should dismiss or replace him .  
Some leading cadres , in pursuit of achievements in their official careers , engage in numerical tricks , submit false statistics to the higher authorities , and force the lower levels for high statistical figures , giving rise to local boastfulness , wasting hosts of human , material , and financial resources , and ruining the people 's interests .

he key to " raising the quality of procuratorial personnel " is to strengthen the development of leading bodies .  Poor-quality , indolent , and problematic leading bodies should be promptly readjusted , while leading procuratorial bodies at the provincial and municipal level should be gradually staffed by democratic party members and nonparty personages .  
To develop and invigorate a place , the key lies in whether or not the leading body can set an example for the rank-and-file and have a good ideological style , a correct line of thinking , and a correct direction .  The building of the ranks of public servants is of vital importance to establishing a good image for the government .  
It also should be noted that party organizations in some localities and units neglect to be strict with party members and to educate , manage , and supervise them and that some leading cadres " seek good relations with all and sundry at the expense of principle " and are too lenient and soft in enforcing the law and discipline for fear of offending others .  As a result , some phenomena of corruption which may have been checked through subjective efforts are not effectively suppressed .

The golden calligraphic characters on a dark ground , signifying " Green Garden , " are dwarfed by dazzling business signs nearby . Several wood steps leading down to a basement are flanked by high wood walls hung , here and there , with photos of youth activities .

They do n't just want to cover their bodies from the elements but also to express themselves in clothing . So as living standards increase , the textile industry is going to be more promising .

In the September issue of Life Magazine , a five-page feature story attacked the alleged profusion of counterfeit manufacturers operating out of the Republic of China . This article was later followed by two successive stories which appeared in Newsweek and the Asia Magazine respectively . Describing Taiwan as a " haven " for illegal manufacturing piracy , the reports seemed to imply that the nation was the leading culprit in this rampant international affliction .  
In light of the recent outcry against the counterfeit industry in the Republic of China , there are several verified facts that have not been properly addressed . According to international trade reports the leaders among counterfeiters in developing nations is Morocco , while among the developed nations , Japan and Italy were the leading offenders .  
There have been evident achievements over the last thirty years enabling traditional thought to compete on good terms with the current of practical thinking , which gives hope that it will be able to become the leading current in the future .  
Currently R . O . C . agriculture has major weaknesses . First , natural agricultural production can not compete with mechanized industrial production , leading to an outmigration of labor , which affects the ability of agriculture to continue to develop ; Second , small farm operations lack economy of scale , leading to a low return on resources , which in turn influences the raising of real incomes of farmers .  
Similarly , we forecast only 7.5% growth at the end of 1987 ; our growth rate should have increased with the global recovery , but the NT dollar appreciated faster than expected , leading to negative growth in exports to the U . S . , so the real growth rate of 7.33% was worse than anticipated .  
Wang served with Yin Chung-jung , K . T . Li , Chao Yao-tung , and other famous leading figures in the world of economics and finance .

This will enable Premier Lee to focus on mapping out the nation 's political and economic future .  
After the lifting of martial law , civil servants suffered blows mainly from two sides . One was policy instability caused by too rapid change and a lack of clarity in the laws . Another side rose out of the " psychological lifting of martial law , " raising consciousness of popular rights and leading to demands reasonable and unreasonable upon the government .  
It can not be denied , however , that the development of various aspects of society has brought about a number of problems that have not as yet been completely solved . For example , the adjustment of the adaptability of various government systems has not yet been completed , traditional rules of politics have been subject to strong attack , and the behavior standards of a democratic society have not yet been firmly established , leading to incidents of anomie and disorder .  
Good social welfare systems offer lifetime security , and geographical remoteness has spared people fierce economic competition from other countries of the world . As a result , Australians and New Zealanders are leisurely and carefree , but their economic growth has been rather slow . Their leading exports are still agricultural and mining products , and they rely on imports for most industrial and manufactured products .  
The problem is that our civil servants have not yet comprehended this shift , and are still stuck in the thinking and methods of the 1950 ' s . They just think about playing the leading role and telling others what they should do and ca n't do , which product to develop - - these are not official topics , so there are always conflicts with private entrepreneurs . In fact in many things the people are more capable than officials .  
This is because economic prosperity brought by industrial prosperity has led to luxuriant lives and long-term extravagant consumption of foods which are too rich and have too high a fat content , leading to overburdening the body 's organs , generating in turn obesity , high blood pressure , and diabetes .  
Yeh Ying-kun , former director of the Taipei Municipal Psychological Center , did a study in 1989 of psychological illnesses in the Taiwan area over the past thirty years . He discovered that though the incidence of schizophrenia has not changed , there has been an increase in psychosomatic disorders arising from interpersonal relations , confusion , fear and behavioral irregularities , leading to backaches , diarrhea , headaches , and so on .  
For most people , if there is only isolated pressure which is neither extreme nor sustained leading to headaches , heart palpitations , stomach disorders or soreness in the muscles , it 's not a serious problem . But if physically one has some inherited weaknesses , past illnesses or a relatively weak capacity to endure pressure , then it is very possible that an illness would be brought on or worsened when he or she is faced with relatively greater pressure or emotional change .  
The 1980 ' s was the takeoff period for the ROC information electronics industry . The Hsinchu Science Based Industrial Park and special regulations to reward industrial upgrading were put in place . This was timed just right to give many young scholars who had lived in the US for a few years and acquired great experience the chance to come back to found enterprises , leading to an unprecedented wave of returning talent .  
Early on , ch'i-p'aos were simple - - plain and somewhat oversized , still maintaining some of the character of a nomadic herding people . By the end , both the sleeves and the body of the ch'i-p'ao had become a bit tighter fitting , " says Ma Yu-chi , a famous leading lady of Peking Opera who grew up amid the social world on account of mandarins of her maternal grandfather 's position as a high-ranking Ching official .  
Koo Chen-fu , who has long been known as an " ambassador of trade " holds a similar view : " The main global economic organizations that we 're fighting to join at present now are GATT , which regulates the world 's free trading system ; the International Monetary Fund , which regulates the world 's financial system ; the World Bank , which assists in the development of developing countries ; and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , which is made up of the world 's leading industrialized countries . "  
And hot money , one of the two main factors leading to the disaster of speculative fever ( along with surplus money in circulation ) , has come back to Taiwan . People are just waiting for the opportunity to have their golden dreams again by taking advantage of currency exchange , the stock market and real estate .  
Apart from the ups and downs of the political economic situation , Schmidt especially stressed the pessimistic outlook for the environment , raising the problem of population growth and limited resources adding to the worsening of the greenhouse effect and leading to unlimited tides of human migration . "  
In particular , the influence of applied science on technological development has led to increasing global polarization - - countries with advanced science and technology are becoming increasingly wealthy as they turn out products with high profit margins , leading to greater economic growth and improvements in their quality of life , while countries that are weak in science and technology have had to spend a correspondingly greater amount in exchange for them , leading to sluggish economies and poorer living conditions .  
It 's too bad that negative population growth is n't quite so ideal as it appears on the surface , " says Chang Pei Chi , director of the Office of Man power Planning at Council for Economic Planning and Development of the Executive Yuan . A low birth rate leading to negative population growth will cause the population structure to be perverted into an inverse pyramid . Over time , society will quickly age and lose its vitality . Besides having streets filled with " white-haired old gentlemen , " many social problems will follow .  
For example , hsiang-chu singing copies after Peking Opera , with the tone high pitched and clear , using falsetto , with the same styles for the leading man and leading lady . The gestures and choreography are also more pronounced and defined . The music is performed according to fixed charts , which is quite different from the traditional Taiwanese ko-tzai-hsi where " the teacher gives the root , the actors improvise the branches " - - the actors on the stage and the musicians backstage play off and coor-dinate with each other .  
The main characters in these dramas were mostly country girls , women vendors , or actresses in dramatic troupes . The trademark Hsinhua film was a common love story built around these leading characters . Production was simple , and performance techniques were based on traditional Chinese opera or the singing techniques of folk songs . To these were added clever , catchy songs by the basic team of Yao Min , who wrote the music , Chen Tieh-yi , who composed the lyrics , and Yao Li , who sang the vocals offstage .  
Today geologists are also worried that additional extraneous factors of environmental change , such as the possible melting of glacial ice due to the greenhouse effect , leading to a worldwide rise in sea levels , may further exacerbate the problem , causing land to sink into the sea even faster .  
For someone who has never before been in con tact with drug addicts , the stereotype is closely connected to that of criminal society , with large dark eyebrows over brooding , threatening eyes leading into a violent , powder keg personality . Little did we expect that when we got to the rehabilitation center we would find that the patients were no different from the run-of-the-mill .  
Because tribal drinking is a social activity , if a local leading figure can be enlisted to set a standard and make a start by reducing quantities to a suitable level , in a short period of time results should be evident .  
But this journey is a distant one . Currently the population , lands and culture of the tribal villages are quickly disappearing . As a result , the tribal ceremonies have become mere formalities , put on only for reasons of tourism or politics ; the tribal lodges no longer exist ; the m other tongues and their oral literatures are gradually being forgotten ; traditional social structures have been broken apart ; and tribal elders , chiefs , and leading families have lost their positions of respect . A return to traditional culture would be difficult indeed .  
At present 25% of the national budget goes for defense and the military ; 20% goes toward economic development ; routine government administrative costs account for 10% ; 15% is applied to education . . . . The remaining few percent is up for grabs among public health , agriculture , social welfare , religious , and other interests , naturally leading to the " squeezing out " effect .  
Now , through the efforts of several dedicated teachers at Shuanglung primary school , Shuanglung village has set up a Bunun Cultural Development Association , and has launched a series of back-to-roots events , such as leading tribespeople on visits to the Bunun 's original home , organizing a traditional " eight-part singing " group and opening a cultural resources office .  
Hong Kong textbooks , which tend to adopt a pragmatic approach , do their utmost to avoid ideology . When describing historical incidents they mainly confine themselves to facts , and when talking about factors leading to conflicts they also do their best to avoid either laudatory or derogatory language , and try to bring out both positive and negative aspects .  
Mainland textbooks on the other hand stress the Communist Party of China 's development of an all-out resistance campaign behind enemy lines , stressing that " the Nationalist government , for fear of unleashing the great power of the people to resist the Japanese , only mobilized the government and the army in partial resistance , leading to severe military failures . The CPC implemented a total war of resistance , effectively complementing the Kuomintang 's overall military strategy and threatening the enemy 's rear . "  
Increasingly frequent interaction between mainland China and Taiwan , their respective political climates , and the new world order taking shape in the post-Cold-War era are of course important historical backdrops , but the ominous tone of the book 's title , and related historical events which the author used as examples , were factors leading to the sensation surrounding T-Day Many people who had never even read the book joined in the debate , some were even frightened to the point of making preparations to emigrate .  
In fact , outside the charmed circle of leading business families are large numbers of ethnic Chinese whose forebears came as laborers , and who still live at a low economic level with limited educational opportunities , just like the rest of the population . For many young women from this background , marriage is a means of escape from a life of poverty .  
" The so-called fashion of the times was always cyclical " says a leading interior designer in London . The styles were always going from elaborate to elegant , then your eyes would get bored and want elaboration again . The colors went from gay to somber , and after a while returned to gay .  
The Chinese dance tradition is broad and deep . In the Zhou dynasty , the government established official forms of music and dance , and viewed them as an integral part of education . In the Han , the court held ritual performances , and at banquets guest and host would take turns leading in dances .  
In making a new opera , characterization is very important , and the set character types of traditional opera are often insufficient . There 's nothing new about transcending these limitations by merging and melding traditional character types . Years ago Mei Lanfang combined traits of the qingyi ( leading female ) and huadan ( vivacious female ) roles to create a new type of role , the huashan , that combines features of both .  
In the Ming dynasty story " The Oil Peddler and the Plum Flower Girl " ( included in the collection Lasting Words to Awaken the World ) , the usually unruffled soul of the leading male character Qin Zhong is as if struck by lightning : " He stood dumbstruck for an age , his whole body limp and numb " - is that not what people today mean when they say someone is " love-struck " ?  
The White Paper on Youth released by the Executive Yuan 's National Youth Commission two years ago gave the results of a survey , showing that of parental attitudes toward their children , exploitation or abuse , too-severe discipline , contradictory parent-ing , differences in opinion between the two parents , breakdown of the family unit , worsening of the atmosphere in the family , low social status of parents , and incorrect values and attitudes toward society were the major factors leading to juvenile crime .  
Just as Emotional Intelligence author Daniel Goleman has observed , many social phenomena of the last few decades have revealed that neither academic achievement nor professional ability are the sole factors leading to success . Especially in modern corporations which emphasize organizational management , such qualities as emotional balance , personability and leadership are frequently more important .  
Shrines are everywhere on the broad yellow ground . There are many steps leading up the sharply rising platforms ( pyramid-like structures but level on top rather than coming to an apex ) , testing the endurance of tourists . The site also has the earliest astronomical observatory in Mesoamerica .  
In the days leading up to the takeover , one periodically reads of incoming chief executive Tung Chee-hwa admonishing Hong Kong people : Confucian culture must be strengthened , civic education is very valuable , family values must be reconstructed .  
The first book he ever bought himself was Stories from Chinese History . Later , when he studied at Chienkuo Boys High School , his happiest moments were browsing the second-hand book stores on Kuling Street with his classmates . This was a very popular place for literary youth of the 1960s and 70s to go . Reading books outside the main curriculum gave many people a rebellious or independent cast of mind , and cultivated many of today 's leading intellectuals and social elites .  
In the 1720s Burlington 's garden became something that had never been seen before . Its eastern section was in the formal classical style , with three radiating shaded avenues leading in straight lines to classical monuments . In the western part , though , Kent had created an irregular natural style , with groups of small trees and winding paths !  
When Attiret compared the Yuan Mingyuan to European gardens , he pointed out that what the Chinese liked were winding paths leading to secluded places , not straight tree-shaded avenues ; their exquisite river banks were made up of freely arranged groups of rocks showing great variety and a taste of the wilderness . Not only was this unlike the European way of making embankments out of square slabs , but there would even be small islands in the lakes joined by crooked bridges leading to pavilions .

The Sudan is also ready and willing to participate in the preparatory meetings leading to the forthcoming Ottawa Conference , which will hopefully commit those countries which have expressed their readiness to accept some constraints on the kind of landmine that can be used or sold , taking into consideration paragraphs 69 and 70 of the section on Disarmament and international security of the Final Document adopted at the Twelfth Ministerial Conference of the Movement of Non _ Aligned Countries held in New Delhi on 7 and 8 April 1997 . 
Of the major changes that have occurred in this century , there is no doubt that one of the most transcendent and revolutionary has been the gradual shift in the area of human rights away from the leading role traditionally played by the State and towards a new vision focused more on human beings than on the authorities wielding power .  
It is against this background of societies repeatedly traumatized by economic , social , cultural and other factors that such extreme situations develop , in which the breakdown of the institutional order opens the floodgates to widespread violence and massacres of the civilian population , frequently leading in the end to actual genocide .

In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would indeed have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
It was regrettable that racial hatred , intolerance , ethnic persecution and unchecked political ambitions were continuing to cause conflicts leading to such mass movements .  
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .

For this reason , while we are focusing on improving the party style and the ethical integrity among the leading cadres at and above the county ( department ) level , we must also seriously solve the conspicuous problems existing among the grassroots cadres , particularly the township ( town ) leading cadres .  Wei Jianxing emphasized : All the township ( town ) leading cadres across the country should keep firmly in mind the party 's purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly .  
During the theoretical study , the central study teams of the party committees at all levels of the Navy elaborated the major realistic issues in the Navy 's modernization program and preparations for military struggles to more than 100 specific topics for study and practice .  Focused on these topics , they guided the reading , investigations , research , exchanges , and application of the leading cadres at all levels .  
During study and discussion , these localities generally said that the speech made by General Secretary Jiang Zemin at Guangdong 's Gaozhou City and the speeches delivered by the six standing committee members of the Central Political Bureau in these six localities are profound , rich and realistic in content , out of an overall strategic consideration and in light of the actual situation of the building of the county ( city ) leading groups and the leading cadre ranks .  
The central leading comrades have come to the grassroots units , directly heard grassroots cadres ' briefings and pertinently pointed out problems .  This fact fully shows their understanding , trust and loving care of grassroots cadres , shows the high degree of importance attached by the Party Central Committee to the " three stresses " education at the county ( city ) level , shows their firm conviction in Marxism and the strategic vision of them as party and state leaders , and shows the correctness of the policy decision made by the Party Central Committee .  
The members of Jingyang County 's leading group said : In the past , we always thought economic work meant inflexible tasks and targets while the party building and the building of spiritual civilization were flexible tasks , dealing with ideological work , not " grain production . "  So , we did not have a profound understanding of the principle of " building both material and spiritual civilizations and attaching equal importance to both " and our understanding of it was lopsided .  
To our knowledge , these localities , after seriously studying and discussing the central leading comrades ' important speeches , made a further mobilization and set aside more than a week 's time for a concentrated theoretical study .  Following the extensive reading in the preceding stage , they practiced intensive reading , conducted special-subject education , and pondered theories in light of reality .  
The spouse and children of a leading cadre are prohibited from accepting any cash gifts , negotiable securities , and valuables by making use of the official authority or the official influences of this leading cadre ; prohibited from engaging in any business or enterprise-running activities in an area or within the professional scope under the jurisdiction of this leading cadre that may conflict with public interests ;  
China 's basic rural changes are attributable to the correct guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory and to the firm leadership of the third-generation leading core .  Zhulin has developed from a hillside village short of water and food into a modern town with all kinds of functions .  Its people , who had worked as farmers for generations , have become town dwellers who created and enjoyed modern civilization .  
The historical experiences gained by our party in leading the socialist cause have proved , from both the positive and negative aspects , that whenever the party represents the development demands of advanced productive forces , our cause will flourish and grow ;  
After the third plenary session of the 11th party central committee , the party 's second generation of leading collective with Deng Xiaoping at the core put forward the great goal of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , adhered to the party 's basic line of one center and two basic points , and scored achievements that attracted worldwide attention .  
A group of leading cadres in Liaoning Province who violated policies by occupying too many houses , illegally taking funds for housing purchases , illegally turning public houses into private ones , and using public funds to renovate houses beyond the standard were investigated and handled sternly .  Party and government disciplinary measures were taken against 62 cadres at or above the county department level in the province , and eight people were transferred to judicial organs to be investigated and affixed criminal responsibilities .  
However , if a grave turn of events occurs leading to the separation of Taiwan from China in any name , or if Taiwan is invaded and occupied by foreign countries , or if the Taiwan authorities refuse , sine die , the peaceful settlement of cross-Strait reunification through negotiations , then the Chinese Government will only be forced to adopt all drastic measures possible , including the use of force , to safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and fulfill the great cause of reunification .  
Hu Jintao emphasized that the key to seizing and using well the opportunity of the great development of the west to speed up economic and social development lies in doing a good job in building the party organizations at all levels ; in particular , the leading cadres at all levels must play a model role , firmly advance in the forefront of emancipating and developing the productive forces and promoting the building of the two civilizations , and unite and lead the masses to work hard together .  
The basic spirit of the speech is suited to the county ( or city ) level as well as to the leadership at various levels ; the speech is particularly aimed at improving the ideological and political qualities of leading cadres at various levels ; so it is of great practical and far-reaching historical significance .  
He then pointed out : In studying Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech , we should base ourselves on the purpose of enabling leading cadres at various levels to clearly understand the importance and necessity of doing a good job in conducting the " three stresses " education at the county ( or city ) level , on the purpose of improving the ideological and political quality of cadres at all levels , and on the purpose of solving problems in a down-to-earth manner .  
Some delegates indicated : During the current building of a spiritual civilization , the trend of promoting material progress to the neglect of cultural and ideological progress has yet to be checked permanently , and a major factor leading to such a situation is that the related legislation work remains relatively weak ; in view of such a problem , we ought to vigorously strengthen the legislation concerning the building of a socialist spiritual civilization .  
It is necessary to establish and perfect a system , under the unified leadership of the party committees , in which the party and government departments and the mass bodies share the work and coordinate with each other and the leading cadres at all levels take on dual responsibilities in their posts ; it is necessary to establish a work mechanism for integrating ideological and political work with work in all aspects , and to form a good " integration " of mutual stimulation between them .  
to ensure the implementation of the party 's basic line and basic policies systematically and legally ; to ensure the party will always give play to the leading and central role of controlling overall situation and of coordinating all interests .  To develop socialist democratic politics , there is a need to persist in the four cardinal principles , in the national policy of the people 's democratic dictatorship , and in the political body of the national people 's congress system .  
At a time when we are about to finish the first two steps , the party 's leading collective of the third generation has made the third-step strategic goals more specific , drawn up a new program , and clearly defined the goals of the new " three-step " strategy .  This will help people throughout the country to maintain their fighting spirit and to firmly , steadily , and in a down-to-earth manner , stride toward the grand goal of building China into a modern socialist country .  
In the fields of electronic information , new materials , biological engineering , integration of light , machines , and electricity [ guang ji dian yi ti hua , 0342-2623-7193-0001-7555-0553 ] , new energy sources , and environmental protection , the high-tech zones are more and more becoming important bases for the development of China 's high-tech industries and have played a active role in promoting industrial restructuring and in leading forward sustained economic development .  
We must keep a sober mind on this issue .  The leading comrades of the State Council have stressed the need for many times to make a proper use of the practice of " changing debt into equity , " for it is an effective means for us to assist key state enterprises with well-marketable products , a sound management foundation , and a broad development prospect to lower their liabilities ratio and to turn their deficits into profits .  
In the group study of the " three stresses " education , Party committee groups and leading cadres received deep Marxist theoretical education ; some prominent problems in the aspects of Party characteristics and Party working styles were touched and solved ; the Party 's excellent traditions and working styles were carried forth ; Party committee groups ' cohesiveness and fighting power were strengthened ; and people 's confidence in building socialism with Chinese characteristics and in the transcentury development of our military 's construction was strengthened .  
This should be of important theoretical and practical significance to our party under the new historical conditions in further strengthening self building , always maintaining advanced nature , leading the people of the whole country in waging concerted struggles , pushing forward reform and opening up and modernization building , and realizing the magnificent transcentury objectives .  
Speaking in this sense , the " three represents " is the foundation for our establishing the party , the source of our strength , and the basics of our life as well as the concrete embodiment of those excellent traditions of our Party like integrating theories with practice , maintaining close links with the masses , waging arduous struggles , and so on in the practice of our party leading the people to develop social productive forces , flourish advanced culture , and realize fundamental interests of the people and the intrinsic excellent characters of the party .  
To respond to the call of the grand western development , the provincial party committee and government are prepared to adopt the method of the " government putting up the stage and enterprises acting on it , " organizing and leading the enterprises having advantages to expand their businesses at low costs in the central and western regions with their own product brands , production lines , and funds , and help the hinterland develop its economy .  
This reporter learned from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the Ministry of Supervision that the discipline inspection and supervision organs of Qinghai and Hunan Provinces had strictly investigated and dealt with two typical cases of violation of the rules of integrity and self-discipline for leading cadres and the responsible persons concerned were subjected to stern party disciplinary actions and administrative punishments .  
Kuang Chushen , secretary of the leading party group and director of the audit bureau of Chenzhou City in Hunan Province ; Tao Jianzhong , deputy director of the audit bureau ; and Lei Yuande , deputy secretary of the leading party group and vice chairman of the city foreign trade and economic cooperation committee and deputy director of the committee 's foreign investment solicitation office , violated the rules by organizing a disguised overseas ( extraterritorial ) group tour at public expense , which resulted in the accidental death of a person .  
At present , party committees and governments at various levels in the central and western regions have come to fully realize their resources advantages for the development of tourism in their areas , and are unifying thinking and making greater determination to take the development of tourism as a major leading industry in the great development of China 's west by doing intensive and down-to-earth work .  
The " Honest Government Standards " formulated and implemented by the Party during the past few years have not only regulated political behavior for leading Party and government cadres under the socialist market economy , they also have advanced construction and development of the market economic system .  
It is hoped that leading cadres at all levels and comrades in the scientific and technological circles would further unify understanding , clearly identify their target , make joint efforts to promote the innovation of knowledge , and raise our basic research work to a new level in order to add brilliance to the world treasure-house of science and make greater contributions to China 's socialist modernization .  
Hosts of facts proved that through fabricating a set of heresies , Li Hongzhi absorbed and controlled spiritually a great number of kindhearted people who want to keep themselves strong and healthy .  At the same time , he trained his key members to establish a compact organizational setup and he himself sat in a leading position and gave remote controls and commands .  
According to a relevant leading official from the Ministry of Public Security , public security organs can fully and promptly prevent and discover security risks and loopholes in the construction and use of computer information systems through standardized , scientific , and fair assessments and supervision .  This will help to raise public security organs ' level of supervision and management of security protection for computer information systems .  
We have attached great importance to developing good neighborly and friendly relations , as well as relations of all-round cooperation , with Vietnam ; and are willing to make common efforts with Vietnam 's new leading collective in opening up a brighter future prospect for the relations between our two parties and two countries .  
The tremendous achievements in economic and social development , which have been attained in the past 20 years by Shenzhen , the special economic zone personally founded by Deng Xiaoping and formed with the painstaking efforts of the second and third generations of the leading collectives of the party 's central committee , are the powerful evidence of our party 's endeavor to act as the " Three Represents " in the new period , and have laid the solid foundation for Shenzhen to take the lead in basically realizing socialist modernization .  
The tremendous achievements in economic and social development , which have been attained in the past 20 years by Shenzhen , the special economic zone personally founded by Deng Xiaoping and formed with the painstaking efforts of the second and third generations of the leading collectives of the party 's central committee , are the powerful evidence of our party 's endeavor to act as the " Three Represents " in the new period , and have laid the solid foundation for Shenzhen to take the lead in basically realizing socialist modernization .  
In accordance with the arrangements of the central and provincial authorities , we have conscientiously organized the " three-stress " education and , combining it with the activities of setting up " united , clean , and good leading groups with a pioneering spirit " launched in the entire city , lost no time in resolving the problems unsuited to the new situation and new tasks facing the party building and the SEZ development .  
Structural readjustment of enterprises means to concentrate effective resources through the market on the industries that concern the state 's economic lifeline and whose scale merit is particularly evident to enable them to establish an appropriate scale of production and operation , so that they will become important industries of the national economy , the pillars of the essential areas , the leaders in economic restructuring , the representatives to international competition , and the leading forces in the state 's regulation and control of the state .  
In doing practical work , first political commissars should resolve problems in a timely manner , study and arrange the major work of reserve forces , clearly understand the ideological pulse of leading cadres , and organize and convene meetings to study and resolve major problems so as to ensure that reserve forces are developing toward a correct orientation .  
Early this year , in formulating plans for advanced scientific and technological training , leading members of the subdistrict held that the future advanced scientific and technological war would mainly be a theater battle .  The reserve forces and militiamen must be capable of providing highly efficient and swift logistical supply and give full play to their role of protecting the theater of war .  
The supervision and control of the leading cadres is a regular , arduous task that requires the relentless efforts of the party organizations at all levels , but it is also a real and urgent task that requires the party organizations to make very sure that the supervision and control measures are implemented in accordance with their supervisory and control duties .  
The 15th National Party Congress has formulated the strategic program of gearing the construction of a socialism with Chinese characteristics to the 21st century .  The completion of this new historical task depends on the leading groups and the leading cadres at all levels , on the continuous upgrading of their leadership standard and government standard , and on the continuous strengthening of their ability to resist corruption and degeneration , and on their work to further solidify the party and the people , so that together we can struggle to move forward with our grand undertaking .  
For the principal leading cadres at provincial and ministerial level to concentrate a period of time for specific discussions on some major issues of reform and development is an effective move adopted by the central authorities in order to enhance the ability of high-ranking cadres to implement the party 's line and principles and to manage the economy and society in the new situation .  
and we should take earnest steps to strengthen leadership over the ideological and political building in military academies , give priority to selecting highly capable cadres to form the leading bodies of military academies , and see to it that the school-running work can keep to its correct orientation and that the able personnel we bring up are all politically qualified .  
In recent years Comrade Jiang Zemin has repeatedly emphasized that leading cadres must stress study , politics , and healthy trends , work hard to enhance the ideological and political quality of the ranks of party members and cadres , do a good job in resolving problems of world view , view of life , and values , and firmly embrace correct ideals and beliefs .  
According a leading member of the State Civil Air Defense Office , as modern warfare principally is expressed in local hi-tech wars , nuclear and chemical protection is predicated on the safe use of the civil air defense engineering projects .  
Party members , especially leading cadres , must establish a correct world outlook , outlook on life and value , stress theoretical study , political awareness and good conduct , keep firmly in mind the party 's purpose , maintain close ties with the people , be clean and self-disciplined , oppose corruption , maintain the fine style of doing hard work , maintain a good spiritual state , and withstand the test of power , money and attractive women .  
Today , with the reforms and opening to the outside , only when leading cadres at all levels possess noble values , strive to become pure people , noble people , people detached from base interests , people benefiting the people , thinking what the masses think , feeling the anxiety of the masses , suffering first , enjoying later , content to live an austere life , and having far-reaching ambitions , can they unite and lead the masses to approach common prosperity sooner .  
On 18 May , at a report meeting on " three stresses " and " review and reexamination " among leading bodies at the municipal level , Jia Qinglin , member of the CPC Central Political Bureau and secretary of the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee , required that party organizations at all levels of the municipality implement the " three represents " requirement set forth by General Secretary Jiang Zemin in their firm and correct implementation of the party 's line , principles , and policies and in the strict enforcement of party discipline .  
Zhang Lichang , secretary of the municipal party committee , said that leading cadres at all levels must stand at the high plain of historical development to fully understand the urgency of implementing the important concept of " three represents " in close connection with the profound changes in the domestic and international situation and with the actual conditions of Tianjin 's work , further emancipate people 's minds , further break new ground and make new progress , grasp opportunities , and develop by leaps and bounds .  
Yu Yongbo said : From a overall-situation and strategic perspective , Chairman Jiang 's important speech scientifically analyzed the situation and tasks facing party building , elaborated in depth the extreme importance of enhancing the party 's governing and leading ability according to the requirements of the " three represents , " and laid down an important plan on completely advancing the new great project of party building .  
He revised the draft resolution over and over again , wrote such important sections as the " Cultural Revolution " by himself , fully implemented what was demanded by the second-generation leading collective with Comrade Deng Xiaoping as the core , seriously summed up the historical experience , correctly evaluated Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought , and made a major contribution to reaching a Party-wide common understanding .  
The organization work is an important component part of our democratic and political building ; and to make the party 's organization work to effectively serve the country 's central task of economic construction and to provide both a firm and powerful organizational guarantee and a personnel support for the country 's reform , opening up , and modernization building , we must adapt the party 's organization work to the needs of the situation , improve work methods , and strive to enhance the quality of both leading bodies and the contingent of cadres .  
Building up a high-quality , unified , and standardized central database for examination questions at the national level in line with high standards is a major way for enhancing the scientific level of examinations , and is also an effective measure for enhancing the work efficiency .  Examinations designed to serve the purpose of an open selection and promotion of leading cadres are different from those designed for national education , and also different from those designed for the employment of state functionaries .  
However , a handful of leading cadres have actually failed to withstand the tests and therefore swerved their ideals and belief , lost their revolutionary integrity , abused power for personal gain , accepted bribes in violation of laws , and become corrupt and degenerate .  
Given the new condition of opening to the outside world and vigorously developing socialist market economy , leading cadres should , just like a lotus , stick to the revolutionary integrity , keep honest and clean , and always be a loyal representative of the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people so that they can make due contribution to further improving party style , strengthening administrative honesty , and opposing corruption .  
To strengthen the awareness of leaders at all levels in leading troops in war , the group army has promoted innovations centered on existing equipment , explored the battle method of winning against the enemy 's superiority under an unfavorable situation ; mastered automated field operation command ; enhanced comprehensive quality of officers and men ;  
We should recommend the non-party cadres who possess both ability and political integrity and meet the requirements of being more revolutionary , younger in age , better educated , and more professionally competent to hold appropriate leading posts in the government and judicial organs at various levels , give support to their work , let them display their special skill and knowledge , and ensure that they have duties , powers , as well as responsibilities .  
Various democratic parties and personalities without party affiliation holding leading posts in government and judicial organs at various levels , taking part in the state power , and participating in the management of state affairs are an important feature of the democratic parties ' participation in public affairs , which is the concrete embodiment of multiparty cooperation and political consultation system and the organizational guarantee for the practice of this basic political system .  
In taking the lead in implementing the important concept of " three represents , " leading cadres should , above all , have firm ideals and convictions and take realizing the common ideal of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and achieving the long-term , grand communist goal as their unchangeable lifelong conviction and pursuance .  
In practicing the " three represents , " leading cadres must have a correct attitude toward work and bring about a major change in leadership methods and the style of work ; they must be truthful and realistic and do solid work in a down-to-earth manner ; and they must earnestly and vigorously carry out policies and measures and achieve actual results through unremitting efforts .  
In the course of studying the " three represents , " party committees of the armed forces and armed police units at and above the army level felt that party committees and leading cadres not only should act as model practitioners of the " three represents " but they should also shoulder the responsibility of guiding the party committees of subordinate military units in meeting the " three represents " requirements and advance party building in the military units in an all-round way .  
In the march toward the new century , in order to conscientiously implement Comrade Jiang Zemin 's requirement on the " three represents " and " comprehensively advance party building around the two major historical topics , that is , constantly raising our leading and governing ability and improving our ability to guard against corruption and degeneration and withstand risks , " it is necessary to thoroughly implement the principle of strictly administering the party and satisfactorily resolve the ideological , organizational , and work style problems that exist in our party .  
In the protracted and complex revolutionary struggle , our party , growing from small to big and from weak to strong , has become the force at the core leading the Chinese revolution and construction .  A fundamental experience is that we have always upheld the principle of strictly administering the party .  
In recent years , the Chinese military has greatly improved war readiness , training , routine work , living conditions , and other infrastructure conditions .  Basic construction in operational command at the army corps level organs , in war readiness duty , and in automatic network centers has taken initial shape , reached a relatively advanced level , thus providing excellent conditions and effective guarantees for leading organs to practice effective organization , command , and routine management over the troop units .  
It is necessary to safeguard the unity of leading groups to enhance the cohesion force of party committees , uphold collective leadership to strengthen the fighting force of party committees , stay honest , upright , and free from corruption to enhance the appealing force of party committees , and realistically build party committees at all levels into strong leading collectives which can consciously uphold and comprehensively practice the " three represents " .  
The central leading comrades concerned personally convened a conference , laid out arrangements for investigating and handling the matter , and required that it be treated as an especially important case in centralized activities to " eliminate pornography and fight illegal publications " .  
In light of the rampant momentum of illegal publishing activities , in December 1998 , with emphasis from the central leading comrades , the Director of the Working Group on " Eliminating Pornography and Fighting Illegal Publications " , Wang Maolin , convened a conference attended by a dozen or so central organizations .  The conference studies ways to make full use of legal weapons and increase the use of criminal penalties .  
The PLA General Political Department held a training course for the party secretaries of its directly subordinate units from 10 May to 15 June to conscientiously study and implement Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of " three represents " .  The training course aimed to further improve the ideological level and the ability of leadership of the secretaries and deputy secretaries of party committees , and to enhance the coherent force and the fighting capacity of the leading bodies of party committees .  
Even the leading cadres with workers ' or farmers ' backgrounds had raised their ideological and theoretical proficiency and knowledge and cultural qualities up to a considerable level through their diligent learning .  
In leading our army 's modernization , Comrade Jiang Zemin is applying Mao Zedong 's military thinking and Deng Xiaoping 's army-building thinking for the new period while adopting some new practices .  He has put forward the task of " ideological and political education " which is of great importance and epochal significance , emphasized the necessity to put ideological and political education above all else in the army , discussed in many ways how to strengthen ideological and political education , and advanced a series of important thinking .  
Ours is a huge country with very low starting point .  And with difficult tasks ahead , it would be very difficult for us to face with complex contradictions , to organize and guide hundreds and millions of people to plunge into fierce competition in the new century , to realize our grand goals , and to find a foothold for the Chinese nation if we do not have a large number of the " solid rock " leading cadres who are trusted and supported by the masses .  
At present and in a future period , we must continue to have leading cadres set self-discipline and be clean and honest , investigate cases of violating discipline and law , penetratingly correct unhealthy practice and make special efforts to handle corrupt cases .  In the mean time , we should prevent and stop corruption from the sources .  
Local party committees are responsible to the central leading body and shoulder the responsibility for comprehensively leading local political , economic , cultural , and social development .  
To give play to the role of local party committees as the core of leadership among all organizations at the same level through controlling the across-the-board situation and coordinating all quarters concerned , it is necessary to further reinforce the leading body of the local party committee itself , actually pursue democratic decision-making , and ensure collective leadership according to the principle of democratic centralism .  
Sometimes , members of the party leading groups in the municipal people 's congress standing committee , the municipal government , and the CPPCC municipal committee , as well as comrades in relevant departments , are also invited to the meeting so that the collective decision made by the standing committee may give full consideration to the needs of all quarters concerned .  The fourth category is " implementation " .  After a decision is made by the standing committee , responsibilities are also made explicit .  
In some localities today , there exist such phenomena as requesting for official positions , buying and selling official positions , being responsible to only superiors but not subordinates , currying favor with the powerful , adjusting behavior to the leading cadre 's expression .  A very important cause for such phenomena is that the selection and appointment of cadres are decided by a few persons only without being subject to an effective democratic supervision .  
Nevertheless , it should also be noticed that some leading cadres still do not have sufficient understanding about the importance of ideological and political work and that they grasp economic work in a relatively solid way but grasp the ideological and political work and the building of spiritual civilization in a relatively vague way .  
Since the end of the Cold War , in order to maintain its leading position as " the only superpower capable of lording it over " , the United States has gradually cultivated a global strategy such as " controlling two oceans and striking from both sides " in light of a new international strategic pattern .  
In 1986 , Qingdao started to openly select and appoint the deputy directors of its planning commission , economic commission and financial committee .  In 1993 , it selected deputy administrators and assistants from applicants all over the country for its five departments including the city 's science and technology commission , bureau for tourism , and high-tech industrial park .  In 1999 , it had selected and appointed six leading cadres at the deputy bureau chief level from applicants in the whole city .  
A group of universally recognized cadres who have both ability and political integrity and made outstanding administrative performances have clinched their leading posts by means of competition .  All this has generally lowered the average age of middle-ranking cadres in various city party and government organizations .  The educational level and the overall quality of these cadres are notably raised .  
This is aimed at helping party organizations further check , understand , and use cadres , discover and assist incompetent cadres , and make adjustments at an earlier stage .  Since August 1995 , Qingdao has implemented a probation system to place all newly selected and appointed leading cadres at the deputy bureau chief level on probation .  The probation period is one year .  
The final statement and action program adopted by the first Southern Ministerial Meeting called for the establishment of a fair and rational international economic order , reform of the irrational international financial system and the unequal international trade system , and for the UN to play a leading role in the economic affairs of the world so that the developing countries would be able to participate more in global economic decisions .  
To get a grip on one key , leaders are required to play an exemplary role .  Meanwhile , leading cadres should set strict demands on themselves , be just and upright , honestly perform official duties , play an exemplary role , and foster a good image among the people .  
That is , with information as the leading factor , attention is paid to laterally renovating or improving the existing system of weapons so that they will be universally applicable and there will be a linkage between them .  This will facilitate accurate access , timely transmission and effective process and use of information , enhance the combined force of attack of the firepower system , thereby raising the overall efficiency of the weaponry and combat system .  
A Japanese reporter said in the Tokyo Shimbun that the circum-Pacific military exercise in which the United States plays a leading role was designed to enhance the technological level of naval vessels in a decisive battle , but its nature has changed a great deal " .  " The recent military exercises are a part of the ' non-war military operations ' strategy drawn up by the US Army " .  
Instead of confining the research of the network offensive and defensive operation to leading organs and laboratories , this army unit has incorporated the subject into the training of its troops as a training content ; and this has enabled its troops to initially master the ability of conducting a network offensive and defensive operation .  
Apart from bringing true a seamless combination between the " soft " and the " tough " powers of the US strategy , high technologies have also , by making use technological export controls and related policies , found a strategic means that lies between the two powers , that is , the " dominating position of the United States " as described by Brzezinski . All this means that with a sustained effort , the United States will seek to keep firm control over the leading zone on the scientific and technological front in the 21st century .  
On the battlefield of the Liaoning-Shenyang Camp of the old days , a certain motorized infantry brigade conducted a special live-ammunition practice : Operating tanks , firing antiaircraft guns , and launching missiles , the " leading members " of the brigade 's party committee operated some 10 authorized main-battle firearms , and not a single shot missed its target ;  
In view of the some 100 specialties that had emerged under the new structure , the " leading members " of the brigade 's party committee focused their attention on a " combined capability " which proved to be a key link in the generation of fighting capacity , and issued a " written pledge " : Vying with one another to become " an expert in making a combined use of weapons " in studies , research , training , appraisals , and military exercises .  
The party 's central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core not only consistently upholds Deng Xiaoping Theory and holds high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , but has also enriched and developed Deng Xiaoping Theory in combination with the new conditions and new experience in the economic , political , scientific and technological , educational , cultural , ethnical policy , military , diplomatic , united front , and party building fields , and added new contents to scientific system of Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
To implement the policy of managing the party strictly , the most fundamental measure is to draw up a set of practical and binding rules and mechanisms to strengthen ideological and institutional construction at the same time , to give full scope to the role of party committees being the leading cores , the role of party branches being the fighting fortresses , and the role of party members being vanguards and models .  
After he assumed the post of executive vice minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , under the leadership and support of Premier Zhou , he intensified the building of the ministry 's leading body , upheld collective leadership , developed democracy , regularly held meetings on the ministry 's affairs and discussions on ideological guidelines , and instituted a system of daily meeting and timely report of the situation .  
The new leading body of the Beijing Military Representatives Bureau conducted in-depth investigation and held a " forum on weaponry development " in late August with the participation of leaders and relevant experts from the offices of science , technology and industry for national defense , in five provinces and cities in northern China , all military enterprises , and military representatives offices stationed in various enterprises and jointly discussed plans with them on scientific research and development of military products .  
The achievements of the " Ninth 5-Year Plan " have been attained on the basis of the rapid developments of reform and opening up , which are not easily won .  They can fully demonstrate the super leading part of the Party 's third generation collective leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core in mastering the overall macroscopic situation , handling various complicated situations , and leading the people of the whole country to advance in a pioneering spirit .  
Scientific and technological progress and innovation are decisive factors for developing productive forces and are increasingly becoming the leading force for the economic and social developments .  Only by quickening scientific and technological progress and improving the capability of technical innovation can we promote structural readjustment , enhance the overall quality of national economy , and realize bigger development of social productive forces .  
In modern history , almost all debates on major issues concerning the country 's development orientation occurred against a background of domestic chaos or external threats or when the nation was facing profound crises .  In such circumstances , people did not have the objective environment for discussing such issues calmly and patiently .  As a result , people could not avoid reaching conclusions leading to rash actions for quick successes and instant benefits at the expense of long-term interests .  
When we are exultant at the great achievements made in the implementation of the Ninth Five-Year Plan and review the extraordinary course traversed by the people in the whole country under the leadership of the party central body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , we deeply feel that the party central leading body indeed has the superb ability to bring the overall situation under control and apply regulatory mechanisms to scientifically handle complicated situations while exercising leadership , and this was the fundamental guarantee for the great achievements in the implementation of the Ninth Five-Year Plan .  
The making of such a change was an important and timely strategic decision made by the party central leading body and the State Council according to its correct analysis of the domestic and international situation and development tendencies , with principal contradictions being grasped accurately .  
Chen Mingduan demanded that through the forum , all units popularize the experience and practice of advanced units in light of actual conditions and fully strengthen the building of grass-roots party branches of provincial military district units , so as to push forward the implementation of various tasks .  Chen pointed out the need to step up grass-roots party branch building ; properly select cadres and form leading bodies ; enhance training in the military and political quality of party branch members ; implement well party rules and regulations ;  
A number of large and medium cities seized the opportunity of the rapid development of capital construction , quickly building new large and medium leading projects to make products for both peacetime and wartime use , and building underground bomb shelters integrated with civilian buildings , for a simultaneous growth of war readiness , social , and economic efficiency .  
The ongoing vigilance education among our party and government leading bodies and leading cadres at and above the county level , which uses the negative examples of Hu Changqing , Cheng Kejie , and other major and typical cases as teaching material , is a major move we have taken to ensure the sound implementation of the guidelines put forward by the party Central Committee on running the party strictly .  
The entire process of Cheng Kejie 's moral degeneration has told us that although many factors led to his reduction from a high-ranking leading cadre to a typical corrupt element , it can not be denied that a major reason for Cheng Kejie 's moral degeneration was our failure to stress education , our failure to maintain tight control , and our failure to exercise close supervision .  
The Cheng Kejie case has exposed the weak links in our work , yet it has also given us a profound warning concerning our work : It is necessary to severely punish corrupt elements ; yet viewing from the angle of resisting corruption and guarding against moral degeneration , it is of a greater importance to impose strict education , strict control , and strict supervision on party-member leading cadres .  
Party organizations , governments , and departments in charge at all levels are required to inspect their work on a regular basis , including major incidents , emergencies , heavy economic losses , persons and affairs which have aroused strong resentment among the masses , as well as problems with relation to the families of leading cadres .  Based on the results of supervision and inspection , any party-member leading cadres found to be involved should be dealt with according to relevant responsibility affixation stipulations ;  
We should investigate and take actions against any leading cadre or any leading collective that has committed dereliction of duty in the building of a sound party style and clean administration and in anti-corruption work ; and if an individual leading cadre is found to be responsible , we should never allow anyone to shirk the responsibility on the excuse of collective responsibility , still less allow such a situation wherein no one is held responsible .  
Every communist , especially the leading cadres , must take warning from this , and truly succeed in being completely upright and uncorrupted , resist the lure of power , money , and sex with noble communist uprightness , and uphold and carry forward the quality and demeanor of communists .  
Whether or not we can uphold democratic centralism , regularly and consciously take up the weapon of criticism and self-criticism , and unfold active and healthy ideological struggle represent an important yardstick for measuring whether a leadership group is strong and effective and whether a leading cadre is truly upright .  
The party organizations at all levels must act in light of developments , proceed from the characteristics of leadership work at different levels and in different posts , and actively explore ways of exercising effective supervision over the leading cadres ; they should make efforts to enhance the level of supervision , to ensure that unhealthy trends are promptly and effectively discovered and corrected and that corrupt behavior is promptly exposed and deal with . 
In particular , the several prohibitions laid down by the central authorities must be carried out .  That is , spouses and children of leading cadres at the provincial ( ministerial ) and prefecture ( bureau ) levels are prohibited from engaging in any commercial and business activities that may cause conflicts with the public interests within the scope under the administrative jurisdiction of those leading cadres ;  
The fact that Cheng Kejie committed serious crimes once again showed that it is of critical importance to establish and perfect a whole set of scientific and rational mechanisms with binding force for management and supervising leading cadres in preventing and checking corruption .  
Each member of a leading body must be given explicit tasks and be subject to a well-defined scope of functions and duties .  Thus , no one is allowed to pass the buck irresponsibly or shift the blame onto others , and collective leadership can be properly combined with individual responsibilities in the division of work .  
This requires the maintenance of the democratic centralist system and the effective implementation of the collective leadership system and the regulations for making decisions through collective discussion .  The internal supervision and the check-and-balance capacity inside leading bodies must be increased .  
Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory shine in the annals of the public , which have recorded the glorious course traversed by the people of all ethnic groups in their arduous struggle led by the CPC , engraved the great achievements made in the process of creating and building socialism with Chinese characteristics , and crystallized the wisdom and strategies of the party 's three generations of leading collectives with Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping , and Jiang Zemin as their cores .  
The splendid achievements in the Ninth Five-year Plan period have again told the world the indisputable fact : Deng Xiaoping Theory is the great banner leading us from victory to victory , and the party 's third-generation leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has the superb leading ability of controlling the overall situation , dealing with all kinds of complicated situation , and leading all the people of the whole country in forging ahead in a pioneering spirit , and is a powerful and reliable leading collective .  
As far as party building is concerned , while ensuring the party 's leading status , how are we going to further perfect the party 's leadership , truly enhance the ideological and political quality of our cadres at all levels , ensure that our party is always the " loyal representative in three aspects " , and effectively curb the corrosive influence of corrupt phenomena on our party 's ranks of cadres ?  
In the use of personnel , we should persist in the correct guidance of " using personnel to meet the need in war " , train versatile personnel who know both management and command and who have both rich knowledge and practice experience , have the courage to use outstanding young cadres with better education , moral character , ability , and performance , and improve the structure of leading bodies to raise their overall quality .  
The number of leading cadres at prefectural and city ( departmental and bureau ) level that received regular legal training topped 176,000 .  
All of the five cases were tracked out by Guangzhou City this year .  Among them , the four criminal cases concluded by the city intermediate court even startled the national leading group for wiping out pornography and cracking down on illegal publications and were major cases with a nationwide impact in the area of wiping out pornography and cracking down on illegal publications .  
They sufficiently respected , trusted and supported brigades and regiments in executing their rights for independently administering grassroots units , and allowed brigades and regiments to have leading roles in devoting efforts to grassroots units .  But some institutions above the level of division still adhere to traditional practices and outdated ways of thinking .  They believe that only when they promote a certain number of activities can they receive wide attention and only when they hold a certain number of meetings can they show their great concern .  
The " Proposal " elevates science and technology progress to the same high plane as reform and opening up and puts it forward as an impetus to national economic and social development .  This is a new improvement to the understanding of the impetus to the development of socialism , as well as an innovation and development in Deng Xiaoping Theory made by the third-generation central leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core .  
Since 1996 when the five-year northern border defense construction program was officially kicked off , leading organs concerned at all levels have laid emphasis on improving the border defense infrastructure , enhancing the use of high technologies in carrying out defense duties , strengthening the construction of basic command and communications networks , and boosting the rapid reaction capability to deal with emergency situations along the border .  For this , they have acquired funds from various sources and made an overall plan to work in a scientific way .  
Party committees and governments in all localities included the warmth-giving activities in their overall work arrangements .  In the whole country , 358,000 leading cadres at all levels set up fixed connection with 45,000 enterprises encountering business difficulties and 629,000 worker families living in difficult condition for helping and supporting them .  This further advanced the process of constantly carrying out the warmth-giving activities and institutionalizing such activities on the basis of taking them as regular social activities .  
Mao Zedong applied the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism in combination with concrete Chinese reality , to give accurate answers to a number of problems : the nature of society and revolution in China , the revolution 's leading class and its allies , China 's unique revolutionary road , etc .  While pointing the Chinese revolution in the right direction , he also creatively developed the theory of Marxism-Leninism .  
The party 's third-generation leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core , as a faithful , reliable , enterprising and promising successor to the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics initiated by Deng Xiaoping , has been leading the people of all nationalities cross the country in working hard together , keeping forging ahead and exerting themselves to make the country prosperous .  
" Special privilege " mentality , patriarchal style , obsession of hierarchy and other feudal things , in conjunction with the corrosion by decadent capitalist ideas and culture , have inflicted damage on the party building with regard to ideology , organization , and style of work , such that some leading cadres have obscured the nature and purpose of the party , even to the deterioration of the socialist democratic legal system .  
Therefore , leaders and institution cadres at all levels , cadres of grassroots units and cadets should all take the management education as a compulsory course , study it hard , temper themselves in a painstaking manner , continuously improving their abilities in organizing , planning , and guiding troops through the management education , fully master the basic methods , meet the requirements for scientifically leading and correctly managing soldiers , and become qualified leaders of soldiers in the new period .  
When moving into the new century , we have all reasons to believe that under the guidance of the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and under the strong leadership of the party central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , we will certainly be able to surmount all challenges and risks from either domestic or foreign factors , and the banner of socialism will flutter high on the vast land of China for ever .  
Recently , a leading Taiwan official openly claimed that cross-strait transport links are " special international routes " and " the formulation that cross-strait links are domestic routes is absolutely unacceptable , " adding that this has involved the serious issue of so-called " national prestige . "  
The Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission was rich in substance .  Take the question of honesty and self-discipline for example .  While upholding the existing regulations , the session put forward , in line with the basic rules of the socialist market economy , six moral requirements on leading cadres to ensure that they are honest in performing official duties .  
On the basis of inheriting and carrying forward the fine compositions of the thought of " rule by virtue " in ancient China and discarding the bad portions of the thought , the new type of " rule by virtue " takes serving the people as its core and collectivism as its principle , attaches importance to the functions of moral education and transformation with moral education , stresses the importance of selecting and promoting cadres with political integrity and professional ability , and enables leading cadres and state functionaries to play an exemplary role .  
To unite and ally all social strata , ethnic groups , political parties and groups to the greatest degree , and form an enormous and powerful revolutionary and constructive army is the fundamental strategy of the Communist Party of China in leading the people to fulfill national liberation and rejuvenation .  
In recent years , relevant mass organizations such as various democratic parties and associations of industry and commerce have gradually experienced political transitions where new leading members have replaced old ones , united and mutually beneficial national relations have been further consolidated , and major progress has been made in relations between religion and socialist society ; the most fundamental reason for all of this is that a high-quality contingent of non-party leaders has been cultivated .  
Since the 20 years of reform and opening up , we have attached prime importance to people 's right of existence in accordance with China 's national conditions , succeeded in realizing two historical leaps - - moving from poverty to having enough food and clothing and then to leading a comparatively comfortable life , and achieved comprehensive economic and social development .  World-shaking changes have taken place in China 's human rights situation , and China has been generally praised by the international community for these changes .  
Deputies Shi Yuxiao and Zhang Guochu held that today , facing the new task of regarding economic construction as the central task , the important thinking of Comrade Jiang Zemin on " three represents " has given a highly refined interpretation in fundamentally answering the questions of how to build the party , what kind of party to build , and how to act well as the " force at the core " in leading the cause of socialist modernization in the new historical conditions .  
The facts have fully proven that Deng Xiaoping Theory is forever the great banner guiding us in continually advancing from victory to victory , and that the party 's third-generation leadership collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has superlative skill and ability in mastering complex situations and leading socialist modernization , and is profoundly trusted and revered by the whole party , the whole army , and the people of all nationalities throughout the country .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin has scientifically summed up the historical experiences of the world socialist movement and of our party in leading the Chinese revolution and construction , and creatively put forward the important thinking on " three represents , " thus answering in scientific fashion a series of major issues that we face in stepping up party building in the new situation .  
Deputy Chen Jinbiao noted : Under the present new historical conditions , to judge whether the building of party organizations in the military has been reinforced , our ultimate criterion is to see whether the coherent force and the fighting capacity of the party organizations at all levels have been reinforced ; and whether the role of party committees as a leading core , the role of party branches as a powerful fighting force , and the exemplary vanguard role of party members have all been brought into full play .  
Reality shows that the third-generation leading collective of the Central Party Committee led by Comrade Jiang Zemin is a sophisticated leading core which is completely capable of mastering any kind of complicated situation and which carries the hopes of the Party and the nation on its shoulders .  Without such a solid leading collective , our nation would not be able to enjoy the current auspicious conditions .  
maintain sharp vigilance against the attempts of " westernization " and " disintegration " made by western hostile forces , and against the infiltration and erosion of such erroneous ideological trends as " the non-party affiliation of the army " ; resolutely resist the corrosive influence and the attacks of decadent ideologies and cultures ; and firmly defend the authority of the party 's leading collective of the third generation with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core .  
Although the " 17 August Communique limits the quality and quantity of weapons and notes that sales will be reduced , leading to " a final resolution " , this is based on the principle that Communist China will adopt a " peaceful solution " to the Taiwan issue .  If this basis is shaken or nonexistent , the United States will have sufficient reason to sell weapons to Taiwan according to the cross-strait military balance and Taiwan 's need .  
The leading body invited military technology experts to teach its members the military space technology , guided missile precision control and guide , automatic commanding technology , and other frontier military knowledge of the contemporary world .  Members of the leading body went deep into the training fields and launching pads to carry out technical practices and scientific and technological research , and to guide troops in completing a number of projects on scientific and technical drills .  
They upheld selecting the best of the best to correctly select and assign capable commanding officers for brigades and regiments , adopted various patterns to strengthen the training for the leading organs of brigades and regiments , implemented patterns like armies and divisions working together , members of party standing committees having division of labor , and so on to examine and assist the building of brigades and regiments one by one , and unfolded the activities of appraising through comparison the advanced brigades and regiments to fully mobilize the initiative and creativity of brigades and regiments .  
It is necessary to speed up the development of central and western China and , at the same time , continue to let eastern coastal areas play a leading role in promoting structural renovation , scientific and technological innovation , the process of opening up to the outside world , and economic growth .  This is an important part of and a strategic step toward the readjustment of the economic structure .  
In recent years , Communist China has rapidly promoted military modernization and its national strength has continued to grow , while economic and trade relations between the two sides of the strait have become increasingly closer .  Besides , the succession of Communist China 's leading power will also take place in the near future .  All those factors have increased the attention of people at home and abroad to the question of arms sales to Taiwan by the United States .  
Quite a large number of cadres lack sufficient understanding of the current new situation and tasks in agricultural and rural economic development ; they are relatively slow to change their concepts , and are rather lacking in knowledge of market economy and agricultural science and technology ; they lack strong capability and methods for leading the peasant masses to carry out restructuring and develop the economy , and do not sufficiently play their role as leaders ;  
Nowadays , in Tibet , the new Tibetan leading clique represent the biggest vested interests , which are sharing interests with the Chinese communists in reality and acting as the most formidable opponent to Dalai . Especially , the Chinese communists have concentrated their united front work on lamaseries .  
On the other hand , sources from Jiangxi said that Shu Shengyou had actually lost his powers as provincial governor and did not perform any active duty .  The new provincial governor will be announced after the candidate is approved by the provincial people 's congress .  The two people 's dismissal from the top provincial leading positions was related to the explosion incident on 6 March in a primary school , where 42 people were killed .  
We must strictly hold the leading cadres concerned accountable for failure to attach importance to public order work , which results in major incidents or accidents , in inability to crack down for a long time on local major crimes and criminal forces , in failure to resolve major public order problems over a long period , and in failure to transform for a long time areas and units where public order is chaotic .  
Party committees and governments at all levels must provide the political and legal front with carefully selected cadres , who are ideologically and politically sound , proficient in professional work , bold and resolute , and able to meet the needs of the political and legal front , and strengthen the leading bodies at all levels of the political and legal front .  
The unexpected collision of US and PRC military aircraft at a point 140 km southeast of Hainan , leading to the PRC F-8 fighter plane crashing , and the US EP-3 reconnaissance plane making a forced landing at Lingshui Airbase , is a test of the crisis management ability of both the PRC and the US . It also makes it clear that the strategic partnership relationship is finished , and determines even more how the two regard each other as strategic competitors .  
At the meeting , attendees diligently studied the important speeches of Jiang Zemin , Zhu Rongji , and other central leading comrades concerning the work related to public order , as well as the spirits of the national public order work conference and the national work conference on rectifying and standardizing market economic order ; and mapped out arrangements for launching a nationwide struggle to strike hard and put things in order .  
The leading cadres at all levels shoulder heavy responsibility for comprehensively implementing the party 's basic line and adhering to the four cardinal principles ; they must take a firm and clear-cut stand on major issues of principle , keep clear heads amid complex struggle , strengthen their political sensitivity and political distinguishing ability , and wage resolute struggle against all phenomena that jeopardize party and state interests .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : In the future , if serious crimes and the activities of criminal gangs are not severely suppressed over a long period , if major law-and-order problems are not resolved effectively over a long period , if the chaotic conditions in public order are not changed over a long period , then local leading cadres and leaders of the relevant departments will be punished for neglecting their duties .  
During this ongoing fight against the evil forces , leading party and government comrades must act firmly , take a clear-cut stand , earnestly strengthen their organizational guidance , and carefully plan and organize every move so as to wipe out the evil forces completely , pull up their roots , deal ruinous blows to all forms of evil forces , and create a peaceful and harmonious environment that can facilitate the realization of the grand objective of national revitalization .  
The vicious growth of criminal syndicates and evil forces has become a prominent issue that affects China 's public security and social order .  It has also become a major disaster that prevents the people from leading a peaceful and happy life .  
Observers believe that the Chinese government carried out a reasonable , beneficial , and moral struggle in the process of handling this matter , and forced the downright hegemonic United States government to capitulate and admit that the American spy plane had encroached upon Chinese air space leading to the collision with a Chinese fighter plane and subsequent loss of its pilot .  The US government was compelled to make multiple expressions of regret , sadness , and apology , thereby strongly protecting China 's national dignity and the country 's sovereignty .  
First of all , leading cadres in the public security organs at and above the county ( section ) level must abide by the rule that their spouses and children are not allowed to get involved in the activities of independently running or joining others in running such entertainment businesses as singing and dancing parlors , game rooms , night clubs and such service businesses as bath rooms and massage rooms in the geographical areas where the leading cadres are performing duties ;  
When selecting candidates , we should consistently adhere to the standards and strictly guarantee the political quality of those to be promoted .  Outstanding female cadres who can fully , correctly , actively implement the party 's basic line , persistently take the role of socialism with Chinese characteristics , can distinguish the right from the wrong on major principle issues , and can withstand tests at critical junctures should be selected and promoted to leading bodies .  
Second , more female cadres should be appointed to the principal leading posts in party and government organizations , and in particular , candidates should be properly selected for the leading posts at the intermediate and higher levels .  Bold actions should be taken to select and promote outstanding young women to leading posts .  
The meeting required that party committees and organization departments at all levels should further unify thinking , enhance understanding , improve the style of work , effectively guarantee the fulfillment of the assignments , seize the opportune moment when local leading bodes at various levels will be changed , and raise the work of selecting , promoting , and training young cadres to a new level .  
Third , the reserve cadre contingent was strengthened to a new degree .  According to the working guideline of " replenishing leading bodies and strengthening reserve force , " through the procedures of democratic recommendation and strict evaluation by the party organizations , outstanding young cadres were added to the reserve cadre contingents at various levels .  These promising young cadres have good political quality and strong work ability , and they are now selected as candidates for leading positions at a higher level .  
Since the beginning of last year , more than 400 outstanding young cadres have been appointed to the leading positions at the provincial departmental level in more than 20 provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities by means of open recruitment from the general public ; meanwhile , more than 110,000 young cadres have been appointed to leading posts at all levels by means of competition .  
Those who deviate from the party 's basic line and behave in a double-dealing manner , those who fail to stand tests at critical moments of the political struggle or hold an ambiguous attitude in an attempt to dodge the struggle , those who disregard the interests of the party and the people and are only keen on seeking personal fame and power through getting official positions by means of bribery or currying favor with influential people or playing defrauds must not be allowed to enter leading bodies .  
Recently the Navy Party Committee adopted a decision on developing a wide-scale campaign in all naval units to emulate Wang Wei with the aim of leading the broad masses of officers and men to carry forward the spirit of unremitting struggle , faithfully fulfill their sacred missions , and make new contributions to defending the state sovereignty , safeguarding national dignity , and achieving the reunification of the motherland .  
Luo Gan demanded that the leading comrades of party committees and government at all levels and the departments concerned must further enhance understanding of the importance of comprehensive management of public order , and properly shoulder their political tasks of preserving social stability and keeping the country peaceful .  
However , in view of existing weak links in the plant 's quality control work , the Military Representative Office proposed to solemnly deal with the matter in order to strengthen the sense of the quality of military products among intermediate-level leading cadres .  Following careful consideration , the plant 's party committee finally decided to dismiss the director of a branch plant , who was in charge of the production of that product , from his post .  This caused strong repercussions in the whole plant .  
After water storage of the Three Gorges Project is completed , the water level will be raised by a dozen meters or even nearly 100 meters .  The original landslides , collapses , and deformed areas , and the stability of the banks will be affected , leading to a bigger possibility for occurrence of geological disasters .  
His violations of law and disciple are serious and disgusting and have given the public a very bad impression .  This is a typical case of a leading cadre of a law-enforcement department bending the law to serve personal interests and abusing official power for selfish ends .  A severe punishment is absolutely necessary .  
Some of the right wing figures in the moderate group even believed that , based on this , trade contact is helping to increase China 's overall national power and leading to an increased military threat of Taiwan by the mainland , and that the risk of the United States being involved in a regional conflict is even greater .  
With regard to the leading cadres and state organ personnel who exercised ineffective leadership in the special work to put things to rights , neglected their duties , or engaged in embezzlement must be sternly investigated and dealt with by the supervisory departments , and those who committed crime should be investigated to affix their criminal responsibility in accordance with the law .  
The comrades in charge of pertinent departments and units under the party 's central committee and State Council and the Beijing-based comrades in charge of the backbone enterprises managed by the central authorities attended the meeting at the main conference hall .  The leading comrades from various provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments , and those from various prefectural ( city ) and county people 's governments and relevant departments attended the meeting at sub-meeting-rooms .  
The Chinese working class is indeed the representative of advanced social productive forces and production relations , is indeed the basic driving force that promotes social development and historical advances , is indeed the main force in the building of socialist material and spiritual civilization , and is indeed the leading class of the people 's republic .  
Such a judgment that sets academic backgrounds and knowledge against practice is a mentality of finding fault with and making excessive demands on high-quality talent ; and in the eyes of people with such a mentality , high-quality talent " are not bold and vigorous enough in their work but are holding themselves aloof , " lack mature skills in leading the troops , have insufficient drive in exercising control , and are engaged in impractical scientific research and studies .  
Apart from the fact that the mental concepts of certain cadres are outdated and they long for the stuff of planned economy , an important reason why regional blockades persist in some areas despite repeated prohibition is that instead of doing their work in a thoroughly sound way , certain leading cadres depend on improper methods such as regional blockades to pursue " achievements in their official career , " and do not hesitate to sacrifice the interests of the masses and the state for the sake of pursuing their own benefit .  
The leading cadres at all levels in all localities must seriously study General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents , " be faithful representatives of the development requirements of the advanced social productive forces and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people , and fully understand the harm done by regional blockades .  
The work organs of national defense education at the provincial , prefectural , and county levels in all parts of the country should , under the unified leadership of the local national defense education committees and national defense education leading groups , and effectively perform the functions of organizing , guiding , coordinating , and inspecting national defense education work in their administrative areas .  
Local institutions for national defense education at provincial , prefectural , and county levels should conscientiously perform their duty of organizing , guiding , coordinating , and inspecting the work on national defense education within their own administrative divisions , under the unified leadership of the local committees for national defense education or leading groups for national defense education .  
Wu Yi pointed out : Cities are situated in a central position in economic and social development , and play a strong influential and leading role in their peripheral areas .  It is necessary to do creative work in accordance with the actual conditions , give full play to their advantages in science , technology , education , and human resources , and more quickly advance the implementation of the strategy of promoting trade with science and technology .  
Guiding projects take major local projects that conform to the direction and conditions of national plans to tackle key scientific and technological problem and that have a stimulating effect on local leading industries and sustainable social development , or those that can improve local capabilities for technological innovation , and lists them in the national plans for tackling key scientific and technological problems for guidance and implementation .  The funding to implement guiding projects is to be raised primarily by the localities and businesses .  
The party committee of the Ministry of Public Security 's Frontier Guard Administrative Bureau has attached great importance to launching the " strike-hard " struggle .  To solidly and efficiently launch the " strike-hard " struggle , the bureau has established a frontier guard " strike-hard " leading group .  Various public security frontier guard headquarters have also established " strike-hard " leading groups headed by principal military and administrative officials .  
He noted : " Today , a constant increase has been registered in the income of peasants in our Naxi Town , and people in all parts of Tibet are leading a prosperous and content life .  All this comes from the fact that we enjoy a stable and relaxed social environment .  
As market competition gets increasingly sharp , state-owned enterprises , especially state-owned large companies and enterprise groups must strive to become international advanced enterprises , have an accurate grasp of the changes in domestic and international markets and the development direction of leading technology , find out the gap with international advanced enterprises , formulate a scientific and rational development strategy and a technological innovation plan , and clearly define what they endeavor to catch up with and surpass and where they should develop themselves .  
If Taiwan takes all that is offered , an increase in its military strength is bound to inspire misgivings of the communist China , the two sides of the strait are bound to head for an arms race , and , no doubt , the current cross-strait relations will go from bad to worse .  The arms sales , in which the Chen Shui-bian Government believes it has achieved a major breakthrough , may become a cause leading Taiwan to wars .  
the development of enterprises in the war industry will promote the development of the US economy ; the building of the super shield will guarantee the United States ' absolute security and offset the nuclear deterring capacity of other nuclear states and shake off the binding of the anti-missile treaty , thus leading to the establishment of a new world security system with the United States at the center .  All these factors were included in the strategic consideration of the United States .  
The state of the leading bodies and cadres under their administration has a vital bearing on the party 's image and prestige among the masses and determines whether or not our nation 's economic construction and social undertakings can achieve sustained , healthy , and fast development .  
Meanwhile , upholding the principle of developing weapons and equipment in a coordinated and comprehensive manner , the Russian armed forces are developing currently relatively backward weapon and equipment programs , such as communication systems for field operations , automatic systems , and reconnaissance systems in order to enable the general level of weapons and equipment always maintain its leading position in the world .  
Today , Tibet is enjoying fast economic growth , great social progress , a stable situation , a sound national unity , and a strong and consolidated border defense ; and its people are leading a happy and contended life .  A scene of prosperity in the socialist new Tibet has spread out before the people of the whole world .  
Efforts should be made to develop crop cultivation and livestock breeding in the light of local conditions , do a good job in readjusting the agricultural structure , energetically bring about an industrialized operation of agriculture , and give shape to regional leading industries with distinguishing characteristics and unique features .  
According to sources , to speed the process of lowering the average age of leading cadres and ensure that officials at the provincial and ministerial level will be able to smoothly enter the CPC Central Committee at the 16th party congress next year , the CPC Central Organization Department has made a decision on completing major changes in the leading bodies of all provinces and ministries by the end of this year .  
At present , some incumbent provincial governors and ministers are close to the retirement age of 65 years , and may be asked to retire before the end of their current tenure .  The relevant central department decided that it should be arranged for younger cadres to take over their leading positions so that the successors may smoothly enter the new central committee at the 16th party congress to be held in October 2002 .  
Last year , the CPC 's personnel policy of lowering the average age of senior leading cadres was put into practice , and the changes were made mainly among officials at the level of provincial departments and the departments under the ministries .  This year , the cadre changes were moved up to the provincial and ministerial level .  
Reportedly , the main reason for arranging the retirement of ministers and provincial governors ahead of time was that these officials will reach or exceed the retirement age of 65 years by the time the CPC holds its 16th national congress next year , and they will no longer be able to remain in leading positions at that time .  If these people still remain in the current leading positions , they will be included in the name list of the new central committee membership , and this may prevent their successors from entering the central committee .  
Conducting propaganda and education on the socialist legal system in a thoroughgoing way and enhancing the legal sense and quality of the all the citizens , leading cadres at all levels in the first place , is an important aspect of the implementation of the basic general plan for managing the country according to the law and building a socialist country ruled by law and also an important task set by the 10th Five-Year Plan and an important legal guarantee for the implementation of the 10th Five-Year Plan .  
All comrades of the party , leading cadres at all levels in particular , must unceasingly enhance their legal sense and ability to act according to the law and strive to promote the improvement of the entire people 's legal sense and quality and lay a solid foundation for building a socialist country ruled by law .  
Attention should be paid to raising the theoretical level of the socialist legal system among large numbers of cadres , especially among the leading cadres , and increasing their ability to make decisions , perform their official duties , and exercise management according to law .  
There are 21 provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities that have formulated rules and regulations on the study and application of laws among the leading cadres , and have clearly defined that whether a cadre possesses necessary legal knowledge and whether he is capable of managing affairs strictly according to law should be taken as a major content for the assessment of his work performance .  
Zhang Fusen stressed that in performing the work of popularizing laws in the next five years , emphasis will be laid on the key points and efforts will be made to attain still more remarkable progress in the study and application of laws among the leading cadres , the training of civil servants , and the education on legal system among youngsters and students , so as to ensure that the popularization of laws will make a good start at a still higher standard in the new century .  
The MAC also analyzed the obstacles to the operation of the three mini links .  It listed the following major factors leading to the failure in starting scheduled flights , in the normal operation of the commercial mechanism for commodity imports and exports , and in allowing mainland tourists into Kinmen and Matsu .

At the time when the heat wave of developing West China gradually ran high , the recently established leading group for the development of the western region under the State Council held a meeting , at which it was pointed out that on the basis of thorough investigation and study , it is imperative to draw up a realistic and feasible overall plan and some special plans now , and include them into the Tenth Five-Year Plan for national economic and social development .

One important reason , Jiang Zemin emphasized at the fourth plenary meeting of the Central Disciplinary Inspection Commission in January of this year , for the failure to prevent some negative and corrupt phenomena , increasingly serious in some cases , in the party despite repeated interdiction efforts has been the failure on the part of CPC organizations and leaders of some localities and units to strictly administer the party in the form of failing to strictly educate , manage , and supervise CPC-member cadres , especially leading cadres .

All party-member leading cadres , especially high and middle-level cadres , should draw a profound lesson from Cheng Kejie 's case on discipline and law breaches , persist in paying attention to study , politics , and healthy trends , and firmly foster a correct world outlook , outlook on life , and the concept of value .  They must be able to stand the test of temptation and maintain forever the ideal , conviction and moral virtue of communist party members .  
In his speech , Zhang Bolin said : The changes in the principal leaders of the State Sports General Bureau were decided by the party central leadership for the purpose of promoting cadre exchanges to meet the actual needs in enhancing the leading body .  The decision was based on giving consideration to the general situation and was a normal change in the organizational work .  
Zhang Bolin also said : Yuan Weimin has been in the leading body of the State Sports Commission since 1984 .  He is politically firm , always willing to study , proficient in sports management , and has rich administrative experience and strong organizational and leading ability .  He works in a down-to-earth manner , firmly adheres to principles , has courage to manage things , and set strict demands on himself .  
This is an important development of the party building theory made by the third generation of leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core .  It is also a practical issue that must be studied and resolved in order to uphold , strengthen , and improve party leadership under the new historical conditions .  The Shanghai municipal party committee must continue to play well the role of the core of leadership , commanding the whole situation and coordinating the efforts of all quarters .  
The first group of county ( municipal ) " three stresses " educational work have the following special characteristics : First , through emphasis on taking hold of theoretical learning , in particular conscientiously learning Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important ideology of the " three represents " , leading cadres have received a rather systematic theoretical education .  Second , leading cadres are living in the villages and going into the households resulting in extensive arousal of the masses to action , introduction of the " three stresses " , and warm welcomes by the masses .  
Following investigation , the discipline inspection and supervision departments of Chongqing Municipality maintained that former Fendu Country Secretary Gao Rongmiao , being the principal person responsible for improving the party 's work style and ensuring honest government administration , was negligent of management and supervision and that he is held for major leading responsibility in Huang Faxiang 's case that occurred in his term of office .  
Li Renfu , former head of Fendu County and incumbent deputy county secretary , was held for major leading responsibility in Huang Faxiang 's case that occurred in his term of office .  Besides , he also violated regulations in accepting " awards " and cash gifts .  He was dismissed from the posts as deputy secretary , member of the standing committee , and member , of the county party committee .  
Huang Faxiang 's wife Chen Zhiqiong , former Fengdu County deputy secretary , was held for major leading responsibility in issuing awards at random by the Fengdu County Financial Bureau and Local Taxation Bureau . She also violated regulations in accepting enormous amounts of " awards " and cash gifts , and in illegally allowing her husband to use 15,000 yuan of public funds .  She was expelled from the party .  
The party 's leading organs or grassroots organizations , the party 's organizations in both the enterprises and the rural areas , and our work in economic , scientific , technological , education , ideological , or political fields should embody in an all-round way the requirement of " three represents . "  
Things are greatly different in the modern society ; however , judging from the vicious criminal cases committed by juveniles in recent years , we can see that a major factor leading to the situation lies with the education of families and schools , lies with the impractical mentality of parents who " hope their children to become dragons one day " as well as their way to " push their children to become dragons , " and lies with our stress on an exam-oriented education in the past instead of a quality education .  
Can China 's cause of socialism be consolidated and developed ?  Can China remain powerful and prosperous in face of the acute international competition in the future ?  The key lies in whether or not our party is able to continuously train a large number of high-quality leading personnel .  
Right now , our party is ruling in a large nation with a population of more than 1.2 billion , Jiang Zemin pointed out .  Without a large number of leading cadres that combine political integrity with professional ability , it is definitely impossible to lead the people of all nationalities throughout the country to push forward our arduous cause of modernization under the complex international and domestic situation .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out that to build our party well , we must , in the first place , help our party 's leading cadres at all levels improve their ideological and political quality .  Particularly we must strive to help the middle-aged and young leading cadres improve their ideological and political quality so that they will become a new generation of statesmen who remain loyal to Marxism and unswervingly adhere to the socialist road with Chinese characteristics , and are capable of running the party and the country .  
Many units have organized leading officers to refute certain non-Marxist and anti-Marxist notions in society , analyze the root cause of the generation and dissemination of " Falungong " doctrines , reflect on the painful lessons learned from the degeneration of certain corrupt elements in the party , and fully understand the utmost importance of continuing to pursue their ideals and convictions and establishing the correct outlook on the world , life , and values .  
Second , in the past 20 years , a major factor leading to an increase in China 's total-factor productivity is a large-scale allocation of key production factors resulted from structural changes .  What are particularly important are the transfer of rural labor forces and other resources to township and town enterprises and to the secondary and tertiary industries in cities , as well as a rapid development in non-state-owned economies .  
We should attach great importance to the work , lay stress on key issues , work perseveringly and unremittingly , be practical results-minded , ensure that work is done in a down-to-earth manner , and ensure that leading bodies of public security , judicial , and procuratorial departments are truly strengthened and the overall quality of cadres and policemen is notably improved , so that they can more effectively perform the mission entrusted to them by the party and people .  
Third , we must work hard to build up a contingent of high-quality community workers ; and while giving full play to the role of existing committee cadres , we should also adopt effective measures to promptly replenish the contingent of community cadres .  Particularly , we should promote to the leading posts of communities a number of outstanding young cadres who have sound political qualities , a fairly high educational level , and a relatively strong work ability and who love the community work , so as to enhance the vigor and vitality of community leading bodies .  
Unremitting efforts should be made to build leading bodies of courts at all levels into a strong and powerful core of leadership that meets the " three represents " demand and that is able to shoulder the trans-century , historical , and heavy tasks so as to ensure that the judicial authority of the state is firmly grasped in the hands of the judges who are loyal to the party , the people , the Constitution , and the laws and in an effort to obviously improve the overall quality and judicial expertise of the courts .  
The Mukang public security frontier inspection station is just dozen kilometers away from the drug-growing center known as the " Golden Triangle . " Its main task is to inspect the entry and exit of personnel , vehicles , and goods through the Sino-Burmese border management zone using the 320 National Route leading to the interlined and crack down on all illegal and criminal activities in the zone .  
Having made achievements of world interest during the five decades since it came into power in leading the people in carrying out socialist revolution and construction as well as the reform and opening to the outside world and in unremittingly struggling to build a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized socialist modern country , our party is worthy of being the choice of history and the people .  
Viewed as a whole , all of our party 's efforts in leading the revolution , construction , and reform have been for emancipating and developing the productive forces and for advancing the development of China 's socialist democratic politics and culture and thus have complied with the objective law of social development , conformed to the advanced trends of development of the times , safeguarded the overall interests of the Chinese nation , and accorded with the fundamental demands of the masses of the people .  
When selecting members of leading groups of people 's courts at the grassroots level , intermediate and higher courts should provide conscientious assistance to local CPC committees .  They must make sure to select them from excellent judges .  
He stressed in particular : Law has entrusted to the various provincial ( regional , municipal ) governments the duty of ensuring the total area of farmland in their own administrative areas does not decrease .  This should be made an important index for assessing local party and government leaderships so that it will become a conscious action of leading cadres at all levels .  
At the same time , marked results were achieved in developing the contingent of ethnic minority leading cadres .  A large number of ethnic minority cadres with high political quality and courage for doing pioneering work were selected and appointed to leading posts at various levels .  
From the launching of party-wide activities to study Deng Xiaoping Theory and the effort to combat corruption , promote clean and honest administration , and severely punish corrupt elements to the launching of centralized education for leading bodies and leading cadres of the county - and sectional-level and upwards on the " stress on study , stress on politics , and stress on healthy trends , " the CPC 's third-generation collective leadership with Jiang Zemin as the core has been trying hard to answer this fundamental question theoretically and practically .  
Responsible official of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission stressed today that all party committees , governments , and discipline inspection and supervisory organs should strengthen the supervision over the behaviors of enterprise leading cadres in doing operational and managerial activities , should earnestly implement the relevant regulations on the responsibility system for building party style and administrative honesty , and should resolutely investigate and deal with without any lenient behaviors that have caused tremendous losses to the state due to duty dereliction .  
It was learned that the age limit for various leading posts set by the party Central Committee this time is mainly to make cadres younger and more intelligent and raise the quality of the ranks of cadres .  In the mean time , it is designed to enable new cadres to receive promotion earlier and encourage leading cadres of various units to adopt new thinking in their administration .  
Third , the legal system for urban and rural planning is unsound and the plans drawn up are lacking in authority .  Some leading cadres have a weak legal concept .  They make decisions as they please and do not act according to plan .  
In his " 20 May " inaugural speech , he made a comprehensive paraphrase of the new middle-of-the-road line and maintained that it would be a road leading Taiwan to a heavenly state as " an example in democracy and human rights in the world . "  After assuming presidency , he has also indeed worked hard for it .  
and heighten their own leading capability or decisionmaking standard .  Various areas should set clear-cut and concrete requirements for the leading cadres to go deep into the grassroots level ; live in the villages ; or call on the households ; should step up supervision and examination in this connection ; and should conscientiously carry out the work to the letter .  
The members of the central joint conference on the " three stresses " education and the leaders of the central inspection teams for the " three stresses " education , who were in Beijing , attended the conference at its main venue in Beijing .  The members of the leading groups in charge of the " three stresses " education and the members of the " three stresses " offices of various provincial ( regional , or municipal ) and prefecture ( city ) party committees ;  
The central authorities repeatedly stressed that the rate of progress should be subordinated to quality .  Stressing the importance of the " three stresses " education in counties ( cities ) is , in essence , determined by the specific important position of counties ( cities ) , and by the condition of the leading bodies and the rank of leading cadres at this level .  
The party and government leading bodies and leading cadres at the county ( city ) level are standing at the forefront of reform , development , and stability , have a direct link with the vast numbers of workers , peasants , and intellectuals , and directly assume the important tasks of carrying out the party 's line , principles , and policies in the grass roots of the urban and rural areas , which has a direct bearing on the image of the party and government among the masses .  
Under the main orientation of orderly and gradual development of Hong Kong 's democratic political system , the Basic Law lays down the method for producing the chief executive and legislative organs of the SAR , and there are clear regulations on the emergence and appointment of the chief executive and the leading officials .  
Shandong Province has changed the fixed mental attitudes of " noexamination unless at the changeover of term " and " examination means promotionfor the cadres " and instituted responsibility systems for annual targets andintensified the annual examinations ; in connection with the changeover of termof leading cadres , it has also readjusted and dealt with incompetent cadres andthose who have proven definitely inferior .  
Wei Jianxing emphasized : In undertaking the large-scale development of the western region , leading bodies at various levels should do better in making decisions in a democratic and scientific way ; all major decisions , such as those concerning construction and development , key construction projects , and defrayal of a large amount of funds , we must act according to the principles of democratic centralism , hold collective discussions , and carefully make decisions in order to prevent what a few leaders say counts or to avoid taking hasty decisions .  
To seize the crucial issue means to ensure leading cadres will take the lead in setting high demands on themselves , be impartial , upright , and honest , set good examples , and establish a good image before the people .  To lay a good foundation means to properly grasp the work at the grass-roots level .  
Making administrative affairs transparent , setting up a set of standards and mechanisms to restrict the use of powers , and making the use of powers transparent are channels through which the broad masses of the people are able to directly supervise the performances of the government in the most extensive manner .  Administrative transparency is not only conducive to supervising leading cadres but it can also provide a systematic guarantee for preventing " secret operations " and abuse of powers .  
After hearing the reports , the State Council leading comrades pointed out : The development of high-energy physics and advanced accelerators is of great significance to raising the standard of science and technology in the country .  We should continue listening to the ideas of domestic and foreign experts to achieve good results with relatively small investment by transforming existing facilities .  
established and perfected rules and regulations ; and have satisfactorily resolved many " long-standing , big , and difficult " issues which long defied solution .  Through the education and rectification activity , the vast numbers of cadres in leading organs have enhanced their political awareness and the awareness of responsibility , and have pledged one after another to set an example for the troops with their own conduct in fulfilling the requirement of " three represents . "  
striving to practice Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thought on the " three represents " ; on maintaining and carrying forward the fine tradition and work style of waging arduous struggles ; promoting honest administration and strict adherence to party discipline and state law among party and government leading cadres ; conscientiously implementing the policy of governing the party sternly ; earnestly strengthening education , management , and supervision of party members and cadres ; and maintaining the party 's progressive character .  
So , it is necessary to make evaluation , investigation of responsibility , and division of work into a coordinate process .  At present , prominent attention should be paid to major economic losses , serious accidents , and serious incidents cropping up due to leading cadres ' failure in improving party style and administrative honesty .  We should find out who is to blame for long-lasting serious unhealthy trends and investigate leading cadres ' spouses and children who abuse leading cadres ' functions and influential power to obtain unlawful benefits and to create bad influence .  
The report believes that although the Chinese communists ' military threat against our troops has changed from mere advantage in quantity to competition in quality , leading to a disparity between the two sides of the strait and the Chinese communists are eager to settle the " Taiwan issue , " thus imposing a greater threat to our security , both sides of the strait should still create conditions for cooperation with goodwill , jointly deal with the issue of " a future China , " and seek a win-win result on the basis of mutual trust .  
Reportedly , among the corrupt officials dismissed from the official posts in the first half of this year , the people with the highest rank were the four leading cadres at the department and bureau levels .  They were Du Baocheng ( department director level ) , former chairman of the Sizhuang Limited Company in Guangxi , who was suspected of taking bribes ;  
Secondly , the reform has cut internal bureaucracy and personnel through eliminating bodies unsuited for current work on the basis of functional adjustments and changes and eliminating and merging bodies characterized by excessive division of labor and functional overlapping , leading to an average personnel cut of 20 percent .  
The film exposes the disgraceful end of certain leading cadres who are unable to withstand the lure of desire for material things , fall into the abyss of evil , and embark on the path of crime , and reveals the ugly ways of corrupt elements in going all-out to rig up a network of connections , open a breach through people at the side of the leaders , and end up by dragging the leading cadres into the water .  
According to information , the province-wide centralized activity for admonitory education will last for two months from August to September . The educational subjects will mainly be leading bodies and leading cadres of party , people 's congress , administrative , Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference [ CPPCC ] , and judicial organs at or above the county level in the entire province ; people 's groups ; and enterprises and institutions .  Other party members-cum-cadres will participate in the study sessions and discussions at the same time .  
Huang Yuanzhi , standing committee member of the provincial party committee and secretary of the provincial discipline inspection commission , said : " It is very necessary to carry out admonitory education among party members-cum-cadres .  People like Cheng Kejie , Hu Changqing , and Jin Jianpei followed different orbits of transformation , but they had things in common .  They gave party members-cum-cadres these warnings : First , party members-cum-cadres , particularly leading cadres , must intensify theoretical study , and foster correct outlooks on the world , life , and value .  
As officials directly responsible for maintaining social stability , the leading comrades responsible for political and legal work and for comprehensive management of social order should vigorously organize and coordinate with all the departments concerned , share the work with individual responsibility , pool efforts , create a situation of everyone getting involved in the work , and promote the investigation and handling of contradictions and disputes .  
An informed figure revealed : To eliminate social destabilizing factors and tighten management over mass organizations , the CPC Central Committee Organization Department and the State Council 's Ministry of Civil Affairs recently issued a circular , urging all active-duty leading cadres to stop taking up concurrent posts in mass organizations .  However , it also simultaneously stressed that they must very carefully and prudently deal with mass organizations so as to avoid aggravating the contradictions .  
It has been learned : To prevent mass organizations from getting out of hand again since Beijing declared Falungong as a cult organization and banned it , China decided to tighten its management over mass organizations .  Previously , most mass organizations normally " invited " local officials to take up leading posts so that the organizations would sound more impressive .  Meanwhile , officials also liked to accept concurrent posts in mass organizations to show others that they " were treasured . "  
Yan Haiwang stressed that to intensify the ideological and political work , it is imperative to strengthen the leadership , so the leading bodies at all levels must persist in " stressing theoretical study , stressing political awareness , and stressing ethical conduct , " place the ideological and political work in an important position , establish and amplify the ideological and political work responsibility system , make regular study , step up examination , and earnestly " do two types of work simultaneously and attach equal importance to both . "  
( 7 ) in light of the five basic requirements that the " leading bodies are staunch and powerful , the party member cadres are pure and up to the mark , the work system of party building is sound , the mechanisms of ideological and political work are perfect , and the work performance is outstanding , " and the three basic conditions of " firm political stand , prominent professional abilities , and excellent work style , " launching activities on creating advanced grassroots party organizations and striving to be fine Communist party members ;  
4 ) Speed up the process of making the leading and ruling systems more scientific , democratic , and institutionalized ; perfect the supervisory mechanisms of the party , the masses , and the media so that those with the motive to commit craft can not do so .  
At the same time , he chaired a CIS summit and visited six CIS countries .  He settled the debt , gas shipment , common border defense issues with the countries concerned and , using security and energy cooperation as cohesive power , improved Russia 's leading role in the CIS . This has further solidified Russia 's security in the adjacent region and its strategic buffer zone .  
Confronted with the new situation marked by increasingly frequent updating and upgrade of naval weapon systems and equipment and their constantly rising technological level , the academy has given full play to the leading and service-ensuring roles of the ideological and political work in meeting the requirements of this new situation .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out : Both the international situation and the domestic situation are changing very rapidly and drastically , and our tasks are very arduous and complex .  To do a good job in reform and development and in ensuring stability , the leading cadres must possess a Marxist political sensitivity , know how to discover problems from a high political vantage point and solve them , and adhere to principle , take a systematic approach , and enhance their foresight and creativity in work .  
Appointment to posts by competition has now developed from being a transitional means in the early stage of instituting the civil servant system into a systematized and standardized method of selecting and employing people by which civil servants are promoted , posts rotate , and people are selected for popular posts ; and the scope of appointment to posts by competition has expanded from middle-grade leading cadres to non-leadership posts and departmental leadership posts .  
According to the current conditions in ideological and political work in the state security organs , Xu Yongyue put forward eight measures for reinforcing and improving ideological and political work , strengthening ideal and belief education , building and managing the cadre contingent , and consolidating leading bodies and grass-roots party organizations .  
This demands that the leadership groups and leading cadres of these institutes possess a high degree of political sensitivity and ability to make political distinctions ; they must take a firm and clear-cut stand on questions of political orientation and fundamental principles ; they must conduct education and put things right with regard to erroneous ideology and political viewpoints that run counter to regarding economic construction as the central task , to reform and opening up , and to the four cardinal principles ;  
Our party can certainly shoulder the historical heavy task of leading China 's socialist cause so long as we keenly grasp the demand for the development of China 's advanced social productive forces and the direction of China 's advanced culture and the fundamental interests and benefits of the overwhelming majority of people in China , do a good job in various work according the requirements of the " three represents , " and further improve the building of out party .  
Wang Zhaoguo emphasized that strengthening the training of young and middle-aged leading cadres among the democratic parties and establishing a contingent of high-caliber cadres of democratic parties is a strategic task with a vital bearing on the overall situation of multiparty cooperation , a basic guarantee for upholding and perfecting the system of multiparty cooperation and system of political consultation under the leadership of the CPC , as well as the pressing need for bringing into play the role of parties participating in the administration of state affairs and an effective measure for further realizing political handover .  
Leading bodies and leading cadres in colleges and universities have universally received education in basic Marxist tenets , party spirit , and party conduct and tempering in relatively strict inner-party political life and thus achieved new improvement in their ideological and political quality .  
In its effort to strengthen leading body construction and ideological and political work and build itself into a domestically first-class and internationally renown university , Beijing Institute of Technology conscientiously worked out numerous rules and regulations and adopted a lot of effective and practical measures .  After its rectification and reform plan was made public , the masses responded to it strongly and maintained that leaders of the institute had grasped the crux of the matter and something significant could be achieved in its development .  
While making positive contributions to economic development and social progress in countries in which they settle , overseas compatriots have supported China with great enthusiasm in many aspects : With their advantages in capital , technology , and talent , they have actively participated in the great practice of China 's reform and opening up and in the implementation of the strategy for the extensive development of the western region .  They have played a leading role and served as a bridge in China 's exchanges with foreign countries .  
During the first half of the year , State Council counsellors focused on the central work of the Party and the government , responding enthusiastically to the call from the CPC Central Committee for the " large-scale development of western China . " Eight separate groups made arduous journeys to the midwestern region - - particularly to frontier areas and poor areas - - to conduct survey studies , writing a number of high-quality research reports and making excellent suggestions , which won the high regard and full affirmation of leading comrades in the State Council .  
In order to enable the people 's congresses to further play their leading role in the building of legal system and provide perfect legal protection and better service to the large-scale western development , the " Seminar on Large-scale Western Development and Legal System Building " was held in Chongqing this morning , which was attended by the personalities in charge of the standing committees of the people 's congresses from various provinces , autonomous regions , and municipality in western China .  
In particular , since the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee , the party central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has set forth comprehensive and profound theses on cadre supervision around the two historical themes of enhancing the party 's leading and ruling capability and enhancing the party 's ability to resist corruption and degeneration and overcome risks , and has set forth explicit guidelines , basic principles , targets , and requirements for cadre supervision work in the new period .  
To strengthen supervision over leading cadres at the bureau level , the party leading group of the Xinhua News Agency formulated its " Opinion on Strengthening Supervision Over Leading Cadres at the Bureau Level , " explicitly specifying the contents of supervision and the measures for exercising such supervision .  The responsibilities for such supervision were also explicitly specified .  The Organization Department of the Hunan Provincial CPC Committee established and perfected a set of supervision system and built a set of effective check-and-balance mechanism for strengthening cadre supervision .  
It successively formulated regulations for prevention , admonition , warning , and penalties .  Various supervision measures were combined properly and implemented comprehensively .  Through more intensive ideological education , stricter internal supervision inside the leading bodies , effective organizational adjustments , and serious handling of problems and cases , the sense of self-discipline among leading cadres was raised and the effectiveness of organizational supervision was also enhanced .  
In Anhui Province , Jilin Province , and Zhengzhou City , information providers were appointed among people in various social circles so that the departments concerned could be aware of the opinions and comments from the masses in good time , and could take more relevant actions to strengthen and improve the supervision over leading cadres and over the work of selecting and appointing cadres .  All this has won favorable comments form the masses and the cadres .  
Zhi Xiaoquan , party committee secretary of an organ of Fujian 's provincial development planning committee , said , Cheng Kejie was a high-ranking leading cadre who abused his power and colluded with his mistress , Li Ping , to collect huge amounts of bribes , because he was never properly supervised .  This only proved that we need a sound supervision and restraining mechanism to control leading cadres , and in particular , we need to supervise and restrain the leading cadres who are in control of concrete power .  
Every year throughout the military , over one thousand leading cadres at or above the army level have gone among the soldiers to understand the situations , give guidance and lectures , answer and solve hot and difficult educational issues , and give effective guidance on education .  This has produced a lively situation where party committees have attached great importance to education , leaders have worked together to manage it , and officers and men participated in it enthusiastically .  
This responsible person noted that ever since the true features the " Falungong " as a religious cult were revealed , over 98 percent of the " Falungong " practitioners have seen the error of their ways and are determined to make a clean break with their past .

Only the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) was capable of leading the Chinese people to national independence , the liberation of the people , and the victory of socialism , and only by resolutely upholding the leading position of Deng Xiaoping theory in the entire Party and insisting unwaveringly on the Party 's basic line of " one center and two basic points " have we been able to achieve national revitalization , a strong and prosperous state , and happiness for the people .  
At a discussion meeting held by the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee and the Shanghai Television Station , participants pointed out that personal connections as revealed by the movie in which one is following the other , or where one is the behind-the-scenes boss of the other , or one has a special relationship with the other , and the collective corrupt practice of the leading body of the Zhongyang Factory are all derived from the remnants of feudal ideology .

The 15th national party congress called on the entire party to set off a new upsurge of studying Deng Xiaoping Theory , for which the central authorities have taken a series of important measures .  Particularly since last year , the " three stresses " education has been conducted in a concentrated way among the party and government leading groups above the county level with remarkable results , which has played a significant role in promoting the regular and institutionalized ideological-political building of the leading groups .  
Besides , thanks to economic responsibility auditing , the leading cadres have cultivated a stronger sense of responsibility and a stronger sense of self-restriction and have grown more conscious in being strict with themselves while performing official duties and those who take over leading posts have also learned both experiences and lessons from their predecessors and have thus avoided making the same mistakes .

Leading enterprises are shouldered with the heavy responsibility of bringing along the growth of peasant households , exploring new markets , making scientific and technological innovations , and boosting the development of the regional economy .  The success or failure of leading enterprises has a direct bearing on our work to improve the economic efficiency of agriculture , to increase the income of our peasants , and to maintain the stability of rural areas .

George W . Bush , who was leading by a razor-thin majority in Florida early this morning , announced on television networks that he had won 25 electoral votes in Florida , accumulating more than 270 votes - - the threshold to be crossed for the presidency .

" Not only did they cause the foreign media to commit the same mistake , they also made many countries ' governments issue congratulatory messages by mistake , leading to major diplomatic blunders .  
Vigorous efforts should be made to train and temper party members and cadres who are particularly able to work hard , to endure hardships , to advance in a pioneering spirit , and to fulfill their duties ; leading cadres should particularly adhere to the purpose of the party , serve the people wholeheartedly , conscientiously be honest and self-disciplined , resolutely resist the corrosive influence of various decadent ideologies and the temptation of money and attractive women , and strive to play an exemplary role in carrying out the requirements of the " three represents . "  
With regard to the leading groups and leading cadres who failed to distinctly enhance their ideological understanding , fully mobilize the masses , and properly resolve their conspicuous problems earlier on , they should be examined one by one in the current activities of " reviewing the past " to have them resolved in a conscientious way .  As regards the problems which have been settled during the concentrated " three stresses " education but have cropped up again , solution should be worked out through intensified education , appropriate criticism , and proper handling .  
Due to the limitations of the country 's structure and mechanisms , the problem of regional barriers and departmental protectionism does exist , to a certain extent , with the use of the country 's urban cultural resources ; and there is no an authoritative and integrated leading organ to exercise an effective management , and there lacks an overall planning in its real sense .

The collective corruption and dereliction-of-duty case of senior Shenyang City officials has only expedited the process of adjusting Liaoning provincial leading body .  
While continuing to investigate and deal with cases such as corruption , bribery , embezzlement of public funds , smuggling and peddling contraband , tax and foreign exchange fraud , and financial swindling , we must pay attention to investigating and handling serious cases of violations of political , organizational , and personnel discipline by leading cadres ; cases of serious dereliction of duty ; cases of leading cadres ' spouses , sons and daughters , and relatives taking advantage of the influence of the leading cadres ' powers and position to pursue illegal profit ;

he key to " raising the quality of procuratorial personnel " is to strengthen the development of leading bodies .  Poor-quality , indolent , and problematic leading bodies should be promptly readjusted , while leading procuratorial bodies at the provincial and municipal level should be gradually staffed by democratic party members and nonparty personages .

The golden calligraphic characters on a dark ground , signifying " Green Garden , " are dwarfed by dazzling business signs nearby . Several wood steps leading down to a basement are flanked by high wood walls hung , here and there , with photos of youth activities . The checkered-glass window of the door seemed to shut out the world of gaudy plastic beauty outside .  
They do n't just want to cover their bodies from the elements but also to express themselves in clothing . So as living standards increase , the textile industry is going to be more promising . The industry has a strong base , so long as the industry people are not convention-bound and they emphasize research and development leading to high quality products .  
In the September issue of Life Magazine , a five-page feature story attacked the alleged profusion of counterfeit manufacturers operating out of the Republic of China . This article was later followed by two successive stories which appeared in Newsweek and the Asia Magazine respectively . Describing Taiwan as a " haven " for illegal manufacturing piracy , the reports seemed to imply that the nation was the leading culprit in this rampant international affliction .  
In light of the recent outcry against the counterfeit industry in the Republic of China , there are several verified facts that have not been properly addressed . According to international trade reports the leaders among counterfeiters in developing nations is Morocco , while among the developed nations , Japan and Italy were the leading offenders .  
There have been evident achievements over the last thirty years enabling traditional thought to compete on good terms with the current of practical thinking , which gives hope that it will be able to become the leading current in the future .  
Currently R . O . C . agriculture has major weaknesses . First , natural agricultural production can not compete with mechanized industrial production , leading to an outmigration of labor , which affects the ability of agriculture to continue to develop ; Second , small farm operations lack economy of scale , leading to a low return on resources , which in turn influences the raising of real incomes of farmers .  
Similarly , we forecast only 7.5% growth at the end of 1987 ; our growth rate should have increased with the global recovery , but the NT dollar appreciated faster than expected , leading to negative growth in exports to the U . S . , so the real growth rate of 7.33% was worse than anticipated .  
Wang served with Yin Chung-jung , K . T . Li , Chao Yao-tung , and other famous leading figures in the world of economics and finance . He can rely on a rich background and thirty years ' training at mediating views to handle the coordination and communications among the various economic and financial ministries . This will enable Premier Lee to focus on mapping out the nation 's political and economic future .  
After the lifting of martial law , civil servants suffered blows mainly from two sides . One was policy instability caused by too rapid change and a lack of clarity in the laws . Another side rose out of the " psychological lifting of martial law , " raising consciousness of popular rights and leading to demands reasonable and unreasonable upon the government .  
It can not be denied , however , that the development of various aspects of society has brought about a number of problems that have not as yet been completely solved . For example , the adjustment of the adaptability of various government systems has not yet been completed , traditional rules of politics have been subject to strong attack , and the behavior standards of a democratic society have not yet been firmly established , leading to incidents of anomie and disorder .  
Good social welfare systems offer lifetime security , and geographical remoteness has spared people fierce economic competition from other countries of the world . As a result , Australians and New Zealanders are leisurely and carefree , but their economic growth has been rather slow . Their leading exports are still agricultural and mining products , and they rely on imports for most industrial and manufactured products .  
The problem is that our civil servants have not yet comprehended this shift , and are still stuck in the thinking and methods of the 1950 ' s . They just think about playing the leading role and telling others what they should do and ca n't do , which product to develop - - these are not official topics , so there are always conflicts with private entrepreneurs . In fact in many things the people are more capable than officials .  
This is because economic prosperity brought by industrial prosperity has led to luxuriant lives and long-term extravagant consumption of foods which are too rich and have too high a fat content , leading to overburdening the body 's organs , generating in turn obesity , high blood pressure , and diabetes .  
Yeh Ying-kun , former director of the Taipei Municipal Psychological Center , did a study in 1989 of psychological illnesses in the Taiwan area over the past thirty years . He discovered that though the incidence of schizophrenia has not changed , there has been an increase in psychosomatic disorders arising from interpersonal relations , confusion , fear and behavioral irregularities , leading to backaches , diarrhea , headaches , and so on .  
For most people , if there is only isolated pressure which is neither extreme nor sustained leading to headaches , heart palpitations , stomach disorders or soreness in the muscles , it 's not a serious problem . But if physically one has some inherited weaknesses , past illnesses or a relatively weak capacity to endure pressure , then it is very possible that an illness would be brought on or worsened when he or she is faced with relatively greater pressure or emotional change .  
The 1980 ' s was the takeoff period for the ROC information electronics industry . The Hsinchu Science Based Industrial Park and special regulations to reward industrial upgrading were put in place . This was timed just right to give many young scholars who had lived in the US for a few years and acquired great experience the chance to come back to found enterprises , leading to an unprecedented wave of returning talent .  
Early on , ch'i-p'aos were simple - - plain and somewhat oversized , still maintaining some of the character of a nomadic herding people . By the end , both the sleeves and the body of the ch'i-p'ao had become a bit tighter fitting , " says Ma Yu-chi , a famous leading lady of Peking Opera who grew up amid the social world on account of mandarins of her maternal grandfather 's position as a high-ranking Ching official .  
Koo Chen-fu , who has long been known as an " ambassador of trade " holds a similar view : " The main global economic organizations that we 're fighting to join at present now are GATT , which regulates the world 's free trading system ; the International Monetary Fund , which regulates the world 's financial system ; the World Bank , which assists in the development of developing countries ; and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , which is made up of the world 's leading industrialized countries . "  
And hot money , one of the two main factors leading to the disaster of speculative fever ( along with surplus money in circulation ) , has come back to Taiwan . People are just waiting for the opportunity to have their golden dreams again by taking advantage of currency exchange , the stock market and real estate .  
Apart from the ups and downs of the political economic situation , Schmidt especially stressed the pessimistic outlook for the environment , raising the problem of population growth and limited resources adding to the worsening of the greenhouse effect and leading to unlimited tides of human migration . "  
In particular , the influence of applied science on technological development has led to increasing global polarization - - countries with advanced science and technology are becoming increasingly wealthy as they turn out products with high profit margins , leading to greater economic growth and improvements in their quality of life , while countries that are weak in science and technology have had to spend a correspondingly greater amount in exchange for them , leading to sluggish economies and poorer living conditions .  
It 's too bad that negative population growth is n't quite so ideal as it appears on the surface , " says Chang Pei Chi , director of the Office of Man power Planning at Council for Economic Planning and Development of the Executive Yuan . A low birth rate leading to negative population growth will cause the population structure to be perverted into an inverse pyramid . Over time , society will quickly age and lose its vitality . Besides having streets filled with " white-haired old gentlemen , " many social problems will follow .  
For example , hsiang-chu singing copies after Peking Opera , with the tone high pitched and clear , using falsetto , with the same styles for the leading man and leading lady . The gestures and choreography are also more pronounced and defined . The music is performed according to fixed charts , which is quite different from the traditional Taiwanese ko-tzai-hsi where " the teacher gives the root , the actors improvise the branches " - - the actors on the stage and the musicians backstage play off and coor-dinate with each other .  
The main characters in these dramas were mostly country girls , women vendors , or actresses in dramatic troupes . The trademark Hsinhua film was a common love story built around these leading characters . Production was simple , and performance techniques were based on traditional Chinese opera or the singing techniques of folk songs . To these were added clever , catchy songs by the basic team of Yao Min , who wrote the music , Chen Tieh-yi , who composed the lyrics , and Yao Li , who sang the vocals offstage .  
Today geologists are also worried that additional extraneous factors of environmental change , such as the possible melting of glacial ice due to the greenhouse effect , leading to a worldwide rise in sea levels , may further exacerbate the problem , causing land to sink into the sea even faster .  
For someone who has never before been in con tact with drug addicts , the stereotype is closely connected to that of criminal society , with large dark eyebrows over brooding , threatening eyes leading into a violent , powder keg personality . Little did we expect that when we got to the rehabilitation center we would find that the patients were no different from the run-of-the-mill .  
Because tribal drinking is a social activity , if a local leading figure can be enlisted to set a standard and make a start by reducing quantities to a suitable level , in a short period of time results should be evident .  
But this journey is a distant one . Currently the population , lands and culture of the tribal villages are quickly disappearing . As a result , the tribal ceremonies have become mere formalities , put on only for reasons of tourism or politics ; the tribal lodges no longer exist ; the m other tongues and their oral literatures are gradually being forgotten ; traditional social structures have been broken apart ; and tribal elders , chiefs , and leading families have lost their positions of respect . A return to traditional culture would be difficult indeed .  
At present 25% of the national budget goes for defense and the military ; 20% goes toward economic development ; routine government administrative costs account for 10% ; 15% is applied to education . . . . The remaining few percent is up for grabs among public health , agriculture , social welfare , religious , and other interests , naturally leading to the " squeezing out " effect .  
Now , through the efforts of several dedicated teachers at Shuanglung primary school , Shuanglung village has set up a Bunun Cultural Development Association , and has launched a series of back-to-roots events , such as leading tribespeople on visits to the Bunun 's original home , organizing a traditional " eight-part singing " group and opening a cultural resources office .  
Hong Kong textbooks , which tend to adopt a pragmatic approach , do their utmost to avoid ideology . When describing historical incidents they mainly confine themselves to facts , and when talking about factors leading to conflicts they also do their best to avoid either laudatory or derogatory language , and try to bring out both positive and negative aspects .  
Mainland textbooks on the other hand stress the Communist Party of China 's development of an all-out resistance campaign behind enemy lines , stressing that " the Nationalist government , for fear of unleashing the great power of the people to resist the Japanese , only mobilized the government and the army in partial resistance , leading to severe military failures . The CPC implemented a total war of resistance , effectively complementing the Kuomintang 's overall military strategy and threatening the enemy 's rear . "  
Increasingly frequent interaction between mainland China and Taiwan , their respective political climates , and the new world order taking shape in the post-Cold-War era are of course important historical backdrops , but the ominous tone of the book 's title , and related historical events which the author used as examples , were factors leading to the sensation surrounding T-Day Many people who had never even read the book joined in the debate , some were even frightened to the point of making preparations to emigrate .  
In fact , outside the charmed circle of leading business families are large numbers of ethnic Chinese whose forebears came as laborers , and who still live at a low economic level with limited educational opportunities , just like the rest of the population . For many young women from this background , marriage is a means of escape from a life of poverty .  
" The so-called fashion of the times was always cyclical " says a leading interior designer in London . The styles were always going from elaborate to elegant , then your eyes would get bored and want elaboration again . The colors went from gay to somber , and after a while returned to gay .  
The Chinese dance tradition is broad and deep . In the Zhou dynasty , the government established official forms of music and dance , and viewed them as an integral part of education . In the Han , the court held ritual performances , and at banquets guest and host would take turns leading in dances .  
In making a new opera , characterization is very important , and the set character types of traditional opera are often insufficient . There 's nothing new about transcending these limitations by merging and melding traditional character types . Years ago Mei Lanfang combined traits of the qingyi ( leading female ) and huadan ( vivacious female ) roles to create a new type of role , the huashan , that combines features of both .  
In the Ming dynasty story " The Oil Peddler and the Plum Flower Girl " ( included in the collection Lasting Words to Awaken the World ) , the usually unruffled soul of the leading male character Qin Zhong is as if struck by lightning : " He stood dumbstruck for an age , his whole body limp and numb " - is that not what people today mean when they say someone is " love-struck " ?  
The White Paper on Youth released by the Executive Yuan 's National Youth Commission two years ago gave the results of a survey , showing that of parental attitudes toward their children , exploitation or abuse , too-severe discipline , contradictory parent-ing , differences in opinion between the two parents , breakdown of the family unit , worsening of the atmosphere in the family , low social status of parents , and incorrect values and attitudes toward society were the major factors leading to juvenile crime .  
Just as Emotional Intelligence author Daniel Goleman has observed , many social phenomena of the last few decades have revealed that neither academic achievement nor professional ability are the sole factors leading to success . Especially in modern corporations which emphasize organizational management , such qualities as emotional balance , personability and leadership are frequently more important .  
Shrines are everywhere on the broad yellow ground . There are many steps leading up the sharply rising platforms ( pyramid-like structures but level on top rather than coming to an apex ) , testing the endurance of tourists . The site also has the earliest astronomical observatory in Mesoamerica .  
In the days leading up to the takeover , one periodically reads of incoming chief executive Tung Chee-hwa admonishing Hong Kong people : Confucian culture must be strengthened , civic education is very valuable , family values must be reconstructed .  
The first book he ever bought himself was Stories from Chinese History . Later , when he studied at Chienkuo Boys High School , his happiest moments were browsing the second-hand book stores on Kuling Street with his classmates . This was a very popular place for literary youth of the 1960s and 70s to go . Reading books outside the main curriculum gave many people a rebellious or independent cast of mind , and cultivated many of today 's leading intellectuals and social elites .  
In the 1720s Burlington 's garden became something that had never been seen before . Its eastern section was in the formal classical style , with three radiating shaded avenues leading in straight lines to classical monuments . In the western part , though , Kent had created an irregular natural style , with groups of small trees and winding paths !  
When Attiret compared the Yuan Mingyuan to European gardens , he pointed out that what the Chinese liked were winding paths leading to secluded places , not straight tree-shaded avenues ; their exquisite river banks were made up of freely arranged groups of rocks showing great variety and a taste of the wilderness . Not only was this unlike the European way of making embankments out of square slabs , but there would even be small islands in the lakes joined by crooked bridges leading to pavilions .  
" The biggest threat is in academic books , " says Chen Hsin-yuan . Taiwan has developed a get-rich-quick culture in recent years . There has been little attention paid to author development or basic research , and there has been excessive reliance on products published in the PRC , leading to a insufficient number of books originating in Taiwan .  
The US plays the leading role under the newly issued Guidelines , while Japan will support the US in any military conflict around Japan . When there is a crisis involving a " regional " issue , the US is required to take responsibility for restoring peace and security in the " region . " Japan , meanwhile , is obliged to keep open its base facilities , airfields , and ports , and provide support to US forces in operating in international waters and airspace .  
In the 70s and 80s , as productive capacity continuously expanded , manufacturing profitability fell and marketing came to play the leading role , with control of brands and distribution channels the key to success . Today , competition is still more intense , and profits from both production and distribution are small . Only the rich earnings offered by financial operations are still attractive . " This is how Ding Kung-wha characterizes the global trend .  
Reflecting their age or even leading it , advertisements expand our scope of vision . Metaphysical Punctuality 's " New , New Youth in China " series won the China Times ' top prize for television commercials in 1993 ( left ) . This year , the winner for print media advertising design was Ideology 's " Little Red Riding Hood " series . Its main theme is modern women 's quest for self-fulfillment and physical safety . ( opposite page photo courtesy of Metaphysical Punctuality Company , left photo courtesy of Ideology Company )  
The Western powers were at the time entering a depression and had no energy to interfere in the affairs of the East . Secondly , blockading of the Communists was underway in Jiangxi . The Nanjing-Guangdong split had occurred , when leading military and political figures established an alternative government after the arrest of Hu Hanmin . The Yangtze also flooded with calamitous consequences , leaving millions of people dead or dislocated .  
Every two years , Dr . Lai Chiu-nan , originator of the " total natural health " lifestyle , based on a " living foods " diet , comes to Taiwan to promote her method for maintaining a healthy body , mind and spirit . Her talks always draw thousands of people . In March of this year , she came to Taiwan again to hold a workshop , leading 600 people in physical and mental training in the mountains of Shuanghsi in Taipei County .  
Hsieh notes that in the US , sectors such as the steel and automotive industries have powerful labor unions which can play a leading role in determining the direction which relations between labor and management take , so there is no need for the government to get involved ; and in various European countries , left-wing labor alliances are just as powerful as right-wing political parties , and alternate with them in government , so the idea of " collective bargaining " is not an empty phrase .  
The main areas affected by land subsidence run down the western coastal plain from Changhua through Chia-yi , Yunlin and Tainan to Pingtung . Fish farming is prevalent in these counties , and ponds dot the entire area . The excessive pumping of ground water by these fish farmers is so severe that the elevation of towns and village in the area is dropping . This creates problems with drainage leading to frequent flooding .  
It emerged that the Rey Lee Resort Hotel , which suffered severe structural damage in the quake , is actually an illegal structure , and its business license was revoked long ago . However , the owner had continued operating the hotel , leading to many guests being injured by earth and rock falls set off by the quake .  
When one mentions the standard of English among schoolchildren and students in Hong Kong , professors at leading local academic institutions such as the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology ( HKUST ) generally express the view that it often leaves much to be desired . " More class time is spent explaining English than teaching subject matter , " says Professor Chi Hsi-sheng of HKUST 's Division of Social Science .  
In 1959 the Chinese communists invaded Tibet , and the Dalai Lama and leading officials fled abroad . They took much valuable jewelry with them , including coral , amber and turquoise , as well as many mysterious dZi beads with their stunning contrasts of white on black .  
In the early years of the Republic of China , with constant fighting among the warlords , intellectuals wrote martial arts novels to amuse themselves , and magazine stories grew more and more decadent and extravagant , leading Lu Xun to describe them as " monstrous and evil at heart , and filled with descriptions of romance . " These works invited their urban readers to escape the painful realities of their lives .  
Their next main target was 500 core industry firms including listed companies and leading firms in various industries ; in the third phase they expanded their focus further to a total of 5000-plus key companies ( medium and large companies with an annual output value over NT $ 100 million ) .  
Dr . Sheih says that kidney disease has long been one of the ten leading causes of death in Taiwan . " Both kidney transplant patients and dialysis patients have to endure considerable pain , " he observes . In addition to this physical suffering , before the introduction of universal health insurance in Taiwan kidney disease was a tremendous financial burden for patients ; now that dialysis is covered by National Health Insurance , it is a substantial item of the system 's expenditure .  
Then I came back to work to apply what I 've learned , " explains Hsing . She originally studied land management , but discovered that Taiwan lacks any comprehensive land management policy , leading to rampant overdevelopment and speculation . She decided to go study urban planning . " And then I discovered that urban planning is closely related to environmental management and public policy , so I went from program to program . "  
It was here that Yen Tsang-po , who has long been a leading light among Taiwanese geologists , discovered sedimentary rock dating back 200 million years , the oldest ever found in Taiwan . An analysis of what he found tells us the basic story of Taiwan 's formation . For untold eons , what is now Taiwan lay upon the ocean floor collecting sediment that had been washed out to sea from the Asian mainland .  
Many suggest that the causes underlying these problems date from the downsizing of the provincial government . Power over local resources has become more centralized , leading to a consequent decline in local self-rule . Compounding these problems , many of the county and city governments in areas seriously affected by the earthquake are controlled by the DPP or are not under the control of any one party , whilst many of the grass-roots level administration is in the hands of the KMT . This creates an unwieldy political environment and generates envy between central and local administrations .  
Furthermore , the site stated that the " Palm Thunder " guns , sold for US $ 250 , must be paid for anonymously , and that deals would be processed only after payment was received , leading police to suspect fraudulent behavior .  
They offer intense plots and dialogue and always feature attractive leading men and women .

These were the accession of more developing countries and economies in transition to WTO ; improvements in the human and administrative capacities of developing countries , leading to their greater involvement in initiatives in the WTO and in the regional trading arrangements ; and an improved understanding of the developmental dimension of the trade and environment nexus .  
The continued preference of some of the warring Afghan parties for the military option , and their intransigence and lack of responsiveness to the strenuous efforts of the special representative to achieve a comprehensive settlement , confirm the need to develop the efforts currently being made by the United Nations and to direct these efforts to more practical steps leading to the creation of the climate necessary for the implementation of the proposals made to date and of the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council on this subject .  
Meanwhile , as is clear from the above , the international community of States has unequivocally admitted that the Abkhaz separatists are still pursuing " ethnic cleansing " by using the most barbaric methods in the territory under their control , leading to the massive destruction and forcible expulsion of the Georgian population , who had made up half the total population of Abkhazia before the conflict .  
The Sudan is also ready and willing to participate in the preparatory meetings leading to the forthcoming Ottawa Conference , which will hopefully commit those countries which have expressed their readiness to accept some constraints on the kind of landmine that can be used or sold , taking into consideration paragraphs 69 and 70 of the section on Disarmament and international security of the Final Document adopted at the Twelfth Ministerial Conference of the Movement of Non _ Aligned Countries held in New Delhi on 7 and 8 April 1997 . 
Of the major changes that have occurred in this century , there is no doubt that one of the most transcendent and revolutionary has been the gradual shift in the area of human rights away from the leading role traditionally played by the State and towards a new vision focused more on human beings than on the authorities wielding power .  
It is against this background of societies repeatedly traumatized by economic , social , cultural and other factors that such extreme situations develop , in which the breakdown of the institutional order opens the floodgates to widespread violence and massacres of the civilian population , frequently leading in the end to actual genocide .  
While the international law of human rights is , indeed , addressed to the behaviour of States and deals with acts or omissions of government officials 18 / or their agents , modern developments of international humanitarian law , 19 / recent authoritative pronouncements such as indicated in the introductory section of this working paper , 20 / and a respectable body of theory 21 / tend to embrace elements leading to some modification of the traditional position that private individuals or groups are not capable of violating human rights .

In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would indeed have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
It was regrettable that racial hatred , intolerance , ethnic persecution and unchecked political ambitions were continuing to cause conflicts leading to such mass movements .  
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .

Paragraph 22.2 should read : " The programme aims at a major strengthening of coordination for human rights throughout the United Nations system leading to a comprehensive and integrated approach to the promotion and protection of human rights based on the contributions of each of the United Nations organs , bodies and specialized agencies whose activities deal with the human rights and on improved inter-agency cooperation and coordination .  
The facts in the Nwankavo case , where there was overwhelming evidence of abuse leading finally to some welcome disciplinary action against the law enforcement officials involved , suggest a judicial disposition precipitately and prematurely to believe the police and to disbelieve the foreign accused / complainant , as well as a reluctance fully to rectify the original wrong .
