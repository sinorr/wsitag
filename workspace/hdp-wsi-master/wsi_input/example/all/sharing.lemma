Trilateral forms of cooperation between the High Commissioner , CSCE and the Council of Europe will be strengthened in the areas mentioned above through regular yearly meetings , effective and timely sharing of information and the establishment of focal points on human rights issues in each of the respective offices .  
Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity , and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reiterating the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of its components , as well as the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources ,  
In the statement , the Conference noted that the Convention on Biological Diversity was the primary international legal instrument for advancing the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the use of genetic resources .  
The Convention on Biological Diversity is the primary international legal instrument for advancing the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the use of genetic resources , while recognizing the important role of other conventions to the objectives of the Convention .  
The three political , military or humanitarian functions can be carried out in integrated and unified operations , provided that there are clearly established modalities of cooperation , including information sharing , transparency , joint planning and logistics ;  
The Special Unit for TCDC of UNDP has extensive experience in the field of technical cooperation in Africa with activities such as capacities and needs matching ( CNM ) , subject-specific workshops focusing on interactive exchange and consultations designed for sharing experiences and know-how , and development of an information referral system ( INRES ) , a data bank on developing countries ' institutional capacities accessible to all potential users .  
Particular areas in which regional cooperation requires strengthening by both the Territories concerned and international agencies : preservation and protection of marine and other natural resources from over-exploitation ; transport and communications ; higher education ; research and development ; regional pooling arrangements for sharing special skills and expertise ; and assistance in the public health area ;  
In this difficult moment , I wish to express my Government 's full solidarity with the UNPROFOR forces , particularly with the courageous Dutch soldiers operating in the Srebrenica territory , sharing the hardships of the civilian population they are protecting and facing overwhelmingly superior forces .  
The unique character of the Congress , in which the participants combined political leverage and expertise , and which served as a forum for the world-wide sharing of knowledge , exchange of experience and transfer of technological know-how , has been widely recognized , and its productive results were emphasized both at the Congress and at the Commission 's subsequent session . 
It is generally accepted that such sharing of experience and expertise among the developing countries using the TCDC modality often develop into ECDC arrangements , which comprise practical and collective economic actions among developing countries , requiring for the most part capital investment and / or major joint ventures .  
Discrimination in education and training , hiring and remuneration , promotion and horizontal mobility practices , as well as inflexible working conditions , lack of access to productive resources and inadequate sharing of family responsibilities , combined with a lack of or insufficient services such as child care , continue to restrict employment , economic , professional and other opportunities and mobility for women and make their involvement stressful .  
Work actively , where necessary , to find additional ways and means for the effective protection and use of such knowledge , innovations and practices , subject to national legislation and consistent with the Convention on Biological Diversity and relevant international law , encourage fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge , innovation and practices .  
Other obstacles to the development of businesses owned by women include an adverse economic and regulatory environment , inadequate physical infrastructure and marketing , poor access to new technology , and a lack of vocational and managerial training .  Rigid social and cultural norms and lack of sharing of domestic responsibilities exacerbate the problems women face when operating businesses .

The view was expressed that international cooperation in outer space activities should be further strengthened through the promotion of transparency , exchange of data , equitable sharing of space benefits and confidence-building measures between developed and developing countries .  
We must foster and strengthen democratic participation in the political sphere to develop , through a sharing of responsibility between the State , local government and civil society , a model of unified efforts for social development .  
In view of those difficulties , the Government was developing a policy that combined campaigns to eradicate stereotypes in several areas , ranging from the sharing of domestic responsibilities to the role of the media , with the establishment of affirmative action programmes in the public and private sectors .  
The Panel may also receive substantive inputs from the Convention following the third meeting of the Conference of the Parties on , inter alia , the underlying causes of biological diversity loss in forest ecosystems , components and dynamics of biological diversity , and ways and means for the effective protection and use of traditional forest-related knowledge , innovations and practices of forest-dwellers , indigenous and local communities , as well as fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from such knowledge , innovation and practices .  
Helping to identify relevant principles , guidelines and mechanisms for countries to develop their own appropriate and effective sui generis system ( s ) , such as traditional resource rights , in order to implement article 8 ( j ) ( requiring that States " respect , preserve and maintain knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles " , while encouraging the " equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge , innovations and practices " ) ;  
In a manner consistent with national legislation , seek to increase the ability of local authorities , non-governmental organizations and the private sector to link directly with global capital markets , in accordance with prudential safeguards in those markets , in order to finance their shelter and infrastructure programmes and to establish international and local mechanisms and instruments to facilitate risk sharing and credit enhancement for investing agencies - local , regional and national ;

It is essential to define , at the national , regional and local levels , a family support programme that is based on the principle of equal sharing of family responsibilities and is consistent with the policies for promoting equality in the labour market and protecting the rights of the child .  
From a water allocation perspective , water in aquifers and rivers has to be shared on three complementary levels : ( a ) local sharing between water-dependent sectors and users ( households , industries , irrigated agriculture ) ; ( b ) urban / rural sharing ; and ( c ) upstream / downstream sharing by sequential reuse .  
The recommendations cover , inter alia , ensuring that the burden of proof is reversed regarding the lawful origin of alleged proceeds or other property liable to confiscation ; concluding agreements with other Governments on the sharing of confiscated illicit proceeds in order to promote the willingness of Governments to investigate and share information on money-laundering activities ; and contributing at least part of the value of confiscated proceeds and property to governmental and intergovernmental bodies that specialize in the fight against illicit traffic in and abuse of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances .  
26 Mechanisms used for accessing the resources and expertise of FLC included sharing information , exchanging personnel , finding technical assistance , using unique federal laboratory facilities and capabilities , licensing patents and technical know-how , acquiring software , performing cooperative research and development , using cooperative research and development agreements directly with private companies and other entities , working cooperatively with NASA , forming consortia and using technology developed under government contracts .  
In view of the small size constraint faced by many island developing countries , special efforts should be made to promote regional cooperation arrangements that offer a viable framework for realizing economies of scale in various economic activities , particularly with regard to resource exploitation , protection and policing of coast lines and exclusive economic zones , environmental protection , market access , development and sharing of human resources , expansion of inter-island feeder services , tourism development and exchange of information on successes and failures in various areas of development .  
If sustainable forest management as conceptualized at the international level is to be widely implemented at the national level on a lasting basis , international solidarity in the sharing of technologies , know-how and information and in making resources available to meet common needs must receive increased attention .  
The conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources should be integrated into national forest programmes ;  
" Respect , preserve and maintain knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and promote their wider application with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge , innovations and practices and encourage the equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge , innovations and practices " ( art . ) ;  
The Panel at its second session ( E / CN . 17 / 1996 / 24 ) noted that a series of issues concerning the provision of technical , technological and scientific advice on traditional knowledge , innovations and practices of forest use and conservation merited further development ( para . 88 ) , identified matters that should be addressed ( para . 89 ) and noted the need for the effective protection of indigenous rights and for the equitable sharing of benefits ( para .  NULL  
Mutual cooperation and assistance in matters concerning serious transnational crime shall also include , as appropriate , the strengthening of systems for the sharing of information among Member States and the provision of bilateral and multilateral technical assistance to Member States by utilizing training , exchange programmes and law enforcement training academies and criminal justice institutes at the international level .  
The Special Rapporteur repeats that no peace worthy of the name can be established in Burundi unless an equitable solution is found to the above-mentioned problem , a solution that provides strong guarantees to the minority once and for all , ensures respect for democracy and leads , at last , to a real sharing of power on concrete and realistic bases , so that the tremendous social and economic inequalities that continue to beset Burundi society may be overcome .  
The High Commissioner / Centre maintained a close working relation with the Conference secretariat by sharing its expertise and providing background materials as well as contributions in the area of human rights and on the specific issues of forced displacement , with a view to ensuring that commitments undertaken under international human rights and humanitarian law standards were accurately reflected in the final document of the Conference . 
Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , the provision of financial resources , technology transfer , respect for each country 's intellectual property rights , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources , in particular for the developing countries ,  
It endorsed the Secretary-General 's initiative to convene a Special Consultative Meeting of entities involved with the carriage of materials subject to the 1993 INF Code and the coastal States concerned for the purpose of sharing information , concerns and ideas and to gain a better understanding of the safety and environmental aspects involved .

But security on this dual level will remain an unattained and unattainable dream so long as the major goal has not been achieved or rather , so long as the first sine qua non condition has not been fulfilled : equitable power sharing providing the necessary balance among national communities .  
" Mutual cooperation and assistance in matters concerning serious transnational crime shall also include , as appropriate , the strengthening of systems for the sharing of information among Member States and the provision of bilateral and multilateral technical assistance to Member States by utilizing training , exchange programmes and law enforcement training academies and criminal justice institutes at the international level .

" Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , the provision of financial resources , technology transfer , respect for each country 's intellectual property rights , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources , in particular for the developing countries ,  
Deeply concerned by the continued loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources ,  
It is indisputably one of the major achievements of the United Nations and has come to be regarded as a multilateral instrument that holds out great promise and vast potential for the maintenance of peace , an equitable basis for sharing the resources of the world 's oceans and a means for securing economic and social progress for all the peoples of the Earth .  
[ Encouraged ] [ ( iii ) Encouraging ] Governments with the support of donors and international organizations to assist [ financially and otherwise ] existing networks promoting the sharing of TFRK [ as well as on mutually agreed terms of technology and profits from biotechnology products derived from these resources ] among concerned groups and institutions in collaboration with involved forest dwellers , indigenous people and local communities ;  
Strengthening national research and training institutions at the national and international levels , and improving knowledge sharing and extension mechanisms [ is a ] are critical [ prerequisites ] with respect to increasing absorptive capacity for technology transfer and ensuring adequate capability to adapt these technologies to local conditions .  
Much attention is still given to timber and forest cover , whereas other goods and services provided by forests such as fuelwood , [ the sustainable use , conservation and equitable sharing of benefits of ] biological diversity , soil and water conservation protection functions , carbon sequestration and other social , cultural and economic aspects are rarely covered and will need more attention .  
These should fully recognize the ecological , social , cultural and [ religious ] [ spiritual ] values of forests [ and pay particular attention to global dimensions of climate change and the sustainable use , conservation and equitable sharing of the benefits of biological diversity . ]  
Since countries each have different relative strengths and all have limited financial means , considerable benefit can be realized from sharing international efforts to develop resource and environmental accounting concepts and methods .  
The Special Rapporteur ventures to remind them that there can be no lasting peace in Burundi until an equitable solution is found to the crucial problem of power _ sharing between the minority and majority on a concrete and realistic basis , providing the minority with sound and genuine guarantees and ensuring that the rights of the majority are firmly respected , in order to overcome the deep _ rooted socio _ economic inequalities from which Burundi society continues to suffer .  
On the basis of all the information received and a detailed study of the documentation it appears that the situation of the Sikhs in the religious field is satisfactory , but that difficulties are arising in the political ( foreign interference , terrorism , etc . ) , economic ( in particular with regard to sharing of water supplies ) and even occupational fields .  
Furthermore , they have established programmes to develop the principles of the CBD and facilitate their implementation : on coastal and marine biodiversity ; forest biodiversity ; agricultural biodiversity ; the biodiversity of inland waters ; the rights of indigenous and local communities under the CBD ; and the equitable sharing of the benefits of biodiversity .  
The objectives of the work programme are , first , to promote the positive effects and mitigate the negative impacts of agricultural practices on biological diversity in agro-ecosystems and their interface with other ecosystems ; second , to promote the conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources of actual or potential value for food and agriculture ; and third , to promote the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources .  
Deeply concerned by the continued loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources ,  
Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms and that carefully designed programmes of teaching , learning , training and sharing of experiences , materials and information can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
Ways and means to secure the effective protection of indigenous rights and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of TFRK , which many countries consider should incorporate appropriate payment to indigenous people and relevant local communities based on their intellectual property rights , should be identified in the context of international and national legal systems , which may include recognition of customary law and indigenous legal systems .  
It noted the statement annexed to decision II / 9 of the Conference of the Parties to that Convention , and accepted that the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from research and development and from the commercial utilization of biological resources fell , inter alia , within the purview of the Convention .  
Much attention is still given to timber and forest cover , whereas other goods and services provided by forests , such as fuelwood , the sustainable use and conservation and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits of biological diversity , soil and water protection functions , and carbon sequestration and sinks , as well as other social , cultural and economic aspects , are rarely covered and need to be considered .  
Application of telemedecine was seen by experts as a promising way of addressing issues such as equity , cost containment , optimizing the use expensive technology and specialized medical services , upgrading of health treatment , improving access of patients in remote areas to primary and specialized health services , and regional sharing of knowledge and cooperation .  
The individual elements of a culture of peace are therefore : non-violence and respect for human rights , respect and solidarity among all peoples and dialogue between cultures , the linkage of peace to democratic participation and sustainable human development , the free flow and sharing of information and knowledge , contribution to conflict-prevention and post-conflict peace-building , and equality between women and men , all best supported through projects in which people take an active role in transforming their values , attitudes and behaviours .  
International Corporations should negotiate with the indigenous communities a just and fair profit _ sharing arrangement , prior to signing of any kind of agreement , and with full disclosure of the projected profit and complete development plans for the relevant project , to ensure that the peoples concerned receive an equitable profit share and / or compensation package .  
National reports on the implementation of Agenda 21 have proved to be a valuable means of sharing information at the international and regional levels and , even more important , of providing a focus for the coordination of issues related to sustainable development at the national level within individual countries .  
The tripartite gathering , the sixth in a series launched in July 1993 , represented a further advance in the informal process of sharing of information , improving coordination , avoiding duplication and optimizing the utilization of scarce resources .  
All RCF programmes for Asia and the Pacific are based on one or more of the following regional criteria : sharing and / or pooling resources ( including intellectual and natural resources ) ; addressing trans-boundary issues ; addressing a common need or common problem ; and developing or promoting agreed upon regional regimes , norms or policies .  
The main needs of developing countries with respect to EMS and ISO 14001 include assistance in awareness building , access to information , access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , technical and financial support for participation in the development of international standards , infrastructure requirements including through assistance in the development and implementation of related legislation , the training of local auditors and consultants , sharing experiences on implementing EMS , and support for SMEs .  
Among them we have found those attitudes and behaviours that reflect and inspire social interaction and sharing ; an enhanced role and responsibility for civil society ; the promotion of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through education ; facilitating informal and non-formal education in a broader range of social institutions , including families , local communities and the mass media ; recognition of equal rights and opportunities for women and men ; and attachment to the principles of tolerance , pluralism and participation .  
UNHCR also noted the continuing cooperation and information _ sharing with the relevant mechanism of the Commission , specifically noting the logistical support and information-sharing and collaboration with United Nations human rights field missions , which it considered to be an important means of addressing the root causes issues and an integral part of comprehensive solutions .  
Accordingly , the need to safeguard private investment through strong intellectual property regimes must be compensated by workable arrangements that ensure equitable sharing of socio-economic benefits with the developing world .  
There is an increased willingness to work across national borders marked by mountain chains , in particular for scientific reasons , such as to study the behaviour of migratory species , for environmental conservation purposes , and for ecological / economic reasons among countries sharing major watercourses .  
The Workshop strongly recommends that a regional technical cooperation programme be designed and implemented as a matter of urgent priority in partnership with the Centre for Human Rights of the United Nations , under its technical cooperation programme , with a view to facilitating the sharing of experience , expertise and best practices within the region to further enhance national and regional human rights capacities .  
Mutual cooperation and assistance in matters concerning serious transnational crime shall also include , as appropriate , the strengthening of systems for the sharing of information among Member States and the provision of bilateral and multilateral technical assistance to Member States by utilizing training , exchange programmes and law enforcement training academies and criminal justice institutes at the international level .  
In paragraphs 5 to 8 of the resolution , the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to submit plans for sharing the costs of establishing and operating a global networking facility with United Nations specialized agencies and programmes ; to report on requirements for network services ; to propose formulas for cost sharing ; to provide comprehensive information concerning location of telecommunications facilities in Member States ; and to show clearly the costs of telecommunications attributable to peacekeeping operations .  
United Nations observations conducted in 87 schools and a detailed infrastructure survey by UNICEF in mid-1997 of an additional 150 schools showed a severe shortage of desks , resulting in an average of four pupils sharing a desk for two and approximately 50 per cent of the students sitting on the floor , lack of teaching aids , buildings in dilapidated condition and a lack of operational water and sanitation facilities .  
Deeply concerned by the continued loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources ,  
Four projects on formulation of technical assistance projects that can enhance economic cooperation among developing countries through the exchange of experiences and know-how and the sharing of methods of production , identification of technical assistance needs by integration groupings in the field and searches for practical and operational solutions , development of a cadre of trained negotiators in international commercial diplomacy and mobilization of funds for the financing of operational activities ; 
National reports on the implementation of Agenda 21 have proved to be a valuable means of sharing information at the international and regional levels and , even more important , of providing a focus for the coordination of issues related to sustainable development at the national level within individual countries .  
The implementation of the programmes as planned requires additional resources , which to an extent the Government of Lebanon has been forthcoming to make available through cost _ sharing ; a similar effort is required through increased mobilization of resources from bilateral donors and international institutions for United Nations system _ supported national programmes . 
SFOR and its Civic Military Cooperation ( CIMIC ) Task Force has increased efforts to work with the Office of the High Representative and the international community on the media problems through several integrated working groups , sharing of resources and coordinated operations to develop means to counter blatant media bias and improve the populace 's ability to have alternative access to information .  
Finally , for module four , covering demand reduction , the following areas will be of main interest : establishment of a subregional coordination mechanism at policy and operational levels ; harmonization of legislation ; promotion of information exchange at the subregional level ; assessment of illicit demand and sharing of experience in prevention and treatment ; joint training activities ; and harmonization of licit control of narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and precursors .  
It includes citizen initiative and participation , the sharing of responsibility between the central State authorities and autonomous State or private bodies , incentives to creativity and responses based very clearly on the specific needs of vulnerable groups .  
However , the implications of that approach as it applied to economic , social and cultural rights , development and the sharing of obligations at the national and international levels were less evident , particularly in the case of developing countries .  
To that end , international cooperation would have to be intensified by improving trade relations and access to markets , sharing new technologies , creating a favourable international financial and economic order and allocating increased development resources to developing countries .  
The Panel recognized that the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from research and development and from the commercial utilization of biological resources fell , inter alia , within the purview of the Convention .  
UNESCO played a vital role in the round tables of the specialized agencies on communication for development , which constituted an informal mechanism for consultation , the sharing of ideas and experience and the organization of joint action .  
Noting the expansion of the technical cooperation programme of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , extended upon the request of the concerned Member States , and the crucial importance of sharing information and experiences and developing and strengthening national capacities for the promotion and protection of human rights ,  
Technical and economic cooperation among developing countries ( TCDC / ECDC ) facilitated increased South-South sharing of capacities through the development and dissemination of 250 best practices in good governance , structural adjustment , poverty eradication , micro-financing , maternal mortality , agriculture and food security , science and technology for sustainable human development , job creation and management of the environment and the sustainable development of small island states . 
Noting the expansion of the technical cooperation programme of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , extended upon the request of the concerned Member States , and the crucial importance of sharing information and experiences and developing and strengthening national capacities for the promotion and protection of human rights ,  
To undertake capacity-building work with indigenous and local communities in order to facilitate their active participation , at all levels of the tourism development process , including transparent decision-making and sharing of benefits , and to create awareness of the social , economic and environmental costs and benefits that they are bearing ;  
It is now widely recognized that the implementation of sustainable development schemes will have to be based on original and innovative approaches to the development process , where sharing must be an integral part of the support given by the industrialized world .  
Emphasizes the role of the international community and external assistance to developing countries and countries with economies in transition in improving the quality of information on the impact of urbanization on all aspects of sustainable development , in sharing of information on the use of economic instruments and in the transfer and dissemination of environmentally sound technology ;  
Activities include coordination meetings and electronic discussions on the planning of cooperative activities and sharing of experience , support for subregional training courses , pilot projects on the application of telematics for development in sectors of public concern , and promotion of the African content of the World Wide Web for educational , scientific , social and cultural development .  
While sharing the concern expressed by some delegations at the third annual sessions 1997 and 1998 that the 4 per cent level of the reserve may be too low , the Executive Director has concluded that the first priority for UNOPS in the current and next bienniums is the restoration of the operational reserve to its level as presently prescribed .  
He stressed in particular the need for prior consultation and full participation of indigenous peoples in the elaboration of energy projects , for compensation and benefit _ sharing , and for sociocultural impact studies to be integrated into the normal environmental impact assessments .  
Finally , coordination between the human rights and humanitarian components of United Nations operations , on the one hand , and political and military components , on the other , will help ensure sharing of information needed to assess the likelihood of mass exoduses and formulate and implement strategies to prevent , prepare for and respond to these emergencies in an effective and comprehensive manner .  
The United Nations International Drug Control Programme and other relevant international and regional organizations : ( i ) to promote the participation of target groups in the design of projects and facilitate the sharing of information on best strategies ; and ( ii ) to facilitate the creation of an international network promoting regular contact among youth involved in demand reduction activities and allowing them to stay informed and learn from one another .  
Anti-competitive practices and abuse of dominant market positions limit market access and market entry to major developed country markets ; they include exclusive dealing , market sharing , export restraints imposed on licensees and joint venture partners , and denial of access to international networks and technology markets .  
The problem needed to be addressed nationally , by supporting the private and informal sectors , promoting self-employment , providing credit facilities to the unemployed , encouraging the creation of volunteer organizations and investing in training programmes ; internationally , by dismantling trade barriers , ensuring adequate capital flows to developing nations , encouraging technology transfer , alleviating the debt burden and sharing experiences .  
The scale of the financing required ruled out the possibility of continuing the current practice of making voluntary contributions on an ad hoc basis ; a more reasonable and transparent formula for sharing the burden would be needed .  
Promotes the sharing and transfer of experience through the monitoring of human settlements indicators and learning from best practices in the implementation of the Habitat Agenda at the local , national , regional and global levels and feeds back the lessons learned and experiences gained in improving human settlements conditions at the country level into global policy development processes ;  
It was therefore important to reinforce regional and international cooperation in combating drugs and essential to assist developing countries whether drug producing or otherwise in the administrative , judicial , economic and social areas , among other things by sharing information on investigation techniques , crop substitution , detoxification and reintegration of drug addicts into society .  
Particular attention will be required to coordinate eco-tourism ventures at the regional level , and to facilitate the sharing of information and experiences and the integration of the private sector within official development assistance supported eco-tourism projects .  
To undertake capacity-building work with indigenous and local communities in order to facilitate their active participation , at all levels of the tourism development process , including transparent decision-making and sharing of benefits , and to create awareness of the social , economic and environmental costs and benefits that they are bearing ;  
At the regional level , ongoing activities conducive to the sustainable management of coastal and marine resources include training of personnel , acquisition of equipment and facilities , production of stock assessment data and other resource inventories , upgrading of skills for management of marine parks , studies on pollution , information exchange and sharing of experience from within and outside the regions , and production of ICAM plans using regional guidelines .  
Moreover , the increasing participation of local communities in tourism development has encouraged modern structures of public administration as well as the sharing of joint responsibilities between public institutions and the private sector .  
A further review during the past six months has focused on bringing UNFICYP into line with the approaches in more recently established peacekeeping missions , while achieving additional efficiencies by integrating civilian and military personnel in terms of sharing responsibilities and decision-making , establishing more transparency and better financial control .  
Reports mention the poor food , the sharing of cells with people who have committed criminal acts , and harsh treatment by police officers ( made all the more easy by the fact that the illegal persons status makes it more difficult for them to gain access to official legal channels ) , all of which has apparently led to the death of a number of immigrants while in detention . 
Working sessions focused on presentation by national institutions of their activities , achievements and prospects and the sharing of experiences ; on international and regional cooperation for the promotion and protection of human rights ; cooperation for human rights within the framework of follow-up to the Barcelona Declaration adopted in November 1995 ; and free movement of people and human rights with particular reference to the northern and southern part of the Mediterranean basin .  
To help strengthen the capacities of developing countries in sustainable human development through TCDC , the Unit supported a number of strategic initiatives aimed at increasing the sharing of experiences in critical areas and strengthening networking among centres of excellence .  
Mr . Kolby ( Norway ) said that the potential development impact of TCDC for developing countries was increasingly being recognized , since South-South cooperation was essential as a means of sharing relevant development experiences , his delegation welcomed the leading role increasingly being taken by developing countries themselves in initiating , organizing and financing TCDC activities , since national ownership and commitment were crucial to the success of South-South cooperation .
