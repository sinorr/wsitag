During which people will be reminded of historical incidents that determined the majority of the modern political and cultural nature of the South Pacific by unusual means .  
All state representatives at the Tunis Summit claimed that this plan proved the countries ' commitment to pursue and strengthen political , economic , social , and educational reforms .  However , these reforms had to be carried out according to the national conditions , cultural backgrounds , religious beliefs , and the possible extent of change of individual states to silently resist the U.S . intention of forcing the Arab states into carrying out political and economic reforms by means foreign to the Arabs .  
Both sides felt pleased and satisfied with the remarkable achievements in the friendly cooperation in political , economic and cultural and other fields between the two countries for over 30 years since China and Austria established diplomatic relations .  
Even though the cultural undertones manifested bore greater differences from regions in the upper middle reaches of the Yellow River and those in the lower middle reaches of the Lancang River , certain connections could still be found from relevant aspects such as the red scorched earth houses , linear stone axes , and ancient painted potteries .  The crops of corn and the pigs reared by people were particular proof of the countless ties between ancient Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the Inner Central Plains .  
As the economic and cultural center for China 's north east region , the provincial capital Shen Yang and five surrounding cities have jointly formed a metropolis , with Da Lian gradually becoming a significant port in north east Asia .  
In a welcoming speech , Fernando Chui Sai On , secretary of social and cultural affairs with the Macao Special Administrative Region ( SAR ) government , said that the importance of the Chinese language has been fully demonstrated as China 's comprehensive national strength gradually improves and the process of reform and opening up continues .  With the number of overseas learners soaring and teaching scales expanding , the development of Chinese as a second language has been boosted .  
Its aim is to use Chinese national traditional culture as a link to associate and unite compatriots at home and abroad , to spread national culture , to display the charm of the superior art of the motherland and display the achievements and elegant demeanor of overseas Chinese , Chinese artists in art realms and international cultural exchange .  
Due to differences in country 's situations , differences in economic development levels , cultural backgrounds , historical traditions , and social systems , each country should formulate suitable , effective population policies according to the actual situation of the native country .  
We must firmly redress the erroneous tendency to neglect ideological and political work and to " pay more attention to material progress than to cultural and ideological progress " in some places and departments ; develop a stronger sense of responsibility and urgency ; and conscientiously pay attention to and step up the effort to solve a series of major issues facing the effort to strengthen and improve ideological and political work , from the perspective of consolidating the party 's status as a ruling party and accomplishing the party 's historical mission .  
The Chinese Government believes that issues like the space for Taiwan conducting external economic , cultural , and social activities which are compatible with its capacity in the international community , the political status of Taiwan authorities , and so on can all be ultimately resolved within this framework , through political negotiations , and during the process of peaceful reunification .  
Currently , we are in an important historical period at the turn of two centuries .  Our country 's reform is in the period of storming the fortifications .  Faced with the changeable situation in the world and various complicated social phenomena , some people are at a loss and puzzled .  This is not strange .  The key is that our ideological and political work must adapt to the new situations in China and abroad .  The work must adapt to new changes in our society , politics , economy and cultural lives .  
The cultural pride and ethnic self-respect that have been formed within the Chinese nation over the five-thousand-year history of its ancient civilization is a sure guarantee that the Chinese people , having " stood up , " and carrying on in the glorious tradition of patriotism , will uphold the principles of national unification and territorial completion more than any other sacred mission .  
China is a big country having a cultural origin for 5,000 years .  Under the conditions that the market economic structure was established not long ago , the cultural industry has not taken shape , and the cultural market mechanism has not been perfected , the challenges from opening up China 's cultural markets to the outside world are self-evident , and the opportunities objectively exist too .  The crux of the issue is how the government and enterprises will meet with the challenges and seize hold of the rare historical opportunities .  
Since our party represents the direction of the development of the advanced culture , all comrades of the party must always take Marxism as the guidance , strive to inherit and develop all fine cultural traditions of the Chinese nation , and strive to learn from and absorb all outstanding cultural achievements of foreign countries in order to continuously create and promote the socialist culture with Chinese characteristics , enable the coordinated development of the socialist material and spiritual civilization , and enable comprehensive progress of the society .  
The conference pointed out : Launching activities of " stressing civilization and fostering new practices " in depth is an urgent need for promoting reform and development and maintaining social stability .  It is an urgent need for meeting the growing material and cultural needs of the people and forging closer ties between the party and the government on the one hand and the masses on the other .  It is also necessary for implementing tasks of ideological and political work at the grassroots levels .  
Efforts should be made to extensively launch a rich variety of cultural and sports activities and promotions of scientific knowledge that are convenient to the masses .  The people should be guided to make conscious efforts to change their old customs and habits and foster healthy and civilized habits .  
Cultural and sports activists among the masses should be given ideological education and vocational training , and the more outstanding ones should be selected to serve as instructors for community cultural and sports activities in order to gradually bring these activities onto the track of organized , standardized and healthy development .  
We should keep to a correct orientation in our work , give wide publicity to the main theme of our time , carry forward and develop healthy trends in society , and occupy the front of mass culture with healthy and beneficial activities .  Exhibition halls , museums , science museums , libraries , cultural centers , cinemas , entertainment venues , and tourist spots are all required to propagate a spiritual civilization , oppose feudal and superstitious ideas , and resist vulgar interests .  
Fourth , all localities in Guangdong must constantly enhance the ideological and ethical qualities , as well as the scientific and cultural qualities , of the people ; strengthen the building of a socialist spiritual civilization ; and bring about a well-coordinated economic and social development .  
In view of the development of the objective situation and the change in the ranks of workers and staff members , we should do in-depth and meticulous ideological and political work among them and keep improving their ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities .  
and having heard and examined five special reports - - the State Council 's report on ensuring basic living allowance for people such as laid-off workers of state-owned enterprises , report on raising peasants ' incomes and reducing their burdens , report on building of public security contingents in recent years , report on management of the cultural market , and report on preventing and tackling atmospheric pollution in Beijing Municipality .  
While fully developing the material productive forces , our party should attach great importance to the " cultural productive forces , " which are high-level productive forces ; the value and influence produced by such high-level productive forces will have a direct bearing on every aspect of our work and on our party 's ideological and political work in the new period .  
It is necessary to propel forward the scientific and technological revolution of agriculture , reform the agricultural scientific and technological structure , and gradually establish an agricultural scientific and technological innovative system which can attain the advanced level in the world , a technical dissemination system which can transform scientific and technological achievements in a highly efficient and productive way , and an agricultural educational and training system which can noticeably enhance the scientific , technological , and cultural quality of peasants .  
Only by continuously developing socialist culture and continuously satisfying the masses growing need for spiritual and cultural life can we provide a powerful spiritual drive and guarantee the development of productive forces .  
and eliminate backward production techniques .  Meanwhile , the industrial enterprises in the urban areas should be relocated in an orderly fashion .  With regard to the tertiary industry , we should give priority to developing tourist , financial and insurance , real estate , and cultural industries , as well as network-based information service industries .  
Some delegates indicated : During the current building of a spiritual civilization , the trend of promoting material progress to the neglect of cultural and ideological progress has yet to be checked permanently , and a major factor leading to such a situation is that the related legislation work remains relatively weak ; in view of such a problem , we ought to vigorously strengthen the legislation concerning the building of a socialist spiritual civilization .  
Departments of spiritual promotion and cultural education must organize and guide a large batch of artistic workers and scientific promotion workers to go deep into the frontline of the socialist reform and modernization construction .  They should absorb nourishment and find materials there , create high-quality spiritual products and meet people 's demand for improving their quality of spiritual civilization .  
Deputy Tian Chengzhong , secretary of Pingdingshan City CPC Committee in Henan , said that ideological and political work includes many aspects such as education content , ways and means , leadership system , operational mechanism , component force , and position carriers [ zhen di zai ti , 7109-0966-6528-7555 ] , and is closely lined with structural reform , the building of the legal system , and cultural construction .  
In socialist construction , areas inhabited by minority nationalities in our country have scored achievements attracting worldwide attention .  Owing to the limitations of natural conditions and for historical reasons , however , there is still a certain gap between the minority-nationality regions and the more developed inland and eastern coastal areas in the levels of economic and cultural development .  
1 .  The fifth natural paragraph of General Program shall be amended as : " Our country shall remain at the primary stage of socialism for a long time to come ( at present ) and be faced with a main contradiction between people 's growing material and cultural needs and backward social production .  Owing to domestic factors and international influence , the struggle waged by our country 's people against hostile forces or hostile elements at home and abroad shall be a long-term one .  
He said : During the past 20 years , the economic exchange and trade cooperation between Fujian and Taiwan have steadily developed and continuously grown in quality and quantity , and the contacts of people and activities of social and cultural intercourse have been increasingly frequent , thus initially forming a pattern of mutual complementarity , mutual benefit , mutual promotion , and common development of the economies of the two localities .  
Over more than 20 years of reform and opening up , great development has been made in the rural economy of our country , but the gross economic quantity is still not big enough , and the quality is not high enough .  The current economic conditions still can not satisfy the ever increasing material and cultural needs of the vast number of peasants in their day-to-day lives .  
Therefore , with Marxism as the guide and the training of people who have lofty ideas , moral integrity , education , and a sense of discipline as the goal , we must develop a national , scientific , and popular culture , which is oriented to modernization , the world , and the future , and concentrate efforts on improving the ideological and ethical quality as well as scientific and cultural quality of the entire Chinese nation .  
Only when we continuously develop socialist culture and improve socialist spiritual civilization continuously can we provide a powerful spiritual dynamic force and intellectual support to economic development and overall social progress and can we continuously meet the increasingly growing spiritual and cultural needs of the people .  
The strategic shift of the Party 's work focuses , the eventual affirmation of the basic line for the primary stage of socialism , the steady advancement of reform and opening up , and the gradual establishment of a system of socialist market economy have laid a firm but fully energetic and vigorous systematic basis for pushing forward the development of social productive forces and increasing the levels of the overall national strength and the material and cultural life of the masses of people .  
After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , the second-generation collective leadership with Deng Xiaoping as the core carried forward and developed the thought of Mao Zedong on cultural building .  In order to meet the new needs of reform and opening up and socialist modernization building , they put forth and constantly developed our party 's thinking about the building of socialist spiritual civilization .  
Only by truly fulfilling the " three represents " can the party lead the people in developing social productive forces , flourishing socialist culture with Chinese characteristics , and constantly improving the material and cultural life of the masses of people .  
With reference to the new developments in situations at home and abroad , the new developments in productive forces and the new situations occurring in economic structural reform , the new requirements of the masses of people for their material and cultural life , and the new changes taking place within the contingents of party members and cadres under the new situation , we must earnestly study , deeply understand , and wholly and accurately master the spiritual essence of this important thinking .  
However , while liberating and developing social productive forces , we must also handle numerous issues about production relations and superstructures , especially those issues in the ideological and cultural realms and must let the building of material civilization and the building of spiritual civilization coordinately develop .  
He specially pointed out : General Secretary Jiang Zemin has always been concerned about the ideological and political education among , as well as the healthy growth of , our teenagers .  All relevant departments should run more useful activities , so as to guide the teenagers to establish a correct outlook on life , science , and civilization ; besides , they should also provide more place of activities for teenagers , including scientific parks and cultural centers .  
In some places and schools in our city of Beijing , there still exist the tendency to emphasize cultural knowledge study and to slight ideological and political education as well as the stubborn disease , of varying degrees of seriousness , of one-sidedly pursuing admissions rates and examination results and slackening ideological and political education as well as social practice activities .  
In his speech celebrating the centennial of Beijing University , he called on the vast number of young people to integrate the acquisition of scientific and cultural knowledge with the strengthening of ideological cultivation , book learning with social practice , the attainment of values with serving the motherland and the people , and the cultivation of lofty ideals with the conduct of hard struggles .  
On the one hand , hostile forces in the West are still bent on " Westernizing " and " dividing " us and they try their utmost to step up ideological and cultural infiltration through a multitude of channels .  They publicize capitalist values in the large volumes of imported publications , film and television products , electronic games , computer software , and other spiritual and cultural products in an effort to compete with us for the younger generation .  
Only by correctly understanding and handling the relationship between the economy and politics can we make comprehensive development in the economic , political , ideological and cultural fields , and build ours into a wealthy , strong socialist modern country with democracy and a high degree of civilization .  
This article criticizes that the US advantages in the economic , political , military , and cultural fields are rapidly growing into a burden .  They have created tensions among old friends , weakened the US appeal to supporters , and made the United States face the danger of losing friends .  And this kind of friendly relationship is a " priceless treasure " accumulated over several decades .  
To properly act as the representative of the direction of the advanced culture in China , the key is to adhere to the principle of " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to both , " further advance the socialist cultural and ethic progress , and work hard to build and create the national , scientific , and popular socialist culture with Chinese characteristics , which is geared to the needs of modernization , the world , and the future .  
As a result of the continuous increase in the input of educational infrastructure construction , the reinforcement of cultural market management , and the bold assimilation and innovation of all fine achievements of ancient , modern , Chinese , and foreign cultures , we have created a situation under which the tourism culture , popular culture , and elegant culture with Shenzhen 's characteristics have attained common development .  
Over the past 20 years since the founding of the Shenzhen SEZ , we have exerted ourselves to carry out a series of policies to enrich the people formulated by the central authorities , unceasingly satisfied the people 's ever growing material and cultural demands , and brought about improvement in the economic and social level and the people 's living standards .  
Construction of urban infrastructure facilities including communications , post and telecommunications , water supply , power supply , gas supply , sewage disposal , and so on progressed ahead of schedule , and the residents ' housing , water and electric supply , medical treatment and public health , and cultural and educational conditions were considerably improved .  
For many years we have worked hard to put into practice Deng Xiaoping 's thinking of common prosperity .  Having gained a certain economic strength , we began to carry out the " project of common prosperity " and , relying mainly upon the financial departments at the city level for many consecutive years , raised funds totaling 1.88-billion yuan and put them into the relatively backward areas of the city in a bid to improve their infrastructure facilities , industrial layout , and cultural and educational conditions , thereby bringing about the coordinated development of various localities .  
to insure that all could , on a basis of their own initiative , learn revolutionary theories , guard and fight against the corrosion of corrupt ideology and culture , persistently struggle against schools of reactionary ideological trends , against idealistic and pseudoscientific ideologies ; that all should take in fact the Marxist world outlook , outlook on life , values , and take the initiative in socialist cultural civilization construction ;  
For many years , under the precondition of adhering to the one-China policy , we have put forward a series of policies and measures and made many tremendous , substantial efforts in conducting cross-strait dialogue and improving cross-strait relations .  This has effectively facilitated the exchange of personnel between the two sides as well as economic and cultural exchanges and development ; greatly softened and improved the age-old tension between the two sides ;  
Since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1992 , considerable progress has been made in bilateral friendly and cooperative relations in the political , economic , cultural , and other fields .  
At the same time , while protecting the rights and interests of ethnic minority groups , the governments must respect the universal principle concerning human rights acknowledged by the international community and also have the right to adopt measures that commensurate with their own national conditions in the light of their own realities because historical background , cultural tradition , development level , and nationality composition vary from country to country .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : Since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1992 , bilateral relations have been healthily and rapidly developing .  Our cooperation in the political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , agricultural , and cultural fields has achieved gratifying results .  
China is a socialist country ; it must strive to build strong state finance in order to press forward the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , continually enhance the material and cultural living standards of the people of all nationalities throughout the country , and preserve social stability and state economic and national defense security .  
During reform and opening up as well as during its modernization drives , China has attached importance to and advocated the all-round development of people .  It not only emphasizes the social and economic rights of the people but also vigorously develops and safeguards the political rights of citizens , strives for realizing the " all-round human rights , " which include political rights , economic rights , social rights , and cultural rights as well collective rights and individual rights .  
After the establishment of Sino-Egyptian diplomatic ties , the friendship between the people of the two countries has continuously been consolidated and developed .  On the basis of mutual respect , equality and mutual benefit , the two countries have established sincere and firm relations , and have carried out extensive and fruitful cooperation in the political , economic , cultural and other fields , as well as in international affairs .  
Jiang Zemin stressed that , as two ancient civilizations of the East and West , cultural exchanges between China and Greece are very lively .  Last year the Greek national theater put on the Greek tragedy " Medea " in Beijing , and the same play has been done on the stages of both countries in the form of a Chinese local opera from Hebei directed by Chinese , which was warmly received by the audiences .  
Jiang Zemin indicated : The cooperation between our two countries has also proved satisfactory in the educational , cultural , and scientific and technological fields .  Last year , in particular , China successfully held a watercolor painting exhibition and a Chinese Film Week in Greece ; while the Greek National Opera successful staged the ancient Greek tragedy " ( Maidyr ) " in Beijing , which was warmly received by the Chinese audience .  
The Chinese Government attaches importance to developing long-term , stable friendly relations and cooperation with Greece and is ready to work together with the Greek side in further expanding and deepening cooperation between the two countries in the political , economic , cultural , and various other fields to constantly score new , great successes .  
We must , through vigorous ideological-political work , enable Marxism to firmly control the ideological and cultural fields and make it difficult for all kinds of reactionary , decadent , and backward political viewpoint , ideology , and life style to gain a foothold and spread .  
All quarters of society and educational departments should make concerted efforts to strengthen the comprehensive management of society and cultural development ; should air more selected radio and television programs , show more selected movies , and publish more selected books and journals that are beneficial to the youngters ' healthy growth so as to resolutely resist the poisoning of youngsters by various feudal superstitions and decadent ideas and cultures ;  
The authorized sizes of our military academies are rather irrational .  It is necessary to make great efforts to enhance students ' scientific and cultural foundation as well as their ability in commanding and management .  We should run well the National Defense University , which aims at cultivating senior commanders who participate in the joint training program for officers of the three forces .  
has reiterated the principal position of the masses of the people , as well as our fundamental aim in bringing about a social , economic , and cultural development ; and has further straightened the relationship that the party should act as a " public servant " to the people .  This is a continued adherence and a new development to the party building theories respectively put forward by Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping .  
Leading cadres at all levels must arm themselves fully with Mao Zedong Thought , Deng Xiaoping Theory , and Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important exposition ; willingly enhance their sense of historical responsibility and urgency ; broaden their horizons ; work hard and keep forging ahead ; foster a scientific spirit ; master scientific methods ; learn knowledge about science ; and persist in working hard unremittingly on the basis of what has been achieved so far .  They must make efforts to further improve their ideological and cultural quality ;  
Piracy has seriously disturbed the economic and cultural operational orders in the country and worsened the environment for national cultural industries ' survival , thus causing a massive drain on state revenues and causing cultural business units ' failure to gain an advantageous position in competition amid world economic integration by making it difficult for them to achieve effective accumulation and rapidly expand their industrial scale .  
At present , our military 's political and ideological work is facing many new problems like how to correctly understand and appropriately handle the relationship of honoring modern educational laws versus bringing to full play our military 's political advantages , teaching scientific and cultural knowledge versus cultivating military people 's ideological and political qualities and stimulating an academic and research atmosphere versus maintaining high ideological unity .  
To keep to the orientation of the progress of advanced culture , it is necessary to adapt ourselves to the requirements of reform , opening up , and the drive for socialist modernization , to concentrate on improving the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the people across the country , and to unite and mobilize the people of all nationalities throughout the country to build our country into a prosperous , powerful , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist state .  
Since our army is an important force for building the socialist spiritual civilization and an advanced group composed of outstanding young people from all walks of life , it must conscientiously uphold the requirement for the advanced quality in ideological , moral , and cultural construction .  
As in-depth changes in the military fields in the world are caused by the development of modern science and technology , especially high technology , the scientific and technological content of army building and modern warfare has been increased to an unprecedentedly high level .  This has put ever higher demands on the scientific and cultural qualities of our officers and men .  
The party and government have attached great importance to the harm of piracy in society , and General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji have given important directives on " eliminating pornography " and " cracking down on illegal publications . "  Therefore , we must fully understand the importance of striking at copyright piracy from the high plain of national political , economic , and cultural aspects .  
Leading cadres must do a good job in arming themselves with scientific theories and the knowledge of science and technology , keep improving themselves ideologically and theoretically , and increase their ability to lead the effort to strengthen the armed forces through science and technology and to direct modern warfare in order to keep pace with the times and to adapt themselves to social , economic , and cultural development , to the renewal of weapons and equipment , and to the change of modern warfare .  
Over the past few years , the North and the South have conducted nongovernmental economic and trade cooperation and cultural exchanges with each other which have grown more dynamic with each passing day .  Now that they have begun to taste the sweet fruit of such benefits , the two sides have deemed it both a common need and a pressing task for the prosperity of the national economy to expand cooperation and exchanges with each other .  
and so on .  In their joint communique , the two sides have pledged to develop the national economy in a balanced way by virtue of economic cooperation and step up bilateral cooperation and exchanges in social , cultural , sports , public health , environmental , and some other areas .  
scientific , technological , and cultural quality ; and physical and mental quality .  All these also reflected an important trend in the implementation of the conference spirit by all units : The units closely integrated theory with practice , and always focused on major issues such as direction and strategy , so as to earnestly strengthen ideological and political work , and actively promote military modernization .  
Even the leading cadres with workers ' or farmers ' backgrounds had raised their ideological and theoretical proficiency and knowledge and cultural qualities up to a considerable level through their diligent learning .  
Under the conditions of promoting reform and opening up and being in the ruling position , our party must constantly resist all kinds of corrosive influence and culture .  Therefore , to the broad masses of party members and cadres , it is particularly important to strengthen the building of spiritual civilization and continuously raise their ideological , moral , scientific and cultural qualities .  
We must persist in " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to each " and firmly promote the building of spiritual civilization while grasping the building of material civilization .  We should use Marxism to firmly occupy the ideological and cultural front , vigorously strengthen education on developing a fine party style and building a clean and honest government , and construct an ideological and moral defensive line to repel the corrupting influence and guard against degeneration .  
Faced with the new situation where science and technology are developing rapidly and high technology is being applied extensively in the military field , our army should train a large number of new-type military personnel who are militarily and politically competent and who have acquired good command of modern scientific and cultural knowledge .  This is the key for our army to gain the initiative in future military struggles and shoulder the historical missions entrusted by the party and the people .  
By 2010 , military specialized technical cadres competent for both military and civilian services should basically be trained mainly by regular schools of higher learning , and a proper number of graduates from regular schools of higher learning should be selected to fill command posts , so that the knowledge structure and scientific and cultural levels of military cadres can be improved fundamentally and a military personnel training system compatible with China 's national conditions and our army 's characteristics can take shape .  
In the network and information age , Western political ideology tends to infiltrate us via various channels .  In this connection , the army must persist in a correct direction in the ideological and political education work and must concentrate efforts on raising the ideological , ethical , scientific , and cultural quality of officers and men .  
In the course of utilizing advanced scientific methods to conduct political education , there is a need to strive to tap into the nation 's outstanding cultural tradition and education resources , to constantly stimulate officers ' and men 's sense of identity with national culture , to enhance immunity against the infiltration of Western culture , and to raise the level and quality of entertainment appreciation among officers and men .  
Chairman Jiang emphatically pointed out with a farsightedness : " To earnestly lay a solid scientific and cultural foundation among vast numbers of cadres of our army and raise their knowledge to a higher level is of tremendous significance to enhancing the entire army 's study and understanding of modern science and technology and particularly high-tech knowledge , to promoting the development and use of high-tech weaponry and equipment , and to creating new tactics . "  
A constant flow of vast numbers of high-quality personnel with modern science and general knowledge into the army will further optimize the knowledge structure and greatly raise the scientific and cultural level of military cadre ranks , and will provide a strong knowledge , science and technology backing for army building .  
Local party committees are responsible to the central leading body and shoulder the responsibility for comprehensively leading local political , economic , cultural , and social development .  
At the beginning of the 20th century , as a result of the new cultural movement and the Russian October Revolution , a group of patriotic and progressive intellectuals accepted Marxist theory which represented advanced culture and a forward direction .  They penetrated the industrial working masses that represented the advanced productive force , propagated revolutionary theory , and combined the two .  The result was the birth of the Chinese Communist Party .  
In the present information age , there are much more frequent ideological and information exchanges among the people .  This is particularly true in the current situation when the country is further opening up its doors to the outside world .  The influx and convergence of different spiritual and cultural products and different ideas and information through different channels have not only enlivened people 's minds and enriched the cultural market but have set higher demands on ideological and cultural development and on ideological and political work .  
Since the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy , many developments have taken place in their spiritual and cultural life and the masses have proposed new demands for spiritual and cultural life .  This requires that we profoundly study the characteristics of the times , have a firm grip on the times , and continuously probe for new forms , methods , means , and mechanisms .  And this is the key to making ideological and political work more purposeful and more inspiring .  
advance toward the target of turning ourselves into well-disciplined young people who have a lofty ideal , a sound moral integrity , and a profound cultural knowledge ; come together to form a mighty contingent of young talents ; and compose a more magnificent song of youth in the new century .  
All ideological and cultural battlefields , all departments of publicity , culture and education , and all spiritual and cultural products at levels ranging from high to low , should facilitate the spread of advanced culture , publicize scientific theories and mold beautiful souls .  
The surging trend of new technological revolution and the knowledge economy in the world will not only provide a more advanced scientific and technological foundation for the development of socialism , but will also bring about a hidden risk of further widening the gap between the socialist countries with comparatively backward economic and cultural conditions and the developed capitalists countries .  
Deng Xiaoping Theory provides the initial answer to a series of basic questions about how to develop socialism in such a country with comparatively backward economic and cultural conditions as China around the primary theoretic subject of " what is socialism and how to development socialism " .  
Raising the scientific and cultural level of all the people is a huge systematic undertaking , one which requires painstaking planning and organization , and one which can not be left unemphasized , nor worse yet bogged down with the usual sighs of emotion .  
Okinawa is a Japanese prefecture in southern Kyushu and comprises Okinawa , Miyako , Yaeyama and other islands .  The main Okinawa Island is 1,185 sq km at the center of the Ryukyu archipelago .  Northern hilly areas account for two-thirds of the entire island .  Naha , the capital at the south of Okinawa Island , is Okinawa Prefecture 's political and cultural center .  
Leading organs should regard it as their own duty to remove worries and resolve problems for the basic level , work out effective and operable measures , favor the basic level in their policy orientation , extend more timely support to the basic level when needed and refrain from gilding the lily for administrative organs at higher levels , constantly improve the conditions of material and cultural lives in basic-level units , and devote great efforts to creating an environment which can hold people 's hearts .  
Each region must pay thorough attention to developing spiritual and cultural products and healthy entertainment activities that have the ability to imperceptibly influence people 's ideological views and moral sentiments so as to allow the masses to achieve enlightenment and mold their sentiments in a relaxed and happy atmosphere .  
Many localities give prominence to special characteristics , conduct propaganda to suit local needs , and expand inputs , and have formed certain principal fronts for ideological and political work , including a public opinion front , a training front , and a cultural entertainment front .  
The party 's central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core not only consistently upholds Deng Xiaoping Theory and holds high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , but has also enriched and developed Deng Xiaoping Theory in combination with the new conditions and new experience in the economic , political , scientific and technological , educational , cultural , ethnical policy , military , diplomatic , united front , and party building fields , and added new contents to scientific system of Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
We must ensure first that they are qualified in the political sense , and second in a scientific and cultural sense , in professional skills and capacities and also in physical and psychological health .  We must further ensure that these experts have acquired comprehensive knowledge in various fields , overall coordination abilities , an innovative spirit as well as innovative capacities .  
Moreover , under the situation that relevant laws , regulations , and policies are not very perfect , opening China 's education markets will give rise to contradictions and problems in terms of education sovereignty , direction of running schools , education concepts , national cultural traditions , and management , and vehemently impact the relatively weak domestic educational industry , such as the production of educational instrument , studying appliances , books , software , toys , and so on .  
The progress of the socialist materialist civilization and spiritual civilization has been constantly cleansing the outdated ideas and concepts and the advanced ideological and cultural mentalities like independent mentality , innovative mentality , competitive mentality , open-up mentality , and so on as well as those civilized and progressive social concepts like efficiency concept , effectiveness concepts , and so on which can promote the development of social productive forces have gradually gone deeply into the hearts of the people .  
Relying on the correct understandings which are formed in practice , we can make ideological and theoretical judgment through making objective and cool-headed comparisons under richer and as a matter of course more complicated cultural and theoretical background .  This is an indication of the psychological progress of a nation .  
Along with the development of the social , political , economic , and cultural life , the independent and optional space for people 's ideological activities will become more extensive .  
His subjective dynamic role is subject to the restriction of his own scientific and cultural level as well as scientific and technological content . 
The people are relieved to see that with the convocation of the UN millennium summit and the " Chinese Cultural Exhibition in the United States " , as well as the large-scale cultural exchange activities which are being held in the United States nationwide like a raging fire , the main US media , including the " New York Times " and the " Washington Post " , have " broken historical records " in frequently reporting on China 's relevant situations .  
We revamped our concepts and emancipated our minds , guiding all areas to actively and boldly develop civil air defense reform practice .  We broke with the closed state , throwing open the doors , and sharply developing and utilizing early-stage projects , with projects integrating peacetime with wartime , such as underground markets , parking garages , production shops , and cultural entertainment places , springing up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain .  
The geographical locations separated by a mere strip of water , close cultural backgrounds , and longstanding contacts and exchange of visits of personnel have provided exceptionally favorable conditions for the development of bilateral economic and trade cooperation .  
Since the historic meeting between the leaders of the DPRK and ROK , Kim Chong-il and Kim Tae-chung , held in mid-June in which the " North-South Joint Declaration " was signed , both sides have developed a series of exchanges and cooperation in political , economic , cultural , and other fields , with gratifying progress made .  
They have waged an unremitting struggle against pornography and illegal activities and rectified the cultural market in a planned and organized manner .  They have wiped out a number of gambling houses and spots where drugs and pornographic materials were being sold , and purified the cultural market .  
With the growing high-tech content in modern armaments , there are increasingly high requirements on our armed forces ' officers and soldiers in connection with scientific and cultural knowledge and military technological qualities .  
At the current ASEM , Premier Zhu Rongji once again gave an important speech , also through extensive contacts and exchanges with Asian and European leaders , he enunciated China 's standpoints and opinions on Asian-European exchange and cooperation in the political , economic , trade , cultural , scientific , and technological fields , thus forcefully promoting the further expansion of consensus between Asia and Europe and the establishment of the cooperative partnership in the new century .  
unswervingly implemented the party 's policy concerning nationalities and religion and the regional national autonomy system ; increasingly consolidated and developed the new-type socialist national relationship based on equality , unity , and mutual help ; and made the dream come true in real terms for the people of all nationalities to exercise their rights according to the law in the political , economic , cultural , and social life .  
We are , and will remain for a long time , in the primary stage of socialism , and the most prominent characteristic of this stage is the slow development of our productive forces .  The contradiction between the masses ' ever growing material and cultural needs and the backward social output will always be our main social contradiction .  
promoting the economic , educational , scientific , and cultural cooperation and interchange between Macao and the inland , connecting people from all circles of Macao , improving the association between Macao and the inland , reflecting the opinions that Macao residents have to the inland , managing the related Taiwan affairs , undertaking other matters that the central government hands over . 
However , because his understanding of the laws of socialist construction was insufficient , because of theoretical errors , because of incorrect response to dramatic changes in the international situation , he also committed subjectivist errors , which resulted in the failure of the " great leap forward " and the people 's communes , and , particularly , this finally led to the great political chaos of the " cultural revolution " that was immensely harmful to the cause of socialism in China .  
This put forward a new topic : on the one hand we need to staunchly adhere to the fundamental principles of socialism put forth by Marx and Engels , on the other hand we need to adopt a scientific attitude to Marx and Engels ' tentative ideas of socialism and , proceeding from the reality of relative economic and cultural backwardness map out a course and policy for socialist construction .  
Since the realization of socialism mostly started based on a relatively low level of economic development , in order to satisfy the ever-growing material and cultural needs of the people , we must rapidly transform the backward condition of social productive forces : in a situation where the two systems , socialist and capitalist , coexist , we also need to energetically develop productive forces to give expression to socialism 's superiority .  
With the curtain of the 21st century slowly opening , the incoming tide of economic globalization is surging into every corner of the world .  Economic globalization is sure to have widespread and profound effects on tomorrow 's world , including the economic , social , cultural , and military spheres .  
Under the impetus of economic globalization , humanity has expanded its interaction , its contacts , and its understanding , and increased friendship , cooperation , and support .  Various converging and intermingling cultural torrents have smashed the " iron curtain " between countries with different social systems and ideologies , marking a new era in the ways countries compete and test their strength against one another .  
Ways , means , and methods which are receiving widespread application are continuing and improving classroom education , " second classrooms , " on-line political work , cultural improvement , psychological guidance , standardizing laws and discipline , self-education , benefits driving , improving the level of education in science , and leaders taking the lead and setting the example .  
During his visit Chairman Li Peng specially arranged to see the relatives of Dr . Kotnis , who sacrificed his precious life for the cause of the Chinese people 's liberation , and held extensive contacts and chats with responsible persons of Indian friendship bodies and figures in business , science and technology , and cultural circles , in which he conveyed to the Indian people the friendly feelings of the Chinese people and their sincere aspirations for developing bilateral ties .  
One of the important issues in the practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is to correctly deal with the influence of the international environment and the international political struggle on people 's thoughts in the course of persistently carrying out reforms , opening up , and increasing economic and cultural exchanges with the outside world , while actively absorbing and learning from all the good results achieved by human society as a whole in civilization development , and effectively resist the corrosive influence of the decadent ideologies and cultures from the West .  
The process of economic globalization is speeding up and has been breaking up the barriers that hinder the movement of capital , technology , information , and labor force across national boundaries .  This process is also turning the world economy into an integrated entity , making the international division of work and international cooperation closer , providing conditions for various nations to more extensively participate in international competition , and also bringing about rare opportunities for the economic and cultural developments in developing countries .  
The openness of society will inevitably bring about ideological and cultural diversification .  While people are receiving positive and progressive ideas and conceptions , they are also exposed to the influence of backward and decadent things .  The complex situation in the realm of ideology and culture in society , where the good and the bad exist side by side , brings about a multi-tiered and diversified feature in people 's mental pursuits and values .  
Such infiltration is not limited to the ideological and cultural fields , but has also be extended to the economic , political , military , scientific , and technological fields .  In their exchanges with us , they also brought ideological things along with them .  
Theory , journalism , publications , literature , and arts are all important ideological and public opinion positions .  We should continuously create and produce good cultural products being favorable to social progress and being beneficial to people 's physical and mental health .  We should boost healthy public conduct in society and develop a progressive spirit of our times , advocate a healthy and civilized lifestyle , resist all reactionary , decadent , and backward ideological and cultural dregs .  
At present , it is particularly necessary to effectively utilize and manage the internet , as it has become the fourth largest mass media next to newspapers , radio , and television .  We should strive to turn our advantageous journalistic resources , cultural resources , and information technology resources into our superiority in online propaganda so that the online position and the mass media in our country will all be occupied with progressive ideology and culture .  
Researchers Pan Houren and Zhou Jiahua held that today , when material living standards are improving all the time , it is extremely important to build a rich and excellent cultural life ; the current measures such as small district sports and public welfare facilities which are now being built in a big way , and the rural cultural activities launched by organizing peasants who have become rich are extremely beneficial .  
As students of military academies , we shoulder the historic mission of relying on science and technology to build a strong army and accelerate the modernization of our army 's armament and equipment .  We must more consciously strengthen our cultivation of Marxist theories and scientific spirit , arm ourselves with modern scientific knowledge , and exert to spread the fruits of socialist spiritual and cultural progress .  We must never allow fallacies of " Falungong " to contaminate our sacred school campuses .  
However , we should clearly understand that we are still in the early stages of a socialist society .  We are still facing a basic national climate characterized by vast space , a large population , a weak economic base and slow economic and cultural development .  We are still facing a basic national climate characterized by a dominating social contradiction expressed as a gap between social productivity and the increasing material and cultural demands of the populace , as well as a huge economic , scientific and technological gap with developed countries .  
Since hostile forces and saboteurs at home and abroad seize every opportunity and try by hook or by crook to steal China 's political , military , economic , cultural , and educational intelligence , cases of leakage of secrets are frequent and startling , posing a serious threat to the information security of the party , the state , and the military .  
The compatriots on both sides of the strait come from the same cultural background ; and the Chinese phonetic alphabet system currently used in the mainland motherland has been practiced and constantly improved for several decades , and has already been widely recognized and accepted in the world .  In fact , relevant authorities in Taiwan had earlier planned to adopt this system .  
During the 20th century which has just passed , scientific and technological progress brought about unprecedented development to the civilization of mankind .  Today , the Chinese nation is faced with a historical opportunity of comprehensive rejuvenation ; and the realization of a peaceful reunification across the strait is an inexorable demand of cross-strait economic , social , and cultural development .  We hope that the leaders of the Taiwan authorities can face up to the reality ; comply with the historical trend of the time ;  
In the document of the 15th national party congress , the principal contradiction in the socialist society are summarized as the " contradiction between the people 's increasing material and cultural demands and the backward social production . "  
The " Covenant " actually confirms such basic human rights as the right of survival and the right of development .  It points out : Only after the creation of the economic , social , and cultural rights that can be enjoyed by all people , as the creation of the same conditions for civil and political rights available to all people , will the ideal freedom which frees mankind from terror and shortage be realized .  
Only when development is accelerated can the living standards of the people of all nationalities in our region be improved and the increasingly growing needs of material and cultural life be met , and only when development is accelerated can the new-type socialist nationality relationship characterized by equality , unity , and mutual help be consolidated and developed and national solidarity be consolidated and enhanced .  
To always represent the way forward for advanced culture is to persist in developing what is useful and discarding what is not , correctly handle the relationship between inheriting the national traditional culture and blazing new trails , and strengthen cultural exchanges between fraternal nationalities so as to absorb all fruits of civilization of the human society .  
Therefore , we must , through constant efforts , further liberalize thinking , renew ideas , expand efforts to open up to the outside , seize opportunities , and accelerate development so as to bring more visible and tangible benefits to the Tibetan people and increasingly improve the material and cultural standard of living for the people .  
We should assign great importance to improving the material and cultural lives of our officers and men , and work hard to create a sound environment which can keep people 's hearts , with a view to unifying , heightening , and inspiring the morale of our troops .  
It firmly takes the steady improvement of the living standards , both material and cultural , of the urban and rural populations as the essential demand of socialism , the fundamental goal of economic development , and the meeting point of the effort to properly handle the relations among reform , development , and stability .  It gives priority to resolving the problems that are of widespread concern to the ordinary people ;  
To implement the Tenth Five-Year Plan , we must work hard to improve the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the entire population in the forward direction of an advanced culture , adhere to the idea of " tackling with both hands , both hands hard , " combine the rule of law with the rule of morality , and vigorously push ahead with the building of a socialist spiritual civilization . 
Chi Haotian said : Developing the western region and accelerating the development of the central and western regions is the major strategic policy of the party Central Committee and President Jiang Zemin after taking stock of the situation and making overall planning geared toward the new century .  It is of vital economic , political , social , and cultural significance .  
Since its establishment , the foundation has given full play to its own characteristics and advantages , and has , with the assistance of friendly organizations and enthusiastic people at home and abroad , dedicated itself to developing the cultural , educational , science , technology and welfare undertakings for children and promoting the healthy mental and physical development of children ;  
Political restructuring and the development of the socialist democracy and political system must be conducive to maintaining and giving play to the features and advantages of our political system , and conducive to maintaining the unity of the country , ethnic unity and social stability .  In addition , the historical conditions and the level of economic , cultural and educational development must also be taken into full consideration .  
The vast number of theoretical workers should take pains to undertake the lofty mission of theoretical innovation which has been entrusted to them by the age , persistently emancipate their minds , make courageous exploration , observe and take hold of the trends of economic , political , scientific and technological , and cultural development in the contemporary world as well as the great changes in China today , and strive to make new progress and new contributions in theoretical innovation .  
In short , our theoretical work must be closely combined with the realities , take the major practical issues in reform , opening up , and modernization as the main direction of attack in our study , positively probe into the law governing economic , political , and cultural development in building socialism with Chinese characteristics , serve the party and government in making scientific policy decisions , and serve the entire party and nation in working for the interest of the whole .  
We must uphold the guideline of grasping things with both hands , with both hands firm , combine ruling the country according to law with ruling the country with ethics , follow the orientation for progress of advanced culture , and make efforts to enhance the ideological and moral standard and scientific and cultural qualities of the whole nation .  
President Jiang Zemin pointed out not long ago : After China participates in the " International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , " China will subject itself to the United Nations ' supervision , will conscientiously fulfill the state obligations specified by the " Covenant , " will effectively promote the realization of the economic , social and cultural rights for the Chinese citizens by legislative , administrative , and other means , and will thus make contributions to the human rights cause in the world .  
However , at the initial stage of socialism , with the distinct characteristics of dual economic structures for the villages and the cities , and with deeply-settled historical and cultural traditions involving small-scale peasant economies in the villages , the cultural and technology quality of the peasants has remained low and many peasants do not understand or are not accustomed to the market economy .  
Professor Yu frankly admitted that as a developing country with a population of 1.2-billion , China 's per capita natural resources are comparatively scant , its current economic and cultural development is imbalanced , its legal system is not complete , and , in the process of law enforcement , some laws are not strictly abided by and some laws are not strictly enforced - - all these contribute to the non-perfect human rights situation in China .  
He said that , in line with the international trend and existing domestic precedent , using high-tech principles to mix electronic sound with natural sound could unite the opera house and concert hall into one .  That would mean building only an opera house and a Beijing Opera playhouse , or one cultural square with two structures , which would save much investment .  
Zhang Xiaoling , a professor at the Central Party School who has been devoted to the specialized study of " women and human rights , " further expounded that according to the International Human Rights Charter , human rights can be classified into two categories - - civil and political rights and economic , social , and cultural rights .  
Take its handling of the Tibet question for example , after taking office in 1993 , former US President Bill Clinton again highlighted the values of human rights by following in Jimmy Carter 's footsteps .  Clinton declared : If China refuses to make improvement on human rights , the United States will not grant MFN status to China . Clinton also listed protecting Tibet 's unique religious or cultural heritage in his wish list on human rights and even arranged an unscheduled meeting between himself and Dalai in the White House .  
Chi Haotian said : Both China and Gabon are developing countries .  The two countries ' cooperation in the political , economic , military , and cultural areas has been remarkable ; and the two countries share common views on a wide range of important international issues .  
Russia has also merged some of its higher command schools with some of its engineering technology schools and increased courses on engineering technology for its postgraduate students studying in the command specialty by a large margin with an eye on training qualified high-level military personnel who are well-versed in scientific and cultural knowledge and proficient in various military specialties .  
Over the past 100 years , the world underwent untold tribulations caused bywars , diseases , hunger , crises , and disasters ; but more importantly , the peopleof various countries carried out momentous social and natural struggles on amagnificent scale , and thus made unprecedented progress in the political , economic , ideological , cultural , scientific , technological , education , military , and medical aspects .  
In light of China 's national conditions and according to the people 's wishes , the Chinese government aims to build a democratic and modernized country with a high level of civilization under the rule of law , and actively learn from the beneficial experiences and cultural achievements of other countries .  While maintaining social stability , it also aims to expedite development , strengthen the democratic legal system , promote spiritual civilization , and continuously push forward the development of the human rights cause .  
At present , according to the arrangements of the State Council , actions should be focused on cracking down on the activities of making and selling counterfeit commodities , regularizing the construction market , punishing criminal offenders involved in tax evasion and tax frauds , breaking departmental monopoly and local blockade , straightening out the market for cultural products , thus laying a good foundation for the fundamental improvement of the order of the market economy in the period of the Tenth Five-Year Plan .  
Jiang Zemin said he was pleased to see that in the 13 years since China and Uruguay established diplomatic relations , the two countries have increasingly enhanced friendly cooperation in political , economic and trade , and cultural fields , and the two peoples have continued to deepen their mutual understanding and friendship .  
Different countries differ not only in their geographical location but also in their level of economic development and historical and cultural traditions .  Thus , they are bound to have different political , economic and social systems , and it is unrealistic to achieve unification using one and the same model .  
In particular , since the two countries established diplomatic relations , the two sides have maintained frequent high-level exchanges , enhanced economic and trade cooperation , markedly increased contacts in scientific and cultural fields , and maintained sound cooperation in international affairs . "  
At present , the mutual stirring of various cultural and ideological trends on a worldwide scale , the mingling of progressive and backward concepts , the increasing diversification of people 's orientations of value , moral concepts , and cultural choices and , in particular , the infiltration and offensives of the Western hostile forces against us , such as " Westernization " and " disintegration , " have made the contradiction and struggle in the ideological field more and more acute and complicated .  
It is necessary , in line with the requirement of maintaining the advanced nature , to vigorously step up the building of our ranks , constantly improve the ideological and political quality , the scientific and cultural level , and the professional skills of party-member cadres , and train and bring up a contingent of high-quality party-member cadres .  
The " three advantages " criterion constitutes the standard for us to judge all our work in carrying out China 's reform and opening-up program and developing the socialist modernization drive .  In this way , the thinking on " three represents " helps set the goals for party building in the new period , and expand the historical mission of the Communist Party of China in the new period .  It also provides a theoretical guidance to the ruling party for further strengthening its cultural , social , and economic foundations .  
It is precisely at this crucial moment that Comrade Jiang Zemin made the remark that the Communist Party of China must represent the progressive course of China 's advanced culture .  He has enriched the political connotation conducive to raising the people 's living standards , and turned the reconstruction of the mode of cultural life and the expansion of advanced culture into the process of China 's modernization drive .  As a result , he has provided China with more attractive cultural resources .  
He noted that for many years China and France have engaged in effective cooperation in economic , scientific , technological , cultural , and other areas .  He expressed the hope that the two countries and the people of China and France would continue to cooperate in cultural , educational , scientific , and technological fields and jointly contribute to the building of a beautiful future in the new century .  
The entire process of the incident was connected to historical , legal , cultural , language , and religious issues , and the only thing that was conspicuously absent was its military aspect .  US Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld did not even appear in public during the development of the incident .  It was not until 13 April that he held a news conference at which he complained that it was only the Chinese Communist plane 's provocative act that was the underlying cause of the collision .  
Yunnan Province has rich tourism resources as it has beautiful natural scenes and pleasant weather .  There are many scenic spots and a rich variety of cultural features and customs of minority ethnic groups .  All this is huge economic potential to be tapped .  
China attaches great importance to developing friendly cooperative relations with Yugoslavia in the political , economic , cultural and educational areas .  China maintains that healthy development of Sino-Yugoslav relations is in the fundamental interests of the two countries .  
When new China was established , for historical reasons the mother mainland laid particular stress on putting politics in command and emphasized ideology ; it violated the laws of economic development , and in particular this went to extremes during the " 10-year cultural revolution , " causing great damage to the social productive forces and bringing the national economy to the brink of bankruptcy . 
set things right in matters ranging from theory to practice ; carried out and acted in the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee ; lost no time in shifting the focus of party work to economic construction ; restored and developed industrial , agricultural , scientific , cultural , and educational undertakings that had been disrupted by the " Great Cultural Revolution " ; revived and carried forward the fine traditions of the party ; and consolidated and developed political stability and unity in Jilin Province .  
We are happy to see that since the normalization of the two countries ' relations , high-level leaders of the two parties and two countries have conducted frequent mutual visits , and both sides ' exchanges and cooperation have expanded and developed in a more in-depth manner in the political , economic , military , scientific , technological , and cultural fields .  
Li Lanqing said : One of the main purposes of my current visit to France is , while pushing forward political and economic cooperation between China and France , to boost development of cultural exchange and cooperation between the two countries - - this is extremely important and indispensable to promoting the comprehensive partnership between our two countries .  
Top level leaders have frequently exchanged visits , while contacts and cooperation are increasingly expanded and deepened in the political , economic , military , scientific , technological , and cultural fields .  
The contacts of officials at high level are frequent , the exchange and cooperation in the political , economic and trade , cultural , public health , science and technology , and other spheres are expanding with each passing day , and the mutual support and coordination in the international affairs are unceasingly intensified .  
2 .  Both sides point out that the two countries have , through joint efforts , established a legal basis of treaties and organizations for mutually beneficial cooperation in the political , economic and trade , science and technological , and cultural fields .  
In recent years , China and Austria increasingly enhanced their exchanges and cooperation in the political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , cultural , and environmental protection fields and also increased friendly exchanges at the provincial and city level .  
After the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1958 , friendly and cooperative relations continued to develop , and bilateral cooperation achieved gratifying results in the political , economic , cultural , and public health fields .  
the spirit of pressing forward in the face of difficulties indomitably and relentlessly , the spirit of working hard and seeking solid results , and the spirit of being indifferent to fame and fortune and making selfless contributions ; continuously enhance their moral and ideological quality and their scientific , cultural , and technological quality ; and strive to become workers with a lofty ideal , moral integrity , good education , and a sense of discipline .  
Featured columns on the website , such as " wonderful natural landscapes , " " cultural treasures , " " urban sights , " and " inside Taiwan , " depict famous mountains and rivers and cultural relics and ancient ruins on both sides of the strait , describe the customs and traditions of various ethnic groups , display the long history and splendid culture of China , and provide first-hand accounts of the enormous changes and developments in China today .  
The standard attained by a country 's universities reflects from one aspect the level of scientific , technological , and cultural development attained by the whole country , and is also a major expression of the country 's all-round national strength .  
You should make efforts to ensure that you have fine ideological and political qualities and also scientific and cultural ability that can withstand severe tests ; you should have both strong physique and sound minds .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : The level attained by the universities of a country actually reflects the level of scientific , technological , and cultural development attained by the whole country , and this is also a major embodiment of this country 's comprehensive national strength .  The building of first-class universities attaining the world 's advanced level in our country will require great support from the party , the government , and all social circles ;  
Thanks to the personal attention and promotion of the heads of state of the two countries , China and Russia have made a big headway and scored notable achievements in mutually beneficial cooperation in the political , economic , scientific and technological , cultural , and educational fields .  
Of more than 10 strategic principles , the US authorities determined on measures for subverting China in various fields of social life including the political , economic , diplomatic , military , trade , cultural , and educational fields .  
In the 10 years starting in 1990 and continuing through the next 10 years , in 20 years of strategic operations , the US Government has already made and will continue to make comprehensive use of the strategy of " win without fighting " and " win through fighting " in a planned , premeditated , and measured way to speed up political , economic , and cultural evolution in China , and achieve at an early date its strategic goals of uprooting communist ideology , weakening Chinese national consciousness , and splitting the PRC setup .  
The basic question of the trade union work is an issue of safeguarding rights .  All work of the trade union should be carried out in close connection with this most fundamental issue , that is , safeguarding the economic interests and democratic rights of workers and staff members and fulfilling their spiritual and cultural needs .  
It is present in political , economic , military , scientific and technological , and cultural education ; its core values are patriotism , revolutionary heroism , and the spirit of dedication ; and its ultimate objectives are to boost all citizens ' will , skills , and physical capabilities in loving , developing , and defending their motherland , so that they can firmly adopt the idea of " being prepared for danger in times of peace " and " joining hands to resist foreign aggression . "  
Judging from the surface , cross-strait relations remain calm and stable ; moreover , thanks to the hard efforts of the public as well as the industrial and commercial circles on the island who have been imposing pressure on the authorities , many man-made restrictions in Taiwan are forced to be relaxed , thus giving rise to an unprecedented upsurge of economic , trade , and cultural exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits .  
However , along with the progress of the times and the development of the situation , with the addition that there exist no fundamental interest conflicts between the Chinese on both sides of the strait , such " complexes " and " knots in the heart " between the Chinese across the strait can all be undone gradually in a benign interaction .  Has this not clearly proved by the increasingly close economic , trade , and cultural ties between the Chinese across the strait over the past more than a decade ?  
Over the last half a century , mutually beneficial cooperation between our two countries have developed in an all-round way in the political , economic , trade , cultural , and scientific and technological fields .  The two governments and peoples have always understood , trusted , and supported each other .  
According to the regulations of the Constitution and the regional national autonomy laws , after the establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region , Tibet enjoys autonomy in many aspects like legislation , use of its national languages , personnel management , management and development of natural resources , and so on .  Therefore , the cultural traditions , customs and habits , languages , and so on of the people of all nationalities in Tibet have been fully respected and the political , economic , social and all other rights have been reliably safeguarded .  
He does not recognize the one China principle , and negates the 1992 ARATS-Strait Exchange Foundation consensus on each side of the strait interpreting in oral form its " adherence to the one China principle " ; he has continued to practice the policy of " no haste , be patient , " blocked direct cross-strait " three links , " pushed " Taiwan cultural independence , " stepped up expansion of armaments and buying arms from abroad , and carried out activities to split the motherland in the international arena .  
After Tibet 's peaceful liberation , the central government and the Tibet Autonomous Regional Government began to list famous religious activity sites including the Johkang , Thaxi Lhunbo , Drepung , Sagya , and Sera Monasteries as key cultural heritages under national or autonomous regional protection .  
While intensifying the aversion of most countries in the world to varying degrees , the so-called " unilateralism , " which is criticized by many countries , has also prompted many people of insight in the world to begin pondering numerous profound and lasting historical philosophic , political , and cultural issues , such as that in the new century , how different countries , different systems , and different cultures should make use of each other 's strong points for reference and respect each other ;  
Here I would like to make a special explanation of one thing , that is , the " multipolarization , " which the Chinese people have often referred to , is based on a new understanding of the international relations in the new period or based on the philosophic and cultural theory that " the world is pluralistic and diversified in nature " rather than developing confrontation against a certain superpower or letting just a few big powers decide world affairs .  
Over the past five years , ASEM has held dialogues on a wide range of issues and carried out cooperation in various forms ; the Asian and the European leaders have held beneficial discussions on a series of major international and regional issues ; and the two sides have carried out exchanges and cooperated with each other in economic , trade , banking , scientific , technological , cultural , environmental , and other fields , and this has pushed forward and deepened the development of Asian-European relations . 
In fact , since the start of the ASEM 's cooperation mechanism , member countries have conducted extensive cooperation and exchanges in many areas .  In addition to economic , trade , and financial cooperation , Asia and Europe have launched political dialogues , cultural forums , and scientific and technological cooperation .  They have also sponsored symposiums on international issues , such as economic globalization , cultural diversification , strengthening the role of the United Nations , safeguarding the equilibrium and stability of global strategy , which have become the topics of ASEM .  
Their arduous efforts have brought about a great change in the look of poor areas : Their production means and living conditions have been markedly improved ; their production level raised by a big margin ; and great progress has been made in the scientific and technological , educational , cultural , and public health fields .  
The two countries have seen rapid development in exchanges and cooperation in the political , economic , cultural , educational , and other fields since they established diplomatic relations more than eight years ago .  
Particularly since the Third Central Forum on Work in Tibet , the region has taken the initiative in launching offensive and sought both a permanent cure and a temporary solution to the separatist problem .  The in-depth anti-separatist struggle in the political , ideological , educational , and cultural fields has dealt a crashing blow to all kinds of separatist activities , reversed the passive situation , and retaken the initiative .  As a result , basic stability of Tibet 's social and political situation has been maintained for a fairly long period .  
The key to prevailing in warfare will be people 's level of scientific and cultural knowledge .  Without a solid foundation in science and culture , there will be no excellent art of commanding to speak of .  
The weakness in scientific and cultural knowledge has become a " bottleneck " constraining improvement in cadres ' comprehensive quality .  To break this " bottleneck , " it is now urgent to raise cadres ' knowledge level as soon as possible .  Work hard to achieve a big leaping rise in cadres ' knowledge level shortly through efforts to make cadres have advanced schooling .  
A : China-Venezuela relations have been developing well in recent years .  The two sides have maintained high-level exchanges , made notable achievements in economic and trade cooperation , and gradually extended their cooperation in cultural , educational , scientific and technological fields .  
The two sides have maintained high-level exchanges , made notable achievements in economic and trade cooperation , and gradually extended their cooperation in cultural , educational , scientific and technological fields .  
They have taken advantage of the channels of international economic and cultural exchanges and dissemination to energetically advertise the political concepts of bourgeois democracy , freedom , and human rights , pursue egoistic values , advocate the reactionary views of divesting armed forces of party leadership and depoliticizing them , vilify CPC leadership , and wage an all-out attack against China 's socialist system with the aim of bringing about a credibility crisis or confidence crisis among the people , who will eventually abandon party leadership and the socialist system .  
In response to a reporter 's question , the spokesman said : We have taken note that to implement their separatist line in an accelerated way , the Taiwan authorities have taken many steps to cut off the cultural and spiritual links between Taiwan and the mainland .  The Taiwan leader 's refusal to admit he is a Chinese and recognize the principle of one China and his deliberate attempt to evade the basic fact that the two sides of the strait belong to one country are the most representative of this .  
The municipal party committee explicitly requires : All major affairs in the capital city 's political , economic , cultural , and social life must be submitted to the Political Consultation Conference for deliberation .  In particular , before decisions are made on major projects and policies , before the change of administrative division of districts in the municipality , and before the formulation of local laws and regulations , political consultation must be conducted .  
For example , they were related to such issues as reforming the housing system , reforming tertiary education , developing cultural industry , rebuilding old and dilapidated houses and buildings , and protecting historical cultural relics and legacies .  At the same time , the municipal party committee and government also set up a briefing system and arrange high-level and small-scope heart-to-heart talks .  
Hong Kong serves as a diverse cultural capital , the development of religious sects has its freedom , there is sound social differentiation of " religious sects " developed by the people 's knowledge , and illegal behavior by " religious sects " is already regulated by Hong Kong law .  The day that the government of the SAR , ignorant of religion , enacts the " Anti-Heretical Cult Law " , all legitimate " religious sects " will be affected .  
Wen Jiabao pointed out that the important " three represents " ideology advanced by Comrade Jiang Zemin has answered from a political , economic , and cultural point of view the basic questions of what type of party to build and how to build it .  It has given expression to a distinctly advanced characteristic , a scientifically innovative spirit , a broad , global view , and a staunch purpose for party building .  
Over the past century and half , it has kept advancing continually in practice , developing continually in practice , studying new situations , answering new questions , and continually incorporating , borrowing , and integrating various outstanding intellectual and cultural achievements , thereby enabling Marxism to always maintain its vitality and to continually open new realms .  
Therefore , upholding Marxism 's guidance position will not only not stop it from incorporating and borrowing other outstanding intellectual and cultural achievements , but also enable us to more scientifically distinguish the real from the fake and the correct from the wrong , to incorporate good elements , to reject bad elements , to have a broader field of vision , and to become even broader minded , a situation which will be more conducive to creating and enriching the new culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Li Lanqing fully affirmed the excellent achievements of Shanghai in economic and social development .

In particular , it should attach great importance to , and earnestly speed up , the development of tourism .  Sichuan has rich and colorful tourist resources .  It particular , it has cultural sites of historic interest , world-famous natural heritage , unique and fantastic natural scenery , and unique local ethnic customs and practices .  
It is necessary to pay great attention to the management of scenic spots .  Houses should not be built at random in the vicinity of scenic spots .  Much less should cultural sites of historical interest be damaged or destroyed to build vulgar public places of entertainment .  
He said : To safeguard regional security , the countries of the " Shanghai Five " should take joint actions in dealing blows at religious extremism , international terrorism , organized crime , drug trafficking , and arms smuggling .

Pay attention to intensifying the effort to analyze Western currents of political and cultural thinking , so as to reveal their reactionary nature , to make clear their decadent and harmful character , to enhance the sense of concern and the capacity to resist corruption and change , and to control armed forces ideologically and politically .  
While progressive thinking and advanced ideas are being formed and developed , various decadent ideas and cultural elements have also been taking this opportunity to achieve infiltration , with idealism , pseudo-science , and anti-Marxist currents of political thinking raising their heads and once-eradicated ugly social phenomena appearing to be resurrected ; the corrosive effects and influence on officials ' and soldiers ' minds should not be underestimated .

"  
As the situation of regional development has been changing and non-stop various international forces have been involved in the region , the unique ethnic , cultural conditions and the difficult regional security issues of the Eurasian area have been plaguing each country of the region .

To achieve their evil purpose of splitting the motherland , Taiwan splittist forces headed by Lee Teng-hui [ Li Denghui ] politically carried out , in a flagrant way , splittist activities to create " two China 's " or " one China , one Taiwan " and culturally attempted to cut off the historical and cultural ties between Taiwan and the mainland of the motherland to confuse the Taiwan society 's thinking .  
Especially since the beginning of the 1990 ' s , with the continuous progress of the domestic and international situation and the magnificent cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , the central leadership collective of the party with Jiang Zemin as the core has adhered to the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts , and made new explorations in practice and a new summarization in theory of many major economic , political , cultural , military , and diplomatic issues , thus enriching and developing Deng Xiaoping Theory .

Cultural life of our urban and rural people is rich and colorful .  
independent culture ? to change the cultural identity of the Taiwan compatriots and then their national and state identities , eliminate their sense of belonging to the Chinese nation , undermine the basis of peaceful reunification between the two sides of the strait , and create an ideological and social basis for realizing their separatist plot .

Our party must , in all kinds of work including party theory , line , program , principle and policy , persevere in taking in the fundamental interests of the people as the starting point and purpose , bring into full play people 's enthusiasm , initiative and creativity , and enable the people to constantly obtain tangible economic , political and cultural benefits through continuous social development and progress .  
In keeping with the economic , political and cultural requirements of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , all comrades in the party and all people in the country should strive to achieve the development goals set for the Tenth Five-Year Plan .

It is necessary to inherit and carry forward all good cultures , including the fine cultural tradition of the Chinese nation , the revolutionary cultural tradition formed by the party and the people over a long time , and all advanced civilization achievements created by human society , and strive to develop our national and scientific socialist culture oriented to modernization , to the world , and to the future .  
On the basis of economic development and social progress , it is necessary to increase the income of urban and rural residents , continuously raise the people 's living standards and life quality , and continuously enable the people to gain better and solid economic , political , and cultural benefits .  
We must learn from their love of their jobs and respect for their occupations , consciously standing in the front ranks of the construction of material and cultural / ideological progress , bringing the vanguard model functions into full play in each job with a solemn sense of mission and an intense sense of responsibility , striving to get ahead and making first-rate achievements in the course of reforms , opening up , and modernization .  
Shi Zhongquan , deputy director of the CPC Central Party History Research Center , said : The important concept of " three represents " was put forward to strengthen our party ideologically , to make large numbers of party cadres , especially the leading cadres , keep firmly in mind the nature and purpose of the party , to keep improving the political , ideological , theoretical , scientific , cultural , and other qualities of the party , and to always preserve and carry forward the its advanced nature .

The third liberation was cultural and ideological liberation .  This liberation released the people of Tibet , long-enslaved under the binding ties of a unitary religious and political system and the corruption of feudal serfdom , from the remnants of backward thought .

financial fraud and violations of fiscal and economic discipline are widespread ; there is fraud and deception in tendering for construction projects , and the quality of some projects is inferior ; the cultural markets are chaotic ; and major and serious safety accidents occur from time to time in production operations .  Some new characteristics have recently emerged in illegal activities , such as crimes being committed by syndicates , transregional crimes , crimes committed by collusion between outside and inside , specialized crime , and intellectualized crime .  
In earmarking billions of yuan for the improvement of the urban environment in spite of a relative shortage of overall financial resources , Guangzhou 's fundamental starting point is that , as General Secretary Jiang noted , " the continuous development of advanced productive forces and advanced culture is essentially to meet the growing material and cultural needs of the masses and to continuously realize the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people . "  
Second , we must further reinforce socialist ideological and cultural progress and promote the steady improvement of the ideological , moral , scientific and cultural qualities of our people in order to turn Guangzhou into a city that is truly " suitable for starting one 's business and suitable to live in . "

Second , with regard to the principle of noninterference in internal affairs , the treaty advocates transcending ideology and not interfering in the choice of the other party 's road for political , economic , social , and cultural development adopted in light of its national conditions .

Under the CPC 's leadership , cadres and common people of all ethnic groups in Tibet have abolished feudal serfdom and established political power based on the people 's democracy , and have been exercising regional ethnic autonomy and pressing ahead with the cause of building socialism .  All this has unleashed and expanded Tibet 's social productive forces to an unprecedented level and contributed to the continuing improvement of the Tibetan people 's material and cultural lives .  
Over the 10 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries , relations of bilateral cooperation have developed smoothly .  There have been frequent mutual visits at a high level and the two sides have established a basic framework and principle for cooperation in political , economic , trade , cultural and other fields .

Both sides are continuously expanding and deepening cooperation and exchange in the political , economic and trade , scientific and technological , educational , cultural fields , and maintain the fine tradition of positive consultation and close cooperation in international affairs .  Satisfactory results have been achieved .  
Whether from the historical , cultural , or geographical angles , or from the political and economic reality angle , Taiwan 's future lies with the mother mainland , and its security is determined by the close ties of people on both sides of the strait and by ultimate peaceful reunification .  
Political consultation and coordination have become increasingly enhanced , with closer cooperation in the United Nations and other international institutions .  Economic and trade relations have developed continuously , trade volume has grown for many years running , and cultural and educational exchanges have been increasingly active .

China 's overall national strength has been greatly increased , and the people 's material and cultural life enhanced .  China has also greatly raised its international status .  To uphold the Party 's absolute leadership over the army in accordance with the requirements of the " three represents , " we must even more unswervingly uphold the authority of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core .  
He said , developing good neighborly and friendly relations between the DPRK and Russia is in the fundamental interests of both countries , and there are tremendous potentials for bilateral cooperation in the economic , military , and cultural fields .

Rectifying and standardizing the cultural market order is the inherent demand for putting the important idea of " three represents " into practice and for vigorously developing China 's advanced culture .  Rectifying and standardizing the cultural market order is necessary in order to build and perfect the socialist market economy system and to meet the challenges brought about by China 's accession to the World Trade Organization . Rectifying and standardizing the cultural market order is also necessary in order to purify the social environment and to guarantee that the masses of young people grow up healthily .

We must resolutely wipe out the ugly social phenomena , such as pornography , gambling , and narcotics ; strengthen management of cultural entertainment places and cultural markets ; firmly crack down on illegal and criminal activities using feudal superstition and religion ; enhance people 's sense of the legal system and ethics ;  
At the present stage , the advanced nature of communist party members should naturally find expression in their conscientious study of Deng Xiaoping Theory and Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents , " and find expression in their conscious efforts to plunge themselves into socialist economic , political , and cultural buildings with Chinese characteristics .  
Non-public-run economic organizations , social bodies , and civilian-run non-enterprise units are emerging in large numbers , and are producing a major influence on the economic , cultural , and social development of our country .  To guide these economic and social bodies to attain a healthy development , we need to have correct principles and policies as well as a perfect legal system , and we also need to strengthen the party 's political leadership .  
4 .  The two sides agreed that the two countries ' cooperation in the political , economic , cultural , educational , public health , and scientific and technological fields had brought tangible benefits to both countries and their people .

We should build an advanced culture to meet the people 's growing needs in cultural life and provide the productive forces development with a spiritual motive force as well as intellectual support .  
Our party has devoted herself to the development of both advanced social productive forces and an advanced culture with a view to meeting the people 's and masses ' growing material and cultural needs and realizing or safeguarding the fundamental interests of the largest majority of the people .  
In his May 20 speech , he indicated the intention to " continually strengthen substantive diplomatic relations with friendly countries , " and also declared , in an undisguised manner , that Taiwan " will vigorously participate in various international nongovernment organizations and take an active part in international affairs through such diverse means as humanitarian concerns , economic and trade cooperation , and cultural exchanges , so as to expand Taiwan 's space for survival internationally . "  
to establish a set of specific management systems that suit the characteristics of science , educational , cultural , health , and other institutions and fit in with the regular patterns of the respective jobs of professional and technical personnel , managerial personnel , and workers and service personnel ;  
Third , the government of the locality where the S &amp; T park is located must make a change in its role and enhance its service quality , do a good job in improving the S &amp; T park 's supporting facilities , environment , communications , social order , cultural and sport facilities , basic education , public health , and social security , thus cultivate favorable conditions for the development of the park .  
Countries differ in many ways , in their social systems , historical backgrounds , cultural heritage , economic development , standard of living , religious beliefs , and values .  Therefore , it is not possible to expect all countries to develop after a single model or system .  
Many papers and periodicals are geared to the masses , the grass roots , and daily life , and persist in guiding people with correct public opinion ; the readers have welcomed them , and they have played a positive role in satisfying the political , economic , cultural , and daily life requirements of the masses and spurring the building of the two civilizations .  
Li Peng said : China similarly respects the general principle of the international community on human rights .  However , we feel that as countries have different social systems , economic conditions , historical backgrounds , cultural traditions , and religious beliefs , they do not share an identical understanding of human rights .  This is very natural .  
In the past 50 years , the Chinese Government has not only basically provided enough food and clothing for 1.2 billion people and greatly raised the people 's living standards , but also allowed the people to enjoy civil , political , economic , social , cultural , and educational rights on the basis of the Constitution and law .  We can say that China 's current human rights situation is in the best period in history .  
The North-South Joint Declaration confirms the basic principles for pursuing independent and peaceful unification on the Korean Peninsula , as well as the direction for seeking unification .

Both sides have agreed to promote the development of the national economy through economic cooperation , and to enhance mutual understanding and mutual trust by boosting cooperation and exchange in the social , cultural , sports , public health , environment , and other fields .  
Chi Haotian said that since establishing diplomatic relations in 1985 China and Bolivia have enjoyed smooth development of friendly cooperative relations , both sides have expanded exchanges and cooperation in political , economic , military and cultural fields , to which China is satisfied , and is willing to make continuous efforts to further relations between the two states and armed forces in a healthy and stable way .  
Second , it expresses their discontent of the West for ignoring Asian ideological traditions all these years .  What is more , it also reflects a kind of anxiety shown by people under the challenge of global economic globalization .  In the present-day world when economic activities become more " interdependent , " it is necessary to consider establishing some moral consensus on the spiritual and cultural levels .  
Since the establishment of diplomatic relations seven years ago , China and Slovakia have made joint efforts to promote the constant development of friendly cooperation in the political , economic , military , science , technology , and cultural fields .  
Both sides have decided to exchange visiting groups of separated families and relatives in as early as coming August , and both are prepared to promote mutual cooperation and exchange in social , cultural , and other fields through economic cooperation .  
since our party represents the orientation for the progress of China 's advanced culture , it must persistently take Marxism as the guide , inherit and develop all fine cultural traditions of the Chinese nation , study and absorb all the fruits of human civilization , and continually build and create socialist culture with Chinese characteristics , so that material and spiritual civilization will develop in coordinated fashion and promote the all-round progress of society ;  
In particular , in the past 10 years , top-level leaders of the two countries have frequently exchanged mutual visits , and bilateral exchange and cooperation in political , economic , trade , scientific and technological , and cultural fields have developed comprehensively .  
Since people 's spiritual and cultural demands are restricted by historical , social , or personal factors on the one hand , and is plastic in nature on the other .  Therefore , guiding people 's spiritual and cultural life is both necessary and indispensable .  
He said : Our contingent of professional literary and artistic workers is the backbone force in our country 's cultural building while the fine works can reflect in a centralized way both the epochal spirit and cultural standard of a country . 
The two sides agreed that China and Iran , two great ancient civilizations in Asia , should enhance exchanges and cooperation in cultural , educational and social areas to develop and substantiate the dialogue among civilizations .  These will be effective steps towards enhanced international cooperation in this field .  
In the meantime , the two sides maintained that to look at the political , economic , social , cultural and civil rights , particularly the right to development in a comprehensive [ English version uses " balanced " ] manner and in the right perspective is of special significance to all countries .  
But we should also be aware that some issues and difficulties do exist in the work of people 's courts , particularly courts at the grassroots level .  The cases in point are their failure to cope with the profound changes in economic , social , ideological , and cultural aspects .  
through the struggle during the period of reform , our party did away with the shortcomings of the economic , political , science , educational , cultural , and other systems that were unable to meet demand of further development of productive forces , thus further liberating and developing productive forces .  
In the final analysis , all struggles carried out by our party were aimed at liberating and developing productive forces ; and all guiding principles and policies adopted by our party are aimed at eventually ensuring continuous development of productive forces , boosting national economic development , raising the overall national strength , building socialist material and spiritual civilizations , satisfying the people 's increasing material and cultural needs , and becoming more representative of the people 's fundamental interests .  
As regards human rights , Li Peng has stressed and pointed out : It is impossible to demand that various countries follow the same viewpoint or mechanically transplant the same mode on the question of human rights , for human rights is an integral concept , and complete and common human rights should include not only the political rights of citizens but also the economic , social , and cultural rights , especially the right of survival and the right of development . 
and further deepened its understanding of China 's basic national condition .  It proposed : The main social contradiction is the one between the increasing material cultural needs of the people and the backward social productive forces .  This main contradiction runs through the whole process of the initial stage of socialism and all aspects of social life .  
7 .  The cultural , trade and economic , public security , information industry , foreign trade and economic affairs departments , customs houses , and administrations for industry and commerce at various levels must unify their thinking , increase their awareness , and further define their own functions and responsibilities .  Under the leadership of the local party committee and government , they must assume their responsibilities , closely coordinate with each other , and earnestly carry out their own administrative work and strengthen their routine supervision and management .  
The biggest lie spread by Dalai Lama at international occasions in recent years is the " theory of the extinction of the Tibetan culture . "  Making groundless charges on hearsay and deliberately distorting facts , he has accused the Tibetan people 's efforts to discard the decadent cultural traits that have seriously hindered Tibet 's social and economic development as " exterminating the Tibetan culture . "  
the effective protection and the active use of cultural relics and historical records ; the respect and protection that has been showed and extended to customs and folkways as well as to the freedom of religious belief ; an all-round inheritance and development of culture and arts ; a comprehensive engagement in Tibetan studies ; and by the rejuvenation of the Tibetan medicine .  All these have attested to the full that the Tibetan culture has undergone an unprecedented development , and this is a fact that allows of no doubt .  
Meanwhile , along with the elimination of the feudal serf system , the cultural trait accompanying the old system that the Tibetan culture was monopolized by a tiny minority of serf owners will surely be " exterminated " ; and the old cultural autocracy featured by both an unification of the administration and the monastery and the dominance of region in Tibet 's entire social and political life will surely be eliminated .  This is a necessity in the development of the Tibetan history , and also a necessity in the development of the Tibetan culture .  
We should throw into the garbage heap all the ideas and actions that run counter to the " three represents , " as well as all the feudal , superstitious , and unhealthy bourgeois ideas that have corroded our party organizations and party members , but we should uphold all the statements and actions that are capable of promoting the development of productive forces , conducive to heightening the advanced cultural level , and tallying with the people 's immediate and long-term interests .  
According to radically changed social conditions , the eighth party congress of 1956 made the correct judgment that the principal contradiction in Chinese society was one between the people 's rapidly increasing economic and cultural needs and the failure to satisfy their such needs ; at the same time , the congress also made accurate statements on the party 's nature , purposes , and tasks .  
it should persist in " grasping two links at the same time and giving equal importance to both of them , " vigorously step up the building of the socialist spiritual civilization , strive to improve the ideological and moral standards and scientific and cultural qualities of the whole nation , bring up a new generation of people who have lofty ideals and moral integrity and who are well-educated and self-disciplined , and create a political atmosphere of respecting knowledge and talented people in the party ;  
We must understand , think over , and resolve , in accordance with the intrinsic relations among society , economics , politics , and culture , the question of how our party can better represent the advance orientation of China 's advanced culture , always uphold Marxism as the guide , and strive to understand and master the characteristics and laws of cultural construction so as to continuously create and push ahead the culture with Chinese characteristics , develop socialist materialist and spiritual civilizations in a coordinated way , and achieve overall social progress .  
Adequately understanding the importance and urgency of cultural construction in line with the requirements of its 15th National Congress and from the height of the prosperity of the socialist cause and national rejuvenation is an important prerequisite for the entire party to better represent the advance orientation of China 's advanced culture .  
Only when the masses of the people are educated and armed with these two aspects of advanced culture can the Chinese nation 's ideological , ethical , scientific , and cultural qualities be improved unceasingly .  
I am convinced , positive scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation among countries of different social systems , economic modes , cultural traditions , and development levels are beneficial to the relevant parties and the entire world 's development .  
( 3 ) All other types of public cultural facilities - - museums , memorial halls , science and technology halls , cultural centers ( stations ) , sports arenas ( gymnasiums ) , theaters , workers ' cultural palaces ( clubs ) - - and enterprises and institutions , cultural and sports facilities affiliated with social group , and extracurricular education facilities must uphold the principle of public welfare , extend the hours opened to teenage students , and be open to teenage students for free or at low rates during festivals and holidays .

In close connection with the changes in the internal and external situation , with the reality of the latest development of China 's social productive forces and the profound changes in the economic system , with the demands of the masses for new development in material and cultural life , and with the new conditions and changes in the ranks of party members and cadres , we should ponder in depth how to adhere still better to the " three represents , " and make efforts to find answers from linking theory with reality .  
As a kind of comprehensive planning , urban and rural planning must properly handle the relations between the part and the whole , the near term and the long tem , needs and possibilities , economic development and social development , urban and rural construction and environmental protection , modernization and protection of historical and cultural relics , and so on .

After years of construction , our political system is quite vigorous and our society is gradually growing more diverse . We maintain trade , scientific , and cultural relations with over 140 countries around the world , but because our government adopts a policy of no compromise , no negotiations , and no contacts to resist the " united front " tactics of the Communists , we have been misunderstood by the international community as stiff-necked conservatives . What is the Premier 's view ?  
The participants were organized into panels to discuss the following eight topics : tactics for long-term economic development , the development of education and human resources , social and cultural development , the development of science and technology , the development of capital and currency markets , regional development , planning for a comprehensive transportation system , and information and communications .  
This so-called " domain of single subjectivity " refers to the main characteristic that in traditional Chinese history social , economic , academic , cultural , and artistic activities as subjectivities were deeply influenced by political activity as subjectivity .

At home its precious textiles spurred the development of the art of embroidery .  
For us " China fever " raises a number of interesting questions . From the land of marvels described by Marco Polo , through the utopia pictured by philosophers of the Enlightenment and the Sick Man of Asia coveted by imperialists , to the future world power predicted by Arnold Toynbee , just what attitudes have Westerners held toward this ancient country isolated by oceans on one side and forbidding plains on the other ? And why ? The Western Powers removed many cultural treasures from the country during the course of the nineteenth century .  
In Europe , which has a strong cultural background of its own , sinological research - - setting out from the tasks of translation and textual criticism - - was exceptionally solid and meticulous , and major figures continued to appear up until the middle of this century .  
These included : The government should increase cultural and educational investment , establish a complete social welfare system and robust rule of law system , and strengthen public trust and public authority .

The image of the lion is widely seen in art both East and West , but in East Asia , where the animal is not indigenous , the conclusion is obvious that its image must have come from West , possibly as long ago as the time of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia . The creation of the artistic lion of East Asia from the real lion , that is to say , represents a kind of cultural interchange .  
Despite its foreign origins in both physical reality and artistic representation , the pomegranate has been able to express even more of its charm in China . Well suiting the Chinese national spirit , it has long been broadly popular among the people , as well as marking a pleasant footnote in the history of cultural and artistic interchange between East and West . (  
Some countries have formal diplomatic relations with us and some do not , but the countries that do not all have a number of substantive relations with us , such as economic and trade ties , scientific and technological cooperation , athletic and cultural exchanges , a whole host of them .  
Mr . Chien said the government has stressed economic development in the past , and neglected cultural and social construction . , In the future it will try to compensate , and looks forward to achieving the following indicators by the year 2000 : * Price increases will not exceed 3.5% annually ; * The economic growth rate will reach 6.5% annually ; * Per capita GNP will reach US $ 20,000 ; * Trade volume will reach US $ 350 billion .  
This includes the establishment of centers for folk arts and popular handicrafts in southern and eastern Taiwan . In the north , Chinese culture parks will be set up . And at the same time at least five large-scale museums will be added to the present number . Exhibition halls displaying the unique features of local and indigenous products will become part and parcel of the cultural centers of every county and town .  
Community cultural activities will be held regularly during weekends or vacations . A spirit of good neighborliness is sure to prevail , and mutual assistance within an interdependent entity will become common . In collaboration with religious and civic bodies , the government will endeavor to foster and encourage ethical norms which are in conformity with our present-day society , itself a product of popular customs and mores blended with traditional rites and ceremonies .  
If both the government and the people adhere to the established policies of political democratization , economic liberalization , societal pluralization , and cultural sinification ; if they speed the development of democratic politics and maintain stable economic growth ; and if they progress in related social and cultural respects - - all this will mean that all sectors in our nation will develop in a balanced way and forge ahead jointly .  
After returning to China , Lin lived an impassioned life , writing essays , speaking , running the school , and organizing cultural activities . His passion was devoted to the realization of his ideal of " social aesthetization . "  
He composed poems and antithetical couplets in impeccable classical Chinese , disdaining the vernacular and even the modern innovation of punctuation . He married a Chinese and hobnobbed with such cultural luminaries as Ch'i Pai-shih and Shen Yin-mo , filling his leisure hours with the traditional pursuits of a Chinese literatus : the lute , the game of go , calligraphy , and painting .  
Modern Taiwan 's rural hinterland could hardly be expected to provide ethical regeneration and social harmony as it used to in the past , because concentration of the population in cities is already an established trend . But rural culture 's essential spiritual values can provide the basis for cultural development .  
After current publisher Shaw Yu-ming assumed office , in 1987 Sinorama 's global vision was broadened and coverage of Chinese cultural traditions was strengthened . Series of reports on world sinology and sinologists , on famous universities , and other subjects appeared , and have already been collected and published in book form .  
As chief architect of the temple 's reconstruction , the late artist Li Mei-shu engaged Taiwan 's best temple builders and craftsmen in wood and stone carving in order to leave to posterity a fine cultural heritage of traditional architectural art . " Cheng Yu-ts'ai adds that many foreigners , particularly Japanese , make special journeys to see this " temple of oriental art . "  
In 1978 , the late President Chiang Ching-kuo , premier at the time , had local cultural development listed as one of the 12 major development projects . Cultural centers were built in towns with county or municipal government s across the province .  
The formation of culture is strongly influenced by geographical factors , " says Tsai Hsiang-hui , an associate professor of history at the Chinese Culture University who serves as a trustee to the cultural foundation in Peikang . " The significance of local cultural and educational foundations lies in bringing together people from the same area , sharing similar customs and backgrounds , to show their concern for local culture . If we are n't elementary school classmates , we may be distant cousins .  
Thinking about all this from the angle of historical geography , I think northerners are used to being ruled by nomadic tribes , and the physical environment makes northerners more open-minded ; southerners , on the other hand , are the stubborn guardians of Chinese cultural traditions , so to speak , they opened up the south when they fled there to escape foreign domination , so they have a strong " spirit of resistance . " Q : Of what benefit were your two years of fieldwork ?  
In his view , housing belongs to the infrastructure and can not easily be altered once built , whereas cultural and educational work can be developed and improved through mistakes , and is a long term project that can not be left undone .  
The economic takeoff is helpful for raising the quality of culture . But from another angle , some people believe that the roots of culture in Taiwan are weak . Sudden wealth at this time is by no means an unmixed blessing . This is especially true with the percolation of a " get rich quick " attitude into the arts , which will do even more to erode the roots of cultural development .  
Hsiao Yeh , who was once with CMPC and devoted much effort to the promotion of new cinema , is even more adamant : " This has nothing at all to do with new cinema , it 's a flash in the pan , " because the cultivation of film-makers alone is inadequate for raising standards throughout cinema , when " the whole cultural and educational environment has been static for so long , without any improvement .  
Having just celebrated the anniversary of commissioner Lin 's burning of British opium which triggered the Opium War , Chinese readers might be smiling quietly to themselves at the fact that neighboring Japan is not only supplying the British with cheap and attractive household goods , but is also spending a large amount of money on their cultural education . lt is difficult not to conclude , however , that the only way to avoid accusations of " charm and stealth " might be to send in gunboats selling heroin under the flag of free trade .  
These products of cultural fushion from 200 or 300 years ago are scattered all across Europe . Just open the map - - from Sicily in the south to Fagervik in the north , from St . Petersburg in the east to Lisbon in the west - - well-preserved specimens of chinoiserie can be found everywhere . This month 's photo essay presents some of the pictures of chinoiserie Sinorama has garnered from across the continent of Europe .  
Nevertheless , although it is impossible to fully articulate the original cultural environment , still , the ultimate meaning behind the culture on the psychological level can transcend time and space and be expressed on the stage .  
Lin Ming-te says emphatically , " We are always calling for a Chinese cultural renaissance , and saying that modern architecture should be imbued with a traditional aesthetic . It 's a shame that one essential element is conspicuously missing from the vast majority of large public structures exhibiting a classical Chinese flavor - - the traditional poetic couplet . Most homes also give little thought to the content of their New Year 's couplets . "  
Long ago , the busy striving for thoroughness in business and the hectic pace of life led Chen to turn to Confucian principles as an extremely human and practical set of cultural beliefs . He feels sorry that he can not get other modern people to accept them as well .  
Altogether , there are probably no more than ten similar local drama troupes . Participants mostly have a sense that cultural development between the cities and the rural areas is too imbalanced : In Taipei arts groups are concentrated together and there are abundant performing arts . But elsewhere , after the powerful assault of the mass media , now everyone is bolted in front of the TV watching the same old TV personalities and plots that have nothing to do with their daily lives . Where have those dramas that reflect local life gone to ? "  
Display local vitality , and the renewal of life : " Affairs are in the hands of men . " Ho Chien-wei learned from this set of performances that drama companies can compromise with and come together with local cultural centers : " The local administrative system is the greatest source of energy . If you just give them a chance , they can escape from the traditional recalcitrant attitude of ' having one more thing to do is not as good as having one less thing to do . ' '  
In " An Open Letter to Our Compatriots on Taiwan , " delivered in 1979 before the National People 's Congress by standing central committee member Ye Jianying , the Communists declared that they would cease shelling Kinmen , Matsu and other offshore islands and would set up navigation and postal links as soon as possible to facilitate direct contacts between the two sides and carry out acade mic and cultural exchange .  
We need to create a beneficial exchange , bringing in more information from abroad and putting out the story of our own cultural heritage , the sincerity of our efforts and our practical actions , to avoid a repeat of the rhino horn incident , with its hurt feelings , wasted energy and the risk that a traditional ingredient in Chinese medicine may disappear . (  
The maintenance of the basic rural village structure , plus leisure time and extra cash that people are willing to spend on cultural activities , is just like Taiwan shortly after retrocession , before any electronic or television media had become widespread , when local opera was definitely in its prime .  
This group of new directors , called the fifth generation , includes such figures as Chen Kai-ge and Tian Zhuang-zhuang . They share some things in common . Because of the cultural revolution , they all lost the chance to study . Among those 20 million intellectual youths dispersed to the remote regions to live with the peasants , they know about these places ' odd customs .  
Three years ago , when Mr . You invited me to act as convener of Ilan 's " Editorial Committee for Locally Oriented Language Teaching Materials , " I made my acceptance conditional on his placing local vernacular education work in the cultural and educational sphere , and resisting any attempt to put it on the political level where it could become a tool in the Democratic Progressive Party 's political battles with the Nationalist Party ( KMT ) .  
The dig report from that time pointed out that there were two cultural levels at the site . The pottery discovered in the upper layer had writing , and brass implements had also been unearthed , so that layer seems to be from the Chou dynasty . But the lower layer was entirely from a stone tool culture . The black and light yellow pottery that was found was innovative in shape and of very high quality in technique , meaning that it must have been " an important stage in high antiquity . "  
Compared to these sites , Chengziya is much larger , and many more large artifacts have been discovered . " In fact , it already transcends the traditional ' fortress ' type compound , which was mainly for defense , and is a ' city ' in the sense of a political , economic , and cultural center .  
For this reason the many arguments expounded in Novel China are mainly presented through analogy and dialogue between large numbers of works , and concentrate on probing the emergence , development and current state of several genre traditions within recent and modern Chinese fiction , including political , local-flavor , overseas student life , science fiction , erotic , feminine consciousness , and others , along with these genres ' aesthetic , social , and cultural implications .  
Generally speaking , only to research each other is not enough . Of course , the reasons involved are very complicated . Speaking from my own limited knowledge of Western and Eastern culture , if there were one ideal state of affairs in this world , it would be a result of incorporating Western and Eastern cultural consciousness , extracting the essential kernels of each and doing away with the chaff . Perhaps that should be the objective of all mankind .  
The symbolic meaning of " tribe " : If you mention the harvest or new year 's festivals of the nine tribes , most people will have a stereotyped impression of a night spent singing , dancing , and drinking but will know nothing of their background or of how these unique cultural phenomena were distilled over time from tribal experience .  
He is worried that with the limited economic power of the Ami residents of the Shankuang Estate , as more and more high-rise blocks are built and large numbers of Han Chinese move in , the Ami will gradually lose the advantage they have enjoyed of forming the vast majority of the local population ; furthermore , each unit on the estate measures only around 65 square meters , so that as second generation residents marry , lack of space will force them to move off the estate , creating a threat to cultural maintenance .  
In recent years , given the progressive social diversification and liberalization of Taiwan and its distinct island culture , Taiwan has become an ideal laboratory for testing various postmodern social theories and conducting cultural research . Deconstructionism , psychoanalysis , feminism , and Marxist theory are not in isolated company , making for a bustling cultural scene .  
Also , because it is cut off from the rest of Taiwan by mountains that run right down to the coast , the east developed relatively late . Many valuable cultural artifacts have thus been preserved up to the present , and there are many archaeological sites from former cultures that settled here .  
In the " Conference on Hakka Culture , " part of this year 's arts and cultural festival , a report written by a Hakka man in praise of Hakka women was suddenly criticized by Huang Yu-hsiu , an associate professor of foreign languages at National Taiwan University , as " having a male chauvinist pig viewpoint and objectifying women . " This brought a sudden quiet , but many younger Hakka women silently approved of the professor 's comments .  
While overseas he saw many Chinese people in a state of ignorance and superstition , with a low level of cultural cultivation . In his hometown he saw old private schools in a state of decay , and the new Western-style schools corrupt . Many children in the village already over the age of ten were still naked and played in the streets : " It almost returned to a prehistoric state of barbarity .  
Chen was Lai Ho 's companion in literature , and the two developed a close bond . They often interacted through poems and songs . The two of them joined together with a group of highly educated and politically aware writers to form the ' Ying Society . ' They composed poetry to express their concerns about current events and their sympathy with the lives of the masses , and they also used this to carry on the Chinese cultural tradition .  
The original content of the 24 Solar Terms was very simple , but over many years , they slowly developed into focal points for an extremely fertile cultural milieu . They are guides to farming life , reference dates for weather forecasting and holidays for all sorts of ceremonial activities . Almanacs , the weather , agriculture , the general life of the community - - all abide under the shadow of the Solar Terms !  
This in turn drew on the neoclassical style that appeared in Europe in the mid-18th century . That style emphasized " reason " and rationality , which designers of the period found embodied in the nearly pure geometric shapes of classical architecture . This trend , combined with the cultural exchange that came from colonial expansionism and the rise of archaeology as a field of study , produced new structures in Europe that incorporated a number of classical themes into a single building .  
Now , through the efforts of several dedicated teachers at Shuanglung primary school , Shuanglung village has set up a Bunun Cultural Development Association , and has launched a series of back-to-roots events , such as leading tribespeople on visits to the Bunun 's original home , organizing a traditional " eight-part singing " group and opening a cultural resources office .  
In the past , the SEF distinguished between negotiations at the levels of chairman , secretary-general , and vice-secretary-general , and the SEF official of a given level would only negotiate with a mainland counterpart at the same level . Now , in order to increase flexibility , there will not be hard and fast distinctions between the levels . Moreover , in the past there were only negotiations on limited issue areas . Now there will also be sub-units discussing economic and cultural affairs . "  
The public hearing gained the attention and sup port of the township council , the mayor and the citizens of Meinung . So in 1993 the Love Meinung Alliance was set up . It incorporated local leaders such as the mayor , neighborhood chiefs , social organizations and people from cultural circles , holding seminars in every neighborhood . They distributed hand-outs , and they decided to go north to Taipei to demonstrate in front of the Legislative Yuan , requesting the reservoir 's budget be eliminated .  
Ho Jin-tsair , the director of the Department of Social Education in the Ministry of Education , says that the relevant government agencies have been under intense pressure since the discovery of the sunken ship off Penghu . Public opinion is inclined to see such wrecks as cultural resources . Many critics say that the MoE is not doing its job because , though it is aware that " national treasures " fall clearly within its purview , it is not actively moving to " rescue " the artifacts .  
Entering into the museum as it celebrates its seventieth anniversary is like walking into a time tunnel of 7000 years . Through all these ancient eras , how many brave heroes , gifted gents and lovely ladies have come and gone ? Fortunately , we have a rich heritage of books , paintings and calligraphy , of objects that did not , like their owners , turn to ashes and dust . Instead they have become witnesses of the wisdom of the ancients , and a cultural inheritance .  
Q : In 1985 , when Peter Brook used an abandoned quarry at Avignon for a nine-hour performance by actors from various countries of the Hindu epic poem Mahabharata , many people hailed the production as a successful blend of numerous cultural elements . But others felt that Brook did not have a deep enough understanding of Hindu thought , so that the work was another example of oriental exoticism .  
" This is not just an issue about 200 people 's livelihoods , or who 's going to take over . It 's more about redefining Peking opera and readjusting the guidelines for national cultural development , " says National Institute of the Arts teacher Wen Chiu-chu , who just completed research on " Taiwanese Peking opera . " The three military opera troupes used to be cultural products forcibly cultivated by the government . They used up quite a lot of national resources , and under excessive protection they lost their ability to be innovative and different .  
As in the cultural , agricultural , and economic fields , cross-strait narcotics exchanges and mutual reliance among dealers have also grown significantly these past several years . Cross-strait anti-drug cooperation should be implemented with urgency , but it is stagnating amidst disputes over sovereignty and legal jurisdiction , and it has proven difficult to make any breakthroughs .  
One reason was because the discovery found its way into newspapers all over the world , and many people knew that now Puli had more than picturesque natural beauty and such special local products as rice noodles and shaoxing wine . The citizens of Puli also possessed a glorious treasure - - cultural property left behind by people of an age long passed .  
Furthermore , too many units are in charge of historical landmarks and cultural artifacts , so that no one knows whom to follow . For example , historical landmarks are administered by the Ministry of the Interior , but antique objects inside protected historical buildings are administered by the Ministry of Education . The central , provincial , county and municipal governments all have " cultural personnel " with the same general function . The resulting mish-mash of authority and responsibility means that in the end the affair falls into the pattern of no one managing at all .  
Their settlement was very large , and the burial patterns ( e.g . the direction in which the coffins are set ) are regular and orderly . During the test dig , traces were found of holes for pillars for house frames . In some places the cultural level is flat and even , without artifacts . " The dirt has been tramped down firmly and evenly , as if a large number of people walked over it , " says Liu , suspecting that such places may have been areas of collective activities for Tamalin Man .  
Should other historical reconstructions , for example those about Taiwanese soldiers or the February 28 incident , be seen in a similar light ? Another easily overlooked pitfall of oral history is that the viewpoint of the interviewer or editor will be imposed on the interviewee , or cultural or humanistic viewpoints will be superimposed and unwittingly enter the thinking of the respondent . These external ideas and interpretations may shape the memories of the interviewee , so that he or she ends up spouting someone else 's point of view without even realizing it .  
On the surface , this is a simple case of who controls the rights to a piece of music . But because those involved are members of a small group of indigenous people , given the surge in ethnic self-identification in Taiwan in recent years , the incident has naturally been interpreted as one in which " certain foreigners and Han Chinese have stolen and exploited the cultural and intellectual property of indigenous people . "  
The songs of the Ami can be traced back to their fishing , farming , and hunting activities in the mountains and along the coast . In their tightly organized villages , through the annual harvest festival , each successive generation was trained and educated in cultural traditions , which is the main reason these songs have been carried forward .  
Just as European countries have in recent years strongly promoted " green industries " in the environmental and cultural fields , not only improving the quality of life but creating tens of thousands of jobs as well , there are many things in Taiwan worth investing in , and sufficient profits to be had . Enterprises need not think that their only choice is to head abroad .  
I feel like a late 20th century George Catlin , who traveled the American West painting portraits of native Americans . Armed with a camera rather than a paintbrush , I have the chance to capture Yunnan 's minorities in all their happy glory , while they still feel content within their ancient cultural perimeters . What began as a documentary exercise evolved into something more personal .  
There are also detailed descriptions of the SEF 's legal , trade and cultural services . The Mainland Affairs section presents the current state of cross-strait exchanges , and regulations governing cross-strait news reporting , publishing and electronic media work . All this information should provide a valuable reference resource for Taiwanese firms investing in the mainland , and for people both inside and outside the ROC who are engaged in cross-strait business or other affairs .  
At the end of September , work formally began on an investment by Acer Computer to build a multi - functional intelligent park in Taoyuan . Total investment is expected to be NT $ 200 billion . When completed , the park will have factories , residences , cultural and educational facilities , and more . It amounts to a privately funded version of the HSBIP , writing a new page for the " Invest in Taiwan " program .  
It is an historical asset that is part of the collective memories of the people who live in Taiwan , and also provides living instruction about the history of railroads here , and could also be a concrete way for the government to show their concern for Taiwan 's native culture . " It has more meaning from the perspective of cultural preservation and education . "  
As for the railway museum , five years ago the TRA set up a museum planning team to find suitable locations , " but all of the NT $ 5 million which we had budgeted was cut by the provincial assembly . They thought it was more appropriate for museums to be planned by cultural and educational departments , " says Chen Te-pei , spreading his hands in a gesture of frustration .  
In October last year it was reported that Taichung Station was to be moved underground , and that the old station building , which dates from the Japanese occupation era , might be demolished . The RCS joined with several other cultural and historical associations to put on a campaign to plead for the life of the 80-year-old station , including an event in which groups rode trains from both north and south to meet in Taichung . Finally they managed to get the station building designated a Grade 2 national monument by the Ministry of the Interior .  
According to the field interviews of cultural writer Ma Teng-yueh , who has traveled extensively writing down the experiences of tattooed tribal elders , the Saisiyat live quite close to the Atayal , and the reason they started tattooing their faces is " the inevitable result of protecting themselves against a stronger enemy . " Therefore , in actuality , among all the indigenous peoples , only Atayal have the inherent custom of facial tattooing . That is why the Qing Dynasty documents usually referred to Atayal as " qingmian fan " ( " tattoo-faced barbarians " ) .  
But at a time when local cultural consciousness is flourishing , and with the associated preference for local plant and animal species , the sudden epidemic of disease among lowland pine trees has been greeted with no great concern by many in forestry and botanical circles . This is because the pine trees in Taiwan 's plains are all introduced species brought by immigrant settlers and colonists , who planted them out of nostalgia for their old homes .  
Moreover , " acquaintance rape " is generally less violent than rape by a stranger . Therefore , under a maledominated legal system , and given the cultural script which calls for men to take the sexual initiative , the rate of conviction is very low . Indeed , victims often have no recourse at all . Worst of all , violation by a known person often leaves much deeper psychological and emotional scars on the victim than violence by a stranger .  
In this sort of cultural tradition , even if many contemporary women and their husbands enjoy a substantial level of educational achievement and income , when these women return to their motherinlaw 's house , they still come down a notch , afraid of offending at every turn , making their inlaws unhappy and causing trouble for their husbands .  
Over the years the HUF has prepared guided introductions to six trails , with the most popular being the Chihshan Rock Trail in Shihlin , which combines natural scenery with Class Two historic cultural artifacts . And since Mayor Chen Shui-bian declared that this trail would be made part of the city 's high school entrance exams , many dedicated parents have come here to collect informa - tion for their kids .  
For instance , the limitless rebirth of life forms exists within cultural change and natural cycles of waxing and waning and rising and falling . And I have connected the symbols and visual vocabulary employed in each of these twelve works to the twelve signs of the zodiac , which represent the rhythmic relationship between Heaven and Earth .  
Kun Opera , which derives its name from the Kunshan area of Jiangsu Province , where it first came into popularity , has one style of tune . As early as the late Yuan and early Ming dynasties , it was recognized as one form of southern song . This period was one of intense political , economic and cultural development in the south .  
Another judge , Huang Hai-ming , adds that the five artists selected reveal three cultural phenomena : the prospering global economy and information explosion that brought with them the crises of spiritual fragmentation and loss of self-identity ( Wang Jun-jieh ) , political and social criticism that followed the lifting of martial law ( Wu Tien-chang and Yao Jui-chung ) , and finally " a return to the feelings of the heart and the oriental tradition " ( Lee Ming-tse and Chen Chien-pei ) .  
Although I am still the only Taiwanese person in the city today , and I have to repeat the same explanations about Chinese culture over and over again , I have learned a lot from these people about their culture and customs , and observed the lives of different levels of society . But more important is the true " cultural friendship " which has been the major factor supporting and encouraging me during my study abroad .  
In the 1980s , among all the social movements , the environmental protection movement found the most resonance around the world . This , coupled with the rise of the aboriginal rights movement , caused environmentalists , in the wake of modern man 's overdevelopment of land , to begin to reexamine methods of living and urge a return to natural , simple lifestyles . As a result , the complete set of cultural ceremonies and behavior that aborigines have as a result of hunting have once again been embraced .  
Many scholars are happy to see that traditional Rukai tribal hunting is being allowed under resource-management controls in order to achieve sustainable economic use of natural resources . " Only when tribal people are economically independent can they rediscover their cultural identity , " they argue . " It 's a good way for them to regain their self-respect . "  
Aiming to reach a new segment of society , HEPP has held its promotional activities in places crowded with the fashionable and cultured elite of Taipei-such as department stores , the Eslite bookstore group ( a key cultural barometer for Taipei ) , and Crown Art Center .  
This exchange is the first time since the break-off of negotiations that dialogue has been conducted between the two sides . The letter sent from Taiwan on March 5th received a quick and clear response on March 11th with ARATS reiterating that they were willing to invite representatives from the SEF of " a suitable level " to lead economic , cultural or academic missions to the PRC , either to visit or participate in seminars . The opportunity to restart cross-straits negotiations can be traced back to earlier this year .  
" The purpose of technology is to serve human cultural development , and the world has already reached a stage in which intangible assets are the most valued and the most valuable , " said Acer Group chairman and CEO Stan Shih at a press conference , adding that the main reason why software is so expensive in Taiwan is because of the small size of the local market .  
In that time of controversy , " Tsai Yuan-pei could be said to have been the least controversial personality , " says Ambrose King in the book Daxue de Linian ( The Idea of the University ) . In his hands , Beida became a real university , a center for new culture and modern thinking in China . But Tsai did not belong only to Beida ; he also belonged to a larger academic and cultural community .  
" He has melded cultural affirmation and ethnic self-respect with literary practice to create a purely Chinese literary form , " says Ng Kim Chew . " This provides solace to his personal sensibilities , both literary and ethnic . " There are few who can compare to ECM writers living in Taiwan in terms of how hard they work , either . Li Yung-ping was once an assistant professor in the department of foreign languages and literatures at National Sun Yat-sen University .  
The year before last the show " Splendors of Imperial China " was well received by the American academic and cultural communities , and afterwards many nations extended invitations to the National Palace Museum . The French government worked especially hard to meet the Musuem 's needs , even passing a new law designating measures to protect foreign art works on exhibition there . Now , 63 years after part of the National Palace Museum collection first went to Europe for a show in London in 1935 , works from the museum are going to Paris .  
Nonetheless , says Li Lan , chairperson of the Sino-American Folk Arts Association , located in the United States , in Lee 's paintings there lurks a glorious and mysterious cultural China , marching slowly from the traditional to the modern , just like those personalities that have come to life through her brushes-very elegant and languorous .  
These private art museums or memorial museums on the one hand afford centralized management and exhibition of these senior artists ' works , and privately held works of art might be donated to foundations as public cultural assets open to the public . In another sense , they bring greater diversity to art appreciation , spreading and expanding viewing opportunities beyond the select few major public art museums .  
Shih Ying does not deny that there were already a number of community organizations active in Wenshan District , and that it already had quite a strong cultural and educational ethos . Thus siting the first community college there " in fact was a soft option-but that does n't mean we are n't aware of the difficulties to be faced later . " He says that in the future it is hoped that community colleges will spread to communities throughout Taiwan , but this will depend on each community 's degree of readiness and preparedness .  
The Taiwan Garrison Command was established in 1958 , assuming complete control over martial law , police functions , entry to and exit from Taiwan , media and cultural censorship , postal spying , and military trials ( which could also be used in civilian cases ) .  
After the ROC government lifted the ban on cultural contacts with mainland China , practitioners of traditional Chinese theater enthusiastically took advantage of the opportunity to visit the land where their art was born . Those with antiquarian interests , too , were very excited about the loosening of restrictions , for even though many of China 's greatest archeological treasures are already to be found right here in Taiwan , extremely important new archeological discoveries had been made in mainland China during the previous two decades .  
From Arabic literature 's Aladdin to the native American tale of Pocahontas , from The Hunchback of Notre Dame , steeped in Gallic ambience , to Hercules , rooted in Greek and Roman mythology , Disney has long sought out material with a world-wide appeal . Seeking a feeling of intimacy and a clear delineation between good and evil , their animated features employ fables and animals to dissolve the cultural barriers that lie hidden under their auras of exoticism .  
Reasons for Taiwanese forgetfulness of May Fourth are that modern Taiwan does not face the general national malaise which once afflicted China , Messrs . Democracy and Science have already been realized to some degree , cultural life is highly westernized , and the nativist movement of recent years has tended to increase estrangement from the mainland . " In Taiwan there is little interest in pursuing fundamental issues of China 's recent and modern development , " says Wu Chan-liang .  
According to Hsinchu mayor Tsai Jen-chien , " There is little free space within the city limits , so we can only carry out rationalization and renewal on present scale . But the city enjoys many other assets due to its long history and culture . " From the Qing dynasty through to the Japanese colonial period , Hsinchu was one of northern Taiwan 's key political and economic centers , and this has left the city with a rich legacy of cultural assets .  
While a 5,000-year-old cultural legacy was being smashed to smithereens on the mainland , the ROC 's commitment to " revive classical Chinese culture and carry on traditional ways " represented a difficult burden for the small island of Taiwan to bear by itself . President Chiang Kai-shek would serve as head of the " Council for Chinese Cultural Renaissance . " Peking opera and classical Chinese painting were deliberately promoted and local Taiwanese culture suppressed .  
Wang Tsu-hua 's wife is from Puli , which is why he moved there in 1985 and opened a restaurant . Because he had a great liking for the place 's artistic and cultural style and for its people , and also makes ceramic art , he later got actively involved in the local artistic and cultural scene . He even helped set up a " New Puli Development Committee " to promote entrepreneurial culture there .  
Over 70% of Tungshih 's population is of Hakka ancestry , and both civic organizations and ordinary people have preserved large numbers of Hakka artifacts and much historical material . After the earthquake , the Taichung County Hakka Cultural Association realized that these valuable cultural and historical assets might be destroyed by the bulldozers as damaged houses were demolished . They urged the Tungshih Township authorities to slow down the demolition work , to give them a few days ' time to save what they could .  
Banu Gabamumu , president of their cultural development association , spent many days inspecting the damage in the Shao ancestral lands around Sun Moon Lake . On seeing how the earthquake had almost split Kuanghua Island into pieces , he said : " This place , which we call Lalu , used to be the home of our highest ancestral spirit . But later it was occupied by the Han Chinese spirit the Old Man Under the Moon . Perhaps now our ancestor has grown angry , and wants to take back the land He lost . "  
The Taipei Fine Arts Museum offered visitors a peek outside the mainstream in October , exhibiting a collection of works by contemporary artists from five Central American nations . Apart from the exotic nature of the exhibit , the deep insights that the artists have incorporated into these works offer a portrait of the political , economic , cultural , and social realities of Central America today .  
And what really moved him was not the magnificent , precipitous Huatung Valley , the endlessly rising peaks of Taroko Gorge , the serpentine curves of the Central and Southern Cross-Island Highways , or the year-round tropical greenery of Kenting-it was the rich cultural voice of Taiwan 's people .  
Says Mei : " This is where the Jesuits established the first Western-type university in the Far East , while Chinese scholars such as Hong Xiuquan , Lin Zexu , Liang Qichao , Kang Youwei and Cheng Guanying spent time here absorbing Western learning . " Macau emerged unscathed from WWII , and many of its original Portuguese-language documents have been preserved intact , providing an invaluable resource for research into cultural and religious exchanges between East and West .  
To say that mainland Chinese look to Taiwan popular culture as an oracle would certainly be blowing our horn a little too loud . But it is no exaggeration to say , as one mainland China cultural maven put it , " Television , film , and pop music are the main channels through which most ordinary people in mainland China have learned about external cultures since the Cultural Revolution . "  
Besides her natural vocal quality , the key to A-Mei 's success has been that her songs reflect feelings and aspirations of her era . In fact , when you look back at the history of popular cultural interchange between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait , all the most successful singers and hit songs have been connected in some way to the hopes and feelings of the times .  
1,000 years ago , under the rule of scholars who valued culture over military prowess , Song-dynasty China saw rapid economic development and brought forth remarkable cultural and artistic achievements .  
As the first Taiwanese president , Lee Teng-hui 's success did a lot to assuage the anger of the Taiwanese people about the discrimination they had experienced . This won him a lot of support . On top of that , once in power he implemented a policy of shifting the island 's cultural center of gravity away from mainland China and more toward Taiwan itself , and he criticized the KMT as being " a regime of outsiders . " These positions won him 54% of the vote in the first direct presidential election .  
New Premier Tang Fei is well aware that the public has high expectations and will brook no delay . He chaired his first cabinet meeting on his fourth day in office , and issued a list of six focal points : improving cross-strait relations , eradicating " black gold " ( the influence of criminals and moneyed interests in politics ) , hastening earthquake reconstruction , creating a new economic miracle , deepening education reform and cultural development , and " reinventing " government .  
In terms of ideology , the stress on the ideal of a unified Greater China and institutionalized anti-communism threw a pall over local culture , and a Taiwan-oriented consciousness had not yet openly emerged . The political environment and the distribution of cultural resources were less than fair , and due to the influence of a world-view centered on the Chinese mainland , progress on urban rapid transit systems and many other important basic infrastructure projects was slow .  
Relations with the mainland at the highest political level have reached impasse after impasse , and dark war clouds gather over the Taiwan Strait ; yet at the grassroots level , what with trade links , fishing links and intermarriage , the people are inseparably intermingled , and the same is true on the academic , cultural and religious fronts and even in the entertainment and travel industries .  
On the subject of cross-strait relations , Chen stressed that the people of Taiwan and mainland China share a common ancestral , cultural , and historical background , and he stated his belief that the leaders on both sides have the wisdom and creativity to jointly deal with the question of a future " one China . "  
In addition to being an important cultural center in ancient India , the Gandhara region of northwest India ( straddling the modern-day border between Pakistan and Afghanistan ) , had also been a part of the Greek empire for a time , and was deeply influenced by Hellenic culture . In Buddhist sculpture from Gandhara , the figures have the deeply set eyes , aquiline noses , and curly hair so typical of Greek statues .  
" Although the ban against building new houses resulted in the preservation of many traditional homes , back when soldiers were billeted in every home they covered the walls with patriotic slogans , seriously defacing the property . Moreover , " says Yang Shu-ching , " cultural studies were seen as unimportant , so there was no one to carry such things out . By the time martial law was lifted , many aspects of Kinmen culture had changed and could no longer easily be studied . "  
Li Hsi-chi got his initial inspiration from the inscribed wooden plaques that grace the door lintels of clan temples in Kinmen . He executed an entire series of paintings based on them before moving on to throw occasional poetry events modeled after the elegant parties indulged in by the upper classes in centuries past . Li also called on artists and writers from both Taiwan and the mainland to tour Kinmen and understand the beauty of the local culture . These activities spurred the local community to a heightened interest in cultural preservation .  
This cultural illness is particularly serious in United States . American girls begin to be extremely concerned about their appearance from high school on , and many people are constantly depressed about their weight . Though the situation is not so serious in Taiwan , the mass media puts out a virtually unvarying message that beauty equals success . It is difficult for young people to resist the message implied in teenage beauty pageants , love-at-first-sight stories pairing up beautiful girls and handsome guys , and the images of pop superstars .  
dubbed by some " the Lone Ranger of the art world , " and by others as " the Confucian Swashbuckler , " noted watercolorist Chen Yang-chun has been practicing his art for nearly 30 years now . Some of his favorite subjects have been bucolic country scenes from around Taiwan , small towns , and women of the reserved yet romantic beauty that East Asia is famous for . Chen 's works are widely collected around the world , which has earned him the unofficial title of " cultural ambassador . "  
This visit , which has been called " soft diplomacy , " breaks the previous mold of focusing on political and economic power . Instead , the vice president 's delegation included members of the cultural , religious , and scientific communities , and elected officials as well .  
The latter was the northernmost of these three counties , and extended all the way to Taipei and Keelung , but settlers long declined to venture north of Touliu ( today the county seat of Yunlin ) . Further south in Tainan , the Dutch arrived in the 1620s and established a fortress called Zeelandia . Later in that century , the Ming loyalist Koxinga 's able minister Chen Yonghua adopted a policy of keeping Taiwan equally strong in both the cultural and military spheres . A period of cultural flowering ensued in the south .  
This naturally makes local governments very reliant upon , and vulnerable to control by , the central government . Although the actual amount of the tax redistribution is limited , local governments have to shoulder most of the burden of maintaining infrastructure , social services , education , cultural activities , and more . Local finances are very strained as a result .  
In the early 1980s his book A Preliminary Discussion of the Art of Modern Fiction made him a celebrity in Beijing cultural circles , and was known as one of the " four beautiful kites launched into China 's broad , lonely skies . " But because the ideas in the book went against the officially promoted doctrine of social realism , and tended towards Western modernism , Gao 's work was suppressed by the communist authorities and he went into exile overseas .  
This independent film festival , which aimed to present the Amis ' own world view , brought together 14 films by four Amis directors and one Japanese director . The organizers attempted to cast off impressions of the aboriginal peoples based on a mishmash of cultural cliches , and also hoped that the festival and its accompanying seminars , concert and gourmet buffet would help city people understand the true " Pangcah . " " Pangcah " is the Amis word for " human being , " and also the term by which the Amis refer to themselves .  
He said that because Amis culture was always transmitted orally , there is no written record of traditional culture . Thus every time he goes to a tribal village to film , it is a race against time . He is very fearful of failing to record tribal elders before they die , thereby losing a precious part of the tribal cultural heritage .  
Of course we are well aware that statesmanship ca n't be learned just from a short series of classes , but we hope that by laying on these courses from our standpoint as a cultural and educational foundation , and not from a party political standpoint , we can make a start by using culture and education to purify people 's hearts . Because in fact a real political leader needs to speak from the heart and express his true hopes .  
The growing number of leadership training activities sponsored by Taiwan NGOs mix personal development with professional skills enhancement , religious training , volunteerism and political reform . These programs can help charismatic leaders who are both politically involved and morally upstanding to become greater forces for good . Amid growing cultural diversity , only a new kind of leader with broader , more holistic values will be able to create frameworks suitable to the new era .  
Though Lang witnessed war and brutality in one of China 's most turbulent and tragic eras , these experiences never effaced the love that the traditional Chinese literati always held for the beautiful landscape . Thus , with a product of Western technology in hand , he embarked on an effort-conditioned by his own cultural learning and by the model of the Chinese landscape painting-to create composite images of different landscapes separated by space and time .  
Over 2,000 years ago the Han Dynasty envoy Zhang Qian ( d . 114 BC ) traveled into the western regions , writing a great page in the history of global cultural interchange . Many important agricultural crops such as grapes , alfalfa and walnuts are reputed to have entered China at that time . 21 centuries later , in our age of highly developed international transport and commerce , the farming , forestry and fisheries industries play the role of modern Zhang Qians , importing countless weird and wonderful fruits , vegetables , birds and beasts .  
Niu Gur began drawing " Uncle Niu the Guerilla Fighter " in 1951 . Finding humor amidst the tragic longing for home of the many mainlanders who fled to Taiwan in 1949 and could not go back , the strip struck a deep chord with the public , and sparked a tremendous response . Subscriptions to the Central Daily News shot upward from a few thousand per month to tens of thousands , and Uncle Niu became a major figure in cultural circles .  
Beijing 's grand scale is truly dumbfounding . The speed of its coming economic growth poses challenges to its water and power supplies , air quality , and natural environment , as well as the well-being of its ancient buildings and cultural artifacts , which date back thousands of years .  
Government policies , the special features of multinational capital , and the political , economic , social , and cultural features of the host country are all important factors in the development of transnational economic cooperation . "  
This cultural symbol of " steady devotion " symbolizes the determination of Kukeng Rural Township to leave behind its image as a disaster-stricken area and to welcome the future with open arms . This determination , in turn , recalls the way this unpromising area-surrounded by water on three sides , with powerful dust storms during the seasonal winds in winter and heavily saline soil-has still managed to produce agricultural products like paddy rice , sugar cane , peanuts , corn , squash , and melon seeds .  
" Huashan lies at the juncture of the Philippine tectonic plate and the Eurasian plate . After serious earthquakes , the crust is loosened and altered , and the topography shows very obvious changes , " says Chiu Tsun-lung , director of the " Lake Bottom Culture Association , " and now a member of the 921 community reconstruction committee . He says that Huashan also has a rich cultural atmosphere . The historic artifacts left behind by pioneers combined with the natural environment provide valuable resources for " mountain education " in Taiwan .  
It may be that cultural activities encourage local productive economic activities to set deeper roots , and have a larger impact on the public . Or it may be a bottom-to-top effect , in which ordinary people raise their cultural refinement , and invest products with a richer image of local culture . Either way , Kukeng Rural Township in Yunlin County is devising a construction strategy that promises a win-win-win outcome for business , culture , and the environment .  
When the participants boarded the ferry and completed the short hop to Xiamen , it constituted the first cultural exchange between Kinmen and the PRC under the newly established " three mini-links . " It was very gratifying to see the artistic occasion carried off without the slightest hint of political overtones .  
Commenting on this phenomenon , mainland Chinese cultural critic Xie Xizhang notes that the residential patterns of old Bei-jing were disrupted by the Cultural Revolution . High-ranking government officials used to live primarily on the east side , and the area had a very cultured air . Rich merchants congregated on the west side , while the south side was the plebian part of town .  
WTO membership will be a blow to many agricultural counties , but in recent years tourist farms have sprouted up . These new operations offer rural residents a new way to make a living by offering visitors a taste of specialty products and unique local cultural attractions . Many novel ideas , like liquor-producing towns , and farming villages specializing in vanilla and other local crops , have appeared .  
With regard to copyrighted imports such as newspapers , magazines , recordings and books , Chao explains that everything that has research value ( whether the copyright is held by an individual or an organization ) can be imported . Books and recordings of a cultural nature can likewise be published in Taiwan , so long as applications are filled and sensitive passages amended . But news-oriented newspapers and magazines from the mainland can not be published or sold here .  
The value of cultural assets lies not in monetary worth , and still less in prices paid , but in the accumulation and passing down to future generations of the fruits of human intellectual and spiritual wisdom .  
In 1972 , UNESCO , considering the damage that war , natural disasters , and industrial development have been doing to precious cultural and natural assets , adopted the " Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage . " This set out rigorous and comprehensive conditions for determining what places are qualified to be deemed World Heritage sites ; it also encouraged signatories to apply to have the assets within their territories that are " of outstanding universal value " included on the World Heritage list .  
Chen Yuh-jean says there is no need for frustration . World Heritage guidelines place special importance on the agreement and cooperation of local residents . " So long as people are enlightened about the real value of the old Mountain Line , " he says , speaking of one of the sites less likely to make the final cut , " and preserve its historical and cultural value and develop only economic activities that are compatible with those values , then ten years from now it may find itself at the top of the list . "  
Individuals all have their own particular cultural background and value system . For that reason , the idea that prospective mates should come from similar economic and social backgrounds is not medieval . Most books on marriage include detailed " compatibility " checklists covering everything from ethnicity to where the two people live , their economic standing and level of education , how they interact with their own families , their respective personalities , interests and health , and what they hope for out of life .  
Based on this premise , any approach which promises to further the substantive objective of Taiwan 's " standing up tall and striding out into the world " - be it holiday diplomacy , economic and trade diplomacy , cultural diplomacy , transit diplomacy , political party-to-party diplomacy or whatever the case and terminology may be-is worth a try .  
Taumi is located about five kilometers southwest of Puli Township , at the entrance to Sun Moon Lake . It borders University Pond , a 400-hectare body of water where lilies grow in abundance . National Chi Nan University is located here , and the town has the appealing nickname of " doctorate village " among folks in Nantou County . In sum , it enjoys an outstanding geographic position and excellent human and cultural resources .  
" Although salaries were very low , the work had a clear objective and someone was looking out for us in our lives . It was like growing up in a warm family , and none of the men who worked together in Lintienshan will ever forget it , " says Chuang Ming-yi , a true second-generation Lintienshaner who was born here , grew up here , currently works in the forestry work station , and is also in charge of the Lintienshan cultural and historical workshop .  
Not long after the founding of the cultural and historical workshop , Chuang Ming-yi 's own mother fell ill with cancer . During the two years of running back and forth between the mountain town and hospitals , Chuang developed a deep understanding of life and death .  
This month 's cover story , " The New Star of the Post-Information Age-Digital Content , " analyzes the digital content industry , which is expected to be one of the next wave of key industries in Taiwan . It is an industry which requires unlimited creativity and rich content to come out on top . We also look at what steps the government is taking to utilize local cultural assets to create business opportunities , to make a knowledge-based contribution to the digital-era Chinese language market .  
In an effort to reduce the gap between rural and urban areas , and to respond concretely to cultural demand in counties and small cities , the Government Information Office ( GIO ) broke with a 26-year tradition and this year moved the Golden Tripod Awards ceremony out of Taipei City for the first time . It was held in Ilan County , where it was able to tap into local cultural characteristics and displayed a definite Lanyang Plain flavor .  
At present , he is living with his son , and though he is as poor as before , at least the cultural foundation that his friends at home and abroad cooperatively established provides him with a monthly stipend of NT $ 50,000 for his living expenses . He still makes it back to Taiwan on occasion , residing in the quiet flat he rents in Tamsui .  
The eastern half is mountains and hills , the western half flat land . The mountain area is mostly planted with fruit trees and dry-field crops , while the plains-an appealing stretch of glossy green stretching as far as the eye can see-are rice paddies . When you also consider its former cultural sites , it is no surprise that Wufeng was always one of the main tourist attractions in central Taiwan .  
The Cultural Bureau of Taichung County last year organized the teachers ' pilgrimage group so as to disseminate understanding of the religious meaning of the pilgrimage and its transforming spiritual power . This year it added groups of volunteers who explained the cultural and historical significance of the festival and recounted their personal experiences with the majesty and power of the tradition .  
My point is that the word " modern " is used in opposition to the classical period in the West . It has arisen as a natural continuation of the trajectory of Western culture . Because Western cultured is the world 's dominant culture , many non-Western cultures have adopted Western concepts regarding modernity while forgetting that our own cultural milieus are not completely the same as that of the West . Modern artists often treat Western ideas as if they were universal in their application , which is very dangerous .  
The bill also stipulates that residents of autonomous areas will enjoy equal rights in participating in political , economic , social , educational and cultural affairs , and are entitled to equal treatment .  
The graves show that the Shihsanhang people buried their dead lying on their side , knees bent . The body was usually positioned with the head to the southwest , perhaps for cultural or religious reasons . Pottery , pearl ornaments , and gold objects accompanied the body in the grave .  
The Nationalist government 's Taiwan policy at that time was to reverse the Japanization of the island , and shortly after the end of the war it banned the use of Japanese . Authors who wrote in Japanese lost their medium , and the Taiwanese people , most of whom were as yet unfamiliar with Mandarin , became effectively illiterate . In short , the policy wrought cultural havoc on Taiwanese society .  
Most people feel that they have to dress up to enjoy art in traditional municipal galleries , and they have to make a special trip to get to them . But railroad art centers are bustling with life and allow people to experience cultural and artistic events in a natural and unplanned way . Art has been confined to museums and temples for too long : let it hop on a train and be carried from station to station around Taiwan !  
Anyone who has traveled to Kyoto is sure to remember the streets and alleyways lined with elegant and well-maintained traditional Japanese-style residences in which people still live . Strolling those streets one feels the spirit of Japanese literature . These spaces are perhaps unsuitable to financial calculations of their worth . But their value in terms of cultural history is something that even greater economic power could not buy .  
The 2003 Asia-Pacific Arts Forum marked another step in cooperation between the Council for Cultural Affairs ( CCA ) and NTUA , following on the 2000 Asia-Pacific Traditional Arts Forum . The Arts Forum , specially coordinated with the CCA 's 2003 " Creative Culture Industry Year , " devoted special attention to culture not only as an end in itself but also as an economic activity . It aimed to encourage discussion about the common problems facing the development of indigenous cultures and cultural industries in the Asia-Pacific region .  
In the eyes of the Japanese colonial authorities , Chiang was Public Enemy No . 1 . Among Taiwanese intellectuals , he was widely recognized as a pioneer . And among ordinary citizens he was revered as a charismatic leader , a guiding force for cultural renaissance and a dedicated opponent of the injustices of the colonial regime .  
However , " although Chiang Wei-shui and others were found guilty in the Social Order and Police Incident , " writes Huang Huang-hsiung in his Chiang biography , " they indirectly benefited from this , because it became a focal point for the political and social movement . " The overreaction and repression by the colonial authorities against these activists-whose petition campaign was moderate and perfectly legal , and whose cultural association restricted itself to educational activities-not only fueled popular resentment , but also hardened the attitudes of activists toward the regime .  
The causes of suicide are complex , have physiological , psychological , social , and cultural implications , and are the result of multiple internal and external factors .  
Rising almost 4000 meters above sea level , Yushan is not only the tallest peak on Taiwan , it is also the source of the three major river systems that provide water for the island , has the most intact ecological system , verdant forests , varied flowers and fauna plus the nearby historical relics of Patungkuan and the rich cultural history of the Aborigines . " It is natural that this area is a topographical symbol of Taiwanese identity , just like Mt . Fuji in Japan or the Alps in Switzerland , " says Professor Tai .  
" Sadly , the average person does n't know very much about this , " laments Nelson Yang . Because in the past mountain climbers or naturalists neglected the history of the opening and development of Taiwan 's mountain areas , people have focused only on the flatlands and shoreline that make up just one fourth of the total land area of the island . They have little knowledge of the length and breadth of the mountains and are unable properly to understand the development of Taiwan 's ethnic and cultural diversity .  
But neglected all along was the Aborigines ' viewpoint and what they had to say , " points out Sun Ta-chuan . He gives an example : developing the water resources of the mountain regions was for the benefit of those downstream , while the Aborigines living upstream were frequently without potable water . When the mountain regions were included in national parks , the Aborigines were forced to leave the area , losing their original living space and sacred territory , and they were cut off from their traditional cultural roots .  
Korea has seized the magic wand of the new economy-the cultural and creative industries-transforming its national image from that of the world 's most diligent and unbending people to that of the liveliest , most innovative and most adept at packaging cultural products .  
In keeping with this view , many scholars have seen the culture industry as a system by which a small number of cultural middlemen who know how to manipulate public tastes feed consumers with a standardized , mass-produced " canned culture " that is artificial and bogus , neither the product of cultural workers ' autonomous creativity , nor capable of representing consumers ' inner yearnings .  
Jan Hung-tze , an expert on trends , writes that Taiwan ought to be better suited than Korea at matching and combining these industries suitable for cultural creativity with the information technology industry ( where Taiwan is already strong ) , creating electronic publishing , the broadcasting and marketing of digital music , and video games .  
Liu Wei-kung , associate professor of sociology at Soochow University , says that rather than debate incessantly about the definition and scope of cultural and creative industries , it would be better to grasp the salient characteristic at their core , which is that content on its own is not enough . It 's extremely important that the product or service creates an appealing story that will pull people in , so as to give people a joyful experience in the process of consumption .  
Wu Se-hwa states that capital for cultural creative industries includes the following : copyrighted music , literature , fine arts and animation ; locations that can serve as the background for creativity , such as historic sites and natural scenery ; creative talent ; and language or customs that reveal the special flavor of an area .  
Chen Chi-nan , a minister without portfolio who is a leading figure in the push for cultural and creative industries , says that from inside to outside there are three key layers to cultural production : at the core are the arts ( the fine arts , theater , music , literature and so forth ) ; the second circle includes advertising design , architecture , the media and so forth ; and the outer circle represents extended services and tourism-this is the most easily commercialized portion .  
What 's more , various kinds of economic assistance , loans and insurance require real estate to be put up as collateral , but for creative and cultural industries , for which creativity and talented personnel represent their true capital , these requirements are entirely inappropriate .  
The " content " of these cultural products has been rich and varied but Taiwan , with its many downstream industries , has been short of something very important in the development of its culture industry-intermediaries who will make the connection to an artistic source , then apply technology so that art is transformed into a commodity of a different kind , and intangible culture can become a tangible industry .  
Wu says that the causes of low creativity and the cultural context are being fixed , but no systematic changes have been made as yet . One encouraging point is that the MOE has included creativity as a core educational ability . Industry , government , and the educational sector , however , have yet to come together . If all of them can move forward together and embrace one another , the circle will get larger and larger .  
We live in an era of aesthetic sensibil-ity . The cultural economy and creative industries hold sway , and aesthetic sensibility has become a key determinant in individual , business , and national achievement .  
Based on these two criteria , the CEPD has compiled a list of 12 critical service industries for future development . These are : financial services ; research and development ; design ; cultural and creative services ; telecommunications and media ; medical , health care and caregiving ; engineering consulting ; information services ; distribution and transportation ; manpower training , manpower services and property management ; tourism , sporting and recreational services ; and environmental protection .  
In an era of strong environmental consciousness , when reports of disasters are frequent , naturally a land-use policy that gives the environment central importance is going to get a generally positive response . But because the government actually promoted mountain agriculture for half a century , now hundreds of thousands of farmers and workers in related industries depend on it for their livelihood , and there is also the question of the cultural and historic needs of Aborigines who call the mountain forests home .  
In order to change this situation , Guangzhou , under the guideline of " sports-based comprehensive development , " adjusted the structural composition and functional orientation of the newly-constructed and remodeled public sports facilities prior to the 9th National Sports Meet in an effort to achieve a multi-purpose integration of athletic , cultural , recreational and entertainment functions for these sports facilities .

We believe that the continuous dialogue between the Secretariat and the Member States should be based on mutual respect , confidence and understanding , and should take into account cultural , political , economic and social realities .  
The second is the formation of the political , economic , social , spiritual and cultural life of the State , without the infamous system - inherited from the past - of roles played out in advance .  
This greatly complicates the future of these countries as they attempt to solve by themselves the difficult economic , political , psychological , cultural and historical problems that they have inherited from the recent past .

It became evident that the association was far more complex than assumed in the past , since it has been established to be contingent upon level of development , social structure and cultural milieu .  
Certain women who are subject to physical or sexual violence by their drugusing partners or parents may none the less feel responsible for caring for their families or may be without alternative means of livelihood for economic , social or cultural reasons .

Thus , a new impetus to foster regional cooperation is needed in order to address adequately the economic , social , cultural and ecological dimensions for a sustainable and systemic development of the ESCWA region .  
Part of the mandate of ESCWA is to act as a warning system to its member States regarding the impact of global political , economic , cultural and technological changes at the national and regional levels .  
To develop a comprehensive United Nations systemwide strategy for the implementation of the right to development and through concerted efforts to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ;  
Promoting the socioeconomic status of disadvantaged ethnic , cultural , occupational or religious groups is also difficult owing to a lack of effective and acceptable means of intervention .  
At the practical level , a multilateral dialogue should be undertaken on issues which all the countries of the region are prepared to take up in the spheres of economic , environmental , cultural and humanitarian cooperation .  
The Special Rapporteur 's claim that heads of cultural associations have been replaced by new heads who are members of the Arab Baath Socialist Party , is mere fabrication , with the obvious political ulterior motive of stirring up sectarian strife .  
The raising of awareness about indigenous peoples must be seen not as the task of a Year but as part of the ongoing and permanent process of education and public information about human rights and the urgent need to protect and strengthen cultural diversity .  
The Governments concerned should therefore set goals for the reversal of that tendency by educating the public to accept cultural , ethnic and religious diversity with a view to promoting communal harmony and understanding .  
Yes , the varied pattern of global cultural evolution may have been successful in the degree of international consensus on democracy as a better political system and free enterprise as a preferable or more effective economic approach .  
However , most countries were composed of distinct ethnic , linguistic , religious and cultural minorities , and it was necessary to balance respect for the rights of minorities and preservation of national unity and territorial integrity .  
The strategies , policies and programmes of States will promote sustainable development and the wellbeing of current and future generations by fostering a better life for human beings in the political , economic , social , cultural and environmental domains .

Concerning the implementation of economic , social and cultural rights at the national level , it was often stated that the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights was too vague to be of operational significance .

Besides , it is insufficiently acknowledged that democracy is merely a species of human rights and that human rights are composed of diverse elements , including those of a cultural , developmental , economic and social nature .  
Since before the 1980s , Central America had begun to suffer the effects of a deep political , economic and social crisis that came about precisely because national societies had developed within a system of limited democracy in particular , because social programmes were not formulated or executed , a doctrine of national security was promoted , political arenas were closed and civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights were violated in one way or another . 
High levels of poverty and unemployment , lack of distributive justice , social unrest arising from ethnic , cultural and minority differences and powerful vested interests that need to be contained remain barriers , and these must be addressed continuously and simultaneously .  
It is the United Nations which , not limiting itself to those classical human rights born of the American and the French revolutions , consecrated the fundamental rights of the second generation and , in particular , economic , social and cultural rights which allowed it to enrich the contribution of liberalism of the century of enlightenment through the contribution of democratic socialism of the nineteenth century .  
The Organization originated in the post-war era with the main objective of consolidating an international order founded on faith in fundamental human rights , the dignity and worth of the human person ; and the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small ; an organization specifically mandated to maintain international peace and security and to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character .  
At the end of the twentieth century and the dawn of a new millennium , in a world characterized by a globalization of the economy and the dynamics of international relations , our reality is conditioned by factors such as the substantial progress of science , the transcendence of the technological revolution , the decisive influence of communications and information , the expansion of trade and the consequences of cultural and religious interaction .  
To attain the objectives of the International Decade of the World 's Indigenous People , Ecuador , a multi-ethnic country , has submitted various concrete programmes and initiatives , in consultation with national indigenous organizations , designed to improve the economic , social and cultural status of those groups while fully respecting their distinctive characteristics .  
Let us suppose , then , that the world of the future will have to be shaped according to regions , or large integrated groups or communities , regional or otherwise , that have a common cultural origin and wish to be identified with the others , because of the particular characteristics of their culture , such as tradition , language , religion and even mixed blood . 
Looking back over the 50 years since the guns of the Second World War fell silent , one notes with satisfaction the valuable work performed by the United Nations as a forum for debate on matters of international concern , and as a centre for harmonizing the activities of States in the economic , social , cultural and humanitarian fields .  
The United Nations has the power to say no to those States and peoples who do not respect the religious , political , moral and artistic convictions of others ; no to those States and peoples who do not respect minorities , be they national or of any other kind , and their languages , which are an essential element of cultural transmission ; no , above all , when repression is accompanied by the use of force and by cruelty , torture and other unspeakable acts .  
Indeed , beyond the simple maintenance of international peace and security , the Organization remarkably distinguished itself in the struggle for decolonization , but , above all , in the establishment of a progressive system of specialized agencies , all of which provide highly valued assistance in the social , economic , humanitarian and cultural fields .  
It must be built upon and strengthened , recognizing always that the human rights whose universality and indivisibility we assert are about economic and social and cultural rights just as much as about the civil and political rights on which the developed countries tend to focus so much attention .  
Moreover , the powerful vitality and steadfast determination which drive peoples to preserve their national traditions and cultural identities demonstrate their will to safeguard from within the inevitable process of international integration something stable and lasting , which links the present of each nation to the roots of its traditions , and the need to affirm the singularity of each society , each nation and each community , and not only of each individual .  
Nonetheless , we are extremely pleased to underscore the admirable example offered to us by the South Africans who , moving beyond racial or cultural motivations , in a long and heroic effort that has caused so much suffering , have put an end to the most odious form of discrimination apartheid .  
But this is not a time for fear or regrets ; it is a time for new endeavours , a time to promote new forms , ways and means of international cooperation , with a view to generating , by cultivating the complementary development of our national individualities , the cultural , economic and human resources that can enable us to be free of poverty and backwardness and to open an ever-broadening road to understanding , tolerance , peace and prosperity as we enter the third millennium .  
My delegation is confident that improved cooperation between developed and developing countries and the consolidation of related agencies and programmes would lead to enhanced prospects for the discovery of solutions to global problems and for the promotion of sustainable economic , social and cultural development .  
Comprising some 200-million ethnically and culturally diverse peoples , the ACS will serve as a vehicle to promote the implementation of policies and programmes designed to harness , utilize and develop the potential of the Caribbean Sea , promote and enhance economic space for trade and investment opportunities , and establish and augment , as appropriate , institutional structures and cooperative arrangements responsive to the various cultural identities within the region .  
The affirmation of human dignity and the universal rights of the individual upheld by the Charter of the United Nations can be achieved only through respect for different ethnic , religious , cultural and political identities , through an efficient system of collective security , and through respect for a law-governed State and international law .  
In fact , many are unprepared to accept that human beings and nations are entitled to move steadily upward on economic , social , political and cultural trajectories which will provide genuine equality . 
They have understood that democratization is a long-term undertaking , one that must be based on the historical , social and cultural realities of a country if it is to be effective and promote political stability , economic development and social justice .  
They point the way to mobilizing all the creativity and energy of youth to build a new community of nations based on mutual understanding , respect for cultural , religious and racial differences , equal rights for men and women , and social and economic well-being for all .  
We recognize the values and the capital that adults have left to us , and we are proud that they have forged a social existence which allows no room for intolerance based on racial , religious or cultural considerations .  
The Revolutionary Youth Movement to which the youth of Syria belong is an organizational framework and an educational forum for young people through which Syria 's youth exercise their its democratic rights , elect their political leaderships , practice their hobbies and defend their interests at all levels : the educational , social , economic , vocational , cultural , touristic , athletic , artistic , informational , ideological , political and technical .  
Consolidating the common features and deepening our understanding of what binds us together , thus expanding the exchange of cultural values between youths of different countries and continents , is a task that is not only feasible , but also essential in order to build of a more harmonious and unified planet for the twenty-first century .  
Firstly , in the cultural and intellectual area , as it constitutes the vision which guides youth in all areas ; secondly , in the aesthetic field , art and literature are the essential pillars of culture ; thirdly , science as the basis of progress in our present generation which is witnessing growing scientific progress ; fourthly , sports and military fields ; fifthly , public social service , and finally , the field of trips and touristic activities and hostels .  
Such a fact underscores the need to respect and to take into consideration the historic religious and cultural characteristics of the peoples of every region when drafting any international document , so that the door may not be left ajar for the introduction of controversial issues after international compromises had been reached on such issues in previous conferences .  
The delegation of Egypt would like to avail itself of this opportunity to stress that whatever the linguistic formulas may be , its concept of the operative content of the paragraphs relating to reproductive and sexual health , especially paragraphs 56 , 57 and 58 , is that their implementation will take place in accordance with the legal system and the cultural and religious heritage of each society .  
To be young and live at the end of the twentieth century is to witness a process of constant change all over the world and , at the same time , to encounter a cruelly competitive cultural , social , economic and political reality .  
None the less , reality has shown that these aspirations have not been met and that , on the contrary , changes in the international system created conditions that have unleashed forces that had long been held in check , giving rise to new conflicts and rivalries , not only as a result of resurgent nationalism but also as a cause of serious ethnic , religious , social and cultural differences which have jeopardized peace and international security . 
There is extraordinary cooperation on the part of States , other political entities and non-governmental organizations in the dozens of areas of substantive concern of the United Nations organs ; in the burgeoning , multidimensional sphere of sustainable development ; in the territory where humane concerns and values , social ordering and cultural norms coalesce ; and in the field of peace-keeping , of providing States and peoples with security from violence and disorder .  
The Islamic Republic of Iran , inspired by the divine teachings of Islam and benefiting from national solidarity and the continued participation and efforts of its people , has endeavoured to develop a society on the basis of the dignity and worth of the human person and respect for human values , a society whose ethos includes fairness and social justice as well as cultural , social and economic development .  
Since the Islamic Republic of Iran firmly believes that the maintenance of peace and security , at the national , regional and international levels alike , is dependent upon economic growth and sustained development , we spend only about 1 per cent of our national budget on defence and devote the rest to overhauling and strengthening our economic , social and cultural infrastructures .  
One of the purposes of the United Nations , as enshrined in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .  
Georgiades ( Cyprus ) : In a world faced with unabated turmoil , the ancient Greek spirit that gave rise to the Olympian ideal of athletic achievement and excellence transcends the cultural and political boundaries that divide human communities .  
We therefore consider it vital to build a future premised on fundamental human rights , and for the realization of this objective we pursue an approach that recognizes the indivisibility of rights and that perceives no difference between civil and political rights , on the one hand , and cultural , social and economic rights , on the other .  
Indeed , 50 years after its founding , and facing the continuing economic and financial crisis that gravely undermines individual and collective development efforts and is a destabilizing factor for young States and for international peace and security , the United Nations is duty-bound to play a more active , indeed a central , role in promoting economic , social and cultural cooperation in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter .  
May this final celebration of the United Nations Year for Tolerance therefore also serve as the occasion on which we call for the redoubling of our efforts to close the apparent divides between us and overcome our momentary differences , our ideological and cultural barriers .  Let all of us therefore continue together , well beyond this special year , to work within the United Nations to instil the spirit of tolerance in the heart of the human community ( SG / SM / 5814 ) .  
Understood as a value which encompasses universal pluralism and a genuine acceptance of cultural diversity , the idea of tolerance represents , first of all , a valuable intellectual and practical framework within which the vitally important norms of a good society and a peaceful world can be developed .  
In our view , the increasing awareness of the need to uphold human rights and fundamental freedoms is closely and organically linked to and essential for the progress of society and the advancement of its members at the economic , political , cultural and social levels .  
National approaches to managing cultural diversity which nurtured the rich culture and linguistic traditions inherent in diverse communities would enhance the competitive position of national economies and increase international peace and security .  
The Charter establishes an important and immediate link between the cooperation necessary in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and the promotion and encouragement of and respect for universal human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .  
Elsewhere in the draft resolution 's operative part , the Secretary-General is requested to continue to deploy his efforts towards strengthening cooperation and coordination between the two organizations and their specialized agencies in order for the two organizations to enhance their capacity to serve their mutual interests in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields .  
The principles enshrined in the declaration , and developed and refined in the course of three ministerial meetings of countries from the zone , have been maintained unchanged : a pacifist spirit that corresponds to the aspirations of the States that compose the zone ; the quest for the best forms of cooperation in the different areas and , in particular , in the scientific , technological , political and cultural spheres ; and a commitment to democracy and the promotion of fundamental human rights .  
The issue has acquired added importance over the past few years due to the fact that the illegal transfer of ownership of cultural property , in particular of archaeological artifacts , has increased dramatically as a result of the unfavourable economic situation in developing countries , and the fall in the exchange rate of the national currencies of those countries against those of a small group of developed , industrialized countries .  
Indeed , it is critical to the preservation of the heritage of all art-rich nations that their cultural properties be preserved in their geographical and natural surroundings and be available for scientific and archaeological studies in their proper context .  
It also reaffirmed support for the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people , including their rights to return , to self-determination , and to establish their independent State on their national soil , with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital ; as well as support for the international programmes for economic , social and cultural development in the occupied territories .  
In this context , we call on the international community to support appropriately the commendable efforts of the Palestinian Authority for economic , social and cultural development in the occupied territories and to consolidate the institutional and socio-economic structures of the emerging Palestinian entity so that it will be able to fulfil its responsibilities in the best possible conditions . 
Recognizing that it is primarily responsible for its own development , and in keeping with commitments entered into under UN-NADAF , Africa has recently become involved in far-reaching and difficult reforms designed to accelerate the process of democratization , promote human rights and achieve economic , social and cultural development , in a climate of transparency and with the active participation of all positive forces .  
Although there may still be many difficulties and challenges along the road ahead , we are confident that , through several generations of hard work , our people will lift China out of economic and cultural backwardness and turn it into a highly prosperous and democratic modern country .  
A common agreement was reached in Copenhagen aimed at creating an economic , political , social , cultural and legal environment , based on democracy , full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , equality between men and women , the elimination of all forms of discrimination , solidarity , transparent and accountable governance and administration , and the encouragement of partnership with free and representative organizations of civil society . 
We have also formulated our laws and our development , economic and social policies on the basis of the principles of equality and justice and the lofty Islamic shariah , in accordance with the current changes in the international environment and in an attempt to achieve our various national objectives in the social , economic , and cultural fields .  
Through these actions it aims to accelerate the implementation of the Nairobi Forward-Looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women and the removal of all obstacles to women 's active participation in all spheres of public and private life through a full and equal share in economic , social , cultural and political decision-making .  
Emphasizing the importance of the integration of documented migrants into the host society , with due respect for their religious and cultural background , and the need to extend to them the same social , economic and legal rights as are enjoyed by citizens , in accordance with national legislation and universally recognized human rights ,  
Recognizing that the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development [ 4 ] / is the sovereign right of every country , in accordance with its national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its peoples and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights ,

Note by the Secretariat on draft decision III , entitled " Contribution of comprehensive national social policies to societal management and to the solving of economic , environmental , demographic , cultural and political problems " , contained in the report of the Commission for Social Development on its thirty-third session ( E / CN . 5 / 1995 / L . 3 ) .

The United States urged China to take further steps to improve the human rights situation in its territory by observing international norms , preserving Tibet 's unique cultural , linguistic and religious heritage and releasing persons jailed solely for expressing political beliefs .  
In the knowledge that sustained economic growth and sustainable development were decisive for the integral realization of human rights , the United Nations should urgently focus on establishing a mechanism to ensure the balanced promotion of civil and political rights , on the one hand , and of economic , social and cultural rights on the other .  
Governments should take active steps to implement programmes to establish and strengthen preventive and curative health facilities , which include women-centred , women-managed , safe and effective reproductive health care and affordable , accessible services , as appropriate , for the responsible planning of family size , in keeping with freedom , dignity and personally held values , taking into account ethical and cultural considerations .

To consider developing and issuing by the year 2000 a strategy of changes necessary to eliminate constitutional , legal , administrative , cultural , behavioural , social and economic obstacles to women 's full participation in sustainable development and in public life ;  
The full and equal , participation of women in political , civil , economic , social and cultural life , at the national , regional and international levels , and the eradication of all forms of discrimination on grounds of sex are priority objectives of the international community .  
Such violations and obstacles include , as well as torture and cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment , summary and arbitrary executions , disappearances , arbitrary detentions , all forms of racism , racial discrimination and apartheid , foreign occupation and alien domination , xenophobia , poverty , hunger and other denials of economic , social and cultural rights , religious intolerance , terrorism , discrimination against women and lack of the rule of law .  
The comprehensive and integrated approach to human rights means that those rights are understood to be universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , which enables all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well as the right to development , to be dealt with on an equal footing and in a fair and even-handed manner .  
The World Conference also called for a concerted effort to be made to ensure the recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels , and suggested a practical approach to the establishment of indicators to measure progress in the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , and the identification of practical ways to overcome obstacles to the implementation of the right to development .

Meanwhile the Greek Cypriots living in the occupied territory ( whose numbers had dropped from 22,000 in 1974 to less than 550 in 1994 ) continued to be the victims of discriminatory measures , harassment and violent acts and to suffer human rights violations ( 1,619 Greek Cypriots had disappeared ) and systematic looting of the cultural heritage of Cyprus .  
In its statement at the International Conference on Population and Development , held in Cairo in 1994 , the Central African Republic commented on the country 's unequal spatial distribution and rapid urban growth , which was difficult to manage and had led to social and cultural crises .  
The Fund will thus actively advocate a holistic approach to empowering women , integrating efforts to improve women 's health , literacy and education , both formal and vocational , with wider efforts to reduce social , legal , cultural and economic disparities based on gender .  
The full and equal participation of women in civil , cultural , economic , political , and social life , at the national , regional and international levels , and the eradication of all forms of discrimination on grounds of sex , are priority objectives of the international community . "  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
The representative stressed that , in order to add a gender dimension to all government policies , the current Government assumed that discrimination against women was not expressed through occasional or partial situations , but rather was systematic and hence required structural and cultural changes .  
It also declared that the full and equal participation of women in civil , cultural , economic , political and social life at the national , regional and international levels , and the eradication of all forms of discrimination on grounds of sex , were priority objectives of the international community .  
In that connection , the Office had submitted to the legislature a preliminary bill on domestic workers designed to protect young women from rural areas who were engaged as domestic servants and who , as a result of deep-rooted cultural discrimination , were denied the minimum social benefits provided under the General Labour Act .  
Her Office 's assessment of the situation was that it was easier to work to have rape classified as a public crime than to try to reverse the burden of proof requirement , which involved going against the entrenched judicial , religious , social and cultural prejudices which came into play whenever such a debate arose in Bolivia .  
Ms . AYKOR , referring to the special temporary measures outlined in paragraph 90 of the report , made the general observation that despite those measures of positive discrimination , the status of individual women continued to be determined by traditional and cultural attitudes .

One form of non-governmental organization follow-up to the Rio de Janeiro Conference has thus been a continuing constructive critique of SARD concepts , emphasizing such elements as democracy , participation , equitable access to resources , local solutions , cultural values , social justice and equity , and ecological agricultural systems often adapted from traditional methods .  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
The successful peaceful transition of South Africa to a democratic and non-racial society with human rights safeguarded by an entrenched Charter of Fundamental Rights has nevertheless left cultural , economic and social inequalities reflecting historical deprivation .  
As indicated elsewhere , there is growing cooperation with non-governmental organizations , building on the role assigned to them in Agenda 21 in relation to activities at the country level , and with centres of excellence and academic institutions , in recognition of the cross-cutting nature of desertification control , involving the social , cultural , economic and physical management of a territory .

Poverty is a multidimensional , complex situation that has economic , educational , social , political , cultural and technological dimensions .

Recognizing also that there is no single political system or single model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples , and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
The new forces of modern science and technology , if harnessed properly and applied in accordance with each country 's particular socio-economic and cultural circumstances , offer immense possibilities for solving many of the complicated problems that are currently impeding economic , social and environmentally sound and sustainable development in the developing countries .

With the institution of SICA , integration is no longer sectoral that is , commercial and economic but comprehensive , meaning that it extends to the economic , social , cultural and political spheres and seeks to promote their harmonious and balanced development .

Such violations and obstacles include , as well as torture and cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment or summary and arbitrary detention , all forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia , denial of economic , social and cultural rights and religious intolerance .  
And , despite the fact that in the past four years it was not seldom that we were the victims of historical prejudices of some policies led on the Balkans , we have proved that we are capable of enduring , as a State and as a people , with authentic national and cultural identity , with deep historical roots and our own contribution to European culture and civilization .

NULLThe process of investigating individual cases takes into account the rights of indigenous peoples as set forth in the Guatemalan Constitution and in international human rights instruments to which Guatemala is a party , particularly the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination , and therefore emphasizes discrimination with respect to cultural , civil and political rights .  
Promotion of effective enjoyment by all people of civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , and access to existing social protection and public services , in particular through encouraging the ratification and ensuring the full implementation of relevant human rights instruments ;  
In the aforesaid resolution , the General Assembly enumerated the High Commissioner 's responsibilities , which basically involve promoting and protecting the effective enjoyment by all of all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .

Access for all to the values , knowledge and skills imparted by the educational system is a prerequisite for ensuring the continuity and stability of democratic institutions , guaranteeing political , economic , social and cultural participation , especially on the part of the most disadvantaged groups and contributing to the fight against poverty .  
The profound socio-economic , scientific , technological and cultural changes which have taken place in the world over the past decade demand educational systems which are capable of developing the skills required in order to cope with these changes and which stimulate creativity and emphasize the new culture of innovation , as well as a clear vision of the future vis - - vis the challenges of the next millennium .

The right to development combines a comprehensive conception of development in its economic , social , cultural and political dimensions and a requirement of whole and entire realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and of the self-determination of peoples .  
It goes beyond the traditional conception of economic , social and cultural development by integrating in it the political dimension , basing it on popular participation and social justice , and focusing it on the human being , who is both its artisan and its chief beneficiary .  
As soon afterwards as 1968 the Proclamation of Tehran drew attention to the danger of this dissociation of human rights by proclaiming that : " Since human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible , the full realization of civil and political rights without the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights is impossible " .  
The Declaration on the Right to Development points out that " All human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ; equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights " .  
Again , by giving a comprehensive definition of development and representing it to be a simultaneously economic , social , cultural and political process , the Declaration on the Right to Development reflects the international community 's will to revise national and international development strategies in the light of the disappointing experience of several United Nations Development Decades .  
The Declaration on the Right to Development proclaims in its article 1 that " the right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized " .

Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education ;  
" Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
Stressing that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Recalling also that , in order to promote development , equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
The General Assembly , Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Bearing in mind also that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
Among other things , the committee is endeavouring to lay down the main principles for reconciling technological progress in these fields with ethical and legal standards , human values , human rights and social , economic and cultural realities .  
Urges all the Afghan parties fully to respect accepted humanitarian rules and act in accordance with all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;  
Take steps to prevent and counteract , through appropriate domestic measures , the financing of terrorists and terrorist organizations , whether such financing is direct or indirect through organizations which also have or claim to have charitable , social or cultural goals , or which are also engaged in unlawful activities such as illicit arms trafficking , drug dealing and racketeering  
The representatives of the broadcasters - both private and public - who attended the event discussed at length the increasing impact television has on decision-making by alerting world attention to international conflicts and threats to peace and security and its potential role in sharpening the focus on other major issues , including economic , social and cultural issues , and in promoting understanding among peoples .  
Thus , if a part of the population of a particular country wanted to change their status , there were three contexts in which this could be achieved : when the constitution established a right to self-determination ; when all the parties concerned agreed to secession ; and when that part of the population was denied the right to participate freely in the conduct of public affairs or if their civil and political as well as economic , social and cultural rights were denied .  
With regard to the fact that the rules on reservations to multilateral treaties had been elaborated with the purpose of reconciling two sets of interests ( the need to ensure the universality of a treaty by maximizing participation by States with diverse cultural , economic and political conditions , and the need to preserve the integrity of the treaty ) , it became evident that universality should not only be numerical but also substantive .  
In our world of interdependency and in the light of the vital need to protect a core of fundamental norms of international law , States can no longer afford to retrench behind traditional notions of sovereignty , concepts of cultural relativism , disparities in national legislation and independence of national courts to plead non-implementation of international obligations , particularly where these are aimed at protection of the individual .  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
During that event , more than 140 leading media figures from around the globe , representing more than 50 countries , had discussed the growing significance of television in the changing contemporary world , the opportunities offered by the current technological revolution in communications , which vastly increased the possibilities of cultural exchange , the role of both private and public broadcasters in providing information on global events and the strengthening of the partnership between the United Nations system and the international media .  
During the Forum , broadcasters from both the public and private sectors had supported the idea of establishing an annual World Television Day , to be celebrated each 21 November by global exchanges of television programmes focusing in particular on such issues as peace and security , economic and social development and the enhancement of cultural exchanges .  
The participants in the forum supported the idea of establishing an annual World Television Day , to be celebrated each 21 November , which would be marked by global exchanges of television programmes , focusing particularly on such issues as peace and security , economic and social development , and the enhancement of cultural exchange .  
[ Urged ] [ ( iv ) Urging ] Governments to promote digital mapping ( using geographical information systems ( GIS ) and global positioning systems ( GPS ) combined with social mapping for establishing forest holdings and values ; assisting planning and management partnerships ; and assisting in the [ location of cultural and ] [ storage of ] geographical information required to support [ sustainable forest management schemes ; ] [ the management , protection and use of TFRK ] ;  
Much attention is still given to timber and forest cover , whereas other goods and services provided by forests such as fuelwood , [ the sustainable use , conservation and equitable sharing of benefits of ] biological diversity , soil and water conservation protection functions , carbon sequestration and other social , cultural and economic aspects are rarely covered and will need more attention .  
These should fully recognize the ecological , social , cultural and [ religious ] [ spiritual ] values of forests [ and pay particular attention to global dimensions of climate change and the sustainable use , conservation and equitable sharing of the benefits of biological diversity . ]  
A comprehensive approach to education for human rights , including civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights and recognizing the indivisibility and interdependence of all rights , as defined by the United Nations , shall be adopted for all activities under the Decade .  
In order to enhance their effectiveness , human rights education efforts for the Decade shall be shaped in such a way as to be relevant to the daily lives of learners , and shall seek to engage learners in a dialogue about the ways and means of transforming human rights from the expression of abstract norms to the reality of their social , economic , cultural and political conditions .  
In recognition of the interdependence and mutually reinforcing nature of democracy , development and human rights , human rights education under the Decade shall seek to further effective democratic participation in the political , economic , social and cultural spheres , and shall be utilized as a means of promoting economic and social progress and people-centred sustainable development .  
Educational materials developed at the international and regional levels should benefit from the review and input of national focal points and national resource and training centres and should be made available to national and local programmes for translation , cultural adaptation , testing and revision , with the financial and technical assistance of international and regional programmes .  
Acknowledges the contribution of Secretary-General Dr .  Boutros Boutros-Ghali to international peace , security and development , his exceptional efforts to solve international problems in economic , social and cultural fields , as well as his endeavours to meet humanitarian needs and to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ;

Acknowledges the contribution of Secretary-General Dr .  Boutros Boutros-Ghali to international peace , security and development , his exceptional efforts to solve international problems in economic , social and cultural fields , as well as his endeavours to meet humanitarian needs and to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ;  
These actors include international and regional intergovernmental organizations ; individual States ; parliamentarians ; non-governmental organizations from the local to the global levels ; and private actors such as legal professionals , the media , academics , private institutions and civic associations , including ethnic , cultural and religious groups .  
While differences in the economic , social , cultural and historical circumstances of the world 's societies mean that differences will continue between democracy as viewed by one society and democracy as viewed by another , democracy is increasingly being recognized as a response to a wide range of human concerns and as essential to the protection of human rights .  
The reality is that no State can long remain just or free , and thus also have the potential to pursue a successful and sustainable development strategy , if its citizens are prohibited from participating actively and substantially in its political processes and economic , social and cultural development .  
8 December 1988 , reaffirming that the will of the people , expressed in periodic and genuine elections , shall be the basis of authority of government , the General Assembly stressed that , " as a matter of practical experience , the right of everyone to take part in the government of his or her country is a crucial factor in the effective enjoyment of a wide range of other human rights and fundamental freedoms , embracing political , economic , social , and cultural rights " . 
Legal , economic , political or cultural barriers that prevent the exercise of equal rights should be identified and removed through comprehensive policy reforms and strong affirmative action ;  
In resolution 1996 / 75 , the Commission , concerned at the situation of women and children , especially regarding access to basic education for girl children and access by women to employment , called upon all parties in Afghanistan to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and also called upon the Afghan authorities to ensure the effective participation of women in the social , economic , political and cultural life throughout the country and to ensure equal treatment to women and girls .  
He stated that the relegation of women to a domestic role , attributable to cultural factors , their lack of political involvement , the reduced pay they received when on maternity leave , the violence within the family that affected two out of every three women , the discrimination practised by families in respect of education and the sexual attacks by soldiers and policemen already reported in 1994 , continued unabated in 1995 .  
Acknowledges the contribution of Secretary-General Dr .  Boutros Boutros-Ghali to international peace , security and development , his exceptional efforts to solve international problems in economic , social and cultural fields , as well as his endeavours to meet humanitarian needs and to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ;  
The Constitution of the Republic of Croatia pays special attention to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms by devoting its whole chapter 3 entitled Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms to the elaboration of different human rights standards including both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights , mainly following the standards elaborated in major international human rights instruments .  
In Cuba , freedoms and fundamental political , economic , social and cultural rights are established by the Constitution , as is equality of rights , and they are all provided for in the main legal texts in force .  
These include the articulation of clear development goals , strategies and priorities that are nationally prescribed and supported , where necessary , by external partners ; effective performance of functions through a well-trained human resource base ; competent organizations and management to effectively utilize and retain skilled people ; a policy and institutional environment that can facilitate the performance and accountability of the public sector and other national institutions ; and sensitivity to the overall social , economic and cultural environment in which capacity development is to take place .  
In accordance with the Charter of the United Nations , the Organization aims at the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principles of sovereign equality of all its Members , equal rights and self - determination of peoples and at achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character .  
This partnership will be built on an integrated and holistic approach to human rights , in the framework of which all rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social , including the right to development , are perceived as of equal importance , interrelated and mutually supportive .  
It recognized that the Declaration on the Right to Development constituted an integral link between the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action through its elaboration of a holistic vision integrating economic , social and cultural rights with civil and political rights .  
At its fifty-third session , the Commission adopted resolution 1997 / 17 , entitled " Question of the realization in all countries of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , and study of special problems which the developing countries face in their efforts to achieve these human rights " .  
The agreement expands cooperation to new fields , such as preventive diplomacy , the maintenance and consolidation of peace and , pursuant to paragraph 4 of resolution 50 / 3 , all subjects of common interest in the political , economic , social , scientific and cultural fields .  
The General Assembly would express its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his continued efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations of the United Nations system and the OIC and its subsidiary organs and specialized and affiliated institutions to serve the mutual interests of the two Organizations in the political , economic , social and cultural fields ; and would express the hope that the Secretary-General will continue to strengthen the mechanisms of coordination between the two Organizations .  
The task of developing a culture of peace would require comprehensive educational , cultural , social and civic action based on a commonality of interest and shared goals .  
The region \ x { e5b8 } constant focus on democracy , good governance , peace , security and nuclear disarmament ; its undertaking to take responsibility for the proper and responsible management of the environment ; the protection of fish and other marine resources ; cultural and technology exchanges ; and economic cooperation and respect for human rights all stand to prove that the zone is successfully dealing with a changing global environment .  
And from them emerged two key principles of considerable importance : a reaffirmation that international assistance for democratization and reform needs to be tailored to fit into the broader political , cultural and social circumstances of each country , and that good governance is effective , participatory , transparent , accountable and equitable , and promotes the rule of law .  
In keeping with this view , the Kingdom of Swaziland believes that democracy is not a model to be copied but a goal to be attained , and the pace at which it can proceed is dependent on a variety of political , economic , social and cultural factors proper to the circumstances of a particular culture and society .  
Mongolia agrees with the conclusion that democracy is not a model to be copied or imposed , but rather a goal to be attained , and that the pace at which democratization can proceed is dependent on a variety of political , economic , social and cultural factors proper to the circumstances of a particular culture or society .  
Taking full advantage of historical affinities , cultural ties and religious bonds and sparing no effort to utilize in an efficient and coordinated manner the human and natural potential and resources of the region constitute the single best long-term guarantee of security and tranquillity .  
For all those reasons , and with a view to preserving the religious , cultural and historical character of Jerusalem , the Government of Jordan continues to maintain , restore and protect the Holy Places , now under the yoke of occupation , and to provide the necessary support for the relevant officials , with a view to protecting those places from all dangers pending the final solution to which we look forward .  
The participating States reached agreements concerning their future actions in various fields of regional cooperation , such as political cooperation ; stability and development of good-neighbourly relations ; economic cooperation in fields of mutual interest ; joint actions for environmental protection ; promotion of humanitarian , social and cultural cooperation ; cooperation in law enforcement , justice and combating organized crime , terrorism , drugs and arms trafficking .  
Recalling General Assembly resolution 50 / 123 of 20 December 1995 in which the Assembly , inter alia , recognized the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
UNHCR notes that involvement of local rather than international non-governmental organizations is likely to provide a closer link with the private sector at the country level and with institutions of civil society , such as voluntary agencies , human rights groups , cultural and academic associations , churches and other religious bodies , and refugee community groups .  
Bearing in mind also that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
In implementing the Guidelines , it should be borne in mind that achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all , is one of the principal objectives of the United Nations .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , States have the duty , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all universally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms , in accordance with international human rights standards .  
HIV / AIDS demonstrates the indivisibility of human rights since the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , as well as civil and political rights , is essential to an effective response .  
The rich variety of geographical , ethnic , cultural and linguistic origins within the staff of the Commission has served , as I intended , to centre and balance the work of the secretariat to meet the required high standards of independence , effectiveness and impartiality , which are expected from a United Nations operation .  
Whereas , at the national level , recognition of the identity of indigenous peoples is of fundamental importance for building national unity based on respect for and the exercise of the political , cultural , economic and spiritual rights of all Guatemalans , as well as on the fulfilment of their duties ,  
One year after D + 60 , beneficiaries of both procedures shall become eligible for longer-term services provided by the Government , including financial , technical , legal and employment assistance and assistance in the areas of education , training and production projects with a view to ensuring their lasting integration into the economic , social and cultural life of the country , on the same terms as the rest of the Guatemalan population .  
Each of the High Contracting Parties guarantees to nationals of the other Parties resident in its territory , regardless of their ethnic affiliation , religion or other differences , social , economic and cultural rights and freedoms in accordance with universally accepted international human rights standards .  
A working group or other mechanism should be set up to examine the imbalance in decision-making powers between developed and developing countries and between major and smaller nations in decision-making in global issues ( political , economic and social and cultural ) and institutions , such as the Bretton Woods institutions , the World Trade Organization , the Security Council and other United Nations bodies . 
The Commission on Human Rights , in its resolution 1993 / 14 , requested the Secretary _ General to prepare basic policy guidelines on structural adjustment and economic , social and cultural rights which could serve as a basis for a continued dialogue between human rights bodies and the international financial institutions .  
The reports of Danilo T \ x { e16c } k , Special Rapporteur of the Sub _ Commission on the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , especially the final report ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1992 / 16 ) , contain a wide _ ranging analysis of how structural adjustment programmes have had negative effects on a range of human rights .  
And as the proportion of those over age 60 changes from approximately 1 in 14 to 1 in 4 ( sooner in developed countries but faster in developing countries ) , the interrelationship of ageing and development will become evident in economic , social , political and cultural areas . 
The representative made clear that Venezuela , as well as the rest of Latin America , was experiencing social , political , economic and cultural transformations that were having a tremendous impact on society , particularly on women , who had seen their incomes and traditional sources of support reduced and their responsibilities expanded .  
In other cases , the existing policies and priorities of the agencies emphasized the social , economic , environmental and cultural dimensions underlying sustainable development to a sufficient extent so that new structures were not felt to be necessary .  
Affirmation of the economic , social , environmental and cultural principles inherent in the concept of sustainable development would be enhanced by more systematic consideration of the follow-up to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and related major United Nations conferences .  
Provisional Order No . 4 / 1994 ( Miscellaneous Amendment of the Organization of Voluntary Work _ Societies Registration Act of 1957 and the Organization of Foreign Non _ Governmental Voluntary Work in the Sudan Act of 1988 ) , signed by the President of the Republic , defines a society as a voluntary organization of thirty or more persons established to carry out voluntary work of [ a ] social , scientific , educational , research , cultural and religious purpose ( art .  2.1 . a . 2 ) .  
According to article 2.2.2 , a voluntary organization means any foreign voluntary organization whose purpose is to carry out work the nature of which is social , scientific , educational , research based , cultural , technical or religious and which is registered under this Act .  
This ensures that the principles embodied in international labour standards are taken into account in the work of other organizations dealing with issues of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , racial and sex discrimination , the rights of ethnic minorities and the rights of children , inter alia .  
Furthermore , the Assembly called upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action .  
The Plan includes clear objectives , target audience ( organized and unorganized elements of society ) , strategies ( trainers training , organization of networks , integration of human rights in all educational curricula , utilization of village-level officials to reach out to the community level , promotional campaigns including artistic and cultural activities , development of monitoring and evaluation systems , etc . ) and programmes , including the creation of a human rights training , documentation and research centre ( the Human Rights Academy ) .  
The Office 's special programmes and projects shall consist of specialized activities concerning , inter alia , displaced persons , the rights of women , the rights of children and adolescents , the penal and prison systems , indigenous communities , disabled persons and other sectors in need of special protection .  22 .  The representative of the National Observatory for Human Rights of Algeria advised that the Observatory was based on the principle of institutional and cultural pluralism .  
Space telecommunications , which are the primary field of commercial applications of space , involve major economic , political , cultural , strategic and industrial stakes .  
Indian society is marked by a rigid hierarchical social stratification which divides the country into two nations : the one comprising the majority , who are poor , uneducated and illiterate , particularly in rural areas , and the other , consisting of the minority which holds the reins of power and forms the economic , social and cultural \ x { 5e68 } ite .  
However , the economic and cultural poverty of the most disadvantaged is a fertile breeding _ ground for the development of religious extremism and , more generally , for the political exploitation of religion ; this is evidenced by the conflicts in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab , the destruction of Babri Masjid and the intercommunal riots in Bombay .  
Recalling General Assembly resolution 50 / 123 of 20 December 1995 in which the Assembly , inter alia , recognized the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
Reaffirming the objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations of achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
Stressing that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Recalling also that , in order to promote development , equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
While recognizing the efforts undertaken by the authorities in the education system , the Committee is concerned about the persisting disparities in relation to the low access to education of children living in rural areas , indigenous children and refugee children , who do not enjoy a system of education adequate to their cultural values and identity .  
The future is contingent on global economic developments as well as on local and national social , cultural , political and economic initiatives .  
While some delegations noted that there was a need to update the report of the Secretary-General containing a preliminary set of basic policy guidelines on structural adjustment programmes and economic , social and cultural rights ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1995 / 10 ) , a number of other delegations considered that it was a valuable and useful document .  
The working group initially identified the principles that might be the relevant and maybe subject of future discussion , with a view to establishing a clear linkage between these principles and structural adjustment programmes as they impinged on economic , social and cultural rights .  
That was how the transitional institutional order was established ; its main purpose is to indicate the way to the Third Republic by creating attitudes consistent with the democratic imperative of a State governed by rule of law , by instituting major political , economic , social , legal and cultural reforms with a view to creating an environment conducive to the establishment of a democratic State governed by the rule of law and by holding free , transparent and democratic elections from which no one would be excluded .  
The development of future large water-supply systems must adopt pricing that reflects all external costs , including waterlogging ; salinization ; habitat alteration ; impact on endangered species ; long-term deterioration of water quality due to changing land-use practices in catchment areas ; cultural and social dislocation ; and the cost of imposed risks .  
Holders of TFRK will need to be represented by their own representatives ; to feel secure in their land tenure arrangements ; to be reassured that they have been accorded status equal to that of the other members of the agreements ; and to be convinced of a common purpose compatible with their cultural and ecological values .  
Much attention is still given to timber and forest cover , whereas other goods and services provided by forests , such as fuelwood , the sustainable use and conservation and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits of biological diversity , soil and water protection functions , and carbon sequestration and sinks , as well as other social , cultural and economic aspects , are rarely covered and need to be considered .  
There is a need for a broad spectrum of quantitative , qualitative and descriptive indicators covering social , cultural , economic , ecological , institutional , legal and policy elements , including land tenure .  
The Panel agreed that in order to achieve the management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests it is necessary to deal coherently with all the interrelated social , cultural , economic , trade , environment , development , production , financial and technology issues that have a concrete impact on those objectives .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the fall of apartheid and despite continuing efforts to combat these phenomena , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of racially motivated violence , persist and are even growing in magnitude , adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination , inter alia against Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , negrophobia , anti _ Semitism and related intolerance continue to persist and even to grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Noting with regret the negative effects of the structural adjustment and reform policies conceived and imposed by the international financial organizations and bilateral creditors on the debtor countries to deal with the effects of the foreign debt , on the enjoyment and realization of economic , social and cultural rights , especially among the most vulnerable and low _ income groups ,  
Recalling that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his civil and political rights ,  
Recalling also that the eradication of widespread poverty , including its most persistent forms , and the full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights and civil and political rights remain interrelated goals ,  
Deeply concerned by the fact that extreme poverty continues to spread throughout the countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social or cultural situation , and gravely affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Aware that equitable access to and efficient use of the Geostationary Satellite Orbit / radio frequency spectrum resources for all States or groups of States , taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries , is of fundamental importance to the development of telecommunications infrastructure for economic , social and cultural development of all States ,  
Mindful that in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action ( A / CONF . 157 / 23 ) the World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , reaffirmed that the human person was the central subject of development and underlined the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,  
Request the Chairman of the Commission , when appointing special rapporteurs , to continue to consult closely with regional groups and ensure that the appointee is of recognized standing in the field of human rights , has an overall knowledge of political , social and legal systems , is sensitive to different cultural , religious and ethnic particularities , and will accordingly implement his mandate independently , impartially and objectively ;  
Noting that the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights has highlighted the imbalance in the special rapporteur system by referring to the fact that although there are a large number of thematic and related mechanisms dealing with different aspects of civil and political rights , there is none dealing solely with the economic , social and cultural rights recognized in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , despite the recognized interdependence , indivisibility and interrelationship of the two sets of rights ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Concerned that the international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected and that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights ,  
Aware that equitable access to and efficient use of the geostationary satellite orbit / radio frequency spectrum resources for all States or groups of States , taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries , is of fundamental importance to the development of telecommunications infrastructure for economic , social and cultural development of all States ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination , inter alia , against Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , negrophobia , anti _ Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Emphasizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated ; the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis ; while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
Urges all States to eliminate all obstacles to development at all levels by pursuing the promotion and protection of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights and by implementing comprehensive development programmes at the national level , integrating these rights into development activities , and by promoting effective international cooperation ;  
At its fortieth session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1988 / 33 , decided to entrust Mr . Danilo T \ x { e16c } k with a study of problems , policies and progressive measures relating to the more effective realization of economic , social and cultural rights , and recommended that the Special Rapporteur should take account of the guidelines and issues contained in resolution 1987 / 29 A of the Sub-Commission .  
At its forty-fourth session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1992 / 29 , expressed its deep appreciation to the Special Rapporteur , Mr . Danilo T \ x { e16c } k , for his final report on the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , endorsed the recommendations contained in paragraphs 202 to 246 of that report and requested the Secretary-General to ensure the widest possible distribution of the reports of the Special Rapporteur .  
At its forty-eighth session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1996 / 24 , welcomed with satisfaction the second interim report on the question of the impunity of perpetrators of violations of human rights ( economic , social and cultural rights ) prepared by Mr . El Hadji Guiss ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1996 / 15 ) , and requested the Special Rapporteur to submit his final report to the Sub-Commission at its forty-ninth session .  
At its forty-fifth session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1993 / 40 , decided to entrust Mr . Asbj \ x { 9de8 } n Eide with the task of producing a preparatory document on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights , and income distribution , at both national and international levels , taking also into account matters related to the realization of the right to development , with a view to determining how most effectively to strengthen activities in this field .  
At its forty-eighth session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1996 / 26 , welcomed the provisional report on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights , and income distribution , prepared by the Special Rapporteur , Mr . Jos Bengoa , ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1996 / 14 ) , and requested the Special Rapporteur to submit his final report to the Sub _ Commission at its forty _ ninth session .  
In its decision 1996 / 117 , the Sub _ Commission decided to request Mr . Osman El _ Hajj to prepare , without financial implications , an expanded working paper on ways and means of promoting democracy , how democracy can ensure economic , social , cultural and political rights and how to overcome obstacles to democracy , and to present the expanded working paper to the Sub _ Commission at its forty _ ninth session .  
They have done so in the context of the urgent need for understanding by non-indigenous societies of the spiritual , social , cultural , economic and political significance of lands , territories and resources to the continued survival and vitality of indigenous societies .  
In summary , each of these examples underscores a number of elements that are unique to indigenous peoples : ( 1 ) a profound relationship between indigenous peoples and their lands , territories and resources exists ; ( 2 ) that this relationship has various social , cultural , spiritual , economic and political dimensions and responsibilities ; ( 3 ) that the collective dimension of this relationship is significant ; and ( 4 ) that the inter-generational aspect of such a relationship is also crucial to indigenous peoples identity , survival and cultural viability .  
At present , it is safe to say that the use of judicial mechanisms may be risky due to the problem of different interpretive tools , the subjective and highly political nature of these State _ chartered forums , and continuing cultural biases demonstrated by Governments .  
The ethnic factor , in conjunction with other political , economic , historical and cultural factors , is eating away at the fragile political ties in Africa , with the harrowing consequences of confrontation _ whose main victims are civilian populations _ and a resurgence of the crime of genocide .  
Thus , both international war and internal armed conflicts , just as states of tension or domestic disturbances caused by political , economic , social or cultural factors , when accompanied by clashes , acts of violence , vandalism , inter _ ethnic confrontations , terrorist attacks , etc . and provided they represent an actual or at any rate imminent threat to the community as a whole , constitute a public danger or public emergency in the meaning conferred on those terms by the international instruments referred to above .  
It is against this background of societies repeatedly traumatized by economic , social , cultural and other factors that such extreme situations develop , in which the breakdown of the institutional order opens the floodgates to widespread violence and massacres of the civilian population , frequently leading in the end to actual genocide .  
After welcoming the preliminary report on the impunity of perpetrators of human rights violations ( economic , social and cultural rights ) ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1994 / 11 and Corr . 1 ) , the Sub _ Commission decided ( resolution 1994 / 34 ) to split the study in two , entrusting Mr . Joinet with the aspect of civil and political rights and Mr . El Hadji Guiss with that of economic , social and cultural rights .  
But there seems to be an obvious causal connection between the denial , or erosion , of economic , social and cultural rights , and conditions leading to subtle and cumulative transfers of populations .  
The human rights system has the legal obligation to observe the economic system and to signal the greater or lesser impact it is having in meeting the needs of individual human beings and on their enjoyment of essential civil , economic , social , political and cultural rights .  
In this spirit , the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , deeply alarmed at the widening gap between the rich and the poor , adopted resolution 1993 / 40 in which it entrusted Mr . A . Eide with the task of producing a preparatory document on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights , and income distribution , at both national and international levels .  
In the preliminary report ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1995 / 14 ) to the Sub-Commission , the Special Rapporteur underlined that income distribution , both internationally and nationally , was the principal indicator of social integration and of the fulfilment of minimum requirements in respect of economic , social and cultural rights , enabling human beings to live in society . 
It was asserted that greater communication between societies would bring growing homogenization of accepted and acceptable " standards " and levels of realization of human rights in general and of economic , social and cultural rights in particular .  
The final objective of the report is to signal the challenges to the human rights system posed by the process of globalization , especially in the field of economic , social and cultural rights .  
A framework is thus taking shape of " permanent and persistent violations " of the economic , social and cultural rights of a substantial and increasing majority of the world 's population , threatening the solidarity of international humanitarian principles and human rights .  
Reaffirming that development is a comprehensive economic , social , cultural and political progress , which aims at the constant improvement of the well-being of the entire population and of all individuals on the basis of their active , free and meaningful participation in development and in the fair distribution of benefits resulting therefrom ,  
Under the wise leadership of the great leader , the people in the northern half of our Republic vigorously accelerated the three revolutions , ideological , technical and cultural , holding high the banner of the Juche idea , and thus cemented rock-firm our revolutionary base , a decisive guarantee of national reunification .  
The right to development was one of the most important human rights , transcending both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights and standing at the nexus formed by democracy , development and respect for human rights .  
Also appeals to the international community to provide its material , technical and financial support to the non _ governmental organizations and to the groups that are working with dedication to achieve the total elimination of this cultural practice that is harmful for girl children and women ;  
Even in situations where it may be necessary to impose limitations on such a right , full compliance with article 4 of the Covenant is required so that any limitations imposed must be determined by law only insofar as this may be compatible with the nature of these [ i.e . economic , social and cultural ] rights and solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society .  
A reign of terror has been let loose , characterized by extrajudicial executions , indiscriminate killings , random and mass arrests for political reasons , forced relocation of the population , gang rapes of women and systematic efforts to obliterate the ethnic , social and cultural identity of the Kashmiri people .  
Also appeals to the international community to provide its material , technical and financial support to the non _ governmental organizations and to the groups that are working with dedication to achieve the total elimination of this cultural practice that is harmful for girl children and women ;  
Mindful that in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action ( A / CONF . 157 / 23 ) the World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , reaffirmed that the human person was the central subject of development and underlined the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,  
Recognizing the profound spiritual , cultural , social and economic relationship that indigenous peoples have to their total environment and the urgent need to respect and recognize the rights of indigenous peoples to their lands , territories and resources ,  
Recognizing that United Nations organs and Member States have increasingly acknowledged that lands and natural resources are essential to the Economic and cultural survival of indigenous peoples , and that some States have enacted legal measures that uphold indigenous land rights or have established procedures for arriving at legally binding agreements on indigenous land _ related issues ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without discrimination as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the Purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Expressing its serious concern that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected , that human rights , in particular those of vulnerable groups in society , continue to be violated in many parts of the world and that millions of people still suffer misery , live in poverty and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ,  
Expressing its serious concern that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected , that human rights , in particular those of vulnerable groups in society , continue to be violated in many parts of the world and that millions of people still suffer misery , live in poverty and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ,  
It is hypocritical that the Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations should level false accusations against the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus on the subject of protection of cultural heritage , when it is a well-known fact that Greece itself is engaged in a policy of forcible assimilation of the Turkish minority in western Thrace , coupled with systematic pillaging and obliteration of Turkish monuments .  
With regard to legislation , while noting with satisfaction the legal and legislative arrangements developed and implemented for the protection of land and sacred sites , including religious objects , and for the return of the religious and cultural heritage , the Special Rapporteur recommends ensuring uniformity of such legislation at the Federal and State levels , as well as its effectiveness in relation to its assigned objective , particularly by identifying and remedying shortcomings and loopholes .  
Legacies to future generations are a collective responsibility of todays citizens be this the legacy of natural capital ( the environment ) , physical capital ( infrastructure , plant and equipment ) , financial capital ( savings ) , social capital ( institutions and structures ) and cultural capital ( the values , principles and concepts that are handed down ) . 
Also invites States to develop comprehensive strategies at the national , regional and local levels to meet the increase in demand for care and support for older persons as individuals , within their families and communities , and within institutions , bearing in mind the changing socio-economic , technological and cultural environment ;  
Essentially a product of deep social and economic underdevelopment , crises in that part of the world are aggravated by ethnic , cultural and religious factors , all deeply rooted in history .  
That Constitution included clear provisions concerning collective land ownership , the management of natural resources , recognition of indigenous forms of government and administration , protection of the identity and cultural heritage of the indigenous peoples , the official status of the languages and dialects they used and the creation of special electoral districts ensuring their representation in Congress .  
Equal attention was being paid to the renaissance and free development of the Ukrainian nation and to the promotion and protection of the spiritual and cultural heritage of other ethnic , linguistic and religious groups living in Ukraine .  
The ties between the Russian Federation and Egypt that are developing in the economic , cultural , humanitarian and other spheres are based on mutual respect for the specific national and cultural characteristics of the two peoples and their traditions of friendship .  
The dialogue could build on the work of the High-Level Advisory Board on Sustainable Development , which in 1996 considered how new information technologies that were broadly accessible could contribute to sustainable development by promoting economic growth , improving access to information and promoting civil society . 11 The new technologies , and related institutional changes such as privatization , offer opportunities to extend services to previously unserved communities and to promote broader participation in development , but may also have economic , social and cultural risks . 
The Programme shall be implemented in particular but not exclusively , in the following fields : political , legal , administrative , internal affairs , economic , social , cultural , educational , reconstruction and return and the media .  
As the economic basis of security , all countries and regions should , on the basis of equality and mutual benefit , promote trade , economic and technological cooperation and scientific and cultural exchanges among themselves , with a view to narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor and achieving common prosperity and development .  
Further , the Assembly called upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action .  
These include the articulation of clear development goals , strategies and priorities that are nationally prescribed and supported , where necessary , by external partners ; effective performance of functions through a well-trained human resource base ; competent organizations and management effectively to utilize and retain skilled people ; a policy and institutional environment that can facilitate the performance and accountability of the public sector and other national institutions ; and sensitivity to the overall social , economic and cultural environment in which capacity development is to take place .  
In accordance with the Charter of the United Nations , the Organization aims at the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations , based on respect for the principles of sovereign equality of all its Members , equal rights and self-determination of peoples , and at achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character .  
To recognize the ethnic and cultural existence of Argentine indigenous peoples ; to guarantee respect for identity and the right to bilingual and cross-cultural education ; to recognize the legal personality of indigenous communities and community ownership of the land they traditionally occupy ; to establish regulations for the handing over of other land that is suitable and sufficient for human development , none such land being inalienable , transmissible or subject to taxes or charges ; and to guarantee their participation in the management of their natural resources and other matters of interest to them .  
An important medium of education and the heightening of awareness has been the " New Home , New Life " radio series developed by Mr . John Butt of the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) , which incorporates cultural , social , economic , human rights , peace , health , conflict resolution , mine awareness and other issues of vital daily importance for the population of Afghanistan .  
The Special Representative seeks to influence relevant actors within the international community , governmental or non-governmental , to support developments in Cambodia that would promote civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
There was a general atmosphere of insecurity , in which the population suffered from the arbitrariness and brazen arrogance of the Zairian armed forces ; an inefficient judiciary ; severe repression of freedom of expression and opinion , although within the margin of freedom tolerated since the National Sovereign Conference ; systematic torture and deplorable prison conditions ; and the absence of measures to ensure economic , social and cultural rights .  
The Ministers also agreed to continue negotiations for the speedy signing of a trade agreement , an agreement on cultural and scientific cooperation , a protocol on the equivalence of educational qualifications and levels , an agreement on cooperation in the area of tourism , and an agreement on cooperation in physical culture and sports , and to draft an agreement on cooperation to combat illegal trafficking in drugs and other psychotropic substances .  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development , which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and which take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security , and their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen economic , social , cultural and environmental cooperation in the region ,  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
Deeply concerned about discrimination against the girl child and the violation of the rights of the girl child , which often result in less access for girls to education , nutrition , physical and mental health care and to girls enjoying fewer rights , opportunities and benefits of childhood and adolescence than boys and often being subjected to various forms of cultural , social , sexual and economic exploitation and to violence and harmful practices such as incest , early marriage , female infanticide , prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation ,  
The approach goes beyond existing formal institutional frameworks to encompass substantive and informal aspects related to the real structures and ethical and cultural traits that underlie political behaviour .  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Expresses its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his continued efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations of the United Nations system and the Organization of the Islamic Conference and its subsidiary organs and specialized and affiliated institutions to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social and cultural fields , and expresses the hope that he will continue to strengthen the mechanisms of coordination between the two organizations ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in order to enhance their capacity to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields ;  
Deeply concerned that despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , continue to persist and even grown in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
While significance of national and regional characteristics and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security , and their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen economic , social , cultural and environmental cooperation in the region ,  
Stresses its solidarity with people living in poverty in all countries , and reaffirms that the satisfaction of basic human needs is an essential element of poverty eradication , those needs being closely interrelated and comprising nutrition , health , water and sanitation , education , employment , housing and equal opportunities for participation in political , economic , cultural and social life ;  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the Office of the High Commissioner , in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security , and their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen economic , social , cultural and environmental cooperation in the region ,  
Deeply concerned about discrimination against the girl child and the violation of the rights of the girl child , which often result in less access for girls to education , nutrition , physical and mental health care and to girls enjoying fewer rights , opportunities and benefits of childhood and adolescence than boys and often being subjected to various forms of cultural , social , sexual and economic exploitation and to violence and harmful practices such as incest , early marriage , female infanticide , prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation ,  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Further recalling that in order to promote development equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
Stressing the importance of the new programme for the sustainable development of Central America and the setting of national and regional priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural and environmental spheres and in the areas of public security and regional integration ,  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
Social , religious and cultural networks can help to represent the specific economic interests of all the different groups in the community , particularly excluded groups ; to ensure that policies reflect the needs and interest of communities ; to ensure that policies do not lead to disintegration of communities ; to collect relevant data and information on the impact of economic policies ; to carry out participatory monitoring of policies ; and to ensure local representation in government structures .  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
Recognizing the sovereign right of each State to decide on the development of its private and public sectors , taking into account the comparative advantages of each sector , bearing in mind the economic , social and cultural diversity in the world ,  
In its paragraph 5 , Part I , the Vienna Declaration and Programme of action recalled that All human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated and , in paragraph 98 , Part II , that to strengthen the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights , additional approaches should be examined , such as a system of indicators to measure progress in the realization of the rights set forth in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights .  
While noting that similar bodies either were exploring the possibility of introducing such a mechanism or had already adopted an additional protocol , the Committee believed that , if the principle of the indivisibility , interdependence and interrelatedness of civil and political , and economic , social and cultural rights was to be upheld in the work of the United Nations , it was essential that a complaint procedure be established under the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights .  
The Committee also recommended that the optional protocol should apply in relation to all economic , social and cultural rights as set forth in the Covenant and that this would include all rights contained in articles 1 to 15 with the exception of the right to self _ determination which would be considered only insofar as the economic , social and cultural rights dimensions of that right were involved . 
The Committee noted that while there are a large number of thematic and related mechanisms dealing with different aspects of civil and political rights , there is none dealing solely with the economic , social and cultural rights recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , despite the acknowledged interdependence , indivisibility and interrelatedness of the two sets of rights ( E / 1997 / 22 _ E / CN . 12 / 1996 / 6 , para .  390 ) .  
In order to raise awareness of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the Department carries on a multi _ media approach to ensure the effective coverage of this issue as well as worldwide distribution of relevant public information materials on human rights .  
First , it should be noted that some replies do not correspond to the request for information made by the Secretary _ General , but they have nevertheless been included because they provided material for discussion on the realization of economic , social and cultural rights with regard to social measures at the national level , the right to self-determination and the right of countries to sovereignty over their natural resources .  
Other replies contained favourable views : the appointment of a special rapporteur was seen , in the light of article 2 of the Covenant , as a way to overcome obstacles to the realization of economic , social and cultural rights and to protect vulnerable groups such as migrants and minorities .  
We have realized that all the major political , economic , social and cultural problems of the world can be tackled meaningfully when development is fully addressed by developed and developing countries alike , as guided by the Agenda for Development .  
Inspired by the long historical and close cultural bonds between Turkey and Afghanistan , we stand ready to fulfil our share of the responsibility falling to the international community to assist the Afghan people on the path to reconciliation and to help them preserve Afghanistan 's territorial integrity , sovereignty , independence and national unity .  
The main constraints to the promotion of TCDC , as reported by many delegations and agencies , included structural and cultural differences ; lack of financial resources ; insufficient awareness of the benefits and potentials of TCDC ; limited access to information ; inadequate human resources ; and lack of coordination among the various government agencies involved in technical cooperation .  
While remaining faithful to the purposes and principles set forth in the Charter the maintenance of international peace and security , cooperation for economic , social and cultural development , defence of human rights , and humanitarian assistance the United Nations should also promote and pursue a reform process which takes into account the many changes that have taken place in a complex international scene .  
That will be in line with our policy of continuing to hold a series of multifaceted regional and international conferences and exhibitions in the cultural , social , economic , political and environmental fields .  
The Ecuadorian State is committed to following this line of conduct and to promoting and protecting all human , civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , including the right to development .  
Such enhanced and diverse contributions , in the framework of a world consensus , could spare the international community any accusation of negligence , double standards or bias towards a single cultural concept .  
Inasmuch as Europe Eastern and Western has been the main partner with Egypt in trade transactions , tourist flows and cultural interactions , so has Egypt been and will continue to be a major active party in ensuring stability and regulating a veritable interaction between the European dimension of Mediterranean security and the Mediterranean dimension of European security , in the full meaning of the comprehensive concept of contemporary security . 
Among its primary purposes , the Charter of the United Nations provides for the maintenance of international peace and security ; the fostering between nations of international relations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples ; international cooperation in the economic , social , cultural and humanitarian fields ; and the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all .  
And we all have an obligation to work towards maintaining international peace and security ; achieving international cooperation in solving economic , social , cultural or humanitarian problems ; and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms .  
Not only are large numbers of children killed and injured , but countless others grow up deprived of their material and emotional needs , including the structures that give meaning to social and cultural life .  
Transnational criminal organizations have , in fact , existed for a long time , but the globalization of international relations with regard to the economy , commerce , telecommunications and the rapid progress of technology , as well as the disappearance of ideological blocs , have permitted the activities of transnational criminal organizations to expand and have increased their power to such an extent that they are now a permanent threat to the foundation and internal security of States , to their cultural and artistic heritage and to the environment of the planet .  
Any move in this direction is bound to encourage certain dangerous phenomena that we have been witnessing of late , including legal and illegal emigration from developing to developed countries , that could sow the seeds of social , ethnic and cultural conflict . 
This leads me to say that a country such as Yemen , which mainly depends on foreign aid to carry out its internal policy that is , its economic , social and cultural development has to take into account , in seeking the financial and technical assistance needed to achieve the objectives of the internal policy , certain basic considerations that might seem to others supplementary and not mandatory .  
Convinced of the need effectively to tackle the problems confronting them in this area , they have committed themselves to creating an economic , social , political , cultural and ecological environment that is conducive to social development , as well as to giving priority to national and international policies and initiatives aimed at eliminating poverty , promoting employment , combating unemployment and fostering social integration .  
The Summit \ x { e5b8 } future-oriented outlook , as reflected in the Declaration \ x { e5b8 } principles and goals , was a commitment to a political , economic , ethical and spiritual vision for social development , which , in addition to the principles I have just referred to , called for full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of people .  
We are aware that the issue of social development can not be separated from the major transformations taking place today at the political , economic and cultural levels and that , therefore , any answers must be based on a realistic view of the social situation and the economic circumstances of development .  
The collective campaign of the world community to define , promote and protect human rights across the globe represents a great achievement of humanity at large and needs to be cherished by all ; however , the imperative of a balanced approach to all aspects of human rights , whether civil , political , economic , social or cultural , should not be theoretically underestimated or practically neglected .  
Despite doubts expressed at the session concerning its non-binding character , an international code of ethics for dealers , together with such existing codes for some dealers ' associations , could serve as a tool in the future in drawing a distinction between the licit and illicit trade in cultural objects and will provide guidance for transactions in ambiguous situations .  
The sanctions imposed on Iraq and the foreign interference in its domestic affairs have given rise to clandestine excavations that have enabled their organizers to appropriate and sell cultural property and rare art objects of inestimable value , as well as manuscripts and antique books .  
This problem is of particular significance to Korea , as numerous Korean cultural objects have been pillaged and illegally transferred abroad during our country \ x { e5b8 } history of political turmoil , especially in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century .  
Similarly , we note in the report the entry into force of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law ( UNIDROIT ) Convention and of the efforts to improve existing international conventions for the protection of world cultural properties and agree that our central goal should be increasing the number of ratifications and providing technical assistance to States with acute problems of illicit trafficking in archaeological objects , as well as aiding countries experiencing armed conflicts .  
We share the views of the representative of the Getty Information Institute on the need to rely on some standardized , basic method of exchanging information on stolen cultural property and on the importance of having precise information about such property , as well as the conclusion that only through closer cooperation between private organizations and the public sector , at both the national and the international level , will we be able to curb this illicit traffic . 
The operative part recognizes the importance of the Central American Integration System as a mechanism for coordinating and harmonizing regional efforts to achieve economic , social , cultural , environmental and political integration .  
However , the Dominican Republic is aware that the stability and creditability of a democratic system does not depend on willingness alone , but on a wide range of political , economic , social , cultural and environmental factors .  
Crises require a coherent and effective international response , a response that should integrate preventive diplomacy , political mediation and humanitarian relief , but also social action , economic alternatives and cultural communication .

The importance of the national professional project personnel as the major source of expertise for technical cooperation projects has increased steadily in recent years because of their crucial advantages in transferring national private sector expertise to public institutions , using national talent that could be lost through the brain-drain and cultural compatibility with national work environment .  
Furthermore , under the special General Initiative Fund for Refugee Women , project support is being provided for the training of 100 traditional birth attendants in seven districts of Afghanistan ; for improving the reproductive health of refugee women in Malawi , which includes family planning advisory services , education on sexually transmitted diseases and HIV / AIDS prevention and the addressing of cultural constraints and male attitudes to reproductive health care ; and for an educational video on female genital mutilation in Eritrea and related reproductive health care .

Emphasizing the encouraging results of the regional and national training activities established by UNESCO , in cooperation with the national and international institutions concerned , to improve the implementation of the 1970 Convention on illicit traffic in cultural property ,  
Referring to Recommendation No .  3 of the Committee 's eighth session , in which the Committee invited the Director-General to examine the possibility of establishing an international fund intended to facilitate the restitution of stolen or illicitly exported cultural objects in cases where the countries concerned are unable to meet the related financial costs ,  
Since countries differed in terms of their living conditions , level of development , geographic characteristics and cultural traditions , there could be no uniform standard or model for solving the problems related to human settlements .  
This part of the study , which deals solely with economic , social and cultural rights , concerns all current or recent violations of those rights and of so _ called collective rights such as the right to development and the right to a healthy environment , irrespective of their perpetrators , whether States or their agents , groups of States , national or international private organizations or individuals or groups acting outside the competence of the State .  
The preamble common to the two International Covenants on Human Rights recognizes that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his civil and political rights . 
The 1968 Proclamation of Tehran reaffirmed that human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible ; in the context of that interdependence , the realization of economic , social and cultural rights is of crucial importance for the effective exercise of civil and political rights .  
The General Assembly of the United Nations has also stated that equal attention and urgent consideration should be devoted to the realization , promotion and protection of both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights .  
In its resolution 4 ( XXXIII ) of 21 February 1977 , the Commission on Human Rights stresses the responsibility and duty of all members of the international community to create the necessary conditions for the full realization of economic , social and cultural rights as an essential means of ensuring the real and meaningful enjoyment of civil and political rights and fundamental freedoms .  
It calls upon all States to take prompt and effective measures , both on the national and on the international level , to remove all obstacles to the full realization of economic , social and cultural rights and to promote all actions that will secure the enjoyment of the said rights .  
During the discussions on methods of implementing economic , social and cultural rights , an implementation that necessitates a certain level of economic development and material support , the representatives of several developing countries expressed the fear that the inevitably slow progress in realizing those rights might be taken for unwillingness on their part . 
It was soon observed afterwards that the fears of the former and the hypocrisy of the latter very rapidly became a source of massive and grave violations of economic , social and cultural rights and of collective rights such as the right to development and the right to a healthy environment .  
Article 22 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights specifies that Everyone . . . is entitled to realization , through national effort and international cooperation . . . of the economic , social and cultural rights indispensable for his dignity and the free development of his personality .  
While it is true that many studies have been made of economic , social and cultural rights and of collective rights such as the right to development and the right to a healthy environment from the point of view of their history , legal basis , regulation or scope , there have been very few on ways of combating violations of them .  
This definition is applicable to civil and political rights , as well as economic , social and cultural rights , and also to collective or communal rights .  
Article 1 , paragraph 3 , stipulates that one of the Purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion .  
It is for the State and the international community to organize the political and legal framework needed to undertake , with any chance of success , the campaign against impunity for violations of economic , social or cultural rights , whether individual or collective .  
The scope of this report is too narrow for a detailed description of the numerous serious violations of rights of all kinds , whether civil and political or economic , social or cultural , considered either collectively or individually .  
It was erected into a system of government and applied for about a century accompanied by violations of human rights , both economic , social and cultural rights and civil and political rights .  
In its resolution 1992 / 50 on the fraudulent or unlawful enrichment of top State officials , the Commission on Human Rights pointed clearly to the responsibility of the North in connection with the commission of that crime in the countries of the South and thus raised the question , still unclear in international law , of the restitution to despoiled peoples , for reinvestment in local economic , social and cultural development , of the funds which their leaders have extorted from them , usually with the complicity of foreign banks .  
The practices and procedures outlined above have a negative impact on the economic , social and cultural rights of individuals and also on collective or communal rights ( right to development and right to a healthy environment ) .  
These collective or communal rights are to individual economic , social and cultural rights what democracy and the rule of law are to civil and political rights .  
While producing their own negative effects on the enjoyment of human rights in general and economic , social and cultural rights in particular , these phenomena have multiplier effects which also exacerbate the increasingly serious and numerous problems faced by the populations of poor regions .  
Any transaction for the transfer of wastes is a serious violation of the right to a healthy environment and , quite obviously , of the whole set of human rights , whether individual or collective , economic , social and cultural or civil and political .  
Although applying the procedures of an optional protocol would not give the Committee any jurisdictional authority , it would provide an opportunity through regular reports and individual communications to submit useful recommendations to the States parties and would make a major contribution to the campaign against impunity for violations of economic , social and cultural rights .  
In many cases , those responsible for violations of economic , social and cultural rights and of the collective rights with an economic content such as the right to development or the right to a healthy environment , are sometimes international entities applying policies which constitute veritable sources of large-scale and serious violations of collective and individual rights in the countries with weak economies .  
In view of the massive and systematic violations of which the third-world peoples have been victims in the recent past , such as slavery , colonization and cultural looting , it is obvious that there could only be a global remedy , the purpose of which is to re-establish these peoples in their communal rights by returning to them the goods of which they have been unlawfully dispossessed .

The Assembly adopted resolution 53 / 168 on the fiftieth anniversary in which it declared its commitment to the fulfilment of the Declaration as a source of inspiration for the further promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms - political , social , civil and cultural _ including the right to development .  
Technical cooperation activities are based on international human rights standards as defined in the instruments adopted within the United Nations and on international practice in applying them in all regions of the world , giving balanced attention to civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
To sum up , the Government of Sweden remains unconvinced that the suggested draft optional protocol presents an optimal way forward in the strengthening of the international mechanisms needed to contribute to the universal realization of economic , social and cultural rights .  
The Greek Cypriot administration , which tries to present itself as the champion of conservation of cultural heritage , continues , on the one hand , to show utter contempt for what is left of the Turkish-Islamic heritage in South Cyprus , where Ottoman Turkish shrines are under threat of disintegration due to total neglect , and , on the other hand , systematically blocks the flow of any external financial or technical assistance to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus for conservation purposes .  
Factors which give rise to racism and racial discrimination were examined at the seminar on the political , historical , economic , social and cultural factors contributing to racism , racial discrimination and apartheid held at Geneva from 10 to 14 December 1990 .  
The primary causes of racism and racial discrimination are deeply embedded in the historical past and are determined by a number of economic , political , social and cultural factors .  
The State has the responsibility to take legislative , judicial , administrative or other appropriate measures to promote the understanding by all persons under its jurisdiction of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
This consensus recognizes the wide diversity of social , economic , environmental , cultural and political conditions around the world and accordingly the need to develop appropriate diverse approaches towards sustainable forest management .  
Stressing that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
The law provided a framework for improving their status , but it was unevenly implemented because of ingrained cultural attitudes ; large segments of rural and urban society still resorted to customary laws in regard to marriage and divorce and dangerous traditional practices , such as circumcision , continued to prevail in many areas .  
The fact that the level of cultural and communal services in rural areas has deteriorated and the absence of comfortable settings for work and living are increasingly causing internal migration of the rural population to urban areas .  
It has been aggravated by a number of negative social phenomena , such as the deterioration in the health of poor people due to poor nutrition , school leaving caused by a disruption in the normal functioning of educational and cultural establishments , and an increase in crime , and in the moral decay of adults , resulting in more and various forms of violence .  
While the question of poverty must be dealt with primarily as a violation of human rights and of the right to development , the measures to be taken for its eradication required integrated approaches encompassing its economic , social , cultural , educational , demographic and other dimensions .  
To counter the perceived threat and build a " clean social system " , 2 the regime launched a uniquely thorough revolution whereby all pre-existing economic , social and cultural institutions were abolished , all foreign influences were expunged and the entire population was transformed into a collective workforce , required to work at breakneck speed to build up the country 's economic strength .  
Human rights are understood to be the civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and the third generation of human rights set forth in the Constitution , the laws and the treaties in force , together with those contained in the declarations and principles approved by the United Nations or the Organization of American States ( PDDH Act , art .  2 ) .  
Furthermore , the network of the Centre for Initiatives and Advancement for Women , as part of a project receiving financial support from the European Union , is promoting an improvement in the status of women by increasing their active participation in the countrys development and thus affording equal opportunities for women to contribute effectively to national economic , social , cultural and political processes , placing special emphasis on rural areas .  
Lastly , it should be noted that there remain principal subjects of concern that have a bearing on economic , social and cultural issues , such as the problem of violence against women in all its aspects , including sexual abuse , physical and mental ill-treatment , sexual exploitation of children and sexual harassment at work , which represent a pattern of human rights violations calling for firm and persistent action at the various levels of the State and within civil society .  
They also have the right freely to apply their systems of political , social , economic , cultural and religious organization and voluntarily to observe customary practices for the regulation of their domestic coexistence , provided that none of them runs counter to the fundamental rights established in this Constitution .  
UNESCO welcomed the ongoing discussions on the feasibility of establishing a United Nations radio network and it looked forward to being able to participate in programming and to working with Member States to promote cultural diversity , including linguistic diversity , through communication through the development of endogenous media capacities , particularly radio broadcasting at the community , national and regional levels .  
On the current international scene , overwhelmed by an information revolution , the media must disseminate objective and impartial information , taking into account the unique social and cultural traditions of each region and acting with a sense of professionalism , ethics and responsibility .  
The representative of Paraguay expressed support for the creation of a permanent forum which would coordinate , promote and advise on all issues regarding indigenous peoples , including their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .

States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , [ cultural ] , administrative , technical [ or any other ] opportunities for criminal organizations to commit [ profitable crimes ] [ any punishable offence ] and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
It has been widely recognized , nationally and internationally , that the existence of strong and transparent institutions is a prerequisite for an inclusive society based on the rule of law , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , cultural and religious diversity , social justice and democratic participation , which takes into account the special needs of vulnerable and disadvantages groups .

That the realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms , and particularly economic , social and cultural rights , is a dynamic process and that , as is evident in today 's world , a great deal remains to be accomplished ;  
To secure progressively , through national development policies and with international assistance and cooperation , full realization of economic , social and cultural rights , giving particular attention to the individuals , most often women and children , especially girls , and communities living in extreme poverty and therefore most vulnerable and disadvantaged ;  
To consider in this context , as appropriate , the desirability of drawing up national action plans identifying steps to improve the situation of human rights in general with specific benchmarks designed to give effect to minimum essential levels of enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights ;  
Recalling also that the eradication of widespread poverty , including its most persistent forms , and the full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights and civil and political rights remain interrelated goals ,

The strategic framework is to comprise integrated and coordinated actions for addressing any combination of political , military , humanitarian , human rights , environmental , economic , social , cultural and demographic factors .  
The Committee reiterates its previous recommendation that if measures are taken to incorporate civil and political rights treaty obligations in the Icelandic legal system , similar measures should be taken simultaneously in respect of economic , social and cultural rights .  
The precise meaning of adequacy is to a large extent determined by prevailing social , economic , cultural , climatic , ecological and other conditions , while sustainability incorporates the notion of long-term availability and accessibility .  
Concluding observations of the Committee on Economic , 1 .  The Committee considered the state of implementation by Solomon Islands of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Covenant at its 9th meeting held on 30 April 1999 ( twentieth session ) and adopted , at its 24th meeting , held on 11 May 1999 , the following concluding observations .  
Its activities may include monitoring compliance with specific rights recognized under the Covenant and providing reports thereon to the public authorities and civil society , and examining complaints alleging infringements of applicable economic , social and cultural rights standards within the State .  
With respect to the general framework within which human rights are protected and promoted , the Committee considers an independent judiciary to be an essential instrument for the protection of economic , social and cultural rights and therefore requests that information be included on the matter in the third periodic report .  
Although globalization is driving the current economic and sociological evolution of the industrialized world , regional cultural identity still represents an extraordinarily strong force in the world .  
States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , [ cultural , ] administrative , technical [ or any other ] opportunities for criminal organizations to commit [ profitable crimes ] [ any punishable offence ] and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
WFDY is a broad international non-governmental youth organization which brings together national youth organizations with diverse cultural , religious and social , economic and political systems .  
The parties expressed optimism about the prospects for expanding bilateral political , economic , commercial , scientific , technical and cultural ties .  
They have done so in the context of the urgent need for understanding by non-indigenous societies of the spiritual , social , cultural , economic and political significance to indigenous societies of their lands , territories and resources for their continued survival and vitality .  
At present , it is safe to say that the use of judicial mechanisms may be risky because of the problem of different interpretive tools , the subjective and highly political nature of these State-chartered forums , and continuing cultural biases demonstrated by Governments .  
This includes the right to maintain , protect and develop the past , present and future manifestations of their cultures , such as archaeological and historical sites , artifacts , designs , ceremonies , technologies and visual and performing arts and literature , as well as the right to the restitution of cultural , intellectual , religious and spiritual property taken without their free and informed consent or in violation of their laws , traditions and customs .  
Pursuant to agreement with the indigenous peoples concerned , just and fair compensation shall be provided for any such activities and measures taken to mitigate adverse environmental , economic , social , cultural or spiritual impact .  
In conclusion , the Committees proposal for an additional regular session to be held in New York is driven by a commitment to the interdependence and indivisibility of all rights , as well as a recognition of the renewed interest in economic , social and cultural rights which is evident in the work of the United Nations human rights system .  
While they may mean different things to different people , 29 / depending on their philosophical , ideological , political , cultural , social and economic perspectives , all agree that the expression a democratic society referred to in the Universal Declaration and in both International Covenants 30 / is a vital concept for human rights based on common values shared by human beings throughout the world community .  
A democratic society , moreover , whatever may be the cultural , political , social and economic framework in which it is achieved , is identified by certain principles and institutions , such as pluralism , the rule of law , legitimacy , political equality , popular control and public accountability of government , which , again , have their starting point in human rights and freedoms .  
Concerning bilateral issues , President Eyadma and President Taylor expressed satisfaction at the excellent relations of friendship , brotherhood , cooperation and solidarity between their two countries and decided to work to strengthen those relations at all levels , especially in the political , economic , commercial and cultural spheres , in the interest of their respective peoples .  
The aggressor 's daily targets are national parks , nature reservations , monuments of cultural and natural heritage , rare and protected plants and animal species , among which are those of international importance .  
Activities include coordination meetings and electronic discussions on the planning of cooperative activities and sharing of experience , support for subregional training courses , pilot projects on the application of telematics for development in sectors of public concern , and promotion of the African content of the World Wide Web for educational , scientific , social and cultural development .  
It will continue to cooperate fully over the coming years , as it has done in connection with the preparations for this Conference , in order to ensure that the results achieved with regard to the main economic , social and cultural interests involved in the use of outer space can be applied for the benefit of all .  
It was the first instrument in the world to set forth a list of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ( author 's emphasis ) . 
As a result of the compromise reached , Article 1 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter of the United Nations defines one of the Organization 's purposes as being to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion .  
Considering further that the States Members of the United Nations , by adopting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , reaffirmed their commitment to the observance of fundamental human rights , their faith in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women , and their determination to promote , in cooperation with the United Nations , the universal observance of civil and political as well as economic , social and cultural rights ,  
The issue under discussion involves both conceptual as well as empirical dimensions , some of which are already under consideration by the Sub _ Commission and the Commission on Human Rights . 17 / It also involves both categories of human rights , viz . , the civil and political , and the economic , social and cultural . 
At its forty _ fifth session , the Sub _ Commission , in its resolution 1993 / 40 , decided to entrust Mr . Asbjrn Eide with the task of producing a preparatory document on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights , and income distribution , at both national and international levels , taking also into account matters related to the realization of the right to development .  
At its forty _ eighth session , the Sub _ Commission , in its resolution 1996 / 26 , welcomed the provisional report on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights , and income distribution , prepared by the Special Rapporteur , Mr . Jos Bengoa ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1996 / 14 ) , and requested the Special Rapporteur to submit his final report to the Sub _ Commission at its forty _ ninth session .  
At its fifty _ fifth session , the Commission on Human Rights , in its resolution 1999 / 53 , decided that the Sub _ Commission should further review , in the light of the ongoing discussions by the Commission on its working methods , the establishment of a forum on economic , social and cultural rights , to be called the Social Forum , to meet during its annual sessions with the following objectives :  
These effects also included the extinction ( or substantial reduction ) of their territorial base and undermined their political , economic , juridical , cultural and social order in general , and even their survival as a distinct society .  
The Special Rapporteur further recommends State authorities not to take up or continue to engage in development projects that may impair the environment of indigenous lands and / or adversely affect their traditional economic activities , religious ceremonies or cultural heritage , without previously commissioning the appropriate ecological studies to determine the actual negative impact those projects will have .  
Governments at local , regional and national levels should recognize the role of multiple identities in contributing to open communities and in establishing useful distinctions between public institutional structures and cultural identities ;  
The content of adequacy is to some extent determined by prevailing social , economic , cultural , climatic , ecological and other conditions , but there are some core elements which are applicable under all circumstances and are spelled out in greater detail by the Committee .  
In its concluding observations regarding Guatemala ( E / C . 12 / 1 / Add . 3 of 28 May 1996 ) the Committee expressed serious concern at the adverse effects of the economic and social disparities on the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights by the majority of the population , particularly by the indigenous and rural populations of Guatemala .  
While on the one hand every Government should remove obstacles blocking development within its State , such as failure to observe civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , effective international cooperation is essential in providing developing countries with appropriate means and facilities to foster their comprehensive development , in accordance with the Declaration on the Right to Development .  
The precise meaning of adequacy is to a large extent determined by prevailing social , economic , cultural , climatic , ecological and other conditions , while sustainability incorporates the notion of long-term availability and accessibility .  
The United Arab Emirates , which has endeavoured to achieve complete development , has taken into account population questions and other essential issues , which should be based on justice and equality , respect for religious beliefs and acceptance of cultural , educational and economic traditions of every country so that we can achieve universal development .  
recommendations included in the ICPD Programme of Action , and those included in the document to be issued at the end of this session , is the sovereign right of each country , consistent with national laws and developmental priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its people , and in conformity with relevant and universally recognized covenants and agreements . 
The implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action and those contained in the present document is the sovereign right of each country , consistent with national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its people , and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights .  6 .  The Programme of Action recommended a set of interdependent quantitative goals and objectives .  
Within the framework of respect for human rights and strengthening democracy , the Bolivian State intends to continue seeking alternative models for dealing with sexual and reproductive health within the context of the social , economic , political and cultural factors that come into play in health matters .  
Thanks to this law , the enforcement and development of a private medical-care system part of the national policy on the population 's medical care will pay special attention to women 's health , which is far more sensitive to social and economic changes and to political , cultural and psychological factors . 
The Cairo Programme of Action , which was the outcome of a delicate compromise made in the face of diverse and even diverging cultural , religious and philosophical values , is the expression of our common will to go beyond diversity and seek together relevant responses to the challenges of sustainable development from the perspective of population , which is certainly the most powerful factor determining the economic and social progress of nations . 
In addition to providing basic services for our society and improving economic performance , the challenges of the future will make it necessary to build bridges across generations and create a more understanding and progressive cultural milieu in which young and old together embrace the new values of our evolving societies while respecting the traditions that we have inherited from our forefathers . 
Our main objectives are to eradicate absolute poverty , increase access to basic education for girls , eliminate gender disparities , increase access to reproductive health care , and reduce cultural and legal barriers that discriminate against women and girls , as well as to reduce maternal and infant mortality rates .  
It is aimed at addressing a range of interrelated challenges , protecting individual social and economic rights and human rights in general , providing legal protections and creating conditions to protect the cultural , spiritual and intellectual interests of our people .  
Quality of life is determined not simply by material goods , but is made up of a whole set of simultaneously interwoven factors : health , education , employment , elimination of poverty , respect of human rights , the possibility of self-fulfilment , social and cultural integration and living in an ecologically enlightened environment .  
These obstacles are : in the social sphere , religious and cultural diversity ; and in the economic area , a steady decline in official development assistance , the excessive burden of foreign debt , deterioration in the terms of trade and the difficulties of gaining access to the international markets for our goods .  
To redress these acts of violence and prevent a forcible and illegal occupation of other institutions of national culture , it is necessary that the international security force ( KFOR ) take immediate and effective action , including physical protection , of the following cultural institutions , so that they may continue regular work :  
Similarly , the ILO / UNESCO recommendation concerning the Status of Teachers states in its Guiding Principles that education from the earliest school years should be directed to the all _ round development of the human personality and to the spiritual , moral , social , cultural and economic progress of the community , as well as to the inculcation of deep respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
When one studies traditional practices , in particular female genital mutilation , it must first be noted that they are rooted in a whole set of beliefs , values , cultural and social behaviour patterns governing the lives of the societies concerned .  
The Special Rapporteur calls on all countries with large inflows of immigrants to develop and put into effect programmes to combat harmful traditional practices in accordance with their national laws and international standards , but always with due respect for the cultural values of the migrant population groups and without denigrating their cultures or treating the societies concerned with disdain or an air of superiority .  
The Convention favours an integrated approach to those rights , avoiding the categorization of rights that , in previous decades , had separated civil and political rights on the one hand , and economic , social and cultural rights on the other .  
Mexico thus considers that the promotion of knowledge of outer space and its technological applications should be encouraged both nationally and internationally , as part of the cultural heritage of present and future generations , fostering a comprehensive and integrated vision of the environment and a greater awareness of the potential uses of this resource and the need to preserve it .  
Recognizing that States have developed different cultural and historical uses for firearms and that the purpose of enhancing international cooperation to eradicate illicit transnational trafficking in firearms is not to discourage or diminish lawful leisure or recreational activities such as travel or tourism for sport shooting , hunting and other forms of lawful ownership and use of firearms that are recognized by States Parties ,  
Concrete projects that create jobs , open new avenues for economic cooperation , provide the chance to share cultural experience or offer more balanced media coverage work both to break down psychological barriers and to create a vested interest in a shared , peaceful and prosperous future together .  
Member States should cooperate , as a matter of urgency , to ensure that future space activities that would cause potentially harmful interference with the scientific research or natural , cultural and ethical values of other nations ( para .  73 ) are subjected to an environmental impact assessment and international consultations before approval ;  
For the purposes of the present Convention , the term " discrimination against women " shall mean any distinction , exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition , enjoyment or exercise by women , irrespective of their marital status , on a basis of equality of men and women , of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural , civil or any other field .  
Most Libyan legislative acts are directed at all citizens , irrespective of their sex , and prescribe the body of rights which they enjoy in the political , functional , economic , social , cultural , health and educational fields , without discrimination between men and women , being fundamental rights that are intrinsic to human beings , whether male or female .  
Potential barriers , whether cultural and organizational , political and legal , technical and programmatic or economic , needed to be identified and then removed or minimized .  
Japan , from the first days of its aggression against Korea , especially during the nearly half a century-long period of its military occupation of and colonial rule over Korea from the early twentieth century , pillaged and destroyed a considerable amount of valuable cultural property , which the Korean people had handed down with utmost care generation after generation .  
The meeting assessed the cooperation between the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields as outlined in General Assembly resolution 53 / 8 .  
The definition and promotion of concepts for a flexible technical infrastructure , adaptable to health services in different economic and cultural environments , including developing countries , and based on a clear vision of the existing and the emerging growth of telecommunications and information-processing capabilities ;  
The NGO community , which has contributed enormously to strengthening the human rights regime , especially regarding civil and political rights , is now moving enthusiastically to operate at the grass _ roots level to deliver economic , social and cultural rights .  
The adoption by the United Nations in 1986 of the Declaration on the Right to Development was the culmination of a long process of international deliberation on human rights which were perceived from the very beginning as an integrated whole of all civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
After that , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 clearly recognized the unity of all those rights and elaborated the theme , as noted later in the preamble to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that , the ideal of free human beings enjoying civil and political freedom and freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his civil and political rights , as well as his economic , social and cultural rights .  
However , as the years passed , the post-war solidarity gave way to the cold war and instead of one unified covenant , those rights were codified in 1966 in two international covenants - one on civil and political rights , another on economic , social and cultural rights .  
As early as 1968 , the Proclamation of Tehran stated : since human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible , the full realization of civil and political rights without the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights is impossible .  
In 1969 the Declaration on Social Progress and Development further emphasized the interdependence of these two sets of rights , and by the early 1970s the concept of the right to development emerged as a human right that unified in itself the civil and political rights as well as the economic , social and cultural rights .  
The right to development unifies civil and political rights with economic , social and cultural rights into an indivisible and interdependent set of human rights and fundamental freedoms , to be enjoyed by all human beings , without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .  
Civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights have been codified in the International Covenants and ratified by a large number of countries , but the Declaration on the Right to Development does not have the status of a treaty and therefore can not be enforced in a legal system .  
The economic , social and cultural rights , on the other hand , required to be protected through positive action over time , which would consume resources , and since resources were always limited , the realization of these rights would naturally be constrained .  
It states : The right to Development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
Then , there is a process of economic , social , cultural and political development , which is recognized as one in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
In addition , States are required , by article 6 , paragraph 3 , to take steps to eliminate obstacles to development resulting from failure to observe civil and political rights as well as economic , social and cultural rights , because the implementation , promotion and protection of these rights would be essential for realizing the right to development , as all human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ( art . 6 , para .  2 ) .  
To appreciate fully the emphasis the Declaration puts on international cooperation , article 4 should be read in conjunction with the opening sentence of the preamble to the Declaration which refers to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations relating to the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural and humanitarian nature , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The importance of the last element derives from the fact that the right to development is a human right , and as such it is interdependent and indivisible with other civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , in the sense that the denial of any one of these rights would tend to deny the right to development itself .  
All representatives endorsed and welcomed the objectives of the Conference , which included promoting the effective means of using space solutions to address problems of regional or global significance ; strengthening the capabilities of Member States , especially developing countries , to use the results of space research for economic and cultural development ; and enhancing international cooperation in space science and technology and its applications . 
Recognizing the importance of space science and space applications for the fundamental knowledge of the universe , education , health , environmental monitoring , management of natural resources , disaster management , meteorological forecasting and climate modelling , satellite navigation and communications , and the major contribution that space science and technology make to the well-being of humanity and specifically to economic , social and cultural development ,  
This shows that the net of international legal commitments relevant for economic , social and cultural rights is fairly wider than would be assumed by considering only the number of ratifications of the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights .  
The complementarity of civil and political rights to economic , social and cultural rights must be fully recognized if the latter are to be implemented in accordance with the needs of people and the actual economic potential of the State .  
For example , the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights has stressed that States parties should recognize the essential role of international cooperation and comply with their commitment to take joint and separate action to achieve the realization of economic , social and cultural rights ( see also paras . 33 and 34 below ) .  
The academic community has assisted the United Nations human rights machinery by , among other things , developing two sets of guidelines known as the Limburg Principles on the Implementation of the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights ( 1986 ) , elaborated in 1997 in the Maastricht guidelines on violations of economic , social and cultural rights .  
For example , guidelines for interviews recently prepared for the Kosovo emergency operation and shared with the partners involved in the field refer to both economic , social and cultural and civil and political rights .  
Independent national human rights institutions , acting in accordance with the 1991 Paris Principles , play an important role in the realization of economic , social and cultural rights at the national level , as was stressed by the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights in its General Comment No . 10 ( 1998 ) .  
The United Nations Development Assistance Framework , which has been designed to provide the format for continuing United Nations teamwork in responding to the development priorities of specific countries , will play an essential role in identifying needs regarding the implementation of economic , social and cultural rights and providing coordinated response to them .  
While further developing close cooperation with regional human rights organizations , the Office intends , therefore , to intensify its programme of cooperation at the regional and subregional level , a significant portion of which will focus on economic , social and cultural rights .  
The meeting held a discussion on economic , social and cultural rights and subsequently recommended that the inter-sessional workshop on the right to development and economic , social and cultural rights should focus , inter alia , on developing quantifiable benchmarks ; identifying obstacles to the realization of these rights ; and proposing relevant actions to strengthen national capacities for the promotion and protection of these rights .  
This is particularly visible with regard to the eradication of poverty , which needs a human rights underpinning , as well as concerning economic , social and cultural rights for which operationalization wavers between an unrealistic expectation that the Government will provide necessary services to all free of charge , and surrender in the face of the combined obstacles of poverty and debt servicing . 
They noted the multifaceted nature of the concept , which combines political , ideological , economic , social , cultural and ethical criteria , and identified its main elements , such as transparency in public administration , accountability , respect for human rights and legality , promotion of democracy and enhanced management of resources . 
Holy See suggested the following text : Full respect for human dignity , human rights and fundamental freedoms , as well as the various religious and ethical values , cultural backgrounds , philosophical convictions of its people , and peace and security , are also crucial for social development . 
There is also concern that the recent emphasis in financial and economic policies has not always been development-oriented , that the dominance of a limited set of macroeconomic targets and parameters over the social , political , cultural and environmental domains has gone too far , and that social and economic policies and objectives must be fully integrated .  
The interaction between population ageing and development is a complex fusion of global patterns in labour and capital markets , government pensions , services , and traditional support systems , which are further shaped by technological change and cultural transformations .  
This search is being guided by the expectation that demographic ageing holds the promise of maturing attitudes and capabilities in social , economic , cultural and spiritual undertakings , and for global peace and development in the next century .  
The increasing pace of globalization and current developments however , have proved that the structures and practices of globalization itself may often , directly and indirectly , be a cause of violations of human rights , not only with regard to economic , social and cultural rights , but also with regard to civil and political rights .  
As a result , the need to ensure the principle of the indivisibility of human rights by directly addressing the existing imbalance between civil and political rights on the one hand , and economic , social and cultural rights on the other , appears to have been neglected .  
Similarly , the creation and establishment of a balanced human rights programme and the need to allocate adequate human and financial resources to capacity building , the right to development , economic , social and cultural rights , technical cooperation etc . , are also missing from the report .  Alternative recommendation 2 : To include the establishment of a balanced human rights programme on the agenda of the working group referred to above .  
While this concern must be addressed , it is important to keep in mind that this concern is being raised at a stage when the creation of special procedures to look at various aspects of civil and political rights is almost complete and a similar exercise has just begun in the field of economic , social and cultural rights .  
According to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , international cooperation should be paramount in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian nature , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all , without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .  
The success of the review of the mechanisms can best be judged by achieving such a balance through concrete proposals , such as assigning equal budgetary and human resources to both civil and political and to economic , social and cultural rights .  
What is therefore required is a developmental approach to human rights , keeping in mind that all human rights are indivisible and the need for adequate importance to be given to economic , social and cultural rights .  
These conflicts have underlying causes which arise from a number of accumulated and complex political , commercial , socio-economic , ethnic , cultural and ideological factors .  
To meet the challenge , the Secretariat has made concerted efforts to move the discourse from a focus on definitions and prescriptive and value judgements to an emphasis on an increased understanding of the social , economic and cultural processes that affect the institution of the family in the performance of its central and irreducible functions in any society .  
With respect to the latter , the last workshop , held in February this year in New Delhi , recommended that an inter-sessional regional workshop on the right to development and economic , social and cultural rights and on steps to be taken in this regard at the national and international levels be organized .  
This does not speak only of a tolerant attitude , but also about a deliberate protection of the separatist-terrorist so-called KLA in order to shun possible responsibility for daily killings , abductions , the destruction and burning of Serbian medieval monasteries and cultural monuments - in which way KFOR becomes practically an accomplice in the great evil against the Serbian people in a flagrant massive violation of human rights and the campaign of ethnic cleansing . 
The rights of Afghan citizens are protected under the Covenants on political and civil , economic , social and cultural rights , the Geneva Conventions and other international instruments to which Afghanistan is a party , and they must be respected .

The UNDP policy document entitled Integrating human rights with sustainable human development embraces a holistic vision integrating all human , civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
My own country of Saint Lucia , and our Eastern Caribbean sister State of Dominica , share special cultural , economic and social ties with the overseas departments of Guadeloupe , Martinique and French Guyana , which represents the political model of integrated status and whose representatives have been present with us here at this Seminar to discuss the intricacies of that political status .  
Other issues examined included : the economic , social and cultural factors that encourage the expectation that women will take care of the elderly ; whether care-giver is a universal female identity ; and widowhood and how it is affected by the economic and demographic changes occurring in different parts of the world .  
Some of them emphasize the increased mobility of factors of production , goods and services across borders and the resultant emergence of a truly global market , others see primarily the results and future potential of an explosive progress in information technology , while still others view globalization primarily from societal and cultural perspectives .  
The broad human rights approach to disability , therefore , takes the view of advancing the rights and well being of all people , regardless of disabilities , through promotion of implementation of general and disability-specific international instruments that encompass civil and political to economic , social and cultural rights for all .

Consolidate the national and multinational cultural reality that confers upon the Portuguese-speaking countries an identity of their own , while reflecting the special character of their relationship and the experience of a fruitful concerted action and cooperation that has been built up over the years ;  
The Statutes of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries summarize the above in three general objectives : concerted action among its members at both the political and diplomatic level , particularly with the aim of asserting their presence in the international forums ; cooperation , particularly in the economic , social , cultural , legal and scientific spheres ; implementation of projects designed to promote and disseminate the Portuguese language .  
We know what these causes of conflict are : the huge gap between the living standards and incomes of different classes and nations ; the exponential increase in mass migration from poor to rich countries ; cultural difference and the conflicts and fanaticism it triggers ; criminal acts for the sake of glorifying or even creating a nation .  
To promote information , education and communication programmes for social mediators , for example , political , religious , educational , cultural , business and union leaders , peer educators , and representatives of non-governmental organizations and the media worldwide , so that they may convey appropriate and accurate messages about drug abuse . 
In this connection , the recommendation of the representative of the Holy See , made during the preparatory process to the Conference against Racism , is very sound : There is a need to go deeper than historical , cultural , political or social contexts and to identify and understand the spiritual and moral dimensions which underlay the universal human condition and in particular those aspects of it leading to abuses of racial discrimination .  
At the national and international levels , unjust economic , social and political systems which really constitute violations of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights contribute to the birth and / or nurturing of extremism .

Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security , and their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen economic , social , cultural and environmental cooperation in the region ,  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of the need for comprehensive , coherent and effective policies on international migration based on the spirit of genuine partnership and common understanding ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
These challenges called for a holistic approach , as the social , economic , cultural and environmental aspects of development were interdependent , and for more creative international cooperation based on internal democracy , fair external relations and the will to act at the appropriate level depending on the nature of the problem .  
Each actor , whether citizen , NGO , enterprise , State or international organization , respect a holistic and integrated approach and to take into consideration the interdependency of the political , social , economic , cultural and environmental factors of development ;  
The United Nations serve as the framework for political , economic , cultural , environmental and moral dialogue and that full use be made of the regional commissions which were the natural link between global and national concerns .  
One of the fundamental principles of the Programme was that the formulation and implementation of population-related policies is the responsibility of each country and should take into account the economic , social and environmental diversity of conditions in each country , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values , cultural backgrounds and philosophical convictions of its people ( A / CONF . 171 / 13 , article 1.11 ) .

Conditions which might assist developing countries in addressing poverty issues at the macroeconomic , institutional and policy levels were , respectively , globalization ; the awareness-building role of civil society and the role of the private sector , particularly in creating jobs and spurring rapid economic growth ; and the achievement of a balance between the economic and financial aspects of development and social , cultural and institutional concerns .  
It had also urged Governments and the private sector to increase their support for developing an adequate science and technology capacity through appropriate education and research programmes as an indispensable foundation for economic , social , cultural and environmentally sound development .  
The Non-Self-Governing Territories , most of which were small island Territories , required and deserved the comprehensive support of the international community , which must assist the Territories to fulfil their aspirations to achieve not only political but also economic , social and cultural well-being .  
At subregional level , an Association of Women of West Africa ( currently chaired by Cte dIvoire ) which had been established by countries of the Economic Community of West African States planned to initiate cultural , social , economic and political programmes for advancing the status of women .

Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security , and their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen economic , social , cultural and environmental cooperation in the region ,  
In order to achieve respect for cultural differences within a context of national unity , national reconciliation and democratic coexistence , it is essential to implement a comprehensive , nationwide programme of civic education , for which the necessary human and financial resources must be provided .  
Recognizes that respect for cultural diversity and the cultural rights of all peoples and nations will enhance cultural pluralism , contributing to wider exchange of knowledge and cultural background , advance the application and enjoyment of universally accepted human rights across the world and foster stable friendly relations among peoples and nations worldwide ;  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
All countries , non-governmental organizations and international organizations concerned needed to be engaged in follow-up , and in that endeavour different methods of implementation , monitoring and evaluation that were sensitive to local cultural , political and religious traditions might be required , as well as active participation of the local population .  
States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , [ cultural , ] administrative , technical [ or any other ] opportunities for criminal organizations to commit [ profitable crimes ] [ any punishable offence ] and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,  
Accordingly , in Syria , there is no basis for any discrimination , exception , restriction or preference on grounds of race , colour , descent or national or ethnic origin that would in any way hamper or impede the recognition , enjoyment or exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms in political , economic , social or cultural fields , in employment or in any other sphere of public life .  
Emphasizes that while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Noting the desire of both organizations to consolidate , develop and enhance further the ties existing between them in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural , technical and administrative fields ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in order to enhance their capacity to serve the mutual interests and objectives of the two organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields ;  
The same perspective was defended during the preparation for the Fourth World Conference on Women and at the April 1995 preparatory seminar that constituted a debating forum on the situation of women : the realization of their civic and political rights ; their economic , social and cultural rights ; their reproductive rights and so-called new rights , inter alia , the right to development and quality of life .  
The creation of a new relationship between Government , society and indigenous peoples must be based on respect for their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and on peaceful dialogue .  
Mr . Wehbe ( Syrian Arab Republic ) said that his delegation viewed draft resolution A / C . 3 / 54 / L . 8 , which advocated abolition of the death penalty , as a flagrant violation of the principle of mutual respect for the sovereignty of States and of non-interference in their internal affairs .  It represented an attempt to force other States to change their political , judicial , social and cultural structures .  
Each State was entitled to protect its citizens and the human rights of the victims of the most serious crimes as it saw fit , and depending on its social , moral , cultural , legal and economic specificities .  
Recent calls for such reform were born of a political desire to protect human rights in the context of international consensus , rather than through the unilateral imposition of a single cultural model .  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity in the peace and security , political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
In the context of the current global difficulties , it had become increasingly evident that economic , social and cultural rights must no longer be relegated to a secondary rank .  
Despite that welcome development , the Israeli Government was continuing its policy of establishing Jewish settlements and confiscating Palestinian land , especially in East Jerusalem , in the area around Jerusalem , and in the Syrian Golan , and was still engaging in practices that adversely affected the human rights of the Palestinian people , with the result that in Jerusalem , the demographic , legal , cultural and historic situation was being altered .  
Guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , and recalling that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development and of the need for comprehensive , coherent and effective policies on international migration based on the spirit of genuine partnership and common understanding ,  
As a moral and pluralistic society , Indonesia was committed to promoting respect for human rights and taking into account the varied cultural , ethnic and religious composition of the nation , as provided for in the 1993 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action .  
Civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights were mutually reinforcing , and the international community had a responsibility to ensure a holistic approach to the protection of human rights and the elimination of poverty , one of the most urgent human rights challenges .  
The report lacks an objective approach to evaluating the repercussions of the implementation of the programme on the overall humanitarian situation in Iraq in that it neglects to make a comparative analysis of the present situation and the situation in the relevant sectors as it was prior to the imposition of sanctions and in that it ignores the cumulative impact of the sanctions on all the economic , social and cultural aspects of life for the Iraqi people , including future generations .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Reaffirming its objectives , as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations , of achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Recognizes that respect for cultural diversity and the cultural rights of all peoples and nations will enhance cultural pluralism , contributing to wider exchange of knowledge and cultural background , advance the application and enjoyment of universally accepted human rights across the world and foster stable friendly relations among peoples and nations worldwide ;  
Expresses concern that while globalization holds out the promise of prosperity , it brings with it severe challenges for the developing countries , and that the promise of prosperity has not touched the vast majority of the worlds population , especially in the least developed countries , which affects the economic , social and cultural rights of their people ;  
Recognizes that respect for cultural diversity and the cultural rights of all enhances cultural pluralism , contributing to wider exchange of knowledge and understanding of cultural background , advancing the application and enjoyment of universally accepted human rights across the world and fostering stable friendly relations among peoples and nations worldwide ;  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
The full realization of the right to development must be addressed within a global context through a constructive , dialogue-based approach , with objectivity , respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity , impartiality , non-selectivity and transparency as the guiding principles , taking into account the political , historical , social , religious and cultural characteristics of each country ;  
Urges States to eliminate all obstacles to development at all levels , inter alia , by pursuing the promotion and protection of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights and implementing comprehensive development programmes at the national level , integrating those rights into development activities and promoting effective international cooperation ;  
Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,  
Reaffirming the purposes and principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations , which , inter alia , call for collective effort to strengthen friendly relations among nations , remove threats to peace and foster international cooperation in resolving international issues of economic , social , cultural and humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ,  
New Zealand is firmly committed to the universality and indivisibility of human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social , as embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .  
In such a process , all elements of the economic system , of the juridical sphere and of the political regime undergo profound transformations , while social differences are reshaped , cultural values are modified , and the international environment also changes .  
Recognizing that States have developed different cultural and historical uses for firearms and that the purpose of enhancing international cooperation to eradicate illicit transnational trafficking in firearms is not to discourage or diminish lawful leisure or recreational activities such as travel or tourism for sport shooting , hunting and other forms of lawful ownership and use of firearms that are recognized by States Parties ,  
Those were the key elements of an informed approach to global population and development priorities for the twenty-first century and should be addressed in the context of an enabling economic , social and cultural environment at the national and international levels .  
We have always said that Iraq is a great country with a rich cultural heritage , home to one of the oldest civilizations known , and that , by virtue of its abundant natural , mineral , human and other resources , it has huge potential to become an economic force to be reckoned with , not only in the Gulf region but also worldwide .  
The Mexican Government , which accorded high priority to promoting the full participation of women in social , economic , political and cultural life on a par with men , devoted significant resources to programmes designed to eliminate poverty using a gender-specific perspective , and to training women in non-traditional activities ; it was also encouraging independent employment and the creation of microbusinesses , in view of regional , social and gender realities .  
The health of ethnic minority women is undermined by multiple factors : lack of access to health services in the sparsely populated areas where they live , cultural and language barriers to effective contact with health staff , inadequate sanitation and nutrition , and low levels of education and information .  
HTPs are traditional , cultural and religious practices handed down through succeeding generations which are often detrimental to the health and psychological and social well-being of women and girls .  
Such targeting was based on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender as defined in article 7 , paragraph 3 , of the Statute , or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law .  
The Government stressed that the people of the South required reparation and justice for impunity , neo-colonial wars , the extermination of populations and peoples , the defilement of their economic , cultural and natural heritage by countries of the North , the decapitalization of the developing countries charged with paying external debts and the dumping of toxic waste in their territories , to cite only a few examples .  
Help Age International specified that the basic economic , social and cultural rights , the right to development and civil and political rights , regardless of age , gender , ethnic , political and religious background and culture should be drawn together as fundamental standards .  
In its resolution 1998 / 33 , the Commission decided , as part of its efforts to impart a higher visibility to economic , social and cultural rights , to appoint , for a period of three years , a special rapporteur whose mandate would focus on the right to education , as laid down in article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the relevant and applicable provisions of the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights . 
One of the purposes of the United Nations is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ( Article 1 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter ) .  
The right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
The universal implementation of human rights , economic , social and cultural as well as civil and political , is the surest preventive strategy and the most effective way of avoiding the emergence of conflict .  
All human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ; equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of both civil and political , and economic , social and cultural rights .  
In the weeks that followed , members of ethnic minority groups , especially Roma and Serbs , began fleeing Kosovo owing to fear of the killings , kidnapping , looting of properties , evictions , widespread burning of villages , as well as cultural , historical and religious monuments , and other forms of intimidation directed against them.The situation of the Serb , Roma and other minority communities has been a painful one of widespread human rights violations . 
Less visible but nonetheless destructive violations of human rights are the growth of poverty in rich and developing countries alike , and the marginalization caused by violations of economic , social and cultural rights .  
The strong plea of the High Commission is : let us , in the coming century , prevent gross violations of human rights , economic , social and cultural as well as civil and political rights .  
Yet this is only one of the many purposes of our Organization ; to achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all is no less an important goal in our Charter .  
We can not deny that uncontrolled market forces and unfettered short-term capital flows , to take but a few examples of globalization , have had devastating consequences on our economies , social cohesion , political stability and cultural identity in many cases for the worse rather than for the better . 
I am confident that over the next two days the debate will be characterized by new ideas and a renewed commitment to the Proclamation on Ageing , which calls for the recognition of humanity ' s demographic coming of age and the promise it holds for maturing attitudes and innovations in political , legal , social , economic , cultural and spiritual fields as our collective and determined way of preparing ourselves towards social justice , global peace , human development equality in the next century . 
Among the activities promoted by local and regional authorities , labour unions and non-governmental organizations were international and national conferences on the issues associated with ageing , ranging from broad cultural and social debates to more focused discussions of the specific economic , medical and psychological concerns of the elderly .  
I wish to reiterate the commitment of the Kingdom of Swaziland to this process , which is aimed at meeting the challenges faced by our countries and our Organization in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character , and in promoting , as well as encouraging , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , as mapped out in the Charter of the United Nations .  
In our view , the only worthwhile approach to this problem encompasses human rights in a comprehensive , integrated and indivisible way : all human rights , which is to say the basic economic , cultural and social needs of every individual , along with civil and political rights .  
We are confident that the adoption of draft resolution A 54 L . 12 , just introduced by the Ambassador of Burkina Faso , will serve as another basis for promoting in the coming year joint activities which fall within the common purposes of both organizations , whose goals are to ensure international cooperation in seeking solutions to international economic , social , cultural and humanitarian problems .  
The ensuing concentration of power and influence lies in the hands of those nations , institutions and individuals that can master the wealth of information on all aspects of human interaction , be it economic , financial , political , social or cultural .  
One-thousand-six-hundred representatives from 131 countries came to Berlin and cooperated in the drafting of important resolutions on the promotion of international humanitarian law ; on the peaceful coexistence of ethnic , cultural and religious minorities , including migrant populations within a single State ; and on the need to revise the current global financial and economic model .  
This agreement , based on the promotion of international cooperation and the solution of problems of a political , economic , social , cultural or humanitarian nature , is designed to promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The forthcoming worldwide celebration of this epic turning point in time is an occasion imbued with profound historical , religious , spiritual and cultural dimensions of high importance for our people , for the other peoples of the region , for the faithful and for the entire international community .  
We are delighted to see la Francophonie , built up over 30 years of cultural and technical cooperation , take on a new political dimension , particularly since the Hanoi Summit of 1997 , and to see it established as a full-fledged international organization working alongside other regional organizations and at the United Nations .  
In implementing that resolution the two institutions set up cooperative machinery , thanks to a cooperative agreement designed to strengthen their ties on issues of common interest , notably in the political , economic , scientific and cultural areas .  
Can we really imagine modern international political and economic relations , trade , satellites , the Internet , aviation , technological and scientific activity , cultural exchanges , environmental protection , travel , the use of natural resources , exploration of outer space and other vital human activities without a solid international legal foundation ? 
This year such issues include the dumping of nuclear waste and other toxic substances , the regional seas programme of the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , the increasing threat to shipping from piracy and armed robbery at sea , the importance of enhancing the safety of navigation and the continued work of the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization towards a convention on the protection of the underwater cultural heritage .  
In this regard , the United States believes that there are still substantial issues on which there must be consensus before a draft convention can be considered for adoption , in particular the extent of coastal-State jurisdiction over underwater cultural heritage in the exclusive economic zone and on the continental shelf seaward of 24 nautical miles , and the treatment of vessels and aircraft entitled to sovereign immunity .  
Hence , gaining a growing number of adherents across cultural , social and economic lines , democracy is increasingly being recognized as an appropriate response to a wide range of human concerns , and as an ingredient for both sustainable development and lasting peace .  
This stage , of course , is fraught with risks and potential setbacks , especially in developing countries , due to the lack of essential conditions for pursuing a democratic course , foremost among them the existence of an economic system that meets the basic living and cultural needs of a society , in addition to the rule of law and the existence of a civil society that is robust with political and professional activities .  
India is vitally interested in peace , development and stability in the Middle East , a region close to our heart and with which we share bonds of history and culture , reinforced in modern times through multifaceted cooperation encompassing trade , investment , cultural exchanges , technical assistance and human resource development . 
The Second Protocol goes further to develop the Conventions protective powers with regard to military involvement and the need to strengthen the system of protection for those categories of cultural property deemed of vital importance to mankind or whose exceptional cultural and historical value is recognized by national legislation .  
Furthermore , the efforts of UNESCO to link existing databases and identification systems to allow for electronic transmission of information concerning stolen cultural property , including those removed from areas of conflict and occupied territories , is viewed by my delegation as a primary weapon in the ongoing struggle to achieve an advantage over those engaged in the smuggling trade .  
The plundering of the cultural heritage of Cyprus in this area has been so widespread that it led to a decision by the United States , a decision which we warmly welcome , to impose an emergency import restriction in April of this year on Byzantine ecclesiastical and ritual ethnological material from Cyprus , unless such material is accompanied by an export permit issued by the Government of Cyprus .  
However , many developing countries in Asia , Africa and Latin America , which experienced the colonial rule of foreign forces in the past , have lost numerous items of cultural property as a result of looting and destruction by colonialists , and have faced serious problems in the continuation of national tradition and the systemic development of national culture .  
The international community has paid close attention to the protection of national cultural property and established concrete norms of international law in the area of preserving the cultural property of nations through relevant international treaties and conventions .  
My delegation reaffirms its strong conviction that it is necessary to strengthen and extend every possible form of cooperation among all countries within the framework of mutual respect , respect for international law and the relevant international conventions , in order to ensure , at the international level , the protection and restoration of archaeological , historical and cultural treasures .  
We hope that international efforts will bear fruit and that the restoration of cultural properties to their legitimate owners will be encouraged , so that our various cultural heritages , which not only have historical and ancestral value but which also represent the intellectual and moral heritage of future generations , can be preserved .  
An integral part of promoting sustainable human development is respect for all social and economic rights , as well as cultural , civil and political rights .  
As we prepare to enter the twenty-first century , and cognizant of the challenges that will confront our continent and peoples , we emphasize the imperative need and a high sense of urgency to rekindle the aspirations of our peoples for stronger unity , solidarity and cohesion in a larger community of peoples transcending cultural , ideological , ethnic and national differences .  
Such activities should promote the free dissemination and mutual exchange of information and knowledge in cultural and scientific fields , assist in educational , social and economic development , particularly in the developing countries , enhance the qualities of life of all peoples and provide recreation with due respect to the political and cultural integrity of States .  
Women are occupying more important positions in everyday life , and the numbers of women participating in all economic , cultural , political , social and intellectual activities has increased significantly .  
Cairo + 5 is part of a series of international conferences that constitute fundamental elements for the advancement and improvement of the situation of mankind , and particularly that of women , who in many instances suffer major discrimination based on their gender and on historic , social and cultural beliefs that undermine their possibilities to advance and their basic right to occupy their due place in all aspects of social life on an equal footing with men .  
In short , our population policy comprises a set of measures aimed at influencing reproductive behaviour : education , training , promoting the sexual and reproductive health of our population , promoting the values of Nicaraguan society , the right to life from the moment of conception , access to education and basic health care , the irreplaceable role of the family and the social and cultural survival of ethnic groups .  
Plans will also include the design and implementation of a national policy specifically directed towards youth to promote technical and vocational training , recreational and cultural facilities and the fostering of moral and civic values that will enable them to take an active part in Salvadoran society .  
However we address the issues , emphasizing the economic , social and cultural aspects of population and development as integrated into various sectors , my Government strongly believes that the Programme of Action can be achieved only if we can accept the standard rules and procedures in principle but are able , when it comes to the implementation of programmes and activities , to be flexible to allow for adjustments based on every country ' s specific needs .  
Notwithstanding historical and cultural traditions , by which elderly people have always been greatly respected , the improvement of their standard of living requires ongoing political efforts to mobilize and utilize available resources in the context of families , communities , civil organizations and the private sector .  
The population policy thus aims at improving standards of living and quality of life ; improving health and welfare through information and education ; further reducing fertility and mortality rates ; encouraging Kenyans to adhere to small family size ; promoting family stability while recognizing the rights of women and children ; and eliminating social and cultural practices that have a negative impact on women and girls .  
It is the conviction of Malta that it must keep on working on the basis outlined in the Cairo Programme of Action and in accordance with the prevalent ethical and cultural values of Maltese society , as reflected in national legislation , so that , together with the international community , we may promote a decent and fulfilling life for every single human being on our planet and for future generations .  
Promoting healthy and responsible behaviour in the sphere of sexual and reproductive health requires profound cultural change , and the Government therefore considers it important to incorporate population issues into curricula at all levels of the national education system .  
The implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action and those contained in the present document is the sovereign right of each country , consistent with national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its people , and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights .  
The Working Group expressed its deep concern in relation to the continuing grave violations of womens human rights , including civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and the persistent and pervasive discrimination against women .  
We are confident that the Committee jurisprudence will be open to a developing interpretation of the most controversial points , in the light of the practice of other human rights treaty bodies , and also of the peculiarity of the CEDAW Convention , which provides for a wider scope of social and cultural human rights than other international instruments .  
To take strong and appropriate action , through the development and enforcement of specific legislation measures , against any kind of illegal , abusive or exploitative tourist activity , including sexual exploitation abuse , in recognition of the fact that such activities have particularly adverse impacts and pose significant social , health and cultural threats , and that all countries have a role to play in the efforts to stamp them out ;  
To provide relevant direction on research activities , and collect and disseminate information on best practices and techniques , including an appropriate mix of instruments to minimize negative and to promote positive environmental , social and cultural impacts from tourism in developed and developing countries and in countries with economies in transition ;  
Several participants emphasized that criteria used in certification schemes should meet or exceed minimum national standards , where they exist , and should include social , cultural and economic aspects as well as environmental considerations .  
In discussing integrated coastal zone management , participants agreed that there were real biophysical limits to capacity in any particular location as well as cultural limits that should be determined at the local level by the local community .  
Tourism was recognized as a key rapid growth sector in the world economy with important economic , social , cultural and environmental impacts , particularly in small island developing States and tourist destinations with fragile ecosystems .  
Tourism had the potential to make an important contribution to poverty alleviation and economic advancement , particularly through integrated plans with the inclusion of local stakeholders in planning and development and where a key objective remained the protection of the cultural and natural assets of the tourist locality .  
The Committee regrets that its dialogue with representatives of the State party regarding the root causes of the armed conflict was inconclusive ; the absence in the report of statistics relating to the north and east of the country can only reinforce the view of the Committee that the question of discrimination in relation to the economic , social and cultural rights of ethnic groups remains the central issue in the armed conflict in Sri Lanka .  
The Committee is fully aware of the human and material costs of the armed conflict in Sri Lanka and the deleterious effects this has on the economic , social and cultural rights of every person living in the country .  
The enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights is hindered by the absence of the rule of law , the existence in Nigeria of military governments , the suspension of the Constitution in favour of rule by military decree and the concomitant resort to intimidation , and the negative effects of widespread corruption on the functioning of governmental institutions .  
Detailed information , including the latest statistical data , is also requested on the progressive realization of economic , social and cultural rights in East Jerusalem , keeping in mind the concerns raised by the Committee in the relevant paragraphs of these concluding observations .  
The Committee recommends that the State party accord equal treatment to both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights in terms of their domestic legal status and that if measures are taken to incorporate civil and political rights treaty obligations consideration be given to similar measures in relation to economic , social and cultural rights .  
The Committee notes that since 1994 , in addressing the budget deficits by slashing social expenditure , the State party has not paid sufficient attention to the adverse consequences for the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights by the Canadian population as a whole , and by vulnerable groups in particular .  
Yet while IMF rigorously monitored loan recipient countries ' compliance with loan conditions for financial reform , it only lamented the ill _ effects on economic , social and cultural rights and left them to be dealt with by other international organizations and bodies .  
The benefits of free and rapid information exchange and enhanced enjoyment of freedom of expression were offset by the culturally homogenizing effect of globalization , which undermined existing cultural identity and weakened various ethical norms and social cohesion .  
Indeed , at its forty-ninth session in August 1997 , the Sub-Commission adopted resolution 1997-7 in which it requested one of its experts , Mr . Mustapha Mehedi , to prepare a working paper on the right to education with the purpose of explaining the content of the right to education , taking account , in particular , of its social dimension and the freedoms it includes and of its dual civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural character .  
The Chairperson reiterated his concern about the persistent lack of recognition of economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to education , as human rights , not only at the national level but also in various international entities .  
In calling for a renewed commitment to respect economic , social and cultural rights , the Committee wishes to emphasize that international organizations , as well as the Governments that have created and manage them , have a strong and continuous responsibility to take whatever measures they can to assist Governments to act in ways which are compatible with their human rights obligations and to seek to devise policies and programmes which promote respect for those rights .  
The World Conference on Human Rights held in 1993 underscored the interdependence of all human rights , and emphasized that all societies should work to ensure the enjoyment by all their members of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , including their right to development .  
The Convention codifies women ' s right to non _ discrimination and equality with men and also establishes that women and men are equally entitled to the full enjoyment and exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural , civil or any other field .  
To that end , they pledge to increase their efforts to assess factors and obstacles that impinge on women ' s enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social , cultural and other rights and to suggest specific actions on how such obstacles might be overcome so that full enjoyment of human rights by all , without discrimination , may be realized .  
The adoption of a rigid classification of economic , social and cultural rights which puts them , by definition , beyond the reach of the courts would thus be arbitrary and incompatible with the principle that the two sets of human rights are indivisible and interdependent .  
The promotion of educational and information programmes designed to enhance awareness and understanding of economic , social and cultural rights , both within the population at large and among particular groups such as the public service , the judiciary , the private sector and the labour movement ;  
The mandate of the permanent forum should be as broad as possible and contain all matters concerning indigenous peoples amongst which should be included civil , political , economic , social , cultural , developmental , environmental , health , education , language , land , resources , territorial , gender and children ' s rights.In particular , it should deal with the following , among others : 
The establishment of the permanent forum should have a positive impact on construction and development for indigenous peoples in areas such as economic , political , social and cultural rights , human rights , the environment , health and the expansion of cross _ cultural bilingual education based on the world view of the indigenous peoples in each State .  
In industrialized and developing countries , young people are living at a time when profound economic , political , social , cultural and environmental changes are occurring , resulting in both opportunities and constraints .  
Young women and men should therefore be involved from childhood in decisions relating to their own lives , and step by step in democratic decisions for their school , their community , in local national social and cultural organizations as well as at the national , regional and international levels .  
Also bearing in mind that democracy , development and respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
This rapid expansion denotes the development of a modern movement of associations which is determined to tackle the ever more pressing economic , social and cultural concerns and is helping to improve communications between the State and civil society .  
However , the efforts to spread basic education in rural areas are hampered by a number of constraints of a geographical , economic and cultural nature ( absence of means of communication , scattered habitations , mountainous areas in certain regions , etc . ) .  
In implementation of high royal instructions placing rural areas at the heart of governmental strategy , in the framework of the policy enabling all citizens to participate in cultural life and to contribute to the improvement of rural living conditions , and with a view to improving the geographical distribution of cultural services and facilities , the Ministry of Culture has initiated , in cooperation with local communities , an extensive programme to build and equip libraries in rural centres .  
In the framework of the decentralization and democratisation of cultural life , having regard to the role of culture in all economic and social development , and in order to enable rural areas to enjoy appropriate cultural facilities in accordance with law 47-96 on regional organization , permanent committees responsible for educational and cultural matters have been established as part of the sixteen recently created regional councils .  
These consultative bodies , comprising representatives of all the social partners concerned ( local communities , cultural associations and unions , private and banking sector , personalities from the arts and literature , etc . ) , constitute a genuine forum for debating cultural policy and determining the direction and priorities of cultural actions . 
These achievements have been made more appreciable through the promotion of social dialogue following the signing of the agreement of 1 August 1996 by the Government and the social partners , the revitalization of the consultative process , and the gradual emancipation of civil society and its increased involvement in economic , social and cultural development .  
Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security , and their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen economic , social , cultural and environmental cooperation in the region ,  
The primary objectives of UNISPACE III are : ( a ) to promote effective means of using space technology to assist in the solution of problems of regional and global significance ; and ( b ) to strengthen the capabilities of Member States , in particular the developing countries , to apply space technology for economic , social and cultural development .  
She hopes that the legal aspects , geographical conditions , economic , social and cultural factors and the environmental and human considerations underpinning the wise decision to abandon this scheme will be remembered should there be any similar plans in the future .  
In its resolution 1998-24 , the Commission on Human Rights decided to appoint for a three-year period a special rapporteur on the effects of foreign debt on the full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights , and requested the Special Rapporteur to submit to the Commission on an annual basis , beginning at its fifty-fifth session , an analytical report on the implementation of the resolution .  
The General Assembly has established the following six main committees : First Committee , disarmament and international security issues ; Second Committee , economic and financial issues ; Third Committee , social , humanitarian and cultural issues ; Fourth Committee , special political and decolonization issues ; Fifth Committee , administrative and budgetary issues ; and Sixth Committee , legal issues .  
Non-discrimination is the overriding principle of international human rights law and thus applies to civil and political , as well as to economic , social and cultural rights , as well as to the rights of the child which cut across these two categories .  
We are of the opinion that the workshops and conferences held on the subject of the permanent forum reveal a consensus in favour of endowing the permanent forum with competence in respect not only of the cultural , economic , social and political rights of the indigenous peoples but also educational and health matters affecting the indigenous peoples , with a view to promoting better services corresponding to their way of life .  
HTPs are traditional , cultural and religious practices handed down through succeeding generations which are often detrimental to the health and psychological and social well-being of women and girls .  
For instance , when local arts and crafts and cultural practices are adapted to suit foreign tastes , the result can be poor quality handicrafts , unethical trading practices and fake antiques , as well as the deterioration of cultural dances , music and festivals .  
The major challenge facing the international community is to assist Governments , especially those of developing countries , to promote tourism development within the framework of sustainable development in order to maximize the potential economic and social benefits from tourism without damaging the environment or cultural assets .  
The main adverse impacts of tourism on the environment are connected to pressure on natural resources , harm to wildlife and habitats ( with associated loss of biological diversity ) , the generation of pollution and wastes , and social and cultural pressures related to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity .  
WTO has also been active , focusing in particular on planning at the national and local levels and on indicators for sustainable tourism , and addressing sustainable tourism in a number of regional forums . 4 A number of other international organizations have developed activities for sustainable tourism ; in particular , UNESCO has addressed , inter alia , tourism in World Heritage Sites and cultural tourism . 
In its resolution 1998-33 , the Commission decided , as part of its efforts to impart a higher visibility to economic , social and cultural rights , to appoint , for a period of three years , a special rapporteur whose mandate would focus on the right to education , as laid down in article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the relevant and applicable provisions of the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights .  
In its decision 1998-102 , the Commission decided to authorize the open-ended working group on structural adjustment programmes and economic , social and cultural rights to meet for one week , at least four weeks before the fifty _ fifth session of the Commission , to consider the report of the independent expert and the comments received thereon and to report to the Commission at its fifty _ fifth session .  
The political and electoral platform has emphasized the migrants cost to society , yet has omitted their very important contributions in the cultural , scientific , technical , social and economic fields . 
Protection , however , extends beyond safeguarding physical security to encompass the broad range of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights provided for under international human rights law .  
The economic , ecological , social and cultural systems of small island developing States are fragile and highly sensitive to external environmental , social and economic change .  
The International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , which is binding on Bosnia and Herzegovina , contains some of the most significant international legal provisions establishing economic , social and cultural rights , including rights relating to work in just and favourable conditions , to social protection , to an adequate standard of living , to the highest attainable standards of health , to education and to enjoyment of benefits of cultural freedom .  
The observer for the Indian Movement Tupaj Amaru stated that , while considering the draft declaration , special attention should be given to such notions as the recognition of the right of indigenous peoples to define themselves as peoples , the principle of self-determination , the exercise of collective ancestral ownership of land , the sovereignty over natural resources , the legal protection of cultural and intellectual property .  
The observer for the Inuit Circumpolar Conference reiterated support for the draft declaration in its current form which , if adopted , would guarantee the political , social , economic and cultural rights of indigenous peoples and lead to a path of peace based on mutual respect .  
Tourism is a labour-intensive activity that does not require a high level of specialization , and if well managed and of the proper size , it may exert a strong attractive force on the rest of the islands economic system , including conservation of certain traditional activities , such as agriculture and fishing , and preservation of islands cultural heritage and natural assets .  
In order to overcome the difficulties , intensive technical assistance will be needed from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , including training courses , seminars and workshops , with a view to removing the major political , cultural and social obstacles to the consolidation of the democratic process and the effective exercise of human rights .  
In order to overcome the difficulties , intensive technical assistance will be needed from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , including training courses , seminars and workshops , with a view to removing the major political , cultural and social obstacles to the consolidation of the democratic process and the effective exercise of human rights .  
Efforts directed at the elimination of all inferior treatment and discrimination of which women are victims should be continued until they achieve equal opportunities with men and are fully integrated into the process of socio _ economic , cultural and political development of the country ;  
While respecting Algerias stages of political , economic , sociological and cultural development and acknowledging that popular support is necessary for any reform relating to womens rights , the Committee encourages the Government , non-governmental organizations , intellectuals and the mass media to do everything possible by means of publicity and public awareness campaigns to encourage more enlightened attitudes and accelerate womens emancipation .  
For the purposes of the present Convention , the term discrimination against women shall mean any distinction , exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition , enjoyment or exercise by women , irrespective of their marital status , on a basis of equality of men and women , of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural , civil or any other field .  
Apartheid was introduced in 1948 by the National Party as a system of racial segregation designed to maintain a situation of inequality between the Whites and the other ethnic and racial groups living in South Africa , in the economic , social , political and cultural spheres .  
A civic training programme , centred mainly on essential aspects of democracy , the South African Constitution , the Human Rights Charter , international humanitarian law , cultural diversity and military ethics , has been published in a manual entitled South African National Defense Force Civic Education Guidelines and is being implemented .  
In that predominantly Kurdish area , long-standing grievances , involving neglect , discrimination and cultural and social repression , promoted substantial support for secessionist and autonomist views , spawning the establishment of the Kurdistan Workers ' Party ( PKK ) , which , in 1984 , launched a violent and ruthless campaign of opposition to central government authority , including the reported killing in Turkey and abroad of civilians considered hostile to the organization ' s objectives .  
The Vienna Conference emphasized the need for Governments and the United Nations to make the full and equal participation of women in political , civil , economic , social and cultural life , at the national , regional and international levels , and the eradication of all forms of discrimination on grounds of sex a priority goal of their policies .  
The wide-ranging dialogue , with questions from Governments and non _ governmental organizations , covered such issues as female genital mutilation ; violence against women ; womens economic , social and cultural rights ; and ways and means of improving United Nations actions protecting the human rights of women .  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
Further to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights recognized that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his her economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his her civil and political rights .  
In adopting the Declaration on the Right to Development , the General Assembly , in resolution 41-128 , recognized that development is a comprehensive , cultural , political , economic , and social process which aims at constant improvement of the well-being of the entire population and of all individuals on the basis of their active , free and meaningful participation in development and the fair distribution of benefits resulting therefrom .  
The right to development is an inalienable human right by which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized ( art . 1 ( 1 ) ) .  
In resolution 51-178 , the General Assembly expressed its solidarity with people living in poverty in all countries and reaffirmed that the satisfaction of basic human needs was an essential element of poverty eradication , those needs being closely interrelated and comprising nutrition , health , water and sanitation , education , employment , housing and participation in cultural and social rights .  
The poverty trap in which the poorest of the poor find themselves shows how human rights are indivisible and interdependent : the right to an adequate standard of living , to housing , to education , to work , to good health , to employment , to the protection of the family , to respect for privacy , to legal status and registration as a citizen , to life and physical integrity , to justice and participation in political , social and cultural life .  
The contribution of those living in extreme poverty could be of decisive importance in current thinking on sustainable human development and the right to development , especially since the concept of development is no longer viewed only from an economic standpoint , but also in social and cultural terms .  
International economic sanctions , particularly when imposed by the Security Council , should be conceived in such a way as to avoid aggravating conditions of extreme poverty in the countries concerned.In particular , they should be compatible with the effective exercise of human rights _ and especially economic , social and cultural rights _ by civilians .  
Although at times a writer may make outrageous statements , even wounding cultural sensitivities and commonly held beliefs , literature remains a basic medium through which imagination and the striving of the human mind are expressed most freely and in the most provocative forms .  
Article 1 of the Declaration states that the right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
To ask the leading human rights non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council to submit information and insights relevant to the elimination of obstacles to development resulting from failure to observe civil and political rights , as well as economic , social and cultural rights .  
The promotion of educational and information programmes designed to enhance awareness and understanding of economic , social and cultural rights both within the population at large and among particular groups such as the public service , the judiciary , the private sector and the labour movement ;  
The Committee called upon States parties to ensure that the mandates accorded to all national human rights institutions include appropriate attention to economic , social and cultural rights and requested States parties to include details both on the mandates and the major relevant activities of such institutions in their reports to the Committee .  
Participants affirmed that national sovereignty should not be exercised at the expense of respect for human rights , and that real efforts towards the co-development of countries north and south of the Mediterranean , as well as the strengthening of the rule of law , would contribute to reducing erratic migratory flows and facilitate economic cooperation , mutual understanding and cultural exchanges .  
The mandate of the permanent forum should be broad enough to cover the concerns of indigenous peoples , including cultural , civil , political and economic rights , health issues , the rights of women and children , education , development , the environment , human rights and conflict prevention and resolution ;  
During the meeting , the heads of State conducted a comprehensive analysis of the state and prospects for the development of cooperation between the countries of the region in major policy areas , mutually advantageous economic ties , and social and cultural life as well as a thorough exchange of views on pressing problems of international relations .  
Within the context of the International Year of Mobilization against Racism , Racial Discrimination , Xenophobia and Related Intolerance , decided by the General Assembly , the High Commissioner should take the initiative of organizing important world cultural meetings , raising awareness , for example , among international sporting , musical and other artistic associations , universities , trade unions and national institutions .  
A country should be encouraged to put itself forward and consideration should be given , with assistance from the United Nations , to the creation of an international university or foundation for dialogue between cultures and civilizations , which will provide scientific , cultural and legal instruction and undertake on a permanent basis , information and educational activities aimed at eradicating racial prejudices and discrimination .  
That , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy their economic , social and cultural rights , as well as their civil and political rights ;  
That the realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms , and particularly economic , social and cultural rights , is a dynamic process and that , as is evident in today ' s world , a great deal remains to be accomplished ;  
To secure , through national development policies and with international assistance and cooperation , full realization of economic , social and cultural rights , giving particular attention to the individuals , most often women and children , especially girls , and communities living in extreme poverty and therefore most vulnerable and disadvantaged ;  
To consider in this context , as appropriate , the desirability of drawing up national action plans identifying steps to improve the situation of human rights in general with specific benchmarks designed to give effect to minimum essential levels of enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights ;  
It was pleased to note that many countries had taken legal measures to eliminate cultural , religious or traditional practices , including female genital mutilation , that violated the human rights of women and girls.Although in keeping with the duty of States to protect all human rights , such actions were insufficient by themselves to end those practices and should be supplemented with education and public awareness campaigns .  
The implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action and those contained in the present document is the sovereign right of each country , consistent with national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its people , and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights . 6 . The Programme of Action recommended a set of interdependent quantitative goals and objectives .  
Expresses concern that while globalization holds out the promise of prosperity , it brings with it severe challenges for the developing countries , and that the promise of prosperity has not touched the vast majority of the worlds population , especially in the least developed countries , which affects the economic , social and cultural rights of their people ;  
The full realization of the right to development must be addressed within a global context through a constructive , dialogue-based approach , with objectivity , respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity , impartiality , non-selectivity and transparency as the guiding principles , taking into account the political , historical , social , religious and cultural characteristics of each country ;

The right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
The need for efficient national mechanisms such as national human rights commissions to ensure respect for civil , economic , cultural , political and social rights , without any distinction whatsoever , was also underlined .  
The most fundamental flaw reflected in the approach of the Independent Expert concerning the development compact is the idea that economic , social and cultural rights are entitlements that require correlated legal duties and obligations .  
Examples included providing accurate , up-to-date and high-quality information ; instituting regular homehost country exchanges ; promoting creative mechanisms to overcome cultural and linguistic gaps ; using interregional exchange forums ; providing financial assistance and investment insurance ; and agreements on investment protection and double taxation , market access and technology transfer .  
The World Conference would offer an exceptional opportunity to examine a wide range of issues of the utmost relevance today , including ethnic cleansing , the emergence of contemporary forms of slavery , traffic in humans , discrimination against minorities , migrant workers , indigenous peoples and refugees , the preservation of cultural identity in multi-cultural societies , racism on the Internet , and new and more subtle forms of racism .  
The European Union held the view that space activities must be carried out in line with two fundamental principles , namely that space technology must promote social , economic and cultural development as well as the protection of the terrestrial and spatial environment and that access to outer space must be regulated on an equitable basis in the light of the real needs of the developing countries .  
The social and cultural impact of territorial fragmentation does not lend itself easily to a summary in numerical terms , but the scenario in that area is no less severe than that depicted in relation to the economic rights data .  
In light of article 4 of the Convention , the Committee recommends that , the State party undertake a study on the impact of the Governments budgetary resources allocated for children and their families in order to assess their effectiveness and to develop a comprehensive strategy to ensure the full implementation of the economic , social and cultural rights of children to the maximum extent of available resources , in particular at the local level and with respect to children belonging to the most vulnerable groups in society .  
The Committee recommends that the State party take all effective measures , including enacting or rescinding legislation where necessary , to prevent and eliminate discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief in the recognition , exercise and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms in all fields of civil , economic , political , social and cultural life .  
The Committee reiterates its recommendation that all measures to implement economic , social and cultural rights should be undertaken to the maximum extent of . . . available resources in the light of articles 2 , 3 and 4 of the Convention and that particular attention be paid to effective budget mobilization and allocation , in particular for the protection of children belonging to vulnerable and marginalized groups .  
Thus , for example , this article underlines the importance of respect for parents , of the need to view rights within their broader ethical , moral , spiritual , cultural or social framework , and of the fact that most childrens rights , far from being externally imposed , are embedded within the values of local communities . 
The Council inspected the minutes of the nineteenth meeting of the committee on industrial cooperation , where agreement had been reached on the amended model normative regime for industrial organization in the GCC States , and the minutes of the tenth meeting of the committee on scientific and cultural cooperation .  
Recalling that , according to the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights , the international community must treat all human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis , and that while the significance of the national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
Reaffirm that development is a comprehensive economic , social , cultural and political process , which aims at the constant improvement of the well-being of the entire population and of all individuals on the basis of their active , free and meaningful participation in development and in the fair distribution of benefits resulting therefrom ;  
Recall the historical fact that among the most hideous manifestations of racial discrimination the African continent and Diaspora have suffered , namely the slave trade , all forms of exploitation , colonialism and apartheid , were essentially motivated by economic objectives and competition between colonial Powers for strategic territorial gains , appropriation , and control over and pillage of natural and cultural resources ;  
Ms . Schpp-Schilling acknowledged that sexual stereotyping existed in both developed and developing countries , but it was particularly difficult to end the practice when it was deeply rooted in cultural and customary traditions .  
Even after signing the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement , the Ethiopian hordes had wilfully , wantonly and methodically launched indiscriminate attacks against civilian targets , taken prisoners , tortured , raped and murdered , attacked and destroyed villages , public facilities , cultural and religious infrastructures and institutions and engaged in ethnic cleansing , causing large numbers of persons to become displaced .  
In Australia , where , a few decades previously , the Government had abducted over 100,000 aboriginal children in order to place them with white families , discrimination against and segregation of indigenous people continued and their economic , social and cultural rights , particularly the right to own land , were restricted . 
Stressing the variety of forms , modalities and experiences of democratic societies , taking into account national and regional particularities , the various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds , and the diversity of economic , political , cultural and legal systems ,  
Expresses its deep conviction that a social order able to guarantee the full realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms can only be founded on a democratic society based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic and cultural system and on the peoples full participation in all aspects of their lives , and characterized by equity , social justice and non-discrimination ;

Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , discrimination against , inter alia , Africans , people of African descent , Arabs and Muslims , and incidents of xenophobia , Negrophobia , anti-Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Although recent advances in genetic research have made it possible to identify the genetic origin of the diseases affecting human beings and to develop prevention and early detection strategies , this same genetic information can also be used to establish new parameters for classifying individuals on the basis of their genetic quality , which undoubtedly will have unpredictable consequences for individual economic , social , cultural and professional development . 
Stresses the necessity of establishing , at the national level , an enabling legal , political , economic and social environment for the realization of the right to development and emphasizes the importance of democratic , participatory , transparent and accountable governance , as well as the need for efficient national mechanisms such as national human rights commissions , to ensure respect for civil , economic , cultural , political and social rights , without any distinction ;  
Invites all special rapporteurs and existing thematic mechanisms of the Commission in the field of economic , social and cultural rights to pay due attention , within the scope of their respective mandates , to the negative impact and consequences of unilateral coercive measures ;

Recalling also that the eradication of widespread poverty , including its most persistent forms , and the full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights and civil and political rights remain interrelated goals ,  
Deeply concerned that , 53 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness are particularly severe in developing countries , while acknowledging the achievements made in many parts of the world ,  
Reaffirming the human right to be free from discrimination and the equal right of women and men to the enjoyment of all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights as stipulated , inter alia , in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ,

This encompasses a broad and balanced approach , placing equal emphasis on all human rights civil and political , economic , social and cultural , as well as the right to development .  
The pressures faced by families in efforts to promote the upbringing and education of the rising generation resulting from economic , social and cultural changes and the tremendous impact of globalization , with its adverse effects on the system of values , concepts , attitudes and the feeling of belonging , and on family and communal ties ;  
As indicated above , ACC continued to deepen its shared understanding of the synergies that have to be fostered among the different dimensions of globalization ( financial , economic , social , cultural , technological and human rights ) , so as to strengthen the knowledge base required for the development of integrated approaches that can serve to bridge the growing divides that globalization is bringing about in many areas , and to spread the benefits of globalization to all .  
ACCs deliberations on information and communication technologies ( ICT ) focused more broadly on the contribution ICT could make in advancing some of the basic objectives that the system was endeavouring to support and advance : the integration of developing countries in the global knowledge society , and the pursuit of growth and efficiency in key sectors of the economy , in ways that serve to further the social and cultural goals of societies . 
In several resolutions , including 2001 / 30 on the realization in all countries of the economic , social and cultural rights , the Commission noted the entry into force of the Optional Protocol and encouraged its further ratification or accession , and also decided on the appointment of an independent expert to examine the question of a draft optional protocol to the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights .  
Recognizing that , national and international actions are required to combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , in order to ensure the full enjoyment of human rights , which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and to improve the living conditions of men , women and children of all nations [ at the , economic , social , cultural , civil , and political level ] ,

The Commission noted that the highest level of political commitment to the empowerment and advancement of women and to the prevention , research , care and treatment of sexually transmitted infections , especially HIV / AIDS , must be secured .  
Governments , with the assistance of relevant United Nations entities , needed to adopt a long-term , timely , coherent and integrated AIDS prevention policy , with public information , life skills-based education programmes specifically tailored to the needs of women and girls , adapted to their social cultural context and sensitivities and the specific needs in their life cycle .

Article 55 of the Charter explicitly recognizes that solutions to international economic , social , health and related problems , international , cultural and educational cooperation and universal respect for human rights are all essential for the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations .  
It also agreed to the importance of peace-building as a broad-based approach to conflict prevention , and stressed the need to address the political , military , humanitarian , human rights , environmental , economic , social , cultural and demographic root causes of conflicts .  
Efforts to prevent armed conflict should promote a broad range of human rights , including not only civil and political rights but also economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to development .

In May 2001 , the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights adopted a statement on poverty which recognizes that poverty constitutes a denial of human rights and defines poverty as a human condition characterized by the deprivation of the resources , capabilities , choices , security and power necessary for the enjoyment of an adequate standard of living and other civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights ( A / CONF . 191 / BP / 7 ) .  
The Sub-Commission has already addressed impunity involving civil and political rights , as well as economic , social and cultural rights , in two excellent studies .  [ 175 ] While neither study directly addresses terrorist acts , terrorist acts viewed as impairing civil and political rights have been those drawing the most attention in the Commission and the Sub-Commission and on the part of the Special Rapporteur in her previous work and in the present report as well .  
We further express our determination to maximize the benefits of globalization with a view to the realization of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development , through strengthening cooperation to create increased opportunities for trade , economic growth and sustainable development , global communications through the use of new technologies and increased intercultural exchange through the preservation and promotion of cultural diversity , which may contribute to the eradication of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;

We regret the existence of inequitable political , economic , cultural and social conditions in which intolerance and racial discrimination breed and fester , and we believe that genuine equality of opportunity for development is fundamental for the eradication of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance .  
We also understand that discrimination contributes to inequitable political , economic , cultural and social conditions , and that genuine equality of opportunity [ for development ] is fundamental for the eradication of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;

In the above-mentioned resolution , the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to prepare a report on human rights and cultural diversity , taking into account the views of Member States , relevant United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations , as well as the considerations in the resolution regarding the recognition and importance of cultural diversity among all peoples ; and decided to continue consideration of the question at its fifty-sixth session under the item entitled Human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
It implies a commitment to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms , particularly the rights of groups that are disadvantaged or victims of discrimination and persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and cultural minorities to have free access to the expression of their own culture and that of others .  
The right to food is the right to have regular , permanent and unobstructed access , either directly or by means of financial purchases , to quantitatively and qualitatively adequate and sufficient food corresponding to the cultural traditions of the people to which the consumer belongs , and which ensures a physical and mental , individual and collective , fulfilling and dignified life free from anxiety .  
However , even the poorest country is bound to ensure the highest level their resources will permit and , at the very least , a basic minimum level of economic , social and cultural rights . 20 The concept of progressive realization can not be used to justify persistent injustice and inequality . 
Even when economic , social and cultural rights are laid down in national constitutions , they are often considered guidelines for Governments , rather than individual rights that are enforceable in the courts .  
It also argues , in paragraph 10 of its General Comment No . 9 , that to put economic , social and cultural rights beyond the reach of courts is arbitrary and incompatible with the international principle that those rights are indivisible and interdependent with civil and political rights .  
In contrast to economic , social and cultural rights , international humanitarian law is not subject to progressive realization , but must always be implemented immediately .  
Clearly economic , social , cultural and hence nutritional situations tend to be extremely varied from one country to another and a model law would fail to address the problems experienced by people in their everyday lives and produce legislative solutions ill-adapted to legal and political systems in different countries .  
The Ministers noted with appreciation enhanced CEI cooperation in the fields of promoting sustainable social , economic and ecological development , infrastructure and private sector investment , SME development , transborder and interregional cooperation ( such as the enhanced Szeged Process ) , human resource development , cultural as well as scientific and technological cooperation ( such as the Italian-Slovenian transfrontier television project ) , including in the field of geodesy , combating organized crime , protection of minorities , womens entrepreneurship and youth affairs .  
All this may give rise to interference by mercenaries who , motivated by payment , may commit terrorist acts , attacks against persons , cultural objects or economic facilities , engage in illicit trafficking , or provoke armed or other conflicts with a view to carrying out violent and destabilizing assignments which have a profound impact on the enjoyment of human rights .  
Article 1 of the Treaty establishing the Community refers to the establishment of an overall economic union based on the implementation of a strategy by means of development plans that are complementary to the national development plans of member States and that include investment in the agricultural , industrial , social and cultural fields and in energy , and it looks towards the financial future of the Community with every confidence . 
The Preparatory Committee drew up a list of participants in the conference , including all Member States of the United Nations and observers , the various related components of the United Nations secretariat , specialized agencies , UNESCO chairs in the field of human rights and interreligious dialogue , treaty and non-treaty human rights mechanisms regional organizations , international organizations of an educational or cultural nature , national and regional human rights institutes , national human rights commissions , and experts from religious or confessional groups and non-governmental organizations .  
However , it must always be borne in mind that the task is complicated by the fact that it is not merely a question of combating laws , regulations and policies , but also of combating cultural practices that are rooted in collective memory and in the deep ancestral beliefs of people , including women themselves , and that , sometimes these harmful practices , although often contrary to religions , are perpetuated in the name of religion , or imputed to religion .  
One might therefore consider that action for the promotion of human rights should involve , on the one hand , action for the establishment , consolidation and protection of democracy , as an expression of human rights on the political level , and , on the other , action aimed at limiting and reducing extreme poverty and promoting the rights of individuals and peoples to development , as an expression of human rights and of economic , social and cultural solidarity among human beings .  
Those rights concern historical , cultural and ethnic identity , the juridical identity of indigenous communities , communal possession of traditional lands , bilingual and intercultural education , the preservation of indigenous heritage , measures to promote human development and participation in the management of their natural resources .  6 .  Argentina has established a National Institute against Discrimination , Xenophobia and Racism , a decentralized body within the framework of the Ministry of the Interior .  
Following the establishment of the Republic of Yemen in 1990 , which ushered in an era of democratization and active civil institutions , the number of non-governmental organizations and institutions engaged in activities relating to the protection and promotion of human rights in general or focusing on a particular field , such as political , civil , economic or cultural rights or protection of the rights of a specific section of society , such as women , children or the disabled , increased considerably and currently amounts to about 2,000 .  
This illegal action , which was authorized by the Israeli high court , aims to alter the legal status and the religious and cultural character of Occupied Jerusalem , in flagrant violation of relevant Security Council resolutions and the fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 1949 . 
Subscribes to the remarks of the expert to the effect that various obstacles linked to the realization of the right of everyone to drinking water supply and sanitation seriously impede the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , and that equality is an essential element for effective participation in the realization of the right to development and the right to a healthy environment ;  
Recommends to the Commission on Human Rights that it authorize the Sub-Commission to appoint Mr . El Hadji Guiss as Special Rapporteur to conduct a detailed study on the relationship between the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights and the promotion of the realization of the right to drinking water supply and sanitation , at national and international level , taking also into account questions related to the realization of the right to development , in order to determine the most effective means of reinforcing activities in this field ;  
A number of interventions recalled article 1 of the Declaration on the Right to Development of 1986 , which stated that The right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
In the opinion of Qatar , the right of peoples to self-determination is one of the most important ones acquired in the field of human rights , yet ongoing occupation is unquestionably impeding the development of international economic cooperation , preventing the social and cultural advancement of peoples subjected to occupation and negating the ideal of universal peace to which the United Nations is aspiring .  
Mindful that , in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , the World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , reaffirmed that the human person was the central subject of development and underlined the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,  
Reaffirming that , as declared in article 28 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in the Universal Declaration can be fully realized and that , as declared in article 25 , paragraph 1 , everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the full realization of economic , social and cultural rights ,  
Recalling that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his or her economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his or her civil and political rights ,  
Recalling also Commission resolution 2001 / 31 on human rights and extreme poverty , in which the Commission expressed its deep concern that 53 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continued to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness were particularly severe in developing countries , while acknowledging the achievements made in many parts of the world ,  
Reaffirming the objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations on achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without discrimination or distinction as to race , colour , sex , social class , descent , national or ethnic origin , language or religion ,  
Noting that in its resolution 52 / 111 of 12 December 1997 , in which it decided to convene the World Conference against Racism , Racial Discrimination , Xenophobia and Related Intolerance , the General Assembly set as one of the main objectives of the Conference the review of the political , historical , social , cultural and other factors leading to racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Considers it essential that the international community continue to follow very closely the situation of women and girls in the territories controlled by Afghan armed groups and bring the necessary pressure to bear so that all the restrictions imposed on women , which constitute flagrant and systematic violations of all the internationally recognized economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights , are removed ;  
In addition , Article 1 calls for achieving international cooperation to solve international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
As a result of a deliberate policy methodically implemented by Turkey in the occupied areas of Cyprus , the cultural identity of the northern part of the island , which dates back to the seventh millennium BC , is in grave danger of being permanently and completely destroyed .  
He recognized the interconnectedness of economics and politics and made a reference to the universally recognized understanding that all rights civil , political , economic , social and cultural , and the right to development are indivisible and interconnected .  
To all the parties to the conflict , political parties and key sectors of civil society in the country : ( a ) that they commit themselves fully and in good faith to the Inter-Congolese Dialogue , avoiding pointless arguments and always keeping their eyes on the goal the establishment of a democratic , participatory system and full respect for civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
In paragraph 32 of its concluding observations on the initial report of Israel , the Committee requested the State party to provide additional information on the realization of economic , social and cultural rights in the occupied territories , in order to complete the State partys initial report and thereby ensure full compliance with its reporting obligations .  
The Committee reminds the State party that even during armed conflict , fundamental human rights must be respected and that basic economic , social and cultural rights as part of the minimum standards of human rights are guaranteed under customary international law and are also prescribed by international humanitarian law .  
The Committee expresses its deep concern about the State partys continuing gross violations of economic , social and cultural rights in the occupied territories , especially the severe measures adopted by the State party to restrict the movement of civilians between points within and outside the occupied territories , severing their access to food , water , health care , education and work .  
Recognizing the importance , from an analytical and operational point of view , of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development and of the need for comprehensive , coherent and effective policies on international migration based on the spirit of genuine partnership and common understanding ,  
High rates of unemployment , in particular among young people , the non-functioning of the national safety net system , scarce opportunities for private investment , declining domestic production and other financial , cultural and criminal factors have contributed to political instability .  
The effects have included a major decline in the countrys gross domestic product and in per capita income ; a sharp increase in mortality rates , especially among mothers and children ; marked deterioration in infrastructure , especially in connection with the water supply , sewerage , electricity and hospitals and health centres ; a drop in school enrolment to 53 per cent and the consequent cultural and scientific impoverishment ; and the destruction of the social fabric .  
Despite the indivisible nature of Euro-Mediterranean security and despite the promises of partnership that have been reiterated on many occasions , the Mediterranean , as a recent declaration of the European Parliament declared , has become a zone that is a microcosm of the principal contradictions of the twenty-first century and is likely to produce irreversible demographic , economic , political and cultural divisions .  
In the developing countries generally , limited infrastructure , inadequate regulatory systems , access costs and lack of human resources were serious handicaps to connectivity and the use of information and communication technologies , which were , moreover , not geared to their languages or their social and cultural contexts . 
A worldwide campaign of solidarity was needed to meet all those growing challenges with a view to strengthening international cooperation and transparency based on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations , and of international law , namely , equality among States , non-intervention in the internal affairs of States , the right of peoples to self-defence , to self-determination and to oppose foreign occupation , and respect for cultural diversity and diversity of beliefs .  
On instructions from His Highness Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan , President of the United Arab Emirates , to make the individual in that State the pivot and the purpose of national development endeavours , the State had adopted legislation , policies and plans aimed at developing national human resources through the development and modernization of educational , health and cultural institutions and the establishment of centres to train young people and develop their scientific and technological skills in accordance with national development needs .  
At the same time , many delegates stressed that democracy was inconceivable without human rights and , in particular , the rights of women , children and minorities , and that it requires the gradual expansion of political space in order to guarantee the full exercise of the political , economic , social and cultural rights of all .  
In my view , the benchmark for a sustainable democracy is the extent to which a State acts in accordance with universal and indivisible human rights : the civil and political rights , as well as the economic , social and cultural rights defined in international human rights law .  
Equally aware of the fact that older women , in all regions of the world , represent an important human resource , and that their contribution to society and development in the economic , cultural , political and social fields often remains unseen or unrecognized ,  
The interlinkages between international migration and development were complex in the sense that they brought into play a multiplicity of factors economic , technological , demographic , social , ecological , historical and cultural depending on regional characteristics .  
Recognizing that the right of human beings to live free from fear and poverty can not be realized unless , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the other international human rights instruments , conditions are created enabling all human beings to enjoy to the full their economic , social and cultural rights , as well as their civil and political rights ,  
Recalling also that in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , the international community commits itself to treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis , bearing in mind the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds .  
Considering that there is a close relationship between the realization of economic , social and cultural rights and the realization of civil and political rights , since the various categories of rights constitute an indissoluble whole based on recognition of the dignity of the human person and therefore require permanent protection and promotion with a view to ensuring their full realization , so that there can never be any justification for violating one category of rights in order to realize others ,  
Considering that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent , and interrelated , and that the promotion and observance of economic , social and cultural rights are consubstantial with integrated development , equitable economic growth and the consolidation of democracy in the States of the region ,  
Reaffirming that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are mutually supportive concepts : democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural regime and their full participation in all aspects of life .

Emphasize that there are principal victims of the violations of economic , social and cultural rights , in particular indigenous peoples , migrants , persons of African origin , the unemployed , uneducated children , women , older persons , persons with a disability and other persons in situations subject to more severe discrimination , and call on States to adopt specific action to meet their needs ;  
Recognize the primary role to be played by the private sector in the exercise of economic , social and cultural rights , and call for joint action with Governments and civil society ;  
It is recommended that the executive , judicial and legislative branches , together with the private sector and civil society , act together to promote the exercise of economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development ;  
The States of the region are asked to undertake to develop and implement national plans of action for human rights covering the entire range of human rights , especially economic , social and cultural rights , through a participatory process which includes civil society ;  
It is recommended that States give broad dissemination , especially among the members of the judiciary , to the international obligations that exist in the area of economic , social and cultural rights , and ensure that the necessary professional groups are trained , including those concerned with law enforcement and with human rights education at all levels of instruction ;  
International and regional organizations and the principal international and regional financial and development institutions are asked to evaluate the impact of their policies and programmes on the enjoyment of human rights , especially economic , social and cultural rights ;  
Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,  
In Central America we have made great progress , not only in the process of transition involving painstaking work in the area of pacifying , disarming and reintegrating armed groups into civil life , as well as campaigns to promote tolerance and peaceful coexistence and integration into political , social and cultural life but also in creating awareness among our peoples about the need to develop a culture of peace , which is closely related to the promotion of civic and democratic values .  
Recognize the importance of the transparent and jointly responsible participation of civil society , including the main groups identified in Agenda 21 , in the design , implementation and follow-up of sustainable development policies and of regional and international commitments on these matters , and that it is essential to strengthen the cultural , educational and environmental training base that makes it possible to engage civil society in the achievement of sustainable development .  
Decision makers at all levels need timely , reliable access to the knowledge generated by science and engineering to introduce rational policies that reflect a better understanding of complex technical , economic , social , cultural and ethical issues concerning society , the earth , and its environment .  
To achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion .  
Consequently , the entire range of civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well as the right to development , are relevant to intellectual property systems .  
The Sub-Commission has particularly strengthened its expertise in the area of economic , social and cultural rights , and that expertise is manifesting itself in the development of the Social Forum and a number of thoughtful and timely studies and resolutions , including those on globalization , international trade and human rights , the effect of intellectual property on human rights , and the relationship between businesses and human rights .  
Globalization and its consequences , which may limit the possibility of achieving sustainable development in the Arab region , and the need to set up the Arab region in line with its own economic and institutional conditions and create a strong Arab regional bloc based on the regions cultural , civilizational and economic constituents ;

The implementation of a comprehensive United Nations programme to assist States , at their request , in developing and implementing national human rights plans of action strengthening , inter alia , national structures having an impact on democracy and the rule of law ; to establish national institutions to give effect to the right to development and economic , social and cultural rights ; and also to assist States , at their request , within the respective mandates of the Secretariat / Office of the High Commissioner , in the process of ratifying United Nations human rights instruments ;  
His approach to human rights is global and comprehensive , thus including civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ; he intends to pay serious attention to poverty as a fundamental human rights issue ;  
There was a need to give legal meaning and support to economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development at the domestic level ; concrete steps should be taken to entrench those rights in constitutions and ensure their justiciability as human rights and not mere aspirations ; judges and lawyers had an important role and responsibility in that regard ; their independence must be safeguarded by Governments ;  
Monitor the observation , collection and analysis of legal , institutional , political , economic , social and cultural information by drawing on the skills of treaty bodies and national institutions for regulation and mediation ;  
Special legislation , enforced by the cooperative sector , should allow cooperative associations to promote integral development but with special attention to economic , legal , administrative , social and cultural issues .  
The failure of HKSAR to establish a national human rights institution with a broad mandate and its failure to establish adequate alternative arrangements for the promotion of economic , social and cultural rights ;

The transit of Venus , the celestial wonder of Venus passing between the Earth and the Sun , will happen on June 8 this year .  During which people will be reminded of historical incidents that determined the majority of the modern political and cultural nature of the South Pacific by unusual means .  
All state representatives at the Tunis Summit claimed that this plan proved the countries ' commitment to pursue and strengthen political , economic , social , and educational reforms .  However , these reforms had to be carried out according to the national conditions , cultural backgrounds , religious beliefs , and the possible extent of change of individual states to silently resist the U.S . intention of forcing the Arab states into carrying out political and economic reforms by means foreign to the Arabs .  
Both sides felt pleased and satisfied with the remarkable achievements in the friendly cooperation in political , economic and cultural and other fields between the two countries for over 30 years since China and Austria established diplomatic relations .  
Even though the cultural undertones manifested bore greater differences from regions in the upper middle reaches of the Yellow River and those in the lower middle reaches of the Lancang River , certain connections could still be found from relevant aspects such as the red scorched earth houses , linear stone axes , and ancient painted potteries .  The crops of corn and the pigs reared by people were particular proof of the countless ties between ancient Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the Inner Central Plains .  
As the economic and cultural center for China 's north east region , the provincial capital Shen Yang and five surrounding cities have jointly formed a metropolis , with Da Lian gradually becoming a significant port in north east Asia .  
In a welcoming speech , Fernando Chui Sai On , secretary of social and cultural affairs with the Macao Special Administrative Region ( SAR ) government , said that the importance of the Chinese language has been fully demonstrated as China 's comprehensive national strength gradually improves and the process of reform and opening up continues .  With the number of overseas learners soaring and teaching scales expanding , the development of Chinese as a second language has been boosted .  
Its aim is to use Chinese national traditional culture as a link to associate and unite compatriots at home and abroad , to spread national culture , to display the charm of the superior art of the motherland and display the achievements and elegant demeanor of overseas Chinese , Chinese artists in art realms and international cultural exchange .  
Due to differences in country 's situations , differences in economic development levels , cultural backgrounds , historical traditions , and social systems , each country should formulate suitable , effective population policies according to the actual situation of the native country .  
We must firmly redress the erroneous tendency to neglect ideological and political work and to " pay more attention to material progress than to cultural and ideological progress " in some places and departments ; develop a stronger sense of responsibility and urgency ; and conscientiously pay attention to and step up the effort to solve a series of major issues facing the effort to strengthen and improve ideological and political work , from the perspective of consolidating the party 's status as a ruling party and accomplishing the party 's historical mission .  
The Chinese Government believes that issues like the space for Taiwan conducting external economic , cultural , and social activities which are compatible with its capacity in the international community , the political status of Taiwan authorities , and so on can all be ultimately resolved within this framework , through political negotiations , and during the process of peaceful reunification .  
Currently , we are in an important historical period at the turn of two centuries .  Our country 's reform is in the period of storming the fortifications .  Faced with the changeable situation in the world and various complicated social phenomena , some people are at a loss and puzzled .  This is not strange .  The key is that our ideological and political work must adapt to the new situations in China and abroad .  The work must adapt to new changes in our society , politics , economy and cultural lives .  
The cultural pride and ethnic self-respect that have been formed within the Chinese nation over the five-thousand-year history of its ancient civilization is a sure guarantee that the Chinese people , having " stood up , " and carrying on in the glorious tradition of patriotism , will uphold the principles of national unification and territorial completion more than any other sacred mission .  
China is a big country having a cultural origin for 5,000 years .  Under the conditions that the market economic structure was established not long ago , the cultural industry has not taken shape , and the cultural market mechanism has not been perfected , the challenges from opening up China 's cultural markets to the outside world are self-evident , and the opportunities objectively exist too .  The crux of the issue is how the government and enterprises will meet with the challenges and seize hold of the rare historical opportunities .  
Since our party represents the direction of the development of the advanced culture , all comrades of the party must always take Marxism as the guidance , strive to inherit and develop all fine cultural traditions of the Chinese nation , and strive to learn from and absorb all outstanding cultural achievements of foreign countries in order to continuously create and promote the socialist culture with Chinese characteristics , enable the coordinated development of the socialist material and spiritual civilization , and enable comprehensive progress of the society .  
The conference pointed out : Launching activities of " stressing civilization and fostering new practices " in depth is an urgent need for promoting reform and development and maintaining social stability .  It is an urgent need for meeting the growing material and cultural needs of the people and forging closer ties between the party and the government on the one hand and the masses on the other .  It is also necessary for implementing tasks of ideological and political work at the grassroots levels .  
Efforts should be made to extensively launch a rich variety of cultural and sports activities and promotions of scientific knowledge that are convenient to the masses .  The people should be guided to make conscious efforts to change their old customs and habits and foster healthy and civilized habits .  
Cultural and sports activists among the masses should be given ideological education and vocational training , and the more outstanding ones should be selected to serve as instructors for community cultural and sports activities in order to gradually bring these activities onto the track of organized , standardized and healthy development .  
We should keep to a correct orientation in our work , give wide publicity to the main theme of our time , carry forward and develop healthy trends in society , and occupy the front of mass culture with healthy and beneficial activities .  Exhibition halls , museums , science museums , libraries , cultural centers , cinemas , entertainment venues , and tourist spots are all required to propagate a spiritual civilization , oppose feudal and superstitious ideas , and resist vulgar interests .  
Fourth , all localities in Guangdong must constantly enhance the ideological and ethical qualities , as well as the scientific and cultural qualities , of the people ; strengthen the building of a socialist spiritual civilization ; and bring about a well-coordinated economic and social development .  
In view of the development of the objective situation and the change in the ranks of workers and staff members , we should do in-depth and meticulous ideological and political work among them and keep improving their ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities .  
and having heard and examined five special reports - - the State Council 's report on ensuring basic living allowance for people such as laid-off workers of state-owned enterprises , report on raising peasants ' incomes and reducing their burdens , report on building of public security contingents in recent years , report on management of the cultural market , and report on preventing and tackling atmospheric pollution in Beijing Municipality .  
While fully developing the material productive forces , our party should attach great importance to the " cultural productive forces , " which are high-level productive forces ; the value and influence produced by such high-level productive forces will have a direct bearing on every aspect of our work and on our party 's ideological and political work in the new period .  
It is necessary to propel forward the scientific and technological revolution of agriculture , reform the agricultural scientific and technological structure , and gradually establish an agricultural scientific and technological innovative system which can attain the advanced level in the world , a technical dissemination system which can transform scientific and technological achievements in a highly efficient and productive way , and an agricultural educational and training system which can noticeably enhance the scientific , technological , and cultural quality of peasants .  
Only by continuously developing socialist culture and continuously satisfying the masses growing need for spiritual and cultural life can we provide a powerful spiritual drive and guarantee the development of productive forces .  
and eliminate backward production techniques .  Meanwhile , the industrial enterprises in the urban areas should be relocated in an orderly fashion .  With regard to the tertiary industry , we should give priority to developing tourist , financial and insurance , real estate , and cultural industries , as well as network-based information service industries .  
Some delegates indicated : During the current building of a spiritual civilization , the trend of promoting material progress to the neglect of cultural and ideological progress has yet to be checked permanently , and a major factor leading to such a situation is that the related legislation work remains relatively weak ; in view of such a problem , we ought to vigorously strengthen the legislation concerning the building of a socialist spiritual civilization .  
Departments of spiritual promotion and cultural education must organize and guide a large batch of artistic workers and scientific promotion workers to go deep into the frontline of the socialist reform and modernization construction .  They should absorb nourishment and find materials there , create high-quality spiritual products and meet people 's demand for improving their quality of spiritual civilization .  
Deputy Tian Chengzhong , secretary of Pingdingshan City CPC Committee in Henan , said that ideological and political work includes many aspects such as education content , ways and means , leadership system , operational mechanism , component force , and position carriers [ zhen di zai ti , 7109-0966-6528-7555 ] , and is closely lined with structural reform , the building of the legal system , and cultural construction .  
In socialist construction , areas inhabited by minority nationalities in our country have scored achievements attracting worldwide attention .  Owing to the limitations of natural conditions and for historical reasons , however , there is still a certain gap between the minority-nationality regions and the more developed inland and eastern coastal areas in the levels of economic and cultural development .  
1 .  The fifth natural paragraph of General Program shall be amended as : " Our country shall remain at the primary stage of socialism for a long time to come ( at present ) and be faced with a main contradiction between people 's growing material and cultural needs and backward social production .  Owing to domestic factors and international influence , the struggle waged by our country 's people against hostile forces or hostile elements at home and abroad shall be a long-term one .  
He said : During the past 20 years , the economic exchange and trade cooperation between Fujian and Taiwan have steadily developed and continuously grown in quality and quantity , and the contacts of people and activities of social and cultural intercourse have been increasingly frequent , thus initially forming a pattern of mutual complementarity , mutual benefit , mutual promotion , and common development of the economies of the two localities .  
Over more than 20 years of reform and opening up , great development has been made in the rural economy of our country , but the gross economic quantity is still not big enough , and the quality is not high enough .  The current economic conditions still can not satisfy the ever increasing material and cultural needs of the vast number of peasants in their day-to-day lives .  
Therefore , with Marxism as the guide and the training of people who have lofty ideas , moral integrity , education , and a sense of discipline as the goal , we must develop a national , scientific , and popular culture , which is oriented to modernization , the world , and the future , and concentrate efforts on improving the ideological and ethical quality as well as scientific and cultural quality of the entire Chinese nation .  
Only when we continuously develop socialist culture and improve socialist spiritual civilization continuously can we provide a powerful spiritual dynamic force and intellectual support to economic development and overall social progress and can we continuously meet the increasingly growing spiritual and cultural needs of the people .  
The strategic shift of the Party 's work focuses , the eventual affirmation of the basic line for the primary stage of socialism , the steady advancement of reform and opening up , and the gradual establishment of a system of socialist market economy have laid a firm but fully energetic and vigorous systematic basis for pushing forward the development of social productive forces and increasing the levels of the overall national strength and the material and cultural life of the masses of people .  
After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , the second-generation collective leadership with Deng Xiaoping as the core carried forward and developed the thought of Mao Zedong on cultural building .  In order to meet the new needs of reform and opening up and socialist modernization building , they put forth and constantly developed our party 's thinking about the building of socialist spiritual civilization .  
Only by truly fulfilling the " three represents " can the party lead the people in developing social productive forces , flourishing socialist culture with Chinese characteristics , and constantly improving the material and cultural life of the masses of people .  
With reference to the new developments in situations at home and abroad , the new developments in productive forces and the new situations occurring in economic structural reform , the new requirements of the masses of people for their material and cultural life , and the new changes taking place within the contingents of party members and cadres under the new situation , we must earnestly study , deeply understand , and wholly and accurately master the spiritual essence of this important thinking .  
However , while liberating and developing social productive forces , we must also handle numerous issues about production relations and superstructures , especially those issues in the ideological and cultural realms and must let the building of material civilization and the building of spiritual civilization coordinately develop .  
He specially pointed out : General Secretary Jiang Zemin has always been concerned about the ideological and political education among , as well as the healthy growth of , our teenagers .  All relevant departments should run more useful activities , so as to guide the teenagers to establish a correct outlook on life , science , and civilization ; besides , they should also provide more place of activities for teenagers , including scientific parks and cultural centers .  
In some places and schools in our city of Beijing , there still exist the tendency to emphasize cultural knowledge study and to slight ideological and political education as well as the stubborn disease , of varying degrees of seriousness , of one-sidedly pursuing admissions rates and examination results and slackening ideological and political education as well as social practice activities .  
In his speech celebrating the centennial of Beijing University , he called on the vast number of young people to integrate the acquisition of scientific and cultural knowledge with the strengthening of ideological cultivation , book learning with social practice , the attainment of values with serving the motherland and the people , and the cultivation of lofty ideals with the conduct of hard struggles .  
On the one hand , hostile forces in the West are still bent on " Westernizing " and " dividing " us and they try their utmost to step up ideological and cultural infiltration through a multitude of channels .  They publicize capitalist values in the large volumes of imported publications , film and television products , electronic games , computer software , and other spiritual and cultural products in an effort to compete with us for the younger generation .  
Only by correctly understanding and handling the relationship between the economy and politics can we make comprehensive development in the economic , political , ideological and cultural fields , and build ours into a wealthy , strong socialist modern country with democracy and a high degree of civilization .  
This article criticizes that the US advantages in the economic , political , military , and cultural fields are rapidly growing into a burden .  They have created tensions among old friends , weakened the US appeal to supporters , and made the United States face the danger of losing friends .  And this kind of friendly relationship is a " priceless treasure " accumulated over several decades .  
To properly act as the representative of the direction of the advanced culture in China , the key is to adhere to the principle of " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to both , " further advance the socialist cultural and ethic progress , and work hard to build and create the national , scientific , and popular socialist culture with Chinese characteristics , which is geared to the needs of modernization , the world , and the future .  
As a result of the continuous increase in the input of educational infrastructure construction , the reinforcement of cultural market management , and the bold assimilation and innovation of all fine achievements of ancient , modern , Chinese , and foreign cultures , we have created a situation under which the tourism culture , popular culture , and elegant culture with Shenzhen 's characteristics have attained common development .  
Over the past 20 years since the founding of the Shenzhen SEZ , we have exerted ourselves to carry out a series of policies to enrich the people formulated by the central authorities , unceasingly satisfied the people 's ever growing material and cultural demands , and brought about improvement in the economic and social level and the people 's living standards .  
Construction of urban infrastructure facilities including communications , post and telecommunications , water supply , power supply , gas supply , sewage disposal , and so on progressed ahead of schedule , and the residents ' housing , water and electric supply , medical treatment and public health , and cultural and educational conditions were considerably improved .  
For many years we have worked hard to put into practice Deng Xiaoping 's thinking of common prosperity .  Having gained a certain economic strength , we began to carry out the " project of common prosperity " and , relying mainly upon the financial departments at the city level for many consecutive years , raised funds totaling 1.88-billion yuan and put them into the relatively backward areas of the city in a bid to improve their infrastructure facilities , industrial layout , and cultural and educational conditions , thereby bringing about the coordinated development of various localities .  
to insure that all could , on a basis of their own initiative , learn revolutionary theories , guard and fight against the corrosion of corrupt ideology and culture , persistently struggle against schools of reactionary ideological trends , against idealistic and pseudoscientific ideologies ; that all should take in fact the Marxist world outlook , outlook on life , values , and take the initiative in socialist cultural civilization construction ;  
For many years , under the precondition of adhering to the one-China policy , we have put forward a series of policies and measures and made many tremendous , substantial efforts in conducting cross-strait dialogue and improving cross-strait relations .  This has effectively facilitated the exchange of personnel between the two sides as well as economic and cultural exchanges and development ; greatly softened and improved the age-old tension between the two sides ;  
Since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1992 , considerable progress has been made in bilateral friendly and cooperative relations in the political , economic , cultural , and other fields .  
At the same time , while protecting the rights and interests of ethnic minority groups , the governments must respect the universal principle concerning human rights acknowledged by the international community and also have the right to adopt measures that commensurate with their own national conditions in the light of their own realities because historical background , cultural tradition , development level , and nationality composition vary from country to country .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : Since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1992 , bilateral relations have been healthily and rapidly developing .  Our cooperation in the political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , agricultural , and cultural fields has achieved gratifying results .  
China is a socialist country ; it must strive to build strong state finance in order to press forward the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , continually enhance the material and cultural living standards of the people of all nationalities throughout the country , and preserve social stability and state economic and national defense security .  
During reform and opening up as well as during its modernization drives , China has attached importance to and advocated the all-round development of people .  It not only emphasizes the social and economic rights of the people but also vigorously develops and safeguards the political rights of citizens , strives for realizing the " all-round human rights , " which include political rights , economic rights , social rights , and cultural rights as well collective rights and individual rights .  
After the establishment of Sino-Egyptian diplomatic ties , the friendship between the people of the two countries has continuously been consolidated and developed .  On the basis of mutual respect , equality and mutual benefit , the two countries have established sincere and firm relations , and have carried out extensive and fruitful cooperation in the political , economic , cultural and other fields , as well as in international affairs .  
Jiang Zemin stressed that , as two ancient civilizations of the East and West , cultural exchanges between China and Greece are very lively .  Last year the Greek national theater put on the Greek tragedy " Medea " in Beijing , and the same play has been done on the stages of both countries in the form of a Chinese local opera from Hebei directed by Chinese , which was warmly received by the audiences .  
Jiang Zemin indicated : The cooperation between our two countries has also proved satisfactory in the educational , cultural , and scientific and technological fields .  Last year , in particular , China successfully held a watercolor painting exhibition and a Chinese Film Week in Greece ; while the Greek National Opera successful staged the ancient Greek tragedy " ( Maidyr ) " in Beijing , which was warmly received by the Chinese audience .  
The Chinese Government attaches importance to developing long-term , stable friendly relations and cooperation with Greece and is ready to work together with the Greek side in further expanding and deepening cooperation between the two countries in the political , economic , cultural , and various other fields to constantly score new , great successes .  
We must , through vigorous ideological-political work , enable Marxism to firmly control the ideological and cultural fields and make it difficult for all kinds of reactionary , decadent , and backward political viewpoint , ideology , and life style to gain a foothold and spread .  
All quarters of society and educational departments should make concerted efforts to strengthen the comprehensive management of society and cultural development ; should air more selected radio and television programs , show more selected movies , and publish more selected books and journals that are beneficial to the youngters ' healthy growth so as to resolutely resist the poisoning of youngsters by various feudal superstitions and decadent ideas and cultures ;  
The authorized sizes of our military academies are rather irrational .  It is necessary to make great efforts to enhance students ' scientific and cultural foundation as well as their ability in commanding and management .  We should run well the National Defense University , which aims at cultivating senior commanders who participate in the joint training program for officers of the three forces .  
has reiterated the principal position of the masses of the people , as well as our fundamental aim in bringing about a social , economic , and cultural development ; and has further straightened the relationship that the party should act as a " public servant " to the people .  This is a continued adherence and a new development to the party building theories respectively put forward by Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping .  
Leading cadres at all levels must arm themselves fully with Mao Zedong Thought , Deng Xiaoping Theory , and Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important exposition ; willingly enhance their sense of historical responsibility and urgency ; broaden their horizons ; work hard and keep forging ahead ; foster a scientific spirit ; master scientific methods ; learn knowledge about science ; and persist in working hard unremittingly on the basis of what has been achieved so far .  They must make efforts to further improve their ideological and cultural quality ;  
Piracy has seriously disturbed the economic and cultural operational orders in the country and worsened the environment for national cultural industries ' survival , thus causing a massive drain on state revenues and causing cultural business units ' failure to gain an advantageous position in competition amid world economic integration by making it difficult for them to achieve effective accumulation and rapidly expand their industrial scale .  
At present , our military 's political and ideological work is facing many new problems like how to correctly understand and appropriately handle the relationship of honoring modern educational laws versus bringing to full play our military 's political advantages , teaching scientific and cultural knowledge versus cultivating military people 's ideological and political qualities and stimulating an academic and research atmosphere versus maintaining high ideological unity .  
To keep to the orientation of the progress of advanced culture , it is necessary to adapt ourselves to the requirements of reform , opening up , and the drive for socialist modernization , to concentrate on improving the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the people across the country , and to unite and mobilize the people of all nationalities throughout the country to build our country into a prosperous , powerful , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist state .  
Since our army is an important force for building the socialist spiritual civilization and an advanced group composed of outstanding young people from all walks of life , it must conscientiously uphold the requirement for the advanced quality in ideological , moral , and cultural construction .  
As in-depth changes in the military fields in the world are caused by the development of modern science and technology , especially high technology , the scientific and technological content of army building and modern warfare has been increased to an unprecedentedly high level .  This has put ever higher demands on the scientific and cultural qualities of our officers and men .  
The party and government have attached great importance to the harm of piracy in society , and General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji have given important directives on " eliminating pornography " and " cracking down on illegal publications . "  Therefore , we must fully understand the importance of striking at copyright piracy from the high plain of national political , economic , and cultural aspects .  
Leading cadres must do a good job in arming themselves with scientific theories and the knowledge of science and technology , keep improving themselves ideologically and theoretically , and increase their ability to lead the effort to strengthen the armed forces through science and technology and to direct modern warfare in order to keep pace with the times and to adapt themselves to social , economic , and cultural development , to the renewal of weapons and equipment , and to the change of modern warfare .  
Over the past few years , the North and the South have conducted nongovernmental economic and trade cooperation and cultural exchanges with each other which have grown more dynamic with each passing day .  Now that they have begun to taste the sweet fruit of such benefits , the two sides have deemed it both a common need and a pressing task for the prosperity of the national economy to expand cooperation and exchanges with each other .  
and so on .  In their joint communique , the two sides have pledged to develop the national economy in a balanced way by virtue of economic cooperation and step up bilateral cooperation and exchanges in social , cultural , sports , public health , environmental , and some other areas .  
scientific , technological , and cultural quality ; and physical and mental quality .  All these also reflected an important trend in the implementation of the conference spirit by all units : The units closely integrated theory with practice , and always focused on major issues such as direction and strategy , so as to earnestly strengthen ideological and political work , and actively promote military modernization .  
Even the leading cadres with workers ' or farmers ' backgrounds had raised their ideological and theoretical proficiency and knowledge and cultural qualities up to a considerable level through their diligent learning .  
Under the conditions of promoting reform and opening up and being in the ruling position , our party must constantly resist all kinds of corrosive influence and culture .  Therefore , to the broad masses of party members and cadres , it is particularly important to strengthen the building of spiritual civilization and continuously raise their ideological , moral , scientific and cultural qualities .  
We must persist in " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to each " and firmly promote the building of spiritual civilization while grasping the building of material civilization .  We should use Marxism to firmly occupy the ideological and cultural front , vigorously strengthen education on developing a fine party style and building a clean and honest government , and construct an ideological and moral defensive line to repel the corrupting influence and guard against degeneration .  
Faced with the new situation where science and technology are developing rapidly and high technology is being applied extensively in the military field , our army should train a large number of new-type military personnel who are militarily and politically competent and who have acquired good command of modern scientific and cultural knowledge .  This is the key for our army to gain the initiative in future military struggles and shoulder the historical missions entrusted by the party and the people .  
By 2010 , military specialized technical cadres competent for both military and civilian services should basically be trained mainly by regular schools of higher learning , and a proper number of graduates from regular schools of higher learning should be selected to fill command posts , so that the knowledge structure and scientific and cultural levels of military cadres can be improved fundamentally and a military personnel training system compatible with China 's national conditions and our army 's characteristics can take shape .  
In the network and information age , Western political ideology tends to infiltrate us via various channels .  In this connection , the army must persist in a correct direction in the ideological and political education work and must concentrate efforts on raising the ideological , ethical , scientific , and cultural quality of officers and men .  
In the course of utilizing advanced scientific methods to conduct political education , there is a need to strive to tap into the nation 's outstanding cultural tradition and education resources , to constantly stimulate officers ' and men 's sense of identity with national culture , to enhance immunity against the infiltration of Western culture , and to raise the level and quality of entertainment appreciation among officers and men .  
Chairman Jiang emphatically pointed out with a farsightedness : " To earnestly lay a solid scientific and cultural foundation among vast numbers of cadres of our army and raise their knowledge to a higher level is of tremendous significance to enhancing the entire army 's study and understanding of modern science and technology and particularly high-tech knowledge , to promoting the development and use of high-tech weaponry and equipment , and to creating new tactics . "  
A constant flow of vast numbers of high-quality personnel with modern science and general knowledge into the army will further optimize the knowledge structure and greatly raise the scientific and cultural level of military cadre ranks , and will provide a strong knowledge , science and technology backing for army building .  
Local party committees are responsible to the central leading body and shoulder the responsibility for comprehensively leading local political , economic , cultural , and social development .  
At the beginning of the 20th century , as a result of the new cultural movement and the Russian October Revolution , a group of patriotic and progressive intellectuals accepted Marxist theory which represented advanced culture and a forward direction .  They penetrated the industrial working masses that represented the advanced productive force , propagated revolutionary theory , and combined the two .  The result was the birth of the Chinese Communist Party .  
In the present information age , there are much more frequent ideological and information exchanges among the people .  This is particularly true in the current situation when the country is further opening up its doors to the outside world .  The influx and convergence of different spiritual and cultural products and different ideas and information through different channels have not only enlivened people 's minds and enriched the cultural market but have set higher demands on ideological and cultural development and on ideological and political work .  
Since the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy , many developments have taken place in their spiritual and cultural life and the masses have proposed new demands for spiritual and cultural life .  This requires that we profoundly study the characteristics of the times , have a firm grip on the times , and continuously probe for new forms , methods , means , and mechanisms .  And this is the key to making ideological and political work more purposeful and more inspiring .  
advance toward the target of turning ourselves into well-disciplined young people who have a lofty ideal , a sound moral integrity , and a profound cultural knowledge ; come together to form a mighty contingent of young talents ; and compose a more magnificent song of youth in the new century .  
All ideological and cultural battlefields , all departments of publicity , culture and education , and all spiritual and cultural products at levels ranging from high to low , should facilitate the spread of advanced culture , publicize scientific theories and mold beautiful souls .  
The surging trend of new technological revolution and the knowledge economy in the world will not only provide a more advanced scientific and technological foundation for the development of socialism , but will also bring about a hidden risk of further widening the gap between the socialist countries with comparatively backward economic and cultural conditions and the developed capitalists countries .  
Deng Xiaoping Theory provides the initial answer to a series of basic questions about how to develop socialism in such a country with comparatively backward economic and cultural conditions as China around the primary theoretic subject of " what is socialism and how to development socialism " .  
Raising the scientific and cultural level of all the people is a huge systematic undertaking , one which requires painstaking planning and organization , and one which can not be left unemphasized , nor worse yet bogged down with the usual sighs of emotion .  
Okinawa is a Japanese prefecture in southern Kyushu and comprises Okinawa , Miyako , Yaeyama and other islands .  The main Okinawa Island is 1,185 sq km at the center of the Ryukyu archipelago .  Northern hilly areas account for two-thirds of the entire island .  Naha , the capital at the south of Okinawa Island , is Okinawa Prefecture 's political and cultural center .  
Leading organs should regard it as their own duty to remove worries and resolve problems for the basic level , work out effective and operable measures , favor the basic level in their policy orientation , extend more timely support to the basic level when needed and refrain from gilding the lily for administrative organs at higher levels , constantly improve the conditions of material and cultural lives in basic-level units , and devote great efforts to creating an environment which can hold people 's hearts .  
Each region must pay thorough attention to developing spiritual and cultural products and healthy entertainment activities that have the ability to imperceptibly influence people 's ideological views and moral sentiments so as to allow the masses to achieve enlightenment and mold their sentiments in a relaxed and happy atmosphere .  
Many localities give prominence to special characteristics , conduct propaganda to suit local needs , and expand inputs , and have formed certain principal fronts for ideological and political work , including a public opinion front , a training front , and a cultural entertainment front .  
The party 's central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core not only consistently upholds Deng Xiaoping Theory and holds high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , but has also enriched and developed Deng Xiaoping Theory in combination with the new conditions and new experience in the economic , political , scientific and technological , educational , cultural , ethnical policy , military , diplomatic , united front , and party building fields , and added new contents to scientific system of Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
We must ensure first that they are qualified in the political sense , and second in a scientific and cultural sense , in professional skills and capacities and also in physical and psychological health .  We must further ensure that these experts have acquired comprehensive knowledge in various fields , overall coordination abilities , an innovative spirit as well as innovative capacities .  
Moreover , under the situation that relevant laws , regulations , and policies are not very perfect , opening China 's education markets will give rise to contradictions and problems in terms of education sovereignty , direction of running schools , education concepts , national cultural traditions , and management , and vehemently impact the relatively weak domestic educational industry , such as the production of educational instrument , studying appliances , books , software , toys , and so on .  
The progress of the socialist materialist civilization and spiritual civilization has been constantly cleansing the outdated ideas and concepts and the advanced ideological and cultural mentalities like independent mentality , innovative mentality , competitive mentality , open-up mentality , and so on as well as those civilized and progressive social concepts like efficiency concept , effectiveness concepts , and so on which can promote the development of social productive forces have gradually gone deeply into the hearts of the people .  
Relying on the correct understandings which are formed in practice , we can make ideological and theoretical judgment through making objective and cool-headed comparisons under richer and as a matter of course more complicated cultural and theoretical background .  This is an indication of the psychological progress of a nation .  
Along with the development of the social , political , economic , and cultural life , the independent and optional space for people 's ideological activities will become more extensive .  
His subjective dynamic role is subject to the restriction of his own scientific and cultural level as well as scientific and technological content . 
The people are relieved to see that with the convocation of the UN millennium summit and the " Chinese Cultural Exhibition in the United States " , as well as the large-scale cultural exchange activities which are being held in the United States nationwide like a raging fire , the main US media , including the " New York Times " and the " Washington Post " , have " broken historical records " in frequently reporting on China 's relevant situations .  
We revamped our concepts and emancipated our minds , guiding all areas to actively and boldly develop civil air defense reform practice .  We broke with the closed state , throwing open the doors , and sharply developing and utilizing early-stage projects , with projects integrating peacetime with wartime , such as underground markets , parking garages , production shops , and cultural entertainment places , springing up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain .  
The geographical locations separated by a mere strip of water , close cultural backgrounds , and longstanding contacts and exchange of visits of personnel have provided exceptionally favorable conditions for the development of bilateral economic and trade cooperation .  
Since the historic meeting between the leaders of the DPRK and ROK , Kim Chong-il and Kim Tae-chung , held in mid-June in which the " North-South Joint Declaration " was signed , both sides have developed a series of exchanges and cooperation in political , economic , cultural , and other fields , with gratifying progress made .  
They have waged an unremitting struggle against pornography and illegal activities and rectified the cultural market in a planned and organized manner .  They have wiped out a number of gambling houses and spots where drugs and pornographic materials were being sold , and purified the cultural market .  
With the growing high-tech content in modern armaments , there are increasingly high requirements on our armed forces ' officers and soldiers in connection with scientific and cultural knowledge and military technological qualities .  
At the current ASEM , Premier Zhu Rongji once again gave an important speech , also through extensive contacts and exchanges with Asian and European leaders , he enunciated China 's standpoints and opinions on Asian-European exchange and cooperation in the political , economic , trade , cultural , scientific , and technological fields , thus forcefully promoting the further expansion of consensus between Asia and Europe and the establishment of the cooperative partnership in the new century .  
unswervingly implemented the party 's policy concerning nationalities and religion and the regional national autonomy system ; increasingly consolidated and developed the new-type socialist national relationship based on equality , unity , and mutual help ; and made the dream come true in real terms for the people of all nationalities to exercise their rights according to the law in the political , economic , cultural , and social life .  
We are , and will remain for a long time , in the primary stage of socialism , and the most prominent characteristic of this stage is the slow development of our productive forces .  The contradiction between the masses ' ever growing material and cultural needs and the backward social output will always be our main social contradiction .  
promoting the economic , educational , scientific , and cultural cooperation and interchange between Macao and the inland , connecting people from all circles of Macao , improving the association between Macao and the inland , reflecting the opinions that Macao residents have to the inland , managing the related Taiwan affairs , undertaking other matters that the central government hands over . 
However , because his understanding of the laws of socialist construction was insufficient , because of theoretical errors , because of incorrect response to dramatic changes in the international situation , he also committed subjectivist errors , which resulted in the failure of the " great leap forward " and the people 's communes , and , particularly , this finally led to the great political chaos of the " cultural revolution " that was immensely harmful to the cause of socialism in China .  
This put forward a new topic : on the one hand we need to staunchly adhere to the fundamental principles of socialism put forth by Marx and Engels , on the other hand we need to adopt a scientific attitude to Marx and Engels ' tentative ideas of socialism and , proceeding from the reality of relative economic and cultural backwardness map out a course and policy for socialist construction .  
Since the realization of socialism mostly started based on a relatively low level of economic development , in order to satisfy the ever-growing material and cultural needs of the people , we must rapidly transform the backward condition of social productive forces : in a situation where the two systems , socialist and capitalist , coexist , we also need to energetically develop productive forces to give expression to socialism 's superiority .  
With the curtain of the 21st century slowly opening , the incoming tide of economic globalization is surging into every corner of the world .  Economic globalization is sure to have widespread and profound effects on tomorrow 's world , including the economic , social , cultural , and military spheres .  
Under the impetus of economic globalization , humanity has expanded its interaction , its contacts , and its understanding , and increased friendship , cooperation , and support .  Various converging and intermingling cultural torrents have smashed the " iron curtain " between countries with different social systems and ideologies , marking a new era in the ways countries compete and test their strength against one another .  
Ways , means , and methods which are receiving widespread application are continuing and improving classroom education , " second classrooms , " on-line political work , cultural improvement , psychological guidance , standardizing laws and discipline , self-education , benefits driving , improving the level of education in science , and leaders taking the lead and setting the example .  
During his visit Chairman Li Peng specially arranged to see the relatives of Dr . Kotnis , who sacrificed his precious life for the cause of the Chinese people 's liberation , and held extensive contacts and chats with responsible persons of Indian friendship bodies and figures in business , science and technology , and cultural circles , in which he conveyed to the Indian people the friendly feelings of the Chinese people and their sincere aspirations for developing bilateral ties .  
One of the important issues in the practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is to correctly deal with the influence of the international environment and the international political struggle on people 's thoughts in the course of persistently carrying out reforms , opening up , and increasing economic and cultural exchanges with the outside world , while actively absorbing and learning from all the good results achieved by human society as a whole in civilization development , and effectively resist the corrosive influence of the decadent ideologies and cultures from the West .  
The process of economic globalization is speeding up and has been breaking up the barriers that hinder the movement of capital , technology , information , and labor force across national boundaries .  This process is also turning the world economy into an integrated entity , making the international division of work and international cooperation closer , providing conditions for various nations to more extensively participate in international competition , and also bringing about rare opportunities for the economic and cultural developments in developing countries .  
The openness of society will inevitably bring about ideological and cultural diversification .  While people are receiving positive and progressive ideas and conceptions , they are also exposed to the influence of backward and decadent things .  The complex situation in the realm of ideology and culture in society , where the good and the bad exist side by side , brings about a multi-tiered and diversified feature in people 's mental pursuits and values .  
Such infiltration is not limited to the ideological and cultural fields , but has also be extended to the economic , political , military , scientific , and technological fields .  In their exchanges with us , they also brought ideological things along with them .  
Theory , journalism , publications , literature , and arts are all important ideological and public opinion positions .  We should continuously create and produce good cultural products being favorable to social progress and being beneficial to people 's physical and mental health .  We should boost healthy public conduct in society and develop a progressive spirit of our times , advocate a healthy and civilized lifestyle , resist all reactionary , decadent , and backward ideological and cultural dregs .  
At present , it is particularly necessary to effectively utilize and manage the internet , as it has become the fourth largest mass media next to newspapers , radio , and television .  We should strive to turn our advantageous journalistic resources , cultural resources , and information technology resources into our superiority in online propaganda so that the online position and the mass media in our country will all be occupied with progressive ideology and culture .  
Researchers Pan Houren and Zhou Jiahua held that today , when material living standards are improving all the time , it is extremely important to build a rich and excellent cultural life ; the current measures such as small district sports and public welfare facilities which are now being built in a big way , and the rural cultural activities launched by organizing peasants who have become rich are extremely beneficial .  
As students of military academies , we shoulder the historic mission of relying on science and technology to build a strong army and accelerate the modernization of our army 's armament and equipment .  We must more consciously strengthen our cultivation of Marxist theories and scientific spirit , arm ourselves with modern scientific knowledge , and exert to spread the fruits of socialist spiritual and cultural progress .  We must never allow fallacies of " Falungong " to contaminate our sacred school campuses .  
However , we should clearly understand that we are still in the early stages of a socialist society .  We are still facing a basic national climate characterized by vast space , a large population , a weak economic base and slow economic and cultural development .  We are still facing a basic national climate characterized by a dominating social contradiction expressed as a gap between social productivity and the increasing material and cultural demands of the populace , as well as a huge economic , scientific and technological gap with developed countries .  
Since hostile forces and saboteurs at home and abroad seize every opportunity and try by hook or by crook to steal China 's political , military , economic , cultural , and educational intelligence , cases of leakage of secrets are frequent and startling , posing a serious threat to the information security of the party , the state , and the military .  
The compatriots on both sides of the strait come from the same cultural background ; and the Chinese phonetic alphabet system currently used in the mainland motherland has been practiced and constantly improved for several decades , and has already been widely recognized and accepted in the world .  In fact , relevant authorities in Taiwan had earlier planned to adopt this system .  
During the 20th century which has just passed , scientific and technological progress brought about unprecedented development to the civilization of mankind .  Today , the Chinese nation is faced with a historical opportunity of comprehensive rejuvenation ; and the realization of a peaceful reunification across the strait is an inexorable demand of cross-strait economic , social , and cultural development .  We hope that the leaders of the Taiwan authorities can face up to the reality ; comply with the historical trend of the time ;  
In the document of the 15th national party congress , the principal contradiction in the socialist society are summarized as the " contradiction between the people 's increasing material and cultural demands and the backward social production . "  
The " Covenant " actually confirms such basic human rights as the right of survival and the right of development .  It points out : Only after the creation of the economic , social , and cultural rights that can be enjoyed by all people , as the creation of the same conditions for civil and political rights available to all people , will the ideal freedom which frees mankind from terror and shortage be realized .  
Only when development is accelerated can the living standards of the people of all nationalities in our region be improved and the increasingly growing needs of material and cultural life be met , and only when development is accelerated can the new-type socialist nationality relationship characterized by equality , unity , and mutual help be consolidated and developed and national solidarity be consolidated and enhanced .  
To always represent the way forward for advanced culture is to persist in developing what is useful and discarding what is not , correctly handle the relationship between inheriting the national traditional culture and blazing new trails , and strengthen cultural exchanges between fraternal nationalities so as to absorb all fruits of civilization of the human society .  
Therefore , we must , through constant efforts , further liberalize thinking , renew ideas , expand efforts to open up to the outside , seize opportunities , and accelerate development so as to bring more visible and tangible benefits to the Tibetan people and increasingly improve the material and cultural standard of living for the people .  
We should assign great importance to improving the material and cultural lives of our officers and men , and work hard to create a sound environment which can keep people 's hearts , with a view to unifying , heightening , and inspiring the morale of our troops .  
It firmly takes the steady improvement of the living standards , both material and cultural , of the urban and rural populations as the essential demand of socialism , the fundamental goal of economic development , and the meeting point of the effort to properly handle the relations among reform , development , and stability .  It gives priority to resolving the problems that are of widespread concern to the ordinary people ;  
To implement the Tenth Five-Year Plan , we must work hard to improve the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the entire population in the forward direction of an advanced culture , adhere to the idea of " tackling with both hands , both hands hard , " combine the rule of law with the rule of morality , and vigorously push ahead with the building of a socialist spiritual civilization . 
Chi Haotian said : Developing the western region and accelerating the development of the central and western regions is the major strategic policy of the party Central Committee and President Jiang Zemin after taking stock of the situation and making overall planning geared toward the new century .  It is of vital economic , political , social , and cultural significance .  
Since its establishment , the foundation has given full play to its own characteristics and advantages , and has , with the assistance of friendly organizations and enthusiastic people at home and abroad , dedicated itself to developing the cultural , educational , science , technology and welfare undertakings for children and promoting the healthy mental and physical development of children ;  
Political restructuring and the development of the socialist democracy and political system must be conducive to maintaining and giving play to the features and advantages of our political system , and conducive to maintaining the unity of the country , ethnic unity and social stability .  In addition , the historical conditions and the level of economic , cultural and educational development must also be taken into full consideration .  
The vast number of theoretical workers should take pains to undertake the lofty mission of theoretical innovation which has been entrusted to them by the age , persistently emancipate their minds , make courageous exploration , observe and take hold of the trends of economic , political , scientific and technological , and cultural development in the contemporary world as well as the great changes in China today , and strive to make new progress and new contributions in theoretical innovation .  
In short , our theoretical work must be closely combined with the realities , take the major practical issues in reform , opening up , and modernization as the main direction of attack in our study , positively probe into the law governing economic , political , and cultural development in building socialism with Chinese characteristics , serve the party and government in making scientific policy decisions , and serve the entire party and nation in working for the interest of the whole .  
We must uphold the guideline of grasping things with both hands , with both hands firm , combine ruling the country according to law with ruling the country with ethics , follow the orientation for progress of advanced culture , and make efforts to enhance the ideological and moral standard and scientific and cultural qualities of the whole nation .  
President Jiang Zemin pointed out not long ago : After China participates in the " International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , " China will subject itself to the United Nations ' supervision , will conscientiously fulfill the state obligations specified by the " Covenant , " will effectively promote the realization of the economic , social and cultural rights for the Chinese citizens by legislative , administrative , and other means , and will thus make contributions to the human rights cause in the world .  
However , at the initial stage of socialism , with the distinct characteristics of dual economic structures for the villages and the cities , and with deeply-settled historical and cultural traditions involving small-scale peasant economies in the villages , the cultural and technology quality of the peasants has remained low and many peasants do not understand or are not accustomed to the market economy .  
Professor Yu frankly admitted that as a developing country with a population of 1.2-billion , China 's per capita natural resources are comparatively scant , its current economic and cultural development is imbalanced , its legal system is not complete , and , in the process of law enforcement , some laws are not strictly abided by and some laws are not strictly enforced - - all these contribute to the non-perfect human rights situation in China .  
He said that , in line with the international trend and existing domestic precedent , using high-tech principles to mix electronic sound with natural sound could unite the opera house and concert hall into one .  That would mean building only an opera house and a Beijing Opera playhouse , or one cultural square with two structures , which would save much investment .  
Zhang Xiaoling , a professor at the Central Party School who has been devoted to the specialized study of " women and human rights , " further expounded that according to the International Human Rights Charter , human rights can be classified into two categories - - civil and political rights and economic , social , and cultural rights .  
Take its handling of the Tibet question for example , after taking office in 1993 , former US President Bill Clinton again highlighted the values of human rights by following in Jimmy Carter 's footsteps .  Clinton declared : If China refuses to make improvement on human rights , the United States will not grant MFN status to China . Clinton also listed protecting Tibet 's unique religious or cultural heritage in his wish list on human rights and even arranged an unscheduled meeting between himself and Dalai in the White House .  
Chi Haotian said : Both China and Gabon are developing countries .  The two countries ' cooperation in the political , economic , military , and cultural areas has been remarkable ; and the two countries share common views on a wide range of important international issues .  
Russia has also merged some of its higher command schools with some of its engineering technology schools and increased courses on engineering technology for its postgraduate students studying in the command specialty by a large margin with an eye on training qualified high-level military personnel who are well-versed in scientific and cultural knowledge and proficient in various military specialties .  
Over the past 100 years , the world underwent untold tribulations caused bywars , diseases , hunger , crises , and disasters ; but more importantly , the peopleof various countries carried out momentous social and natural struggles on amagnificent scale , and thus made unprecedented progress in the political , economic , ideological , cultural , scientific , technological , education , military , and medical aspects .  
In light of China 's national conditions and according to the people 's wishes , the Chinese government aims to build a democratic and modernized country with a high level of civilization under the rule of law , and actively learn from the beneficial experiences and cultural achievements of other countries .  While maintaining social stability , it also aims to expedite development , strengthen the democratic legal system , promote spiritual civilization , and continuously push forward the development of the human rights cause .  
At present , according to the arrangements of the State Council , actions should be focused on cracking down on the activities of making and selling counterfeit commodities , regularizing the construction market , punishing criminal offenders involved in tax evasion and tax frauds , breaking departmental monopoly and local blockade , straightening out the market for cultural products , thus laying a good foundation for the fundamental improvement of the order of the market economy in the period of the Tenth Five-Year Plan .  
Jiang Zemin said he was pleased to see that in the 13 years since China and Uruguay established diplomatic relations , the two countries have increasingly enhanced friendly cooperation in political , economic and trade , and cultural fields , and the two peoples have continued to deepen their mutual understanding and friendship .  
Different countries differ not only in their geographical location but also in their level of economic development and historical and cultural traditions .  Thus , they are bound to have different political , economic and social systems , and it is unrealistic to achieve unification using one and the same model .  
In particular , since the two countries established diplomatic relations , the two sides have maintained frequent high-level exchanges , enhanced economic and trade cooperation , markedly increased contacts in scientific and cultural fields , and maintained sound cooperation in international affairs . "  
At present , the mutual stirring of various cultural and ideological trends on a worldwide scale , the mingling of progressive and backward concepts , the increasing diversification of people 's orientations of value , moral concepts , and cultural choices and , in particular , the infiltration and offensives of the Western hostile forces against us , such as " Westernization " and " disintegration , " have made the contradiction and struggle in the ideological field more and more acute and complicated .  
It is necessary , in line with the requirement of maintaining the advanced nature , to vigorously step up the building of our ranks , constantly improve the ideological and political quality , the scientific and cultural level , and the professional skills of party-member cadres , and train and bring up a contingent of high-quality party-member cadres .  
The " three advantages " criterion constitutes the standard for us to judge all our work in carrying out China 's reform and opening-up program and developing the socialist modernization drive .  In this way , the thinking on " three represents " helps set the goals for party building in the new period , and expand the historical mission of the Communist Party of China in the new period .  It also provides a theoretical guidance to the ruling party for further strengthening its cultural , social , and economic foundations .  
It is precisely at this crucial moment that Comrade Jiang Zemin made the remark that the Communist Party of China must represent the progressive course of China 's advanced culture .  He has enriched the political connotation conducive to raising the people 's living standards , and turned the reconstruction of the mode of cultural life and the expansion of advanced culture into the process of China 's modernization drive .  As a result , he has provided China with more attractive cultural resources .  
He noted that for many years China and France have engaged in effective cooperation in economic , scientific , technological , cultural , and other areas .  He expressed the hope that the two countries and the people of China and France would continue to cooperate in cultural , educational , scientific , and technological fields and jointly contribute to the building of a beautiful future in the new century .  
The entire process of the incident was connected to historical , legal , cultural , language , and religious issues , and the only thing that was conspicuously absent was its military aspect .  US Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld did not even appear in public during the development of the incident .  It was not until 13 April that he held a news conference at which he complained that it was only the Chinese Communist plane 's provocative act that was the underlying cause of the collision .  
Yunnan Province has rich tourism resources as it has beautiful natural scenes and pleasant weather .  There are many scenic spots and a rich variety of cultural features and customs of minority ethnic groups .  All this is huge economic potential to be tapped .  
China attaches great importance to developing friendly cooperative relations with Yugoslavia in the political , economic , cultural and educational areas .  China maintains that healthy development of Sino-Yugoslav relations is in the fundamental interests of the two countries .  
When new China was established , for historical reasons the mother mainland laid particular stress on putting politics in command and emphasized ideology ; it violated the laws of economic development , and in particular this went to extremes during the " 10-year cultural revolution , " causing great damage to the social productive forces and bringing the national economy to the brink of bankruptcy . 
set things right in matters ranging from theory to practice ; carried out and acted in the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee ; lost no time in shifting the focus of party work to economic construction ; restored and developed industrial , agricultural , scientific , cultural , and educational undertakings that had been disrupted by the " Great Cultural Revolution " ; revived and carried forward the fine traditions of the party ; and consolidated and developed political stability and unity in Jilin Province .  
We are happy to see that since the normalization of the two countries ' relations , high-level leaders of the two parties and two countries have conducted frequent mutual visits , and both sides ' exchanges and cooperation have expanded and developed in a more in-depth manner in the political , economic , military , scientific , technological , and cultural fields .  
Li Lanqing said : One of the main purposes of my current visit to France is , while pushing forward political and economic cooperation between China and France , to boost development of cultural exchange and cooperation between the two countries - - this is extremely important and indispensable to promoting the comprehensive partnership between our two countries .  
Top level leaders have frequently exchanged visits , while contacts and cooperation are increasingly expanded and deepened in the political , economic , military , scientific , technological , and cultural fields .  
The contacts of officials at high level are frequent , the exchange and cooperation in the political , economic and trade , cultural , public health , science and technology , and other spheres are expanding with each passing day , and the mutual support and coordination in the international affairs are unceasingly intensified .  
2 .  Both sides point out that the two countries have , through joint efforts , established a legal basis of treaties and organizations for mutually beneficial cooperation in the political , economic and trade , science and technological , and cultural fields .  
In recent years , China and Austria increasingly enhanced their exchanges and cooperation in the political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , cultural , and environmental protection fields and also increased friendly exchanges at the provincial and city level .  
After the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1958 , friendly and cooperative relations continued to develop , and bilateral cooperation achieved gratifying results in the political , economic , cultural , and public health fields .  
the spirit of pressing forward in the face of difficulties indomitably and relentlessly , the spirit of working hard and seeking solid results , and the spirit of being indifferent to fame and fortune and making selfless contributions ; continuously enhance their moral and ideological quality and their scientific , cultural , and technological quality ; and strive to become workers with a lofty ideal , moral integrity , good education , and a sense of discipline .  
Featured columns on the website , such as " wonderful natural landscapes , " " cultural treasures , " " urban sights , " and " inside Taiwan , " depict famous mountains and rivers and cultural relics and ancient ruins on both sides of the strait , describe the customs and traditions of various ethnic groups , display the long history and splendid culture of China , and provide first-hand accounts of the enormous changes and developments in China today .  
The standard attained by a country 's universities reflects from one aspect the level of scientific , technological , and cultural development attained by the whole country , and is also a major expression of the country 's all-round national strength .  
You should make efforts to ensure that you have fine ideological and political qualities and also scientific and cultural ability that can withstand severe tests ; you should have both strong physique and sound minds .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : The level attained by the universities of a country actually reflects the level of scientific , technological , and cultural development attained by the whole country , and this is also a major embodiment of this country 's comprehensive national strength .  The building of first-class universities attaining the world 's advanced level in our country will require great support from the party , the government , and all social circles ;  
Thanks to the personal attention and promotion of the heads of state of the two countries , China and Russia have made a big headway and scored notable achievements in mutually beneficial cooperation in the political , economic , scientific and technological , cultural , and educational fields .  
Of more than 10 strategic principles , the US authorities determined on measures for subverting China in various fields of social life including the political , economic , diplomatic , military , trade , cultural , and educational fields .  
In the 10 years starting in 1990 and continuing through the next 10 years , in 20 years of strategic operations , the US Government has already made and will continue to make comprehensive use of the strategy of " win without fighting " and " win through fighting " in a planned , premeditated , and measured way to speed up political , economic , and cultural evolution in China , and achieve at an early date its strategic goals of uprooting communist ideology , weakening Chinese national consciousness , and splitting the PRC setup .  
The basic question of the trade union work is an issue of safeguarding rights .  All work of the trade union should be carried out in close connection with this most fundamental issue , that is , safeguarding the economic interests and democratic rights of workers and staff members and fulfilling their spiritual and cultural needs .  
It is present in political , economic , military , scientific and technological , and cultural education ; its core values are patriotism , revolutionary heroism , and the spirit of dedication ; and its ultimate objectives are to boost all citizens ' will , skills , and physical capabilities in loving , developing , and defending their motherland , so that they can firmly adopt the idea of " being prepared for danger in times of peace " and " joining hands to resist foreign aggression . "  
Judging from the surface , cross-strait relations remain calm and stable ; moreover , thanks to the hard efforts of the public as well as the industrial and commercial circles on the island who have been imposing pressure on the authorities , many man-made restrictions in Taiwan are forced to be relaxed , thus giving rise to an unprecedented upsurge of economic , trade , and cultural exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits .  
However , along with the progress of the times and the development of the situation , with the addition that there exist no fundamental interest conflicts between the Chinese on both sides of the strait , such " complexes " and " knots in the heart " between the Chinese across the strait can all be undone gradually in a benign interaction .  Has this not clearly proved by the increasingly close economic , trade , and cultural ties between the Chinese across the strait over the past more than a decade ?  
Over the last half a century , mutually beneficial cooperation between our two countries have developed in an all-round way in the political , economic , trade , cultural , and scientific and technological fields .  The two governments and peoples have always understood , trusted , and supported each other .  
According to the regulations of the Constitution and the regional national autonomy laws , after the establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region , Tibet enjoys autonomy in many aspects like legislation , use of its national languages , personnel management , management and development of natural resources , and so on .  Therefore , the cultural traditions , customs and habits , languages , and so on of the people of all nationalities in Tibet have been fully respected and the political , economic , social and all other rights have been reliably safeguarded .  
He does not recognize the one China principle , and negates the 1992 ARATS-Strait Exchange Foundation consensus on each side of the strait interpreting in oral form its " adherence to the one China principle " ; he has continued to practice the policy of " no haste , be patient , " blocked direct cross-strait " three links , " pushed " Taiwan cultural independence , " stepped up expansion of armaments and buying arms from abroad , and carried out activities to split the motherland in the international arena .  
After Tibet 's peaceful liberation , the central government and the Tibet Autonomous Regional Government began to list famous religious activity sites including the Johkang , Thaxi Lhunbo , Drepung , Sagya , and Sera Monasteries as key cultural heritages under national or autonomous regional protection .  
While intensifying the aversion of most countries in the world to varying degrees , the so-called " unilateralism , " which is criticized by many countries , has also prompted many people of insight in the world to begin pondering numerous profound and lasting historical philosophic , political , and cultural issues , such as that in the new century , how different countries , different systems , and different cultures should make use of each other 's strong points for reference and respect each other ;  
Here I would like to make a special explanation of one thing , that is , the " multipolarization , " which the Chinese people have often referred to , is based on a new understanding of the international relations in the new period or based on the philosophic and cultural theory that " the world is pluralistic and diversified in nature " rather than developing confrontation against a certain superpower or letting just a few big powers decide world affairs .  
Over the past five years , ASEM has held dialogues on a wide range of issues and carried out cooperation in various forms ; the Asian and the European leaders have held beneficial discussions on a series of major international and regional issues ; and the two sides have carried out exchanges and cooperated with each other in economic , trade , banking , scientific , technological , cultural , environmental , and other fields , and this has pushed forward and deepened the development of Asian-European relations . 
In fact , since the start of the ASEM 's cooperation mechanism , member countries have conducted extensive cooperation and exchanges in many areas .  In addition to economic , trade , and financial cooperation , Asia and Europe have launched political dialogues , cultural forums , and scientific and technological cooperation .  They have also sponsored symposiums on international issues , such as economic globalization , cultural diversification , strengthening the role of the United Nations , safeguarding the equilibrium and stability of global strategy , which have become the topics of ASEM .  
Their arduous efforts have brought about a great change in the look of poor areas : Their production means and living conditions have been markedly improved ; their production level raised by a big margin ; and great progress has been made in the scientific and technological , educational , cultural , and public health fields .  
The two countries have seen rapid development in exchanges and cooperation in the political , economic , cultural , educational , and other fields since they established diplomatic relations more than eight years ago .  
Particularly since the Third Central Forum on Work in Tibet , the region has taken the initiative in launching offensive and sought both a permanent cure and a temporary solution to the separatist problem .  The in-depth anti-separatist struggle in the political , ideological , educational , and cultural fields has dealt a crashing blow to all kinds of separatist activities , reversed the passive situation , and retaken the initiative .  As a result , basic stability of Tibet 's social and political situation has been maintained for a fairly long period .  
The key to prevailing in warfare will be people 's level of scientific and cultural knowledge .  Without a solid foundation in science and culture , there will be no excellent art of commanding to speak of .  
The weakness in scientific and cultural knowledge has become a " bottleneck " constraining improvement in cadres ' comprehensive quality .  To break this " bottleneck , " it is now urgent to raise cadres ' knowledge level as soon as possible .  Work hard to achieve a big leaping rise in cadres ' knowledge level shortly through efforts to make cadres have advanced schooling .  
A : China-Venezuela relations have been developing well in recent years .  The two sides have maintained high-level exchanges , made notable achievements in economic and trade cooperation , and gradually extended their cooperation in cultural , educational , scientific and technological fields .  
The two sides have maintained high-level exchanges , made notable achievements in economic and trade cooperation , and gradually extended their cooperation in cultural , educational , scientific and technological fields .  
They have taken advantage of the channels of international economic and cultural exchanges and dissemination to energetically advertise the political concepts of bourgeois democracy , freedom , and human rights , pursue egoistic values , advocate the reactionary views of divesting armed forces of party leadership and depoliticizing them , vilify CPC leadership , and wage an all-out attack against China 's socialist system with the aim of bringing about a credibility crisis or confidence crisis among the people , who will eventually abandon party leadership and the socialist system .  
In response to a reporter 's question , the spokesman said : We have taken note that to implement their separatist line in an accelerated way , the Taiwan authorities have taken many steps to cut off the cultural and spiritual links between Taiwan and the mainland .  The Taiwan leader 's refusal to admit he is a Chinese and recognize the principle of one China and his deliberate attempt to evade the basic fact that the two sides of the strait belong to one country are the most representative of this .  
The municipal party committee explicitly requires : All major affairs in the capital city 's political , economic , cultural , and social life must be submitted to the Political Consultation Conference for deliberation .  In particular , before decisions are made on major projects and policies , before the change of administrative division of districts in the municipality , and before the formulation of local laws and regulations , political consultation must be conducted .  
For example , they were related to such issues as reforming the housing system , reforming tertiary education , developing cultural industry , rebuilding old and dilapidated houses and buildings , and protecting historical cultural relics and legacies .  At the same time , the municipal party committee and government also set up a briefing system and arrange high-level and small-scope heart-to-heart talks .  
Hong Kong serves as a diverse cultural capital , the development of religious sects has its freedom , there is sound social differentiation of " religious sects " developed by the people 's knowledge , and illegal behavior by " religious sects " is already regulated by Hong Kong law .  The day that the government of the SAR , ignorant of religion , enacts the " Anti-Heretical Cult Law " , all legitimate " religious sects " will be affected .  
Wen Jiabao pointed out that the important " three represents " ideology advanced by Comrade Jiang Zemin has answered from a political , economic , and cultural point of view the basic questions of what type of party to build and how to build it .  It has given expression to a distinctly advanced characteristic , a scientifically innovative spirit , a broad , global view , and a staunch purpose for party building .  
Over the past century and half , it has kept advancing continually in practice , developing continually in practice , studying new situations , answering new questions , and continually incorporating , borrowing , and integrating various outstanding intellectual and cultural achievements , thereby enabling Marxism to always maintain its vitality and to continually open new realms .  
Therefore , upholding Marxism 's guidance position will not only not stop it from incorporating and borrowing other outstanding intellectual and cultural achievements , but also enable us to more scientifically distinguish the real from the fake and the correct from the wrong , to incorporate good elements , to reject bad elements , to have a broader field of vision , and to become even broader minded , a situation which will be more conducive to creating and enriching the new culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Li Lanqing fully affirmed the excellent achievements of Shanghai in economic and social development .  He greatly praised Shanghai for its efforts in vigorously rectifying and regulating the market economic order , developing chain operations for materials circulation , and strictly controlling the cultural market , in addition to accelerating the socialization of logistics work for institutes of higher learning and building the " university city " and quality education bases for youth in the course of educational reform .  
Speaking at a recent symposium on financial and economic affairs , Central Bank Vice Governor Chen Shih-meng mentioned that , at the recent International Monetary Fund meeting he attended , many foreign businessmen maintained that they believed the Chinese Mainland would become the biggest market in the future , but that , owing to political and cultural factors , they had problems gaining direct access .  
In particular , it should attach great importance to , and earnestly speed up , the development of tourism .  Sichuan has rich and colorful tourist resources .  It particular , it has cultural sites of historic interest , world-famous natural heritage , unique and fantastic natural scenery , and unique local ethnic customs and practices .  
It is necessary to pay great attention to the management of scenic spots .  Houses should not be built at random in the vicinity of scenic spots .  Much less should cultural sites of historical interest be damaged or destroyed to build vulgar public places of entertainment .  
He said : To safeguard regional security , the countries of the " Shanghai Five " should take joint actions in dealing blows at religious extremism , international terrorism , organized crime , drug trafficking , and arms smuggling .  At the same time , they should also expand cooperation in the economic , cultural , educational , scientific , and technological fields .  
Pay attention to intensifying the effort to analyze Western currents of political and cultural thinking , so as to reveal their reactionary nature , to make clear their decadent and harmful character , to enhance the sense of concern and the capacity to resist corruption and change , and to control armed forces ideologically and politically .  
While progressive thinking and advanced ideas are being formed and developed , various decadent ideas and cultural elements have also been taking this opportunity to achieve infiltration , with idealism , pseudo-science , and anti-Marxist currents of political thinking raising their heads and once-eradicated ugly social phenomena appearing to be resurrected ; the corrosive effects and influence on officials ' and soldiers ' minds should not be underestimated .  
It has provided a good example , which shows that all countries , large or small , can carry out regional cooperation on the basis of complete equality and mutual benefit .  It has demonstrated that showing mutual respect and seeking common ground while reserving differences is the only choice for countries with different civilization backgrounds and cultural traditions to live with each other in peace and harmony and achieve common prosperity .  
The " Shanghai spirit " cultivated by the Shanghai Five process of mutual trust , mutual benefit , equality , consultation , respect for cultural pluralism , and seeking common development , is a summary of the experiences of the five countries in handling mutual relations ; in addition , it is of important practical significance in promoting the establishment of a new international political and economic order of justice and reason .  
It stands for extensive bilateral and multilateral cooperation and exchange to put peace and security on a more solid foundation .  " Shanghai Spirit " speaks for mutual respect and seeking common points while reserving differences , which has been proved to be the only realistic choice for countries of different civilization backgrounds and cultural traditions to attain a peaceful coexistence .  
The Common Program solemnly announced the abolition of the feudal system , which had shackled women .  Women were to enjoy the same political , economic , cultural , educational , and other social rights as men .  It cut the four ropes that had bound Chinese women , namely , the political system , clan power , religious authority , and the authority of their husbands , and ushered in a new era in the liberation of Chinese women . "  
As the situation of regional development has been changing and non-stop various international forces have been involved in the region , the unique ethnic , cultural conditions and the difficult regional security issues of the Eurasian area have been plaguing each country of the region .  
Full development of the socialist economy will lay a solid foundation for resolving the contradiction between the backward social productivity and the growing material and cultural needs .  
With the coming of the new century , we ardently wish that Guangzhou and Tibet will walk to hand in hand even more closely , further strengthen and deepen their exchanges and cooperation in the economic , technical , scientific , educational , cultural , travel , and other areas , that they will continually create new forms of cooperation , expand the areas of cooperation , mutually use their strong points to compensate for weaknesses , and move forward shoulder to shoulder .  
Jiang Zemin inspected the building on 16 June . He exhorted the responsible comrades concerned to do a good job in building and managing the hall , turn it into an important window for imparting scientific thinking , spirit , knowledge , and methods , and make it play a positive role in enhancing the masses ' ideological and ethical qualities and scientific and cultural qualities .  
Under the leadership of the CPC , under the guidance of the party three-generation leading collectives with Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping , and Jiang Zemin as the core and , through the unremitting hard work of all party members and the people of all nationalities across the country , who have united as one in their struggle , tremendous changes of historic significance have taken place in the economic , political , cultural , and social features of China .  
Scientific and technical workers are part of China 's working class , they carry out courageous exploration and make constant progress , so they are the main inheritors and disseminators of scientific and cultural knowledge of humankind and play an irreplaceable role in the building of socialist material and spiritual civilization . 
Large numbers of publishing workers have persisted in serving the people , socialism , and the overall situation in the work of the party and state ; they have made remarkable achievements in publicizing Marxism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , in disseminating and accumulating scientific and cultural knowledge , in satisfying the spiritual and cultural needs of the people , and in promoting the building of the material and spiritual civilizations ; and they have played an important role in reform , opening up , and the drive for socialist modernization .  
To achieve their evil purpose of splitting the motherland , Taiwan splittist forces headed by Lee Teng-hui [ Li Denghui ] politically carried out , in a flagrant way , splittist activities to create " two China 's " or " one China , one Taiwan " and culturally attempted to cut off the historical and cultural ties between Taiwan and the mainland of the motherland to confuse the Taiwan society 's thinking .  
Especially since the beginning of the 1990 ' s , with the continuous progress of the domestic and international situation and the magnificent cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , the central leadership collective of the party with Jiang Zemin as the core has adhered to the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts , and made new explorations in practice and a new summarization in theory of many major economic , political , cultural , military , and diplomatic issues , thus enriching and developing Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
Cadres of naval and air forces have organized for party members and cadres , in light of the six-point requirements proposed by the General Department of Politics on maintaining the advanced nature of party members , to identify their weaknesses in ideological and political qualities and scientific , technological and cultural abilities , and strengthen the military 's sense of the urgency and responsibilities for advancing the military construction .  
Liu Yunshan said : In various historical periods in which the CPC leads revolution , construction and reform , its propaganda and ideological work plays a very important role in disseminating the scientific truth , promoting the integration of Marxism with the practical reality in China , uniting with , mobilizing and rallying the masses , fulfilling historical tasks in various periods , advocating advanced moral practice and scientific and civilized way of life , and improving the ideological , moral , scientific and cultural quality of the whole nation .  
Since its birth , the party " has been fighting not only for political and economic revolution in China , but also for cultural revolution in our country . "  Liu Yunshan pointed out : The party developed a new democratic culture - - a national , scientific and mass culture .  
The party has persisted in unfolding the main themes , advocating diversified development of our cultural undertakings , and vigorously developing our literature and art , press and publication , and radio and television undertakings to constantly satisfy our people 's increasing spiritual and cultural demands .  Cultural life of our urban and rural people is rich and colorful .  
independent culture ? to change the cultural identity of the Taiwan compatriots and then their national and state identities , eliminate their sense of belonging to the Chinese nation , undermine the basis of peaceful reunification between the two sides of the strait , and create an ideological and social basis for realizing their separatist plot . 
At this transcentury moment , our Party has correctly analyzed the situations at home and abroad , comprehensively summed up the successful experiences of the reform and opening up the outside world over 20 years , formulated the economic , political , and cultural programs of the Party in the primary stage of socialism , striven to realize the combination of public ownership with market economy , developed the socialist market economy , let the social productive forces constantly be liberated and developed , and meanwhile upheld the political direction of socialism .  
Since the founding of New China , the economy and society have developed rapidly ; the country has become increasingly prosperous ; the people 's social status , living standards and cultural and educational level have risen markedly .  
To raise the ideological and ethical standards and scientific and cultural levels of the workers , peasants , intellectuals , and other laboring people and the entire population and improve their work skills and creativity and give full scope to their enthusiasm , initiative , and creative power - - these should remain the tasks of primary importance that our party should perform in representing China 's advanced productive forces .  
To make our party represent the direction of the development of China 's advanced culture , we must make its theory , line , programs , principles , policies , and all its work reflect the requirements of the national , scientific , and popular socialist culture that develops toward modernization , the world , and the future , and enable them to upgrade the ideological and ethical quality and scientific and cultural quality of the whole nation and to provide spiritual impetus and intellectual support for China 's economic development and social progress .  
focus our attention on the front line of world scientific and cultural development ; develop a healthy , progressive , rich , and colorful socialist culture with Chinese style and characteristics to meet the increasing demands of the people ; and direct the people to get mentally equipped and upgraded with correct ideas .  
To always represent the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people , our party must , in all kinds of work including party 's theory , line , program , principle and policy , persevere in taking the fundamental interests of the people as the starting point and ultimate goal , bring into full play people 's enthusiasm , initiative and creativity , and enable the people to constantly obtain tangible economic , political and cultural benefits through continuous social development and progress .  
In order to forever represent the orientation of the development of China 's advanced culture , we must make the party 's theory , line , program , principles , policies and all its work reflect the requirements of the national , scientific and popular socialist culture that develops toward modernization , the world and the future ; enable them to upgrade the ideological and ethical qualities and scientific and cultural qualities of the whole nation and to provide the motive power and support culturally and intellectually .

In keeping with the economic , political and cultural requirements of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , all comrades in the party and all people in the country should strive to achieve the development goals set for the Tenth Five-Year Plan . We should focus on development through economic restructuring and by relying on reform , opening up and scientific and technological progress with a view to improving people 's living standards and constantly pushing for economic growth and social progress .  
It is a rather complete system of science in the aspects of philosophy , political economy , and scientific socialism and covers the economic , political , scientific and technological , educational , cultural , ethnic , military , foreign affairs , united front , and party building aspects .  It is also a system of science to be further enriched and developed in all aspects .  
To practice the requirement of representing the orientation of the development of China 's advanced culture , we must enhance the building of socialist spiritual civilization , persistently educate the people with Marxism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , effectively implement the strategy of relying on science and education for national regeneration , promote the enhancement of the ideological and moral integrity and scientific and cultural attainments of the whole nation .  
It is necessary to inherit and carry forward all good cultures , including the fine cultural tradition of the Chinese nation , the revolutionary cultural tradition formed by the party and the people over a long time , and all advanced civilization achievements created by human society , and strive to develop our national and scientific socialist culture oriented to modernization , to the world , and to the future .  
On the basis of economic development and social progress , it is necessary to increase the income of urban and rural residents , continuously raise the people 's living standards and life quality , and continuously enable the people to gain better and solid economic , political , and cultural benefits .  
We must learn from their love of their jobs and respect for their occupations , consciously standing in the front ranks of the construction of material and cultural / ideological progress , bringing the vanguard model functions into full play in each job with a solemn sense of mission and an intense sense of responsibility , striving to get ahead and making first-rate achievements in the course of reforms , opening up , and modernization .  
Shi Zhongquan , deputy director of the CPC Central Party History Research Center , said : The important concept of " three represents " was put forward to strengthen our party ideologically , to make large numbers of party cadres , especially the leading cadres , keep firmly in mind the nature and purpose of the party , to keep improving the political , ideological , theoretical , scientific , cultural , and other qualities of the party , and to always preserve and carry forward the its advanced nature .  
base ourselves on the realities in China , with attention focused on the front line of world scientific and cultural development ; and unceasingly develop a healthy , progressive , rich , and colorful socialist culture with Chinese style and characteristics .  That is also the fundamental expression and requirement for our party to remain in the forefront of the times and maintain its advanced nature .  
To constantly develop advanced productive forces and culture is , in the final analysis , aimed at meeting the growing material and cultural needs of the people and continuously realizing the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people . "  
The circular requires that all military units provide more technological , educational , cultural , and medical support to the people in poor areas , thus helping them develop the ability to shake off poverty and get rich .  
The third liberation was cultural and ideological liberation .  This liberation released the people of Tibet , long-enslaved under the binding ties of a unitary religious and political system and the corruption of feudal serfdom , from the remnants of backward thought .  
Representing the progressive course of the advanced culture is also a very realistic need .  So it is very urgent to improve the scientific and cultural qualities of peasants ; the quality of the people as a whole can be improved only when the peasants ' quality is improved .  
financial fraud and violations of fiscal and economic discipline are widespread ; there is fraud and deception in tendering for construction projects , and the quality of some projects is inferior ; the cultural markets are chaotic ; and major and serious safety accidents occur from time to time in production operations .  Some new characteristics have recently emerged in illegal activities , such as crimes being committed by syndicates , transregional crimes , crimes committed by collusion between outside and inside , specialized crime , and intellectualized crime .  
In earmarking billions of yuan for the improvement of the urban environment in spite of a relative shortage of overall financial resources , Guangzhou 's fundamental starting point is that , as General Secretary Jiang noted , " the continuous development of advanced productive forces and advanced culture is essentially to meet the growing material and cultural needs of the masses and to continuously realize the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people . "  
Second , we must further reinforce socialist ideological and cultural progress and promote the steady improvement of the ideological , moral , scientific and cultural qualities of our people in order to turn Guangzhou into a city that is truly " suitable for starting one 's business and suitable to live in . "  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's 1 July speech adheres to the unity of the historical and current views , the unity of moving forward and developing Marxism and the unity of the theory and reality .  This important speech comprehensively , systematically and profoundly reveals the rich content , the scientific spirit and the mutual relationship among the " three represents " and explicitly points out the guiding and theoretical significance of the " three represents " on Party-building and the political , economic and cultural development of our country .  
The games we are going to host will be the Olympics Games of humanities , as ours is a country with ancient civilization and Beijing , the capital , has a brilliant history and culture of more than 3,000 years .  As the world is ablaze with different colors , the grand cultural exchange to be carried out through the Olympics Games will make the world even more colorful and splendid . "  
completely get rid of the soil on which the " Falungong " cult and various decadent ideologies and cultures breed ; strive to give rise to a sound general trend of opposing religious cults and upholding civilization in society ; and make positive contribution to improving the ideological and moral quality as well as the scientific and cultural quality of the entire nation , and to promoting the country 's undertaking of reform , opening up , and modernization building .  
Since the first visit by President Yeltsin to China in December 1992 , the cooperation between the two countries in all fields rapidly developed and the exchanges between the two countries in the political , economic , scientific and technological , cultural and other fields became increasingly frequent and close .  According to statistics , in 1993 the number of visits between delegations of the two countries above the vice ministerial level reached 25 ; and in 1994 it reached 36 .  
exemplarily carrying out the party 's ethnic and religious policies ; actively assisting local authorities in vigorously developing science and technological , educational , cultural , and health work ; serving as a vanguard , fighting on the forefront , heroically protecting the people 's lives and property in various missions to deal with emergencies and relieve disaster victims , writing heroic songs of victory one after another and fully demonstrating a good image of being a mighty and civilized army and an army of triumph .  
The historical mission for the current period put forth by our Party is , through reform and opening-up , to further liberate and develop the productive forces , promote national economic , political and cultural development in an all-around way , continuously improve people 's material and cultural standards of living , strive to build China into a prosperous , strong , democratic , civilized , modernized socialist country , and strive for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese people .  
With the development of reforms , opening-up and the modernization drive , the working class , including intellectuals , in China has expanded steadily , the quality of the working class has improved markedly in terms of the ideological and moral standard and the scientific and cultural level , a large group of conscientious , advanced elements within the working class has been accepted by the Party , and the class foundation of our Party has increased markedly .  
With the direct concern shown and efforts made by the heads of state of the two countries , exchange of high-level visits between China and Russia has been frequent , and the mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries in the political , economic , science and technological , cultural , educational , and other fields has continued to develop , and the results have been notable .  
Second , with regard to the principle of noninterference in internal affairs , the treaty advocates transcending ideology and not interfering in the choice of the other party 's road for political , economic , social , and cultural development adopted in light of its national conditions .  
In the first 10 years plus since the implementation of reform and opening up , the gap between the level of Tibet 's economic and cultural development with the inland and the inland as well as the coastal developed areas in the east showed a trend of further widening instead of shrinking because Tibet was restricted by natural conditions and because of historical reasons .  
Under the CPC 's leadership , cadres and common people of all ethnic groups in Tibet have abolished feudal serfdom and established political power based on the people 's democracy , and have been exercising regional ethnic autonomy and pressing ahead with the cause of building socialism .  All this has unleashed and expanded Tibet 's social productive forces to an unprecedented level and contributed to the continuing improvement of the Tibetan people 's material and cultural lives .  
Over the 10 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries , relations of bilateral cooperation have developed smoothly .  There have been frequent mutual visits at a high level and the two sides have established a basic framework and principle for cooperation in political , economic , trade , cultural and other fields .  
Since China and Ukraine established diplomatic relations 10 years ago , exchanges and cooperation in the political , economic and trade , science and technological , educational , cultural , sports , and other fields between our two countries have continued to broaden , and encouraging results have been achieved .  
Both sides are continuously expanding and deepening cooperation and exchange in the political , economic and trade , scientific and technological , educational , cultural fields , and maintain the fine tradition of positive consultation and close cooperation in international affairs .  Satisfactory results have been achieved .  
Whether from the historical , cultural , or geographical angles , or from the political and economic reality angle , Taiwan 's future lies with the mother mainland , and its security is determined by the close ties of people on both sides of the strait and by ultimate peaceful reunification .  
Political consultation and coordination have become increasingly enhanced , with closer cooperation in the United Nations and other international institutions .  Economic and trade relations have developed continuously , trade volume has grown for many years running , and cultural and educational exchanges have been increasingly active .  
It represents the contemporary advanced strategic culture and security idea , is a continuation and development in the new period of China 's Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , an extension and continuation in international security affairs of China 's new type of peace-loving and development-pursuing political idea , and the new manifestation in contemporary security affairs of China 's fine cultural tradition of regarding peace as the top priority , maintaining good neighborly and amicable relations with one 's neighbors , and maintaining peaceful and cooperative relations with all countries .  
China 's overall national strength has been greatly increased , and the people 's material and cultural life enhanced .  China has also greatly raised its international status .  To uphold the Party 's absolute leadership over the army in accordance with the requirements of the " three represents , " we must even more unswervingly uphold the authority of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core .  
He said , developing good neighborly and friendly relations between the DPRK and Russia is in the fundamental interests of both countries , and there are tremendous potentials for bilateral cooperation in the economic , military , and cultural fields .  
At the exhibition , more than 2,000 valuable pictures and 500 cultural relics , displayed in chronological sequence of historical development , vividly depicted the brilliant achievements scored by the people of all nationalities throughout the country in carrying out revolution , reform , construction , and reform under the leadership of the party 's three generations of central collective leadership with Comrades Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping , and Jiang Zemin as the core .  
Since the peaceful liberation 50 years ago , Tibet has witnessed profound social changes , including the democratic reform as well as reform and opening up , and has scored world-renowned successes in its political , economic , and cultural development .  
In carrying out political structural reform , we must take into full account China 's historical background , level of economic development , and cultural and educational standards , and must also help to preserve national unity , ethnic solidarity , and social stability .  
In carrying out political structural reform , we must take into full account China 's historical background , level of economic development , and cultural and educational standards , and must also help to preserve national unity , ethnic solidarity , and social stability .  
Rectifying and standardizing the cultural market order is the inherent demand for putting the important idea of " three represents " into practice and for vigorously developing China 's advanced culture .  Rectifying and standardizing the cultural market order is necessary in order to build and perfect the socialist market economy system and to meet the challenges brought about by China 's accession to the World Trade Organization . Rectifying and standardizing the cultural market order is also necessary in order to purify the social environment and to guarantee that the masses of young people grow up healthily .  
In accordance with the Regulations Governing the Administration of Recreational Establishments and on the basis of the principle of " protecting what is legitimate , cracking down on what violates the law , and banning what is illegal , " cultural , public security , industrial and commercial departments at all levels , as well as other functional departments , must resolutely ban recreational establishments that are engaged in illegal operations without a license or a complete license .  
It is a period of the CPC leading the Chinese people to instigate to materialize national prosperity and strength and shared prosperity among people during reforms and opening up to the outside world , to construct a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics .  The CPC has made great achievements that attracted worldwide attention during its modernization process , and remarkably raised the social productivity and overall national strength , the people 's social status , living standards and material and cultural level .  
Since the founding of New China , the economy and society have developed rapidly ; the country has become increasingly prosperous ; the people 's social status , living standards and material and cultural level have risen markedly .  
Both sides have seen continuous high-level exchanges , rapid development in trade relations , ever expanding economic and technological cooperation , and productive exchanges in cultural , sports , and other areas .  The forum plans to officially set up a trade representative office in China this year .  
Qian Qichen said in his speech , international nongovernmental organizations have developed very rapidly in recent years ; they have played an increasingly important role in international political , economic , military , cultural , and social fields , and have become a force that can not be neglected in the international arena .  
create a sound social order environment for economic development ; and protect and promote the development of the advanced productive forces .  We must resolutely wipe out the ugly social phenomena , such as pornography , gambling , and narcotics ; strengthen management of cultural entertainment places and cultural markets ; firmly crack down on illegal and criminal activities using feudal superstition and religion ; enhance people 's sense of the legal system and ethics ;  
At the present stage , the advanced nature of communist party members should naturally find expression in their conscientious study of Deng Xiaoping Theory and Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents , " and find expression in their conscious efforts to plunge themselves into socialist economic , political , and cultural buildings with Chinese characteristics .  
Non-public-run economic organizations , social bodies , and civilian-run non-enterprise units are emerging in large numbers , and are producing a major influence on the economic , cultural , and social development of our country .  To guide these economic and social bodies to attain a healthy development , we need to have correct principles and policies as well as a perfect legal system , and we also need to strengthen the party 's political leadership .  
4 .  The two sides agreed that the two countries ' cooperation in the political , economic , cultural , educational , public health , and scientific and technological fields had brought tangible benefits to both countries and their people .  
We must perceive the major political , economic , cultural , and science and technology changes that have taken place in the world since the publication of the " Communist Manifesto " 150 years ago ; we must perceive the major changes that have occurred in China 's socialist construction ; and we must perceive the major changes that have taken place in the working and living conditions and social environment of the party members , cadres , and masses .  
Officials were of the view that on-line information should be able to satisfy the needs of the people 's just and healthy spiritual life , allow the world to understand China fully , accurately , and in a timely way , and resist the ideological and cultural infiltration of harmful information and its pernicious social influence .  
Zhu Bangzao said : The two sides had an in-depth exchange of views on further strengthening diverse cooperative relations between China and the four countries in the political , economic , trade , and cultural fields , and on international and regional issues , such as the establishment of a new international political and economic order , the Middle East issue , the Gulf situation , and the Iraq issue .  They reached broad consensus .  
In the past year , the Chinese Government has made efforts to realize the people 's economic , social and cultural rights , as well as to promote and protect the citizens ' political rights , and has made remarkable progress in this respect , thus comprehensively raising the level of enjoying various human rights by the Chinese people .  
The Chinese Government has stood all kinds of rigorous tests in the complicated changing situation and scored remarkable achievements in the political , economic , social , science and technology , cultural , and diplomatic fields .  
Providing a panoramic view of the government 's work , this over-15,000-character Government Work Report is composed of 10 parts which cover the political , economic , social , and cultural fields , with more than half of its space devoted to economy-related contents .  Such a fact not only tallies with China 's present principle of " centering everything on the economy , " but has precisely reflected the expertise of this premier in economic management .  
Banking , financial and taxation , customs , scientific research , educational , and cultural and public health departments and all government organizations should use electronic and information technologies and communications networks to set up and improve high-efficiency , reliable , applicable management and social service information systems .  
Since reform and opening up two decades ago , Fujian-Taiwan trade and economic exchanges and cooperation have developed steadily , their quality and level have been constantly increased , and people-to-people and social and cultural exchanges have become increasingly frequent , initially bringing about a situation of economic complementarity and mutual benefit , mutual promotion , and common development .  
In the past 50 years since the founding of new China , especially in the past 20 years since the beginning of reform and opening up , the level of the people 's material and cultural life has constantly been raised , and the human rights cause , being a part of these achievements , has also made comprehensive and concrete progress personally experienced by the Chinese people on the basis of the constant development of the economy in China .  
China 's diplomatic policy is to develop friendly ties of cooperation with all countries in the world based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence , Zhu stated .  China is willing to further develop cooperation with Iran in the political , economic , and cultural fields .  
Due to the historical link of nationalities , religion , cultural and geographical position and because of the resurgence of Turkism and Islamism in central and western Asia , those separatists who escaped from Xinjiang years ago are engaged in separatist activities in countries in central Asia . Xinjiang 's separatists have also used Turkey as their base of operation .  
During his visits , President Jiang exchanged with the heads of state , heads of government , and parliamentary leaders of the six nations in-depth views on bilateral relations and the current international situation .  He also made extensive contacts with personalities of the economic and trade , business , science and technological , educational , and cultural circles of the six nations ; and visited and investigated factories , farming villages , and some representative cultural facilities .

Under the new circumstance , it is the military academies ' central task to cultivate new-type and high-quality military talents , who have comprehensive and excellent development in aspects such as ideological and political building , scientific and cultural building , military profession , and physical and psychological strength , and are endowed with comprehensive knowledge and talents as well as the spirit and ability to make initiative .  
Third , in the face of the mutual impacts of the various different ideologies and cultures in the world , it is not enough for us to depend only on the method of controlling the information flow ; and we must also improve the quality of socialist cultural products and give shape to a common ideal and a spiritual pillar of the Chinese nation in the whole society .  
It should give full play to its political nucleus role and set a correct direction , goal and task for the development of Chinese culture .  It should formulate a correct line , guiding principle and policy , provide a staunch cultural and organizational guarantee and become the leader of the progressive course of China 's advanced culture .  
It should actively propagate , popularize and promote advanced ideology and culture among the masses and develop a scientific , civilized and progressive ideological concept , way of production and way of life .  It should constantly enhance ideological and moral quality and scientific and cultural level of the whole nation and become the disseminator of China 's advanced culture .  
To sum up , we may see that only the saving of military and diplomatic expenses and the lowering of the costs by the " three direct links " will bring huge benefits ; as for the tapping of potential from cross-strait cooperation , the invisible assets in the political , foreign relations , cultural , and educational fields will be immeasurable .  
Relations of cooperation between the two countries have been constantly reinforced in the political , economic , scientific and technological , and cultural fields ; there have been constant high-level contacts between the two armies ; and exchanges are being carried out in multiple fields and at multiple levels .  
We should build an advanced culture to meet the people 's growing needs in cultural life and provide the productive forces development with a spiritual motive force as well as intellectual support .  
Our party has devoted herself to the development of both advanced social productive forces and an advanced culture with a view to meeting the people 's and masses ' growing material and cultural needs and realizing or safeguarding the fundamental interests of the largest majority of the people .  
In his May 20 speech , he indicated the intention to " continually strengthen substantive diplomatic relations with friendly countries , " and also declared , in an undisguised manner , that Taiwan " will vigorously participate in various international nongovernment organizations and take an active part in international affairs through such diverse means as humanitarian concerns , economic and trade cooperation , and cultural exchanges , so as to expand Taiwan 's space for survival internationally . "  
to establish a set of specific management systems that suit the characteristics of science , educational , cultural , health , and other institutions and fit in with the regular patterns of the respective jobs of professional and technical personnel , managerial personnel , and workers and service personnel ;  
Third , the government of the locality where the S &amp; T park is located must make a change in its role and enhance its service quality , do a good job in improving the S &amp; T park 's supporting facilities , environment , communications , social order , cultural and sport facilities , basic education , public health , and social security , thus cultivate favorable conditions for the development of the park .  
Countries differ in many ways , in their social systems , historical backgrounds , cultural heritage , economic development , standard of living , religious beliefs , and values .  Therefore , it is not possible to expect all countries to develop after a single model or system .  
Many papers and periodicals are geared to the masses , the grass roots , and daily life , and persist in guiding people with correct public opinion ; the readers have welcomed them , and they have played a positive role in satisfying the political , economic , cultural , and daily life requirements of the masses and spurring the building of the two civilizations .  
Li Peng said : China similarly respects the general principle of the international community on human rights .  However , we feel that as countries have different social systems , economic conditions , historical backgrounds , cultural traditions , and religious beliefs , they do not share an identical understanding of human rights .  This is very natural .  
In the past 50 years , the Chinese Government has not only basically provided enough food and clothing for 1.2 billion people and greatly raised the people 's living standards , but also allowed the people to enjoy civil , political , economic , social , cultural , and educational rights on the basis of the Constitution and law .  We can say that China 's current human rights situation is in the best period in history .  
The North-South Joint Declaration confirms the basic principles for pursuing independent and peaceful unification on the Korean Peninsula , as well as the direction for seeking unification .  It agrees to realize the exchange of visitor groups of separated families and relatives , and explicitly calls for seeking balanced national economic development through economic cooperation , increasing exchanges and cooperation in the social , cultural , sports , public health , and environmental spheres , and establishing a mechanism of dialogue between the two governments as soon as possible .  
Both sides have agreed to promote the development of the national economy through economic cooperation , and to enhance mutual understanding and mutual trust by boosting cooperation and exchange in the social , cultural , sports , public health , environment , and other fields .  
Chi Haotian said that since establishing diplomatic relations in 1985 China and Bolivia have enjoyed smooth development of friendly cooperative relations , both sides have expanded exchanges and cooperation in political , economic , military and cultural fields , to which China is satisfied , and is willing to make continuous efforts to further relations between the two states and armed forces in a healthy and stable way .  
Second , it expresses their discontent of the West for ignoring Asian ideological traditions all these years .  What is more , it also reflects a kind of anxiety shown by people under the challenge of global economic globalization .  In the present-day world when economic activities become more " interdependent , " it is necessary to consider establishing some moral consensus on the spiritual and cultural levels .  
Since the establishment of diplomatic relations seven years ago , China and Slovakia have made joint efforts to promote the constant development of friendly cooperation in the political , economic , military , science , technology , and cultural fields .  
Both sides have decided to exchange visiting groups of separated families and relatives in as early as coming August , and both are prepared to promote mutual cooperation and exchange in social , cultural , and other fields through economic cooperation .  
since our party represents the orientation for the progress of China 's advanced culture , it must persistently take Marxism as the guide , inherit and develop all fine cultural traditions of the Chinese nation , study and absorb all the fruits of human civilization , and continually build and create socialist culture with Chinese characteristics , so that material and spiritual civilization will develop in coordinated fashion and promote the all-round progress of society ;  
In particular , in the past 10 years , top-level leaders of the two countries have frequently exchanged mutual visits , and bilateral exchange and cooperation in political , economic , trade , scientific and technological , and cultural fields have developed comprehensively .  
Since people 's spiritual and cultural demands are restricted by historical , social , or personal factors on the one hand , and is plastic in nature on the other .  Therefore , guiding people 's spiritual and cultural life is both necessary and indispensable .  
He said : Our contingent of professional literary and artistic workers is the backbone force in our country 's cultural building while the fine works can reflect in a centralized way both the epochal spirit and cultural standard of a country . 
The two sides agreed that China and Iran , two great ancient civilizations in Asia , should enhance exchanges and cooperation in cultural , educational and social areas to develop and substantiate the dialogue among civilizations .  These will be effective steps towards enhanced international cooperation in this field .  
In the meantime , the two sides maintained that to look at the political , economic , social , cultural and civil rights , particularly the right to development in a comprehensive [ English version uses " balanced " ] manner and in the right perspective is of special significance to all countries .  
But we should also be aware that some issues and difficulties do exist in the work of people 's courts , particularly courts at the grassroots level .  The cases in point are their failure to cope with the profound changes in economic , social , ideological , and cultural aspects .  
through the struggle during the period of reform , our party did away with the shortcomings of the economic , political , science , educational , cultural , and other systems that were unable to meet demand of further development of productive forces , thus further liberating and developing productive forces .  
In the final analysis , all struggles carried out by our party were aimed at liberating and developing productive forces ; and all guiding principles and policies adopted by our party are aimed at eventually ensuring continuous development of productive forces , boosting national economic development , raising the overall national strength , building socialist material and spiritual civilizations , satisfying the people 's increasing material and cultural needs , and becoming more representative of the people 's fundamental interests .  
As regards human rights , Li Peng has stressed and pointed out : It is impossible to demand that various countries follow the same viewpoint or mechanically transplant the same mode on the question of human rights , for human rights is an integral concept , and complete and common human rights should include not only the political rights of citizens but also the economic , social , and cultural rights , especially the right of survival and the right of development . 
and further deepened its understanding of China 's basic national condition .  It proposed : The main social contradiction is the one between the increasing material cultural needs of the people and the backward social productive forces .  This main contradiction runs through the whole process of the initial stage of socialism and all aspects of social life .  
7 .  The cultural , trade and economic , public security , information industry , foreign trade and economic affairs departments , customs houses , and administrations for industry and commerce at various levels must unify their thinking , increase their awareness , and further define their own functions and responsibilities .  Under the leadership of the local party committee and government , they must assume their responsibilities , closely coordinate with each other , and earnestly carry out their own administrative work and strengthen their routine supervision and management .  
The biggest lie spread by Dalai Lama at international occasions in recent years is the " theory of the extinction of the Tibetan culture . "  Making groundless charges on hearsay and deliberately distorting facts , he has accused the Tibetan people 's efforts to discard the decadent cultural traits that have seriously hindered Tibet 's social and economic development as " exterminating the Tibetan culture . "  
the effective protection and the active use of cultural relics and historical records ; the respect and protection that has been showed and extended to customs and folkways as well as to the freedom of religious belief ; an all-round inheritance and development of culture and arts ; a comprehensive engagement in Tibetan studies ; and by the rejuvenation of the Tibetan medicine .  All these have attested to the full that the Tibetan culture has undergone an unprecedented development , and this is a fact that allows of no doubt .  
Meanwhile , along with the elimination of the feudal serf system , the cultural trait accompanying the old system that the Tibetan culture was monopolized by a tiny minority of serf owners will surely be " exterminated " ; and the old cultural autocracy featured by both an unification of the administration and the monastery and the dominance of region in Tibet 's entire social and political life will surely be eliminated .  This is a necessity in the development of the Tibetan history , and also a necessity in the development of the Tibetan culture .  
We should throw into the garbage heap all the ideas and actions that run counter to the " three represents , " as well as all the feudal , superstitious , and unhealthy bourgeois ideas that have corroded our party organizations and party members , but we should uphold all the statements and actions that are capable of promoting the development of productive forces , conducive to heightening the advanced cultural level , and tallying with the people 's immediate and long-term interests .  
According to radically changed social conditions , the eighth party congress of 1956 made the correct judgment that the principal contradiction in Chinese society was one between the people 's rapidly increasing economic and cultural needs and the failure to satisfy their such needs ; at the same time , the congress also made accurate statements on the party 's nature , purposes , and tasks .  
it should persist in " grasping two links at the same time and giving equal importance to both of them , " vigorously step up the building of the socialist spiritual civilization , strive to improve the ideological and moral standards and scientific and cultural qualities of the whole nation , bring up a new generation of people who have lofty ideals and moral integrity and who are well-educated and self-disciplined , and create a political atmosphere of respecting knowledge and talented people in the party ;  
We must understand , think over , and resolve , in accordance with the intrinsic relations among society , economics , politics , and culture , the question of how our party can better represent the advance orientation of China 's advanced culture , always uphold Marxism as the guide , and strive to understand and master the characteristics and laws of cultural construction so as to continuously create and push ahead the culture with Chinese characteristics , develop socialist materialist and spiritual civilizations in a coordinated way , and achieve overall social progress .

Love for learning is a proud tradition as well as a powerful motive force responsible for the rapid growth of our publishing industry . With close cooperation between the publishing and printing industries and whole-hearted support for each other , cultural and educational circles of the Republic of China look to an encouraging future .

During the switch in the social infrastructure from an agricultural to an industrial base , embroidery has proved to be a valuable stabilizing force in cultivating the mind and preserving the cultural heritage , while at the same time earning foreign exchange for the country .  
Lin pointed out that as a precious Chinese cultural legacy , the art of flower arrangement was popular in the Sui and Tang dynasties ( 589-907 A . D . ) , when it was first introduced to Japan . Wild flowers and natural raw materials are endowed with new vitality when they are arranged artistically , giving an elegant and refined look to the most mundane surroundings .  
Additionally , the government has prepared a " major program for developing the bastion of national revival " to expedite simultaneous implementation of medium-range and long-range economic , social and cultural plans over the next 10 years . "  
Work Enriches Students ' Lives As a relative newcomer to the industrial world , Taiwan has been experiencing accompanying changes in its social and cultural structure . In China in the past , academic study was generally re served for the nobility or the rich , while toiling in the fields was the lot of most people .  
I 'm only helping to preserve them for their descendents , " Gao says . He has had offers to sell his collection for prices as high as five times the original cost , but is determined to eventually hand it over to a cultural organization for proper care and display .

Li uses special machinery to replace human labor , creating slabs of so fine a texture that the grain of the slick wooden mold used for shaping is clearly visible on the surface of the product . As production increased , Li opened a number of " cultural service centers " in smaller towns to offer his products at close-to-cost prices . He also opened a gallery where calligraphers and painters may exhibit their works free of charge .  
At that time the social order was stable the economy was thriving and the suburbs of Changan and Loyang were thickly populated . The capital , Changan , was the political , economic , and cultural center of Asia .  
Pointing to the Republic of China 's attractive investment climate , Chen Fei-lung , chairman of Nan Chao Chemical Industries commented , " Over the last 30 years , Taiwan has had a very stable and secure government . There is a highly skilled and educated work force , and with the traditional cultural and ethical background , this makes for harmonious labor relations . Worker productivity also surpasses that in many Southeast Asian nations . These are all factors that attract Overseas Chinese investment . "  
This bustling hub is not only one of the island 's most prosperous industrial centers but is also rich in history and traditional Chinese arts and crafts . Taichung is a unique blend of old and new , offering the visitor an example of Taiwan 's economic development and a glimpse of its cultural heritage .  
In selecting the subject matter for each series , the group tries to adhere to some specific guidelines . There are four main areas which serve as sources of stamp subjects . The first of these are themes drawn from the rich cultural heritage of Chinese tradition . Other selections are made in accordance with certain international activities such as the " International Year of the Child " , and still another criteria for selection are important current events .  
From then until the late nineteenth century , Tainan served as the political , cultural and economic center of Taiwan . Its rich history has left Tainan with a heritage of cultural landmarks and scholarly contributions unmatched elsewhere on the island .  
Chen Shu-yuan states that many adult observers are surprised to see that the children are quite cultivated in their selection of tapes and videos . While the cartoon is still popular , many cultural offerings have won equal acceptance among the avid participants .  
When the government moved to Taiwan , a new administrative system was implemented which left Chang Hua without its provincial seat of government . The criteria for a provincial seat was either a population of half a million or a population of only 200,000 and a reputation as a cultural , economic or administrative center .  
After years of construction , our political system is quite vigorous and our society is gradually growing more diverse . We maintain trade , scientific , and cultural relations with over 140 countries around the world , but because our government adopts a policy of no compromise , no negotiations , and no contacts to resist the " united front " tactics of the Communists , we have been misunderstood by the international community as stiff-necked conservatives . What is the Premier 's view ?  
The participants were organized into panels to discuss the following eight topics : tactics for long-term economic development , the development of education and human resources , social and cultural development , the development of science and technology , the development of capital and currency markets , regional development , planning for a comprehensive transportation system , and information and communications .  
This so-called " domain of single subjectivity " refers to the main characteristic that in traditional Chinese history social , economic , academic , cultural , and artistic activities as subjectivities were deeply influenced by political activity as subjectivity .  
Ancient China was known as " the land of impeccable attire , " and its culture was always closely tied to the high technical level of its textile crafts . Its silk fabrics , for instance , were treasured commodities among people in other countries , and the Silk Road became a symbol of cultural interchange between East and West . At home its precious textiles spurred the development of the art of embroidery .  
For us " China fever " raises a number of interesting questions . From the land of marvels described by Marco Polo , through the utopia pictured by philosophers of the Enlightenment and the Sick Man of Asia coveted by imperialists , to the future world power predicted by Arnold Toynbee , just what attitudes have Westerners held toward this ancient country isolated by oceans on one side and forbidding plains on the other ? And why ? The Western Powers removed many cultural treasures from the country during the course of the nineteenth century .  
In Europe , which has a strong cultural background of its own , sinological research - - setting out from the tasks of translation and textual criticism - - was exceptionally solid and meticulous , and major figures continued to appear up until the middle of this century .  
These included : The government should increase cultural and educational investment , establish a complete social welfare system and robust rule of law system , and strengthen public trust and public authority . The mass media should educate society and improve social habits , and should avoid exaggerating stories .  
The image of the lion is widely seen in art both East and West , but in East Asia , where the animal is not indigenous , the conclusion is obvious that its image must have come from West , possibly as long ago as the time of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia . The creation of the artistic lion of East Asia from the real lion , that is to say , represents a kind of cultural interchange .  
Despite its foreign origins in both physical reality and artistic representation , the pomegranate has been able to express even more of its charm in China . Well suiting the Chinese national spirit , it has long been broadly popular among the people , as well as marking a pleasant footnote in the history of cultural and artistic interchange between East and West . (  
Some countries have formal diplomatic relations with us and some do not , but the countries that do not all have a number of substantive relations with us , such as economic and trade ties , scientific and technological cooperation , athletic and cultural exchanges , a whole host of them .  
Mr . Chien said the government has stressed economic development in the past , and neglected cultural and social construction . , In the future it will try to compensate , and looks forward to achieving the following indicators by the year 2000 : * Price increases will not exceed 3.5% annually ; * The economic growth rate will reach 6.5% annually ; * Per capita GNP will reach US $ 20,000 ; * Trade volume will reach US $ 350 billion .  
This includes the establishment of centers for folk arts and popular handicrafts in southern and eastern Taiwan . In the north , Chinese culture parks will be set up . And at the same time at least five large-scale museums will be added to the present number . Exhibition halls displaying the unique features of local and indigenous products will become part and parcel of the cultural centers of every county and town .  
Community cultural activities will be held regularly during weekends or vacations . A spirit of good neighborliness is sure to prevail , and mutual assistance within an interdependent entity will become common . In collaboration with religious and civic bodies , the government will endeavor to foster and encourage ethical norms which are in conformity with our present-day society , itself a product of popular customs and mores blended with traditional rites and ceremonies .  
If both the government and the people adhere to the established policies of political democratization , economic liberalization , societal pluralization , and cultural sinification ; if they speed the development of democratic politics and maintain stable economic growth ; and if they progress in related social and cultural respects - - all this will mean that all sectors in our nation will develop in a balanced way and forge ahead jointly .  
After returning to China , Lin lived an impassioned life , writing essays , speaking , running the school , and organizing cultural activities . His passion was devoted to the realization of his ideal of " social aesthetization . "  
He composed poems and antithetical couplets in impeccable classical Chinese , disdaining the vernacular and even the modern innovation of punctuation . He married a Chinese and hobnobbed with such cultural luminaries as Ch'i Pai-shih and Shen Yin-mo , filling his leisure hours with the traditional pursuits of a Chinese literatus : the lute , the game of go , calligraphy , and painting .  
Modern Taiwan 's rural hinterland could hardly be expected to provide ethical regeneration and social harmony as it used to in the past , because concentration of the population in cities is already an established trend . But rural culture 's essential spiritual values can provide the basis for cultural development .  
After current publisher Shaw Yu-ming assumed office , in 1987 Sinorama 's global vision was broadened and coverage of Chinese cultural traditions was strengthened . Series of reports on world sinology and sinologists , on famous universities , and other subjects appeared , and have already been collected and published in book form .  
As chief architect of the temple 's reconstruction , the late artist Li Mei-shu engaged Taiwan 's best temple builders and craftsmen in wood and stone carving in order to leave to posterity a fine cultural heritage of traditional architectural art . " Cheng Yu-ts'ai adds that many foreigners , particularly Japanese , make special journeys to see this " temple of oriental art . "  
In 1978 , the late President Chiang Ching-kuo , premier at the time , had local cultural development listed as one of the 12 major development projects . Cultural centers were built in towns with county or municipal government s across the province .  
The formation of culture is strongly influenced by geographical factors , " says Tsai Hsiang-hui , an associate professor of history at the Chinese Culture University who serves as a trustee to the cultural foundation in Peikang . " The significance of local cultural and educational foundations lies in bringing together people from the same area , sharing similar customs and backgrounds , to show their concern for local culture . If we are n't elementary school classmates , we may be distant cousins .  
Thinking about all this from the angle of historical geography , I think northerners are used to being ruled by nomadic tribes , and the physical environment makes northerners more open-minded ; southerners , on the other hand , are the stubborn guardians of Chinese cultural traditions , so to speak , they opened up the south when they fled there to escape foreign domination , so they have a strong " spirit of resistance . " Q : Of what benefit were your two years of fieldwork ?  
In his view , housing belongs to the infrastructure and can not easily be altered once built , whereas cultural and educational work can be developed and improved through mistakes , and is a long term project that can not be left undone .  
The economic takeoff is helpful for raising the quality of culture . But from another angle , some people believe that the roots of culture in Taiwan are weak . Sudden wealth at this time is by no means an unmixed blessing . This is especially true with the percolation of a " get rich quick " attitude into the arts , which will do even more to erode the roots of cultural development .  
Hsiao Yeh , who was once with CMPC and devoted much effort to the promotion of new cinema , is even more adamant : " This has nothing at all to do with new cinema , it 's a flash in the pan , " because the cultivation of film-makers alone is inadequate for raising standards throughout cinema , when " the whole cultural and educational environment has been static for so long , without any improvement .  
Having just celebrated the anniversary of commissioner Lin 's burning of British opium which triggered the Opium War , Chinese readers might be smiling quietly to themselves at the fact that neighboring Japan is not only supplying the British with cheap and attractive household goods , but is also spending a large amount of money on their cultural education . lt is difficult not to conclude , however , that the only way to avoid accusations of " charm and stealth " might be to send in gunboats selling heroin under the flag of free trade .  
These products of cultural fushion from 200 or 300 years ago are scattered all across Europe . Just open the map - - from Sicily in the south to Fagervik in the north , from St . Petersburg in the east to Lisbon in the west - - well-preserved specimens of chinoiserie can be found everywhere . This month 's photo essay presents some of the pictures of chinoiserie Sinorama has garnered from across the continent of Europe .  
Nevertheless , although it is impossible to fully articulate the original cultural environment , still , the ultimate meaning behind the culture on the psychological level can transcend time and space and be expressed on the stage .  
Lin Ming-te says emphatically , " We are always calling for a Chinese cultural renaissance , and saying that modern architecture should be imbued with a traditional aesthetic . It 's a shame that one essential element is conspicuously missing from the vast majority of large public structures exhibiting a classical Chinese flavor - - the traditional poetic couplet . Most homes also give little thought to the content of their New Year 's couplets . "  
Long ago , the busy striving for thoroughness in business and the hectic pace of life led Chen to turn to Confucian principles as an extremely human and practical set of cultural beliefs . He feels sorry that he can not get other modern people to accept them as well .  
Altogether , there are probably no more than ten similar local drama troupes . Participants mostly have a sense that cultural development between the cities and the rural areas is too imbalanced : In Taipei arts groups are concentrated together and there are abundant performing arts . But elsewhere , after the powerful assault of the mass media , now everyone is bolted in front of the TV watching the same old TV personalities and plots that have nothing to do with their daily lives . Where have those dramas that reflect local life gone to ? "  
Display local vitality , and the renewal of life : " Affairs are in the hands of men . " Ho Chien-wei learned from this set of performances that drama companies can compromise with and come together with local cultural centers : " The local administrative system is the greatest source of energy . If you just give them a chance , they can escape from the traditional recalcitrant attitude of ' having one more thing to do is not as good as having one less thing to do . ' '  
In " An Open Letter to Our Compatriots on Taiwan , " delivered in 1979 before the National People 's Congress by standing central committee member Ye Jianying , the Communists declared that they would cease shelling Kinmen , Matsu and other offshore islands and would set up navigation and postal links as soon as possible to facilitate direct contacts between the two sides and carry out acade mic and cultural exchange .  
We need to create a beneficial exchange , bringing in more information from abroad and putting out the story of our own cultural heritage , the sincerity of our efforts and our practical actions , to avoid a repeat of the rhino horn incident , with its hurt feelings , wasted energy and the risk that a traditional ingredient in Chinese medicine may disappear . (  
The maintenance of the basic rural village structure , plus leisure time and extra cash that people are willing to spend on cultural activities , is just like Taiwan shortly after retrocession , before any electronic or television media had become widespread , when local opera was definitely in its prime .  
This group of new directors , called the fifth generation , includes such figures as Chen Kai-ge and Tian Zhuang-zhuang . They share some things in common . Because of the cultural revolution , they all lost the chance to study . Among those 20 million intellectual youths dispersed to the remote regions to live with the peasants , they know about these places ' odd customs .  
Three years ago , when Mr . You invited me to act as convener of Ilan 's " Editorial Committee for Locally Oriented Language Teaching Materials , " I made my acceptance conditional on his placing local vernacular education work in the cultural and educational sphere , and resisting any attempt to put it on the political level where it could become a tool in the Democratic Progressive Party 's political battles with the Nationalist Party ( KMT ) .  
The dig report from that time pointed out that there were two cultural levels at the site . The pottery discovered in the upper layer had writing , and brass implements had also been unearthed , so that layer seems to be from the Chou dynasty . But the lower layer was entirely from a stone tool culture . The black and light yellow pottery that was found was innovative in shape and of very high quality in technique , meaning that it must have been " an important stage in high antiquity . "  
Compared to these sites , Chengziya is much larger , and many more large artifacts have been discovered . " In fact , it already transcends the traditional ' fortress ' type compound , which was mainly for defense , and is a ' city ' in the sense of a political , economic , and cultural center .  
For this reason the many arguments expounded in Novel China are mainly presented through analogy and dialogue between large numbers of works , and concentrate on probing the emergence , development and current state of several genre traditions within recent and modern Chinese fiction , including political , local-flavor , overseas student life , science fiction , erotic , feminine consciousness , and others , along with these genres ' aesthetic , social , and cultural implications .  
Generally speaking , only to research each other is not enough . Of course , the reasons involved are very complicated . Speaking from my own limited knowledge of Western and Eastern culture , if there were one ideal state of affairs in this world , it would be a result of incorporating Western and Eastern cultural consciousness , extracting the essential kernels of each and doing away with the chaff . Perhaps that should be the objective of all mankind .  
The symbolic meaning of " tribe " : If you mention the harvest or new year 's festivals of the nine tribes , most people will have a stereotyped impression of a night spent singing , dancing , and drinking but will know nothing of their background or of how these unique cultural phenomena were distilled over time from tribal experience .  
He is worried that with the limited economic power of the Ami residents of the Shankuang Estate , as more and more high-rise blocks are built and large numbers of Han Chinese move in , the Ami will gradually lose the advantage they have enjoyed of forming the vast majority of the local population ; furthermore , each unit on the estate measures only around 65 square meters , so that as second generation residents marry , lack of space will force them to move off the estate , creating a threat to cultural maintenance .  
In recent years , given the progressive social diversification and liberalization of Taiwan and its distinct island culture , Taiwan has become an ideal laboratory for testing various postmodern social theories and conducting cultural research . Deconstructionism , psychoanalysis , feminism , and Marxist theory are not in isolated company , making for a bustling cultural scene .  
Also , because it is cut off from the rest of Taiwan by mountains that run right down to the coast , the east developed relatively late . Many valuable cultural artifacts have thus been preserved up to the present , and there are many archaeological sites from former cultures that settled here .  
In the " Conference on Hakka Culture , " part of this year 's arts and cultural festival , a report written by a Hakka man in praise of Hakka women was suddenly criticized by Huang Yu-hsiu , an associate professor of foreign languages at National Taiwan University , as " having a male chauvinist pig viewpoint and objectifying women . " This brought a sudden quiet , but many younger Hakka women silently approved of the professor 's comments .  
While overseas he saw many Chinese people in a state of ignorance and superstition , with a low level of cultural cultivation . In his hometown he saw old private schools in a state of decay , and the new Western-style schools corrupt . Many children in the village already over the age of ten were still naked and played in the streets : " It almost returned to a prehistoric state of barbarity .  
Chen was Lai Ho 's companion in literature , and the two developed a close bond . They often interacted through poems and songs . The two of them joined together with a group of highly educated and politically aware writers to form the ' Ying Society . ' They composed poetry to express their concerns about current events and their sympathy with the lives of the masses , and they also used this to carry on the Chinese cultural tradition .  
The original content of the 24 Solar Terms was very simple , but over many years , they slowly developed into focal points for an extremely fertile cultural milieu . They are guides to farming life , reference dates for weather forecasting and holidays for all sorts of ceremonial activities . Almanacs , the weather , agriculture , the general life of the community - - all abide under the shadow of the Solar Terms !  
This in turn drew on the neoclassical style that appeared in Europe in the mid-18th century . That style emphasized " reason " and rationality , which designers of the period found embodied in the nearly pure geometric shapes of classical architecture . This trend , combined with the cultural exchange that came from colonial expansionism and the rise of archaeology as a field of study , produced new structures in Europe that incorporated a number of classical themes into a single building .  
Now , through the efforts of several dedicated teachers at Shuanglung primary school , Shuanglung village has set up a Bunun Cultural Development Association , and has launched a series of back-to-roots events , such as leading tribespeople on visits to the Bunun 's original home , organizing a traditional " eight-part singing " group and opening a cultural resources office .  
In the past , the SEF distinguished between negotiations at the levels of chairman , secretary-general , and vice-secretary-general , and the SEF official of a given level would only negotiate with a mainland counterpart at the same level . Now , in order to increase flexibility , there will not be hard and fast distinctions between the levels . Moreover , in the past there were only negotiations on limited issue areas . Now there will also be sub-units discussing economic and cultural affairs . "  
The public hearing gained the attention and sup port of the township council , the mayor and the citizens of Meinung . So in 1993 the Love Meinung Alliance was set up . It incorporated local leaders such as the mayor , neighborhood chiefs , social organizations and people from cultural circles , holding seminars in every neighborhood . They distributed hand-outs , and they decided to go north to Taipei to demonstrate in front of the Legislative Yuan , requesting the reservoir 's budget be eliminated .  
Ho Jin-tsair , the director of the Department of Social Education in the Ministry of Education , says that the relevant government agencies have been under intense pressure since the discovery of the sunken ship off Penghu . Public opinion is inclined to see such wrecks as cultural resources . Many critics say that the MoE is not doing its job because , though it is aware that " national treasures " fall clearly within its purview , it is not actively moving to " rescue " the artifacts .  
Entering into the museum as it celebrates its seventieth anniversary is like walking into a time tunnel of 7000 years . Through all these ancient eras , how many brave heroes , gifted gents and lovely ladies have come and gone ? Fortunately , we have a rich heritage of books , paintings and calligraphy , of objects that did not , like their owners , turn to ashes and dust . Instead they have become witnesses of the wisdom of the ancients , and a cultural inheritance .  
Q : In 1985 , when Peter Brook used an abandoned quarry at Avignon for a nine-hour performance by actors from various countries of the Hindu epic poem Mahabharata , many people hailed the production as a successful blend of numerous cultural elements . But others felt that Brook did not have a deep enough understanding of Hindu thought , so that the work was another example of oriental exoticism .  
" This is not just an issue about 200 people 's livelihoods , or who 's going to take over . It 's more about redefining Peking opera and readjusting the guidelines for national cultural development , " says National Institute of the Arts teacher Wen Chiu-chu , who just completed research on " Taiwanese Peking opera . " The three military opera troupes used to be cultural products forcibly cultivated by the government . They used up quite a lot of national resources , and under excessive protection they lost their ability to be innovative and different .  
As in the cultural , agricultural , and economic fields , cross-strait narcotics exchanges and mutual reliance among dealers have also grown significantly these past several years . Cross-strait anti-drug cooperation should be implemented with urgency , but it is stagnating amidst disputes over sovereignty and legal jurisdiction , and it has proven difficult to make any breakthroughs .  
One reason was because the discovery found its way into newspapers all over the world , and many people knew that now Puli had more than picturesque natural beauty and such special local products as rice noodles and shaoxing wine . The citizens of Puli also possessed a glorious treasure - - cultural property left behind by people of an age long passed .  
Furthermore , too many units are in charge of historical landmarks and cultural artifacts , so that no one knows whom to follow . For example , historical landmarks are administered by the Ministry of the Interior , but antique objects inside protected historical buildings are administered by the Ministry of Education . The central , provincial , county and municipal governments all have " cultural personnel " with the same general function . The resulting mish-mash of authority and responsibility means that in the end the affair falls into the pattern of no one managing at all .  
Their settlement was very large , and the burial patterns ( e.g . the direction in which the coffins are set ) are regular and orderly . During the test dig , traces were found of holes for pillars for house frames . In some places the cultural level is flat and even , without artifacts . " The dirt has been tramped down firmly and evenly , as if a large number of people walked over it , " says Liu , suspecting that such places may have been areas of collective activities for Tamalin Man .  
Should other historical reconstructions , for example those about Taiwanese soldiers or the February 28 incident , be seen in a similar light ? Another easily overlooked pitfall of oral history is that the viewpoint of the interviewer or editor will be imposed on the interviewee , or cultural or humanistic viewpoints will be superimposed and unwittingly enter the thinking of the respondent . These external ideas and interpretations may shape the memories of the interviewee , so that he or she ends up spouting someone else 's point of view without even realizing it .  
On the surface , this is a simple case of who controls the rights to a piece of music . But because those involved are members of a small group of indigenous people , given the surge in ethnic self-identification in Taiwan in recent years , the incident has naturally been interpreted as one in which " certain foreigners and Han Chinese have stolen and exploited the cultural and intellectual property of indigenous people . "  
The songs of the Ami can be traced back to their fishing , farming , and hunting activities in the mountains and along the coast . In their tightly organized villages , through the annual harvest festival , each successive generation was trained and educated in cultural traditions , which is the main reason these songs have been carried forward .  
Just as European countries have in recent years strongly promoted " green industries " in the environmental and cultural fields , not only improving the quality of life but creating tens of thousands of jobs as well , there are many things in Taiwan worth investing in , and sufficient profits to be had . Enterprises need not think that their only choice is to head abroad .  
I feel like a late 20th century George Catlin , who traveled the American West painting portraits of native Americans . Armed with a camera rather than a paintbrush , I have the chance to capture Yunnan 's minorities in all their happy glory , while they still feel content within their ancient cultural perimeters . What began as a documentary exercise evolved into something more personal .  
There are also detailed descriptions of the SEF 's legal , trade and cultural services . The Mainland Affairs section presents the current state of cross-strait exchanges , and regulations governing cross-strait news reporting , publishing and electronic media work . All this information should provide a valuable reference resource for Taiwanese firms investing in the mainland , and for people both inside and outside the ROC who are engaged in cross-strait business or other affairs .  
At the end of September , work formally began on an investment by Acer Computer to build a multi - functional intelligent park in Taoyuan . Total investment is expected to be NT $ 200 billion . When completed , the park will have factories , residences , cultural and educational facilities , and more . It amounts to a privately funded version of the HSBIP , writing a new page for the " Invest in Taiwan " program .  
It is an historical asset that is part of the collective memories of the people who live in Taiwan , and also provides living instruction about the history of railroads here , and could also be a concrete way for the government to show their concern for Taiwan 's native culture . " It has more meaning from the perspective of cultural preservation and education . "  
As for the railway museum , five years ago the TRA set up a museum planning team to find suitable locations , " but all of the NT $ 5 million which we had budgeted was cut by the provincial assembly . They thought it was more appropriate for museums to be planned by cultural and educational departments , " says Chen Te-pei , spreading his hands in a gesture of frustration .  
In October last year it was reported that Taichung Station was to be moved underground , and that the old station building , which dates from the Japanese occupation era , might be demolished . The RCS joined with several other cultural and historical associations to put on a campaign to plead for the life of the 80-year-old station , including an event in which groups rode trains from both north and south to meet in Taichung . Finally they managed to get the station building designated a Grade 2 national monument by the Ministry of the Interior .  
According to the field interviews of cultural writer Ma Teng-yueh , who has traveled extensively writing down the experiences of tattooed tribal elders , the Saisiyat live quite close to the Atayal , and the reason they started tattooing their faces is " the inevitable result of protecting themselves against a stronger enemy . " Therefore , in actuality , among all the indigenous peoples , only Atayal have the inherent custom of facial tattooing . That is why the Qing Dynasty documents usually referred to Atayal as " qingmian fan " ( " tattoo-faced barbarians " ) .  
But at a time when local cultural consciousness is flourishing , and with the associated preference for local plant and animal species , the sudden epidemic of disease among lowland pine trees has been greeted with no great concern by many in forestry and botanical circles . This is because the pine trees in Taiwan 's plains are all introduced species brought by immigrant settlers and colonists , who planted them out of nostalgia for their old homes .  
Moreover , " acquaintance rape " is generally less violent than rape by a stranger . Therefore , under a maledominated legal system , and given the cultural script which calls for men to take the sexual initiative , the rate of conviction is very low . Indeed , victims often have no recourse at all . Worst of all , violation by a known person often leaves much deeper psychological and emotional scars on the victim than violence by a stranger .  
In this sort of cultural tradition , even if many contemporary women and their husbands enjoy a substantial level of educational achievement and income , when these women return to their motherinlaw 's house , they still come down a notch , afraid of offending at every turn , making their inlaws unhappy and causing trouble for their husbands .  
Over the years the HUF has prepared guided introductions to six trails , with the most popular being the Chihshan Rock Trail in Shihlin , which combines natural scenery with Class Two historic cultural artifacts . And since Mayor Chen Shui-bian declared that this trail would be made part of the city 's high school entrance exams , many dedicated parents have come here to collect informa - tion for their kids .  
For instance , the limitless rebirth of life forms exists within cultural change and natural cycles of waxing and waning and rising and falling . And I have connected the symbols and visual vocabulary employed in each of these twelve works to the twelve signs of the zodiac , which represent the rhythmic relationship between Heaven and Earth .  
Kun Opera , which derives its name from the Kunshan area of Jiangsu Province , where it first came into popularity , has one style of tune . As early as the late Yuan and early Ming dynasties , it was recognized as one form of southern song . This period was one of intense political , economic and cultural development in the south .  
Another judge , Huang Hai-ming , adds that the five artists selected reveal three cultural phenomena : the prospering global economy and information explosion that brought with them the crises of spiritual fragmentation and loss of self-identity ( Wang Jun-jieh ) , political and social criticism that followed the lifting of martial law ( Wu Tien-chang and Yao Jui-chung ) , and finally " a return to the feelings of the heart and the oriental tradition " ( Lee Ming-tse and Chen Chien-pei ) .  
Although I am still the only Taiwanese person in the city today , and I have to repeat the same explanations about Chinese culture over and over again , I have learned a lot from these people about their culture and customs , and observed the lives of different levels of society . But more important is the true " cultural friendship " which has been the major factor supporting and encouraging me during my study abroad .  
In the 1980s , among all the social movements , the environmental protection movement found the most resonance around the world . This , coupled with the rise of the aboriginal rights movement , caused environmentalists , in the wake of modern man 's overdevelopment of land , to begin to reexamine methods of living and urge a return to natural , simple lifestyles . As a result , the complete set of cultural ceremonies and behavior that aborigines have as a result of hunting have once again been embraced .  
Many scholars are happy to see that traditional Rukai tribal hunting is being allowed under resource-management controls in order to achieve sustainable economic use of natural resources . " Only when tribal people are economically independent can they rediscover their cultural identity , " they argue . " It 's a good way for them to regain their self-respect . "  
Aiming to reach a new segment of society , HEPP has held its promotional activities in places crowded with the fashionable and cultured elite of Taipei-such as department stores , the Eslite bookstore group ( a key cultural barometer for Taipei ) , and Crown Art Center .  
This exchange is the first time since the break-off of negotiations that dialogue has been conducted between the two sides . The letter sent from Taiwan on March 5th received a quick and clear response on March 11th with ARATS reiterating that they were willing to invite representatives from the SEF of " a suitable level " to lead economic , cultural or academic missions to the PRC , either to visit or participate in seminars . The opportunity to restart cross-straits negotiations can be traced back to earlier this year .  
" The purpose of technology is to serve human cultural development , and the world has already reached a stage in which intangible assets are the most valued and the most valuable , " said Acer Group chairman and CEO Stan Shih at a press conference , adding that the main reason why software is so expensive in Taiwan is because of the small size of the local market .  
In that time of controversy , " Tsai Yuan-pei could be said to have been the least controversial personality , " says Ambrose King in the book Daxue de Linian ( The Idea of the University ) . In his hands , Beida became a real university , a center for new culture and modern thinking in China . But Tsai did not belong only to Beida ; he also belonged to a larger academic and cultural community .  
" He has melded cultural affirmation and ethnic self-respect with literary practice to create a purely Chinese literary form , " says Ng Kim Chew . " This provides solace to his personal sensibilities , both literary and ethnic . " There are few who can compare to ECM writers living in Taiwan in terms of how hard they work , either . Li Yung-ping was once an assistant professor in the department of foreign languages and literatures at National Sun Yat-sen University .  
The year before last the show " Splendors of Imperial China " was well received by the American academic and cultural communities , and afterwards many nations extended invitations to the National Palace Museum . The French government worked especially hard to meet the Musuem 's needs , even passing a new law designating measures to protect foreign art works on exhibition there . Now , 63 years after part of the National Palace Museum collection first went to Europe for a show in London in 1935 , works from the museum are going to Paris .  
Nonetheless , says Li Lan , chairperson of the Sino-American Folk Arts Association , located in the United States , in Lee 's paintings there lurks a glorious and mysterious cultural China , marching slowly from the traditional to the modern , just like those personalities that have come to life through her brushes-very elegant and languorous .  
These private art museums or memorial museums on the one hand afford centralized management and exhibition of these senior artists ' works , and privately held works of art might be donated to foundations as public cultural assets open to the public . In another sense , they bring greater diversity to art appreciation , spreading and expanding viewing opportunities beyond the select few major public art museums .  
Shih Ying does not deny that there were already a number of community organizations active in Wenshan District , and that it already had quite a strong cultural and educational ethos . Thus siting the first community college there " in fact was a soft option-but that does n't mean we are n't aware of the difficulties to be faced later . " He says that in the future it is hoped that community colleges will spread to communities throughout Taiwan , but this will depend on each community 's degree of readiness and preparedness .  
The Taiwan Garrison Command was established in 1958 , assuming complete control over martial law , police functions , entry to and exit from Taiwan , media and cultural censorship , postal spying , and military trials ( which could also be used in civilian cases ) .  
After the ROC government lifted the ban on cultural contacts with mainland China , practitioners of traditional Chinese theater enthusiastically took advantage of the opportunity to visit the land where their art was born . Those with antiquarian interests , too , were very excited about the loosening of restrictions , for even though many of China 's greatest archeological treasures are already to be found right here in Taiwan , extremely important new archeological discoveries had been made in mainland China during the previous two decades .  
From Arabic literature 's Aladdin to the native American tale of Pocahontas , from The Hunchback of Notre Dame , steeped in Gallic ambience , to Hercules , rooted in Greek and Roman mythology , Disney has long sought out material with a world-wide appeal . Seeking a feeling of intimacy and a clear delineation between good and evil , their animated features employ fables and animals to dissolve the cultural barriers that lie hidden under their auras of exoticism .  
Reasons for Taiwanese forgetfulness of May Fourth are that modern Taiwan does not face the general national malaise which once afflicted China , Messrs . Democracy and Science have already been realized to some degree , cultural life is highly westernized , and the nativist movement of recent years has tended to increase estrangement from the mainland . " In Taiwan there is little interest in pursuing fundamental issues of China 's recent and modern development , " says Wu Chan-liang .  
According to Hsinchu mayor Tsai Jen-chien , " There is little free space within the city limits , so we can only carry out rationalization and renewal on present scale . But the city enjoys many other assets due to its long history and culture . " From the Qing dynasty through to the Japanese colonial period , Hsinchu was one of northern Taiwan 's key political and economic centers , and this has left the city with a rich legacy of cultural assets .  
While a 5,000-year-old cultural legacy was being smashed to smithereens on the mainland , the ROC 's commitment to " revive classical Chinese culture and carry on traditional ways " represented a difficult burden for the small island of Taiwan to bear by itself . President Chiang Kai-shek would serve as head of the " Council for Chinese Cultural Renaissance . " Peking opera and classical Chinese painting were deliberately promoted and local Taiwanese culture suppressed .  
Wang Tsu-hua 's wife is from Puli , which is why he moved there in 1985 and opened a restaurant . Because he had a great liking for the place 's artistic and cultural style and for its people , and also makes ceramic art , he later got actively involved in the local artistic and cultural scene . He even helped set up a " New Puli Development Committee " to promote entrepreneurial culture there .  
Over 70% of Tungshih 's population is of Hakka ancestry , and both civic organizations and ordinary people have preserved large numbers of Hakka artifacts and much historical material . After the earthquake , the Taichung County Hakka Cultural Association realized that these valuable cultural and historical assets might be destroyed by the bulldozers as damaged houses were demolished . They urged the Tungshih Township authorities to slow down the demolition work , to give them a few days ' time to save what they could .  
Banu Gabamumu , president of their cultural development association , spent many days inspecting the damage in the Shao ancestral lands around Sun Moon Lake . On seeing how the earthquake had almost split Kuanghua Island into pieces , he said : " This place , which we call Lalu , used to be the home of our highest ancestral spirit . But later it was occupied by the Han Chinese spirit the Old Man Under the Moon . Perhaps now our ancestor has grown angry , and wants to take back the land He lost . "  
The Taipei Fine Arts Museum offered visitors a peek outside the mainstream in October , exhibiting a collection of works by contemporary artists from five Central American nations . Apart from the exotic nature of the exhibit , the deep insights that the artists have incorporated into these works offer a portrait of the political , economic , cultural , and social realities of Central America today .  
And what really moved him was not the magnificent , precipitous Huatung Valley , the endlessly rising peaks of Taroko Gorge , the serpentine curves of the Central and Southern Cross-Island Highways , or the year-round tropical greenery of Kenting-it was the rich cultural voice of Taiwan 's people .  
Says Mei : " This is where the Jesuits established the first Western-type university in the Far East , while Chinese scholars such as Hong Xiuquan , Lin Zexu , Liang Qichao , Kang Youwei and Cheng Guanying spent time here absorbing Western learning . " Macau emerged unscathed from WWII , and many of its original Portuguese-language documents have been preserved intact , providing an invaluable resource for research into cultural and religious exchanges between East and West .  
To say that mainland Chinese look to Taiwan popular culture as an oracle would certainly be blowing our horn a little too loud . But it is no exaggeration to say , as one mainland China cultural maven put it , " Television , film , and pop music are the main channels through which most ordinary people in mainland China have learned about external cultures since the Cultural Revolution . "  
Besides her natural vocal quality , the key to A-Mei 's success has been that her songs reflect feelings and aspirations of her era . In fact , when you look back at the history of popular cultural interchange between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait , all the most successful singers and hit songs have been connected in some way to the hopes and feelings of the times .  
1,000 years ago , under the rule of scholars who valued culture over military prowess , Song-dynasty China saw rapid economic development and brought forth remarkable cultural and artistic achievements .  
As the first Taiwanese president , Lee Teng-hui 's success did a lot to assuage the anger of the Taiwanese people about the discrimination they had experienced . This won him a lot of support . On top of that , once in power he implemented a policy of shifting the island 's cultural center of gravity away from mainland China and more toward Taiwan itself , and he criticized the KMT as being " a regime of outsiders . " These positions won him 54% of the vote in the first direct presidential election .  
New Premier Tang Fei is well aware that the public has high expectations and will brook no delay . He chaired his first cabinet meeting on his fourth day in office , and issued a list of six focal points : improving cross-strait relations , eradicating " black gold " ( the influence of criminals and moneyed interests in politics ) , hastening earthquake reconstruction , creating a new economic miracle , deepening education reform and cultural development , and " reinventing " government .  
In terms of ideology , the stress on the ideal of a unified Greater China and institutionalized anti-communism threw a pall over local culture , and a Taiwan-oriented consciousness had not yet openly emerged . The political environment and the distribution of cultural resources were less than fair , and due to the influence of a world-view centered on the Chinese mainland , progress on urban rapid transit systems and many other important basic infrastructure projects was slow .  
Relations with the mainland at the highest political level have reached impasse after impasse , and dark war clouds gather over the Taiwan Strait ; yet at the grassroots level , what with trade links , fishing links and intermarriage , the people are inseparably intermingled , and the same is true on the academic , cultural and religious fronts and even in the entertainment and travel industries .  
On the subject of cross-strait relations , Chen stressed that the people of Taiwan and mainland China share a common ancestral , cultural , and historical background , and he stated his belief that the leaders on both sides have the wisdom and creativity to jointly deal with the question of a future " one China . "  
In addition to being an important cultural center in ancient India , the Gandhara region of northwest India ( straddling the modern-day border between Pakistan and Afghanistan ) , had also been a part of the Greek empire for a time , and was deeply influenced by Hellenic culture . In Buddhist sculpture from Gandhara , the figures have the deeply set eyes , aquiline noses , and curly hair so typical of Greek statues .  
" Although the ban against building new houses resulted in the preservation of many traditional homes , back when soldiers were billeted in every home they covered the walls with patriotic slogans , seriously defacing the property . Moreover , " says Yang Shu-ching , " cultural studies were seen as unimportant , so there was no one to carry such things out . By the time martial law was lifted , many aspects of Kinmen culture had changed and could no longer easily be studied . "  
Li Hsi-chi got his initial inspiration from the inscribed wooden plaques that grace the door lintels of clan temples in Kinmen . He executed an entire series of paintings based on them before moving on to throw occasional poetry events modeled after the elegant parties indulged in by the upper classes in centuries past . Li also called on artists and writers from both Taiwan and the mainland to tour Kinmen and understand the beauty of the local culture . These activities spurred the local community to a heightened interest in cultural preservation .  
This cultural illness is particularly serious in United States . American girls begin to be extremely concerned about their appearance from high school on , and many people are constantly depressed about their weight . Though the situation is not so serious in Taiwan , the mass media puts out a virtually unvarying message that beauty equals success . It is difficult for young people to resist the message implied in teenage beauty pageants , love-at-first-sight stories pairing up beautiful girls and handsome guys , and the images of pop superstars .  
dubbed by some " the Lone Ranger of the art world , " and by others as " the Confucian Swashbuckler , " noted watercolorist Chen Yang-chun has been practicing his art for nearly 30 years now . Some of his favorite subjects have been bucolic country scenes from around Taiwan , small towns , and women of the reserved yet romantic beauty that East Asia is famous for . Chen 's works are widely collected around the world , which has earned him the unofficial title of " cultural ambassador . "  
This visit , which has been called " soft diplomacy , " breaks the previous mold of focusing on political and economic power . Instead , the vice president 's delegation included members of the cultural , religious , and scientific communities , and elected officials as well .  
The latter was the northernmost of these three counties , and extended all the way to Taipei and Keelung , but settlers long declined to venture north of Touliu ( today the county seat of Yunlin ) . Further south in Tainan , the Dutch arrived in the 1620s and established a fortress called Zeelandia . Later in that century , the Ming loyalist Koxinga 's able minister Chen Yonghua adopted a policy of keeping Taiwan equally strong in both the cultural and military spheres . A period of cultural flowering ensued in the south .  
This naturally makes local governments very reliant upon , and vulnerable to control by , the central government . Although the actual amount of the tax redistribution is limited , local governments have to shoulder most of the burden of maintaining infrastructure , social services , education , cultural activities , and more . Local finances are very strained as a result .  
In the early 1980s his book A Preliminary Discussion of the Art of Modern Fiction made him a celebrity in Beijing cultural circles , and was known as one of the " four beautiful kites launched into China 's broad , lonely skies . " But because the ideas in the book went against the officially promoted doctrine of social realism , and tended towards Western modernism , Gao 's work was suppressed by the communist authorities and he went into exile overseas .  
This independent film festival , which aimed to present the Amis ' own world view , brought together 14 films by four Amis directors and one Japanese director . The organizers attempted to cast off impressions of the aboriginal peoples based on a mishmash of cultural cliches , and also hoped that the festival and its accompanying seminars , concert and gourmet buffet would help city people understand the true " Pangcah . " " Pangcah " is the Amis word for " human being , " and also the term by which the Amis refer to themselves .  
He said that because Amis culture was always transmitted orally , there is no written record of traditional culture . Thus every time he goes to a tribal village to film , it is a race against time . He is very fearful of failing to record tribal elders before they die , thereby losing a precious part of the tribal cultural heritage .  
Of course we are well aware that statesmanship ca n't be learned just from a short series of classes , but we hope that by laying on these courses from our standpoint as a cultural and educational foundation , and not from a party political standpoint , we can make a start by using culture and education to purify people 's hearts . Because in fact a real political leader needs to speak from the heart and express his true hopes .  
The growing number of leadership training activities sponsored by Taiwan NGOs mix personal development with professional skills enhancement , religious training , volunteerism and political reform . These programs can help charismatic leaders who are both politically involved and morally upstanding to become greater forces for good . Amid growing cultural diversity , only a new kind of leader with broader , more holistic values will be able to create frameworks suitable to the new era .  
Though Lang witnessed war and brutality in one of China 's most turbulent and tragic eras , these experiences never effaced the love that the traditional Chinese literati always held for the beautiful landscape . Thus , with a product of Western technology in hand , he embarked on an effort-conditioned by his own cultural learning and by the model of the Chinese landscape painting-to create composite images of different landscapes separated by space and time .  
Over 2,000 years ago the Han Dynasty envoy Zhang Qian ( d . 114 BC ) traveled into the western regions , writing a great page in the history of global cultural interchange . Many important agricultural crops such as grapes , alfalfa and walnuts are reputed to have entered China at that time . 21 centuries later , in our age of highly developed international transport and commerce , the farming , forestry and fisheries industries play the role of modern Zhang Qians , importing countless weird and wonderful fruits , vegetables , birds and beasts .  
Niu Gur began drawing " Uncle Niu the Guerilla Fighter " in 1951 . Finding humor amidst the tragic longing for home of the many mainlanders who fled to Taiwan in 1949 and could not go back , the strip struck a deep chord with the public , and sparked a tremendous response . Subscriptions to the Central Daily News shot upward from a few thousand per month to tens of thousands , and Uncle Niu became a major figure in cultural circles .  
Beijing 's grand scale is truly dumbfounding . The speed of its coming economic growth poses challenges to its water and power supplies , air quality , and natural environment , as well as the well-being of its ancient buildings and cultural artifacts , which date back thousands of years .  
Government policies , the special features of multinational capital , and the political , economic , social , and cultural features of the host country are all important factors in the development of transnational economic cooperation . "  
This cultural symbol of " steady devotion " symbolizes the determination of Kukeng Rural Township to leave behind its image as a disaster-stricken area and to welcome the future with open arms . This determination , in turn , recalls the way this unpromising area-surrounded by water on three sides , with powerful dust storms during the seasonal winds in winter and heavily saline soil-has still managed to produce agricultural products like paddy rice , sugar cane , peanuts , corn , squash , and melon seeds .  
" Huashan lies at the juncture of the Philippine tectonic plate and the Eurasian plate . After serious earthquakes , the crust is loosened and altered , and the topography shows very obvious changes , " says Chiu Tsun-lung , director of the " Lake Bottom Culture Association , " and now a member of the 921 community reconstruction committee . He says that Huashan also has a rich cultural atmosphere . The historic artifacts left behind by pioneers combined with the natural environment provide valuable resources for " mountain education " in Taiwan .  
It may be that cultural activities encourage local productive economic activities to set deeper roots , and have a larger impact on the public . Or it may be a bottom-to-top effect , in which ordinary people raise their cultural refinement , and invest products with a richer image of local culture . Either way , Kukeng Rural Township in Yunlin County is devising a construction strategy that promises a win-win-win outcome for business , culture , and the environment .  
When the participants boarded the ferry and completed the short hop to Xiamen , it constituted the first cultural exchange between Kinmen and the PRC under the newly established " three mini-links . " It was very gratifying to see the artistic occasion carried off without the slightest hint of political overtones .  
Commenting on this phenomenon , mainland Chinese cultural critic Xie Xizhang notes that the residential patterns of old Bei-jing were disrupted by the Cultural Revolution . High-ranking government officials used to live primarily on the east side , and the area had a very cultured air . Rich merchants congregated on the west side , while the south side was the plebian part of town .  
WTO membership will be a blow to many agricultural counties , but in recent years tourist farms have sprouted up . These new operations offer rural residents a new way to make a living by offering visitors a taste of specialty products and unique local cultural attractions . Many novel ideas , like liquor-producing towns , and farming villages specializing in vanilla and other local crops , have appeared .  
With regard to copyrighted imports such as newspapers , magazines , recordings and books , Chao explains that everything that has research value ( whether the copyright is held by an individual or an organization ) can be imported . Books and recordings of a cultural nature can likewise be published in Taiwan , so long as applications are filled and sensitive passages amended . But news-oriented newspapers and magazines from the mainland can not be published or sold here .  
The value of cultural assets lies not in monetary worth , and still less in prices paid , but in the accumulation and passing down to future generations of the fruits of human intellectual and spiritual wisdom .  
In 1972 , UNESCO , considering the damage that war , natural disasters , and industrial development have been doing to precious cultural and natural assets , adopted the " Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage . " This set out rigorous and comprehensive conditions for determining what places are qualified to be deemed World Heritage sites ; it also encouraged signatories to apply to have the assets within their territories that are " of outstanding universal value " included on the World Heritage list .  
Chen Yuh-jean says there is no need for frustration . World Heritage guidelines place special importance on the agreement and cooperation of local residents . " So long as people are enlightened about the real value of the old Mountain Line , " he says , speaking of one of the sites less likely to make the final cut , " and preserve its historical and cultural value and develop only economic activities that are compatible with those values , then ten years from now it may find itself at the top of the list . "  
Individuals all have their own particular cultural background and value system . For that reason , the idea that prospective mates should come from similar economic and social backgrounds is not medieval . Most books on marriage include detailed " compatibility " checklists covering everything from ethnicity to where the two people live , their economic standing and level of education , how they interact with their own families , their respective personalities , interests and health , and what they hope for out of life .  
Based on this premise , any approach which promises to further the substantive objective of Taiwan 's " standing up tall and striding out into the world " - be it holiday diplomacy , economic and trade diplomacy , cultural diplomacy , transit diplomacy , political party-to-party diplomacy or whatever the case and terminology may be-is worth a try .  
Taumi is located about five kilometers southwest of Puli Township , at the entrance to Sun Moon Lake . It borders University Pond , a 400-hectare body of water where lilies grow in abundance . National Chi Nan University is located here , and the town has the appealing nickname of " doctorate village " among folks in Nantou County . In sum , it enjoys an outstanding geographic position and excellent human and cultural resources .  
" Although salaries were very low , the work had a clear objective and someone was looking out for us in our lives . It was like growing up in a warm family , and none of the men who worked together in Lintienshan will ever forget it , " says Chuang Ming-yi , a true second-generation Lintienshaner who was born here , grew up here , currently works in the forestry work station , and is also in charge of the Lintienshan cultural and historical workshop .  
Not long after the founding of the cultural and historical workshop , Chuang Ming-yi 's own mother fell ill with cancer . During the two years of running back and forth between the mountain town and hospitals , Chuang developed a deep understanding of life and death .  
This month 's cover story , " The New Star of the Post-Information Age-Digital Content , " analyzes the digital content industry , which is expected to be one of the next wave of key industries in Taiwan . It is an industry which requires unlimited creativity and rich content to come out on top . We also look at what steps the government is taking to utilize local cultural assets to create business opportunities , to make a knowledge-based contribution to the digital-era Chinese language market .  
In an effort to reduce the gap between rural and urban areas , and to respond concretely to cultural demand in counties and small cities , the Government Information Office ( GIO ) broke with a 26-year tradition and this year moved the Golden Tripod Awards ceremony out of Taipei City for the first time . It was held in Ilan County , where it was able to tap into local cultural characteristics and displayed a definite Lanyang Plain flavor .  
At present , he is living with his son , and though he is as poor as before , at least the cultural foundation that his friends at home and abroad cooperatively established provides him with a monthly stipend of NT $ 50,000 for his living expenses . He still makes it back to Taiwan on occasion , residing in the quiet flat he rents in Tamsui .  
The eastern half is mountains and hills , the western half flat land . The mountain area is mostly planted with fruit trees and dry-field crops , while the plains-an appealing stretch of glossy green stretching as far as the eye can see-are rice paddies . When you also consider its former cultural sites , it is no surprise that Wufeng was always one of the main tourist attractions in central Taiwan .  
The Cultural Bureau of Taichung County last year organized the teachers ' pilgrimage group so as to disseminate understanding of the religious meaning of the pilgrimage and its transforming spiritual power . This year it added groups of volunteers who explained the cultural and historical significance of the festival and recounted their personal experiences with the majesty and power of the tradition .  
My point is that the word " modern " is used in opposition to the classical period in the West . It has arisen as a natural continuation of the trajectory of Western culture . Because Western cultured is the world 's dominant culture , many non-Western cultures have adopted Western concepts regarding modernity while forgetting that our own cultural milieus are not completely the same as that of the West . Modern artists often treat Western ideas as if they were universal in their application , which is very dangerous .  
The bill also stipulates that residents of autonomous areas will enjoy equal rights in participating in political , economic , social , educational and cultural affairs , and are entitled to equal treatment .  
The graves show that the Shihsanhang people buried their dead lying on their side , knees bent . The body was usually positioned with the head to the southwest , perhaps for cultural or religious reasons . Pottery , pearl ornaments , and gold objects accompanied the body in the grave .  
The Nationalist government 's Taiwan policy at that time was to reverse the Japanization of the island , and shortly after the end of the war it banned the use of Japanese . Authors who wrote in Japanese lost their medium , and the Taiwanese people , most of whom were as yet unfamiliar with Mandarin , became effectively illiterate . In short , the policy wrought cultural havoc on Taiwanese society .  
Most people feel that they have to dress up to enjoy art in traditional municipal galleries , and they have to make a special trip to get to them . But railroad art centers are bustling with life and allow people to experience cultural and artistic events in a natural and unplanned way . Art has been confined to museums and temples for too long : let it hop on a train and be carried from station to station around Taiwan !  
Anyone who has traveled to Kyoto is sure to remember the streets and alleyways lined with elegant and well-maintained traditional Japanese-style residences in which people still live . Strolling those streets one feels the spirit of Japanese literature . These spaces are perhaps unsuitable to financial calculations of their worth . But their value in terms of cultural history is something that even greater economic power could not buy .  
The 2003 Asia-Pacific Arts Forum marked another step in cooperation between the Council for Cultural Affairs ( CCA ) and NTUA , following on the 2000 Asia-Pacific Traditional Arts Forum . The Arts Forum , specially coordinated with the CCA 's 2003 " Creative Culture Industry Year , " devoted special attention to culture not only as an end in itself but also as an economic activity . It aimed to encourage discussion about the common problems facing the development of indigenous cultures and cultural industries in the Asia-Pacific region .  
In the eyes of the Japanese colonial authorities , Chiang was Public Enemy No . 1 . Among Taiwanese intellectuals , he was widely recognized as a pioneer . And among ordinary citizens he was revered as a charismatic leader , a guiding force for cultural renaissance and a dedicated opponent of the injustices of the colonial regime .  
However , " although Chiang Wei-shui and others were found guilty in the Social Order and Police Incident , " writes Huang Huang-hsiung in his Chiang biography , " they indirectly benefited from this , because it became a focal point for the political and social movement . " The overreaction and repression by the colonial authorities against these activists-whose petition campaign was moderate and perfectly legal , and whose cultural association restricted itself to educational activities-not only fueled popular resentment , but also hardened the attitudes of activists toward the regime .  
The causes of suicide are complex , have physiological , psychological , social , and cultural implications , and are the result of multiple internal and external factors .  
Rising almost 4000 meters above sea level , Yushan is not only the tallest peak on Taiwan , it is also the source of the three major river systems that provide water for the island , has the most intact ecological system , verdant forests , varied flowers and fauna plus the nearby historical relics of Patungkuan and the rich cultural history of the Aborigines . " It is natural that this area is a topographical symbol of Taiwanese identity , just like Mt . Fuji in Japan or the Alps in Switzerland , " says Professor Tai .  
" Sadly , the average person does n't know very much about this , " laments Nelson Yang . Because in the past mountain climbers or naturalists neglected the history of the opening and development of Taiwan 's mountain areas , people have focused only on the flatlands and shoreline that make up just one fourth of the total land area of the island . They have little knowledge of the length and breadth of the mountains and are unable properly to understand the development of Taiwan 's ethnic and cultural diversity .  
But neglected all along was the Aborigines ' viewpoint and what they had to say , " points out Sun Ta-chuan . He gives an example : developing the water resources of the mountain regions was for the benefit of those downstream , while the Aborigines living upstream were frequently without potable water . When the mountain regions were included in national parks , the Aborigines were forced to leave the area , losing their original living space and sacred territory , and they were cut off from their traditional cultural roots .  
Korea has seized the magic wand of the new economy-the cultural and creative industries-transforming its national image from that of the world 's most diligent and unbending people to that of the liveliest , most innovative and most adept at packaging cultural products .  
In keeping with this view , many scholars have seen the culture industry as a system by which a small number of cultural middlemen who know how to manipulate public tastes feed consumers with a standardized , mass-produced " canned culture " that is artificial and bogus , neither the product of cultural workers ' autonomous creativity , nor capable of representing consumers ' inner yearnings .  
Jan Hung-tze , an expert on trends , writes that Taiwan ought to be better suited than Korea at matching and combining these industries suitable for cultural creativity with the information technology industry ( where Taiwan is already strong ) , creating electronic publishing , the broadcasting and marketing of digital music , and video games .  
Liu Wei-kung , associate professor of sociology at Soochow University , says that rather than debate incessantly about the definition and scope of cultural and creative industries , it would be better to grasp the salient characteristic at their core , which is that content on its own is not enough . It 's extremely important that the product or service creates an appealing story that will pull people in , so as to give people a joyful experience in the process of consumption .  
Wu Se-hwa states that capital for cultural creative industries includes the following : copyrighted music , literature , fine arts and animation ; locations that can serve as the background for creativity , such as historic sites and natural scenery ; creative talent ; and language or customs that reveal the special flavor of an area .  
Chen Chi-nan , a minister without portfolio who is a leading figure in the push for cultural and creative industries , says that from inside to outside there are three key layers to cultural production : at the core are the arts ( the fine arts , theater , music , literature and so forth ) ; the second circle includes advertising design , architecture , the media and so forth ; and the outer circle represents extended services and tourism-this is the most easily commercialized portion .  
What 's more , various kinds of economic assistance , loans and insurance require real estate to be put up as collateral , but for creative and cultural industries , for which creativity and talented personnel represent their true capital , these requirements are entirely inappropriate .  
The " content " of these cultural products has been rich and varied but Taiwan , with its many downstream industries , has been short of something very important in the development of its culture industry-intermediaries who will make the connection to an artistic source , then apply technology so that art is transformed into a commodity of a different kind , and intangible culture can become a tangible industry .  
Wu says that the causes of low creativity and the cultural context are being fixed , but no systematic changes have been made as yet . One encouraging point is that the MOE has included creativity as a core educational ability . Industry , government , and the educational sector , however , have yet to come together . If all of them can move forward together and embrace one another , the circle will get larger and larger .  
We live in an era of aesthetic sensibil-ity . The cultural economy and creative industries hold sway , and aesthetic sensibility has become a key determinant in individual , business , and national achievement .  
Based on these two criteria , the CEPD has compiled a list of 12 critical service industries for future development . These are : financial services ; research and development ; design ; cultural and creative services ; telecommunications and media ; medical , health care and caregiving ; engineering consulting ; information services ; distribution and transportation ; manpower training , manpower services and property management ; tourism , sporting and recreational services ; and environmental protection .  
In an era of strong environmental consciousness , when reports of disasters are frequent , naturally a land-use policy that gives the environment central importance is going to get a generally positive response . But because the government actually promoted mountain agriculture for half a century , now hundreds of thousands of farmers and workers in related industries depend on it for their livelihood , and there is also the question of the cultural and historic needs of Aborigines who call the mountain forests home .  
In order to change this situation , Guangzhou , under the guideline of " sports-based comprehensive development , " adjusted the structural composition and functional orientation of the newly-constructed and remodeled public sports facilities prior to the 9th National Sports Meet in an effort to achieve a multi-purpose integration of athletic , cultural , recreational and entertainment functions for these sports facilities .

The second is the formation of the political , economic , social , spiritual and cultural life of the State , without the infamous system - inherited from the past - of roles played out in advance .

Thus , a new impetus to foster regional cooperation is needed in order to address adequately the economic , social , cultural and ecological dimensions for a sustainable and systemic development of the ESCWA region .  
Part of the mandate of ESCWA is to act as a warning system to its member States regarding the impact of global political , economic , cultural and technological changes at the national and regional levels .  
To develop a comprehensive United Nations systemwide strategy for the implementation of the right to development and through concerted efforts to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ;

The Special Rapporteur 's claim that heads of cultural associations have been replaced by new heads who are members of the Arab Baath Socialist Party , is mere fabrication , with the obvious political ulterior motive of stirring up sectarian strife .

Concerning the implementation of economic , social and cultural rights at the national level , it was often stated that the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights was too vague to be of operational significance .

Since before the 1980s , Central America had begun to suffer the effects of a deep political , economic and social crisis that came about precisely because national societies had developed within a system of limited democracy in particular , because social programmes were not formulated or executed , a doctrine of national security was promoted , political arenas were closed and civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights were violated in one way or another . 
High levels of poverty and unemployment , lack of distributive justice , social unrest arising from ethnic , cultural and minority differences and powerful vested interests that need to be contained remain barriers , and these must be addressed continuously and simultaneously .  
It is the United Nations which , not limiting itself to those classical human rights born of the American and the French revolutions , consecrated the fundamental rights of the second generation and , in particular , economic , social and cultural rights which allowed it to enrich the contribution of liberalism of the century of enlightenment through the contribution of democratic socialism of the nineteenth century .  
The Organization originated in the post-war era with the main objective of consolidating an international order founded on faith in fundamental human rights , the dignity and worth of the human person ; and the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small ; an organization specifically mandated to maintain international peace and security and to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character .  
At the end of the twentieth century and the dawn of a new millennium , in a world characterized by a globalization of the economy and the dynamics of international relations , our reality is conditioned by factors such as the substantial progress of science , the transcendence of the technological revolution , the decisive influence of communications and information , the expansion of trade and the consequences of cultural and religious interaction .  
To attain the objectives of the International Decade of the World 's Indigenous People , Ecuador , a multi-ethnic country , has submitted various concrete programmes and initiatives , in consultation with national indigenous organizations , designed to improve the economic , social and cultural status of those groups while fully respecting their distinctive characteristics .  
Let us suppose , then , that the world of the future will have to be shaped according to regions , or large integrated groups or communities , regional or otherwise , that have a common cultural origin and wish to be identified with the others , because of the particular characteristics of their culture , such as tradition , language , religion and even mixed blood . 
Looking back over the 50 years since the guns of the Second World War fell silent , one notes with satisfaction the valuable work performed by the United Nations as a forum for debate on matters of international concern , and as a centre for harmonizing the activities of States in the economic , social , cultural and humanitarian fields .  
The United Nations has the power to say no to those States and peoples who do not respect the religious , political , moral and artistic convictions of others ; no to those States and peoples who do not respect minorities , be they national or of any other kind , and their languages , which are an essential element of cultural transmission ; no , above all , when repression is accompanied by the use of force and by cruelty , torture and other unspeakable acts .  
Indeed , beyond the simple maintenance of international peace and security , the Organization remarkably distinguished itself in the struggle for decolonization , but , above all , in the establishment of a progressive system of specialized agencies , all of which provide highly valued assistance in the social , economic , humanitarian and cultural fields .  
It must be built upon and strengthened , recognizing always that the human rights whose universality and indivisibility we assert are about economic and social and cultural rights just as much as about the civil and political rights on which the developed countries tend to focus so much attention .  
Moreover , the powerful vitality and steadfast determination which drive peoples to preserve their national traditions and cultural identities demonstrate their will to safeguard from within the inevitable process of international integration something stable and lasting , which links the present of each nation to the roots of its traditions , and the need to affirm the singularity of each society , each nation and each community , and not only of each individual .  
Nonetheless , we are extremely pleased to underscore the admirable example offered to us by the South Africans who , moving beyond racial or cultural motivations , in a long and heroic effort that has caused so much suffering , have put an end to the most odious form of discrimination apartheid .  
But this is not a time for fear or regrets ; it is a time for new endeavours , a time to promote new forms , ways and means of international cooperation , with a view to generating , by cultivating the complementary development of our national individualities , the cultural , economic and human resources that can enable us to be free of poverty and backwardness and to open an ever-broadening road to understanding , tolerance , peace and prosperity as we enter the third millennium .

Consolidating the common features and deepening our understanding of what binds us together , thus expanding the exchange of cultural values between youths of different countries and continents , is a task that is not only feasible , but also essential in order to build of a more harmonious and unified planet for the twenty-first century .  
Firstly , in the cultural and intellectual area , as it constitutes the vision which guides youth in all areas ; secondly , in the aesthetic field , art and literature are the essential pillars of culture ; thirdly , science as the basis of progress in our present generation which is witnessing growing scientific progress ; fourthly , sports and military fields ; fifthly , public social service , and finally , the field of trips and touristic activities and hostels .  
Such a fact underscores the need to respect and to take into consideration the historic religious and cultural characteristics of the peoples of every region when drafting any international document , so that the door may not be left ajar for the introduction of controversial issues after international compromises had been reached on such issues in previous conferences .  
The delegation of Egypt would like to avail itself of this opportunity to stress that whatever the linguistic formulas may be , its concept of the operative content of the paragraphs relating to reproductive and sexual health , especially paragraphs 56 , 57 and 58 , is that their implementation will take place in accordance with the legal system and the cultural and religious heritage of each society .  
To be young and live at the end of the twentieth century is to witness a process of constant change all over the world and , at the same time , to encounter a cruelly competitive cultural , social , economic and political reality .  
None the less , reality has shown that these aspirations have not been met and that , on the contrary , changes in the international system created conditions that have unleashed forces that had long been held in check , giving rise to new conflicts and rivalries , not only as a result of resurgent nationalism but also as a cause of serious ethnic , religious , social and cultural differences which have jeopardized peace and international security . 
There is extraordinary cooperation on the part of States , other political entities and non-governmental organizations in the dozens of areas of substantive concern of the United Nations organs ; in the burgeoning , multidimensional sphere of sustainable development ; in the territory where humane concerns and values , social ordering and cultural norms coalesce ; and in the field of peace-keeping , of providing States and peoples with security from violence and disorder .  
The Islamic Republic of Iran , inspired by the divine teachings of Islam and benefiting from national solidarity and the continued participation and efforts of its people , has endeavoured to develop a society on the basis of the dignity and worth of the human person and respect for human values , a society whose ethos includes fairness and social justice as well as cultural , social and economic development .  
Since the Islamic Republic of Iran firmly believes that the maintenance of peace and security , at the national , regional and international levels alike , is dependent upon economic growth and sustained development , we spend only about 1 per cent of our national budget on defence and devote the rest to overhauling and strengthening our economic , social and cultural infrastructures .  
One of the purposes of the United Nations , as enshrined in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .  
Georgiades ( Cyprus ) : In a world faced with unabated turmoil , the ancient Greek spirit that gave rise to the Olympian ideal of athletic achievement and excellence transcends the cultural and political boundaries that divide human communities .  
We therefore consider it vital to build a future premised on fundamental human rights , and for the realization of this objective we pursue an approach that recognizes the indivisibility of rights and that perceives no difference between civil and political rights , on the one hand , and cultural , social and economic rights , on the other .  
Indeed , 50 years after its founding , and facing the continuing economic and financial crisis that gravely undermines individual and collective development efforts and is a destabilizing factor for young States and for international peace and security , the United Nations is duty-bound to play a more active , indeed a central , role in promoting economic , social and cultural cooperation in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter .  
May this final celebration of the United Nations Year for Tolerance therefore also serve as the occasion on which we call for the redoubling of our efforts to close the apparent divides between us and overcome our momentary differences , our ideological and cultural barriers .  Let all of us therefore continue together , well beyond this special year , to work within the United Nations to instil the spirit of tolerance in the heart of the human community ( SG / SM / 5814 ) .  
Understood as a value which encompasses universal pluralism and a genuine acceptance of cultural diversity , the idea of tolerance represents , first of all , a valuable intellectual and practical framework within which the vitally important norms of a good society and a peaceful world can be developed .  
In our view , the increasing awareness of the need to uphold human rights and fundamental freedoms is closely and organically linked to and essential for the progress of society and the advancement of its members at the economic , political , cultural and social levels .  
National approaches to managing cultural diversity which nurtured the rich culture and linguistic traditions inherent in diverse communities would enhance the competitive position of national economies and increase international peace and security .  
The Charter establishes an important and immediate link between the cooperation necessary in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and the promotion and encouragement of and respect for universal human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .

The active support and participation of a broad and diverse range of other institutional actors should be encouraged , including legislative bodies , academic and research institutions , professional associations , trade unions , cooperatives , local community groups , non-governmental organizations , including women 's organizations and feminist groups , the media , religious groups , youth organizations and cultural groups , as well as financial and non-profit organizations .  
To this end , Governments , the international community and civil society , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , are called upon to take strategic action in the following critical areas of concern [ with full respect for religious and ethical values , cultural backgrounds and philosophical convictions and in conformity with all human rights and fundamental freedoms ] :  
Sustainable development and economic growth that is both sustained and sustainable are possible only through improving the economic , social , political , legal and cultural status of women .  
Such violations and obstacles include , as well as torture and cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment or summary and arbitrary detention , all forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia , denial of economic , social and cultural rights and religious intolerance .  
And , despite the fact that in the past four years it was not seldom that we were the victims of historical prejudices of some policies led on the Balkans , we have proved that we are capable of enduring , as a State and as a people , with authentic national and cultural identity , with deep historical roots and our own contribution to European culture and civilization .  
The decisive condition for their realization is the spontaneous initiative of individuals , first of all representatives of cultural and public life and of youth , with the financial assistance of national and international organizations and foundations .  
Other obstacles to the development of businesses owned by women include an adverse economic and regulatory environment , inadequate physical infrastructure and marketing , poor access to new technology , and a lack of vocational and managerial training .  Rigid social and cultural norms and lack of sharing of domestic responsibilities exacerbate the problems women face when operating businesses .  
States should be less restrictive and more liberal in the granting of visas to nationals of countries of the South and call on their populations to be more receptive to foreigners and to cultural interchange .  181 .  In the short term , as the United Nations strives for peace on several fronts , radical measures are urgently needed to curb radio stations that promote ethnic or racial hatred and to suppress clandestine radio stations which engage in such activities .  
NULLOther obstacles to the development of businesses owned by women include an adverse economic and regulatory environment , inadequate physical infrastructure and marketing , poor access to new technology , and a lack of vocational and managerial training .  Rigid social and cultural norms and lack of sharing of domestic responsibilities exacerbate the problems women face when operating businesses .  
Fads in policy design have repeatedly swept across segments of the community of policy advisers , only to be followed by reassessments after unanticipated difficulties have arisen .  No single model of financial development applies equally well in all institutional , cultural and technological situations .  
NULLThe conferences took the form of discussions based upon papers and commentaries written by selected individuals , of many differing nationalities and intellectual backgrounds but with one thing in common : that they were all outstanding experts in their various fields ( international law , international relations and relevant social and cultural areas ) .  
NULLLegally recognize the existence , identity and rights of indigenous people through constitutional reforms and the adoption of new laws to improve their legal status and guarantee their territorial , economic , social , cultural , political and civil rights .  
The Centre for Human Rights , in close cooperation with other bodies and organs of the United Nations , is available for developing activities aimed at facilitating the full participation of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of their societies and in the economic progress and development of their countries .  
In his report on the mission he undertook to the United States of America ( E / CN . 4 / 1995 / 78 / Add . 1 ) , " The Special Rapporteur found sociological inertia , structural obstacles and individual resistance hindering the emergence of an integrated society based on the equal dignity of the members of the American nation and willing to accept ethnic and cultural pluralism " ( para .  NULL  
Technical institutions and other forms of professional interest groups have a valuable role to play , particularly at the regional level , in articulating commonly held concerns or requirements of countries that are exposed to similar types of hazards or share common geographical or cultural attributes .  
The study enjoys the guidance and advice of a group of eminent persons made up of individuals of international repute and integrity drawn from every geographic region and representing a wide diversity of political , religious and cultural backgrounds ; this group also acts as a public advocate .  
Based on this research , a training programme has been developed to strengthen national and regional capacity for strategic development policy analysis , focusing on tools and techniques that incorporate the local cultural and social context for evaluating the socio-economic driving forces of structural change . 
NULLThe process of investigating individual cases takes into account the rights of indigenous peoples as set forth in the Guatemalan Constitution and in international human rights instruments to which Guatemala is a party , particularly the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination , and therefore emphasizes discrimination with respect to cultural , civil and political rights .  
Promotion of effective enjoyment by all people of civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , and access to existing social protection and public services , in particular through encouraging the ratification and ensuring the full implementation of relevant human rights instruments ;  
In the aforesaid resolution , the General Assembly enumerated the High Commissioner 's responsibilities , which basically involve promoting and protecting the effective enjoyment by all of all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
In 1991 , the Bank issued a revised policy ( Operational Directive 4.20 ) , which extends the definition of indigenous peoples to include a much wider array of groups who maintain social and cultural identities distinct from those of the national societies in which they live , who have close attachments to their ancestral lands , and who are susceptible to being disadvantaged in the development process .  
" Accordingly , I would be most grateful to continue benefitting from the cooperation of your Excellency 's Government so that I may provide the General Assembly and the Commission with an accurate and comprehensive assessment of the situation of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights in Myanmar .  
" Keeping in mind the deadline for the submission of my interim report to the General Assembly ( September 1995 ) , a visit to Myanmar at the end of August may be the only opportunity to provide the international community with an accurate and comprehensive assessment of the situation of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights in Myanmar .  
" Accordingly , I would be most grateful to continue benefitting from the cooperation of your Excellency 's Government so that I may provide the Commission and the General Assembly with an accurate and comprehensive assessment of the situation of economic , social , cultural , civil , and political rights in Myanmar in accordance with the provisions contained in Commission on Human Rights resolution 1995 / 72 .  
In order to make youth aware of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well their societal responsibilities , and in order to develop harmonious inter-community relations , mutual tolerance , mutual respect , equality between women and men , and tolerance for diversity , Governments should develop human rights education strategies targeted to youth , taking particular account of the human rights of women .  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of racial violence , continue to persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
NULLWhile the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the universal nature of which is beyond question .  
Ensure that the rights of persons belonging to national , ethnic and other minorities are protected , and that such persons are able to pursue economic and social development and live in circumstances of full respect for their identity , traditions , forms of social organization and cultural and religious values .  
Access for all to the values , knowledge and skills imparted by the educational system is a prerequisite for ensuring the continuity and stability of democratic institutions , guaranteeing political , economic , social and cultural participation , especially on the part of the most disadvantaged groups and contributing to the fight against poverty .  
The profound socio-economic , scientific , technological and cultural changes which have taken place in the world over the past decade demand educational systems which are capable of developing the skills required in order to cope with these changes and which stimulate creativity and emphasize the new culture of innovation , as well as a clear vision of the future vis - - vis the challenges of the next millennium .  
In addition , the phenomenon of the caste system , which could be characterized as multiple apartheid , also must be addressed openly with a view to mitigating the suffering of millions of people living a life of bondage and discrimination which divided them into upper and lower echelons , segregated them and excluded them from the political , economic , social and cultural spheres of society . 
The continuing plundering of the cultural heritage of the Greek Cypriots and the changing demographic structure of the area under Turkish military occupation through massive importation of settlers were two additional characteristics of the unacceptable situation created in Cyprus through the force of arms .  
Although the Turkish Cypriots now live free from Greek Cypriot harassment , oppression and terror , an inhuman embargo on their political , economic , social and cultural activity , imposed by the other side , continues .  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development that have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
Underlines the need for Governments with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
The High Commissioner has raised issues relating to economic , social and cultural rights , as well as the right to development , promotion of the rights of women , the status of minorities , indigenous people , the status of non-citizens , the legal status of refugees and asylum-seekers , protection of the rights of children and conformity of national legislation with international standards .  
The Croatian aggression resulted in major and forcible demographic displacement in the areas under the protection of the United Nations forces , i.e . , in mass resettlement and exodus of the Serbian population , violation of human rights , burning and destruction of their property including the Orthodox places of worship and Serbian cultural and historical monuments .  
In order to make youth aware of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well their societal responsibilities , and in order to develop harmonious inter-community relations , mutual tolerance , mutual respect , equality between women and men , and tolerance for diversity , Governments should develop human rights education strategies targeted to youth , taking particular account of the human rights of women .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of racial violence , continue to persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
Reaffirms that the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action is the sovereign right of every country , in accordance with its national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its peoples and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights ;  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the universal nature of which is beyond question .  
Ensure that the rights of persons belonging to national , ethnic and other minorities are protected , and that such persons are able to pursue economic and social development and live in circumstances of full respect for their identity , traditions , forms of social organization and cultural and religious values .  
Requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in order to enhance their capacity to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields ;  
It was pleased to note that , with the assistance and support of the international community and through the committed efforts of the Palestinian population , the Palestinian Authority had gradually established its administration and had taken a number of measures to ensure public order and to normalize Palestinian political , social , economic and cultural life , as well as to improve living conditions .  
the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his civil and political rights " .  
" an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized " .  
The right to development combines a comprehensive conception of development in its economic , social , cultural and political dimensions and a requirement of whole and entire realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and of the self-determination of peoples .  
It goes beyond the traditional conception of economic , social and cultural development by integrating in it the political dimension , basing it on popular participation and social justice , and focusing it on the human being , who is both its artisan and its chief beneficiary .  
As soon afterwards as 1968 the Proclamation of Tehran drew attention to the danger of this dissociation of human rights by proclaiming that : " Since human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible , the full realization of civil and political rights without the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights is impossible " .  
The Declaration on the Right to Development points out that " All human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ; equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights " .  
Again , by giving a comprehensive definition of development and representing it to be a simultaneously economic , social , cultural and political process , the Declaration on the Right to Development reflects the international community 's will to revise national and international development strategies in the light of the disappointing experience of several United Nations Development Decades .  
The Declaration on the Right to Development proclaims in its article 1 that " the right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized " .  
The full and equal participation of women in political , civil , economic , social and cultural life , at the national , regional and international levels , and the eradication of all forms of discrimination on grounds of sex are priority objectives of the international community .  
It is one of the purposes of the United Nations , in virtue of the Charter , " to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion " ( Art . 1 , para .

Reaffirms that the restitution to a country of its objets d'art , monuments , museum pieces , archives , manuscripts , documents and any other cultural or artistic treasures contributes to the strengthening of international cooperation and to the preservation and flowering of universal cultural values through fruitful cooperation between developed and developing countries ;  
Its members were all developing countries ; the mandates of its legislative bodies called for the promotion of economic , social and cultural cooperation among Member States ; and its subsidiary organs , agencies , affiliated institutions and international universities were geared towards the sharing of capacities and strengthening of cooperation in different spheres of socio-economic activity .

Taking into account the desire of both organizations to cooperate more closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,

Mr . AGGREY ( Ghana ) commended the excellent work carried out by the High Commissioner and the impartial manner in which he balanced issues relating to civil and political rights and questions concerning economic , social and cultural rights .  
Solutions to the problems faced by indigenous people must be worked out with their full participation and on the basis of full respect for their human , civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights and identity .  
also that there is no single political system or single universal model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples , and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,

further that , in order to promote development , equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,

bearing in mind that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing , and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
of the Committee would recall the difficult discussions which had taken place at recent major multilateral trade and economic negotiations on measures to preserve cultural industries and the provisions made in some documents , such as those of the Copenhagen Summit , requiring that liberalized and multifaceted economic actions , including structural adjustment , should be tempered by prudent considerations which reflected the concern to minimize the harm which could be caused to the populations to which they would be applied .  
Government looked to the Chinese Government to take specific steps to conform to international human rights norms , including releasing persons detained solely for the peaceful expression of their opinions and preserving the unique cultural , linguistic and religious heritage of Tibet .  
overwhelming majority of the world 's population lived in developing countries and for them , while political and civil rights were important , economic , social and cultural rights , particularly the right to subsistence and development , were paramount .  
MEKDAD ( Syrian Arab Republic ) said that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action had stated that all human rights were universal , interdependent and interconnected and that the international community should deal with human rights in a comprehensive , equitable and even-handed manner , while taking regional and cultural specificities into consideration .  
In this connection , it is appropriate to take into account the diversity of situations prevailing in each country in economic , social , cultural and political terms to appreciate the effectiveness and efficiency of the administrative apparatus and then perhaps to suggest adjustments , since there can not be just one analytical criterion or just one model for good administration .  
This original approach by Benin to the reform of its civil service had three major advantages : first , the transfer of skills and the strengthening of national expertise ; secondly , the relatively low cost of the operation , compared with what it would have cost had it been conducted completely by international consultants ; thirdly , the integration of national cultural and moral values in the different proposals and recommendations , thus easing implementation of this reform policy by the citizens at large and by the users of public services in particular . 
They conveyed the Community 's proposal to dispatch a Ministerial Trade and Investment Mission to South Africa at a mutually convenient date in 1997 and also to establish a joint CARICOM Diplomatic Mission in South Africa in the near future to advance economic , technical and cultural relations with the countries of southern Africa and with the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) .  
These settlors need not only represent recognized legal experts in international military / peace / security issues , but also those having expertise in economic , social and cultural relations where disputes are most often the root cause of all disastrous conflicts .  
Particularly relevant were the country 's limited economic capacities and its dependence on farm production , which had only very recently begun to be modernized ; high rates of poverty and marginalization among the population ; the institutional and cultural consequences of the prolonged dictatorship ; and the existence of a very traditional and hierarchical society .  
Any government , institution or individual seeking to promote human rights should bear in mind the significance of national and regional peculiarities as well as historical , cultural and religious backgrounds and the stage of economic development .  
The Government of Bolivia 's current efforts are essentially based on the consolidation of participatory democratic institutions and on the conviction that economic development must be compatible with care for nature and the environment in other words , that this must take place within the framework of sustainable development and of respect for ethnic and cultural diversity , in order to make unity in diversity possible .  
It placed on record their deep conviction with regard to sustainable development ; it set forth precise guidelines on regional integration and trade ; it expressed a firm resolve to press ahead in the fight against drugs and related crimes ; it emphasized , in particular , the importance of the Inter-American Convention against Corruption ; and it reiterated emphatically the crucial importance Governments , from their position of lofty responsibility , attached to cultural integration .  
They made a commitment , among other things , to protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ; to strengthen laws , policies and programmes to secure the full and equal participation of women in all spheres of political , civil , economic , social and cultural life ; to promote and protect the rights of the child ; to ensure protection of the rights of people who are particularly vulnerable , including young people , the disabled , the elderly and migrant workers ; and to promote and protect the rights of indigenous populations .  
We are therefore encouraged to think that the time has come for the establishment of a new global human order that would be based on respect for national sovereignty , participatory democracy , socio-economic equality , people-centred development and the realization of the economic , social and cultural rights enshrined in the United Nations Charter .  
Guaranteeing peace and collective security ; developing friendly relations among nations based on shared values ; promoting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ; and developing varied forms of cooperation in the economic , social , cultural and humanitarian fields these were the dreams of those who , 50 years ago , created the United Nations . 
This interrelatedness of interests has formed a sort of common culture among nations and has created a favourable climate for the exchange of ideas and the tools of knowledge , thus enabling cultural and intellectual interaction among peoples of the world and enhancing a deeper understanding of the bases of world peace and security , an objective which the United Nations has sought to achieve over the past five decades .  
The Sudan is of the view that the structure of the international community , which is based on ideological , political and cultural diversity and pluralism , prompts us all to accept peaceful coexistence and dictates that harmony and diversity among nations become the vehicle for interaction and dialogue within the framework of pursuing national interests in the context of the international system .  
The main purposes of the United Nations , as outlined in Chapter I of the Charter , include the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and also to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends .  
Society must be firmly rooted in the rule of law , democratic participation , gender equality , the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by all , social justice , tolerance , respect for ethnic , religious and cultural diversity , and meeting the requirements of groups with specific needs , such as young and older people , as well as people with disabilities .  
Wilmot ( Ghana ) : At the World Summit for Social Development held in Copenhagen in March 1995 , world leaders took tough political decisions and committed themselves to create an economic , political , social , cultural and legal environment that would enable people to achieve social development and social justice .  
Organized under the auspices of the United Nations , these global conferences have focused attention on the complex phenomenon of development in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , legal and related fields in a holistic manner .  
It is therefore with great apprehension that we note a proliferation of regional conflicts , social and economic collapse in some of our countries , environmental decay , and the coming of new scourges such as transnational crime , drug trafficking , a rising wave of criminality , racial disturbances , xenophobia , and religious and cultural intolerance . 
Honduras is a firm believer in the fact that cooperation between the two organizations constitutes positive progress towards the maintenance of peace and security in the region , allowing the countries there to have a broader forum for discussion and negotiation in the search for solutions to economic , social , cultural , political and humanitarian problems and respect for human rights .  
As this is based on a harmonious cultural hegemony that serves as a solid foundation for the defense of human rights , it is clear that there is a strong political will , public opinion and social awareness in favour of positive action .  
Turbay ( Colombia ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : As stated in the draft resolution before us today , the United Nations must be the centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of common ends such as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Kuwait believes that there are several countries that have proven , through their relations with the United Nations , that they are capable of assuming the main responsibilities of maintaining international peace and security and of assisting in achieving the United Nations objectives in the political , economic , social and cultural fields through their participation in peacekeeping operations and their considerable financial contributions to the various budgets of these operations and to the regular United Nations budget .  
This obliges States , within the framework of the United Nations system , to go beyond their traditional activities and jointly engage in management activities in the Organization based on the new cultural , economic and geographical reality made up of broad functional regional areas .  
The outstanding features of this new model have been embodied in the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , which is a national and regional strategy to foster a change in personal and social attitudes to ensure the establishment of a model of sustainable development in the political , economic , social , cultural and environmental fields .

Thus , if a part of the population of a particular country wanted to change their status , there were three contexts in which this could be achieved : when the constitution established a right to self-determination ; when all the parties concerned agreed to secession ; and when that part of the population was denied the right to participate freely in the conduct of public affairs or if their civil and political as well as economic , social and cultural rights were denied .

The reality is that no State can long remain just or free , and thus also have the potential to pursue a successful and sustainable development strategy , if its citizens are prohibited from participating actively and substantially in its political processes and economic , social and cultural development .  
8 December 1988 , reaffirming that the will of the people , expressed in periodic and genuine elections , shall be the basis of authority of government , the General Assembly stressed that , " as a matter of practical experience , the right of everyone to take part in the government of his or her country is a crucial factor in the effective enjoyment of a wide range of other human rights and fundamental freedoms , embracing political , economic , social , and cultural rights " . 
Legal , economic , political or cultural barriers that prevent the exercise of equal rights should be identified and removed through comprehensive policy reforms and strong affirmative action ;  
In resolution 1996 / 75 , the Commission , concerned at the situation of women and children , especially regarding access to basic education for girl children and access by women to employment , called upon all parties in Afghanistan to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and also called upon the Afghan authorities to ensure the effective participation of women in the social , economic , political and cultural life throughout the country and to ensure equal treatment to women and girls .  
He stated that the relegation of women to a domestic role , attributable to cultural factors , their lack of political involvement , the reduced pay they received when on maternity leave , the violence within the family that affected two out of every three women , the discrimination practised by families in respect of education and the sexual attacks by soldiers and policemen already reported in 1994 , continued unabated in 1995 .  
Acknowledges the contribution of Secretary-General Dr .  Boutros Boutros-Ghali to international peace , security and development , his exceptional efforts to solve international problems in economic , social and cultural fields , as well as his endeavours to meet humanitarian needs and to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ;  
The Constitution of the Republic of Croatia pays special attention to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms by devoting its whole chapter 3 entitled Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms to the elaboration of different human rights standards including both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights , mainly following the standards elaborated in major international human rights instruments .  
In Cuba , freedoms and fundamental political , economic , social and cultural rights are established by the Constitution , as is equality of rights , and they are all provided for in the main legal texts in force .  
These include the articulation of clear development goals , strategies and priorities that are nationally prescribed and supported , where necessary , by external partners ; effective performance of functions through a well-trained human resource base ; competent organizations and management to effectively utilize and retain skilled people ; a policy and institutional environment that can facilitate the performance and accountability of the public sector and other national institutions ; and sensitivity to the overall social , economic and cultural environment in which capacity development is to take place .  
In accordance with the Charter of the United Nations , the Organization aims at the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principles of sovereign equality of all its Members , equal rights and self - determination of peoples and at achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character .  
This partnership will be built on an integrated and holistic approach to human rights , in the framework of which all rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social , including the right to development , are perceived as of equal importance , interrelated and mutually supportive .  
It recognized that the Declaration on the Right to Development constituted an integral link between the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action through its elaboration of a holistic vision integrating economic , social and cultural rights with civil and political rights .  
At its fifty-third session , the Commission adopted resolution 1997 / 17 , entitled " Question of the realization in all countries of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , and study of special problems which the developing countries face in their efforts to achieve these human rights " .  
The agreement expands cooperation to new fields , such as preventive diplomacy , the maintenance and consolidation of peace and , pursuant to paragraph 4 of resolution 50 / 3 , all subjects of common interest in the political , economic , social , scientific and cultural fields .  
The General Assembly would express its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his continued efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations of the United Nations system and the OIC and its subsidiary organs and specialized and affiliated institutions to serve the mutual interests of the two Organizations in the political , economic , social and cultural fields ; and would express the hope that the Secretary-General will continue to strengthen the mechanisms of coordination between the two Organizations .  
The task of developing a culture of peace would require comprehensive educational , cultural , social and civic action based on a commonality of interest and shared goals .  
The region \ x { e5b8 } constant focus on democracy , good governance , peace , security and nuclear disarmament ; its undertaking to take responsibility for the proper and responsible management of the environment ; the protection of fish and other marine resources ; cultural and technology exchanges ; and economic cooperation and respect for human rights all stand to prove that the zone is successfully dealing with a changing global environment .  
And from them emerged two key principles of considerable importance : a reaffirmation that international assistance for democratization and reform needs to be tailored to fit into the broader political , cultural and social circumstances of each country , and that good governance is effective , participatory , transparent , accountable and equitable , and promotes the rule of law .  
In keeping with this view , the Kingdom of Swaziland believes that democracy is not a model to be copied but a goal to be attained , and the pace at which it can proceed is dependent on a variety of political , economic , social and cultural factors proper to the circumstances of a particular culture and society .  
Mongolia agrees with the conclusion that democracy is not a model to be copied or imposed , but rather a goal to be attained , and that the pace at which democratization can proceed is dependent on a variety of political , economic , social and cultural factors proper to the circumstances of a particular culture or society .  
Taking full advantage of historical affinities , cultural ties and religious bonds and sparing no effort to utilize in an efficient and coordinated manner the human and natural potential and resources of the region constitute the single best long-term guarantee of security and tranquillity .  
For all those reasons , and with a view to preserving the religious , cultural and historical character of Jerusalem , the Government of Jordan continues to maintain , restore and protect the Holy Places , now under the yoke of occupation , and to provide the necessary support for the relevant officials , with a view to protecting those places from all dangers pending the final solution to which we look forward .  
The participating States reached agreements concerning their future actions in various fields of regional cooperation , such as political cooperation ; stability and development of good-neighbourly relations ; economic cooperation in fields of mutual interest ; joint actions for environmental protection ; promotion of humanitarian , social and cultural cooperation ; cooperation in law enforcement , justice and combating organized crime , terrorism , drugs and arms trafficking .  
Recalling General Assembly resolution 50 / 123 of 20 December 1995 in which the Assembly , inter alia , recognized the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
UNHCR notes that involvement of local rather than international non-governmental organizations is likely to provide a closer link with the private sector at the country level and with institutions of civil society , such as voluntary agencies , human rights groups , cultural and academic associations , churches and other religious bodies , and refugee community groups .  
Bearing in mind also that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
In implementing the Guidelines , it should be borne in mind that achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all , is one of the principal objectives of the United Nations .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , States have the duty , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all universally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms , in accordance with international human rights standards .  
HIV / AIDS demonstrates the indivisibility of human rights since the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , as well as civil and political rights , is essential to an effective response .  
The rich variety of geographical , ethnic , cultural and linguistic origins within the staff of the Commission has served , as I intended , to centre and balance the work of the secretariat to meet the required high standards of independence , effectiveness and impartiality , which are expected from a United Nations operation .  
Whereas , at the national level , recognition of the identity of indigenous peoples is of fundamental importance for building national unity based on respect for and the exercise of the political , cultural , economic and spiritual rights of all Guatemalans , as well as on the fulfilment of their duties ,  
One year after D + 60 , beneficiaries of both procedures shall become eligible for longer-term services provided by the Government , including financial , technical , legal and employment assistance and assistance in the areas of education , training and production projects with a view to ensuring their lasting integration into the economic , social and cultural life of the country , on the same terms as the rest of the Guatemalan population .  
Each of the High Contracting Parties guarantees to nationals of the other Parties resident in its territory , regardless of their ethnic affiliation , religion or other differences , social , economic and cultural rights and freedoms in accordance with universally accepted international human rights standards .  
A working group or other mechanism should be set up to examine the imbalance in decision-making powers between developed and developing countries and between major and smaller nations in decision-making in global issues ( political , economic and social and cultural ) and institutions , such as the Bretton Woods institutions , the World Trade Organization , the Security Council and other United Nations bodies . 
The Commission on Human Rights , in its resolution 1993 / 14 , requested the Secretary _ General to prepare basic policy guidelines on structural adjustment and economic , social and cultural rights which could serve as a basis for a continued dialogue between human rights bodies and the international financial institutions .  
The reports of Danilo T \ x { e16c } k , Special Rapporteur of the Sub _ Commission on the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , especially the final report ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1992 / 16 ) , contain a wide _ ranging analysis of how structural adjustment programmes have had negative effects on a range of human rights .  
And as the proportion of those over age 60 changes from approximately 1 in 14 to 1 in 4 ( sooner in developed countries but faster in developing countries ) , the interrelationship of ageing and development will become evident in economic , social , political and cultural areas . 
The representative made clear that Venezuela , as well as the rest of Latin America , was experiencing social , political , economic and cultural transformations that were having a tremendous impact on society , particularly on women , who had seen their incomes and traditional sources of support reduced and their responsibilities expanded .  
In other cases , the existing policies and priorities of the agencies emphasized the social , economic , environmental and cultural dimensions underlying sustainable development to a sufficient extent so that new structures were not felt to be necessary .  
Affirmation of the economic , social , environmental and cultural principles inherent in the concept of sustainable development would be enhanced by more systematic consideration of the follow-up to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and related major United Nations conferences .  
Provisional Order No . 4 / 1994 ( Miscellaneous Amendment of the Organization of Voluntary Work _ Societies Registration Act of 1957 and the Organization of Foreign Non _ Governmental Voluntary Work in the Sudan Act of 1988 ) , signed by the President of the Republic , defines a society as a voluntary organization of thirty or more persons established to carry out voluntary work of [ a ] social , scientific , educational , research , cultural and religious purpose ( art .  2.1 . a . 2 ) .  
According to article 2.2.2 , a voluntary organization means any foreign voluntary organization whose purpose is to carry out work the nature of which is social , scientific , educational , research based , cultural , technical or religious and which is registered under this Act .  
This ensures that the principles embodied in international labour standards are taken into account in the work of other organizations dealing with issues of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , racial and sex discrimination , the rights of ethnic minorities and the rights of children , inter alia .  
Furthermore , the Assembly called upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action .  
The Plan includes clear objectives , target audience ( organized and unorganized elements of society ) , strategies ( trainers training , organization of networks , integration of human rights in all educational curricula , utilization of village-level officials to reach out to the community level , promotional campaigns including artistic and cultural activities , development of monitoring and evaluation systems , etc . ) and programmes , including the creation of a human rights training , documentation and research centre ( the Human Rights Academy ) .  
The Office 's special programmes and projects shall consist of specialized activities concerning , inter alia , displaced persons , the rights of women , the rights of children and adolescents , the penal and prison systems , indigenous communities , disabled persons and other sectors in need of special protection .  22 .  The representative of the National Observatory for Human Rights of Algeria advised that the Observatory was based on the principle of institutional and cultural pluralism .  
Space telecommunications , which are the primary field of commercial applications of space , involve major economic , political , cultural , strategic and industrial stakes .  
Indian society is marked by a rigid hierarchical social stratification which divides the country into two nations : the one comprising the majority , who are poor , uneducated and illiterate , particularly in rural areas , and the other , consisting of the minority which holds the reins of power and forms the economic , social and cultural \ x { 5e68 } ite .  
However , the economic and cultural poverty of the most disadvantaged is a fertile breeding _ ground for the development of religious extremism and , more generally , for the political exploitation of religion ; this is evidenced by the conflicts in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab , the destruction of Babri Masjid and the intercommunal riots in Bombay .  
Recalling General Assembly resolution 50 / 123 of 20 December 1995 in which the Assembly , inter alia , recognized the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
Reaffirming the objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations of achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
Stressing that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Recalling also that , in order to promote development , equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
While recognizing the efforts undertaken by the authorities in the education system , the Committee is concerned about the persisting disparities in relation to the low access to education of children living in rural areas , indigenous children and refugee children , who do not enjoy a system of education adequate to their cultural values and identity .  
The future is contingent on global economic developments as well as on local and national social , cultural , political and economic initiatives .  
While some delegations noted that there was a need to update the report of the Secretary-General containing a preliminary set of basic policy guidelines on structural adjustment programmes and economic , social and cultural rights ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1995 / 10 ) , a number of other delegations considered that it was a valuable and useful document .  
The working group initially identified the principles that might be the relevant and maybe subject of future discussion , with a view to establishing a clear linkage between these principles and structural adjustment programmes as they impinged on economic , social and cultural rights .  
That was how the transitional institutional order was established ; its main purpose is to indicate the way to the Third Republic by creating attitudes consistent with the democratic imperative of a State governed by rule of law , by instituting major political , economic , social , legal and cultural reforms with a view to creating an environment conducive to the establishment of a democratic State governed by the rule of law and by holding free , transparent and democratic elections from which no one would be excluded .  
The development of future large water-supply systems must adopt pricing that reflects all external costs , including waterlogging ; salinization ; habitat alteration ; impact on endangered species ; long-term deterioration of water quality due to changing land-use practices in catchment areas ; cultural and social dislocation ; and the cost of imposed risks .  
Holders of TFRK will need to be represented by their own representatives ; to feel secure in their land tenure arrangements ; to be reassured that they have been accorded status equal to that of the other members of the agreements ; and to be convinced of a common purpose compatible with their cultural and ecological values .  
Much attention is still given to timber and forest cover , whereas other goods and services provided by forests , such as fuelwood , the sustainable use and conservation and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits of biological diversity , soil and water protection functions , and carbon sequestration and sinks , as well as other social , cultural and economic aspects , are rarely covered and need to be considered .  
There is a need for a broad spectrum of quantitative , qualitative and descriptive indicators covering social , cultural , economic , ecological , institutional , legal and policy elements , including land tenure .  
The Panel agreed that in order to achieve the management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests it is necessary to deal coherently with all the interrelated social , cultural , economic , trade , environment , development , production , financial and technology issues that have a concrete impact on those objectives .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the fall of apartheid and despite continuing efforts to combat these phenomena , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of racially motivated violence , persist and are even growing in magnitude , adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination , inter alia against Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , negrophobia , anti _ Semitism and related intolerance continue to persist and even to grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Noting with regret the negative effects of the structural adjustment and reform policies conceived and imposed by the international financial organizations and bilateral creditors on the debtor countries to deal with the effects of the foreign debt , on the enjoyment and realization of economic , social and cultural rights , especially among the most vulnerable and low _ income groups ,  
Recalling that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his civil and political rights ,  
Recalling also that the eradication of widespread poverty , including its most persistent forms , and the full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights and civil and political rights remain interrelated goals ,  
Deeply concerned by the fact that extreme poverty continues to spread throughout the countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social or cultural situation , and gravely affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Aware that equitable access to and efficient use of the Geostationary Satellite Orbit / radio frequency spectrum resources for all States or groups of States , taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries , is of fundamental importance to the development of telecommunications infrastructure for economic , social and cultural development of all States ,  
Mindful that in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action ( A / CONF . 157 / 23 ) the World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , reaffirmed that the human person was the central subject of development and underlined the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,  
Request the Chairman of the Commission , when appointing special rapporteurs , to continue to consult closely with regional groups and ensure that the appointee is of recognized standing in the field of human rights , has an overall knowledge of political , social and legal systems , is sensitive to different cultural , religious and ethnic particularities , and will accordingly implement his mandate independently , impartially and objectively ;  
Noting that the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights has highlighted the imbalance in the special rapporteur system by referring to the fact that although there are a large number of thematic and related mechanisms dealing with different aspects of civil and political rights , there is none dealing solely with the economic , social and cultural rights recognized in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , despite the recognized interdependence , indivisibility and interrelationship of the two sets of rights ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Concerned that the international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected and that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights ,  
Aware that equitable access to and efficient use of the geostationary satellite orbit / radio frequency spectrum resources for all States or groups of States , taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries , is of fundamental importance to the development of telecommunications infrastructure for economic , social and cultural development of all States ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination , inter alia , against Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , negrophobia , anti _ Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Emphasizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated ; the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis ; while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
Urges all States to eliminate all obstacles to development at all levels by pursuing the promotion and protection of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights and by implementing comprehensive development programmes at the national level , integrating these rights into development activities , and by promoting effective international cooperation ;  
At its fortieth session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1988 / 33 , decided to entrust Mr . Danilo T \ x { e16c } k with a study of problems , policies and progressive measures relating to the more effective realization of economic , social and cultural rights , and recommended that the Special Rapporteur should take account of the guidelines and issues contained in resolution 1987 / 29 A of the Sub-Commission .  
At its forty-fourth session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1992 / 29 , expressed its deep appreciation to the Special Rapporteur , Mr . Danilo T \ x { e16c } k , for his final report on the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , endorsed the recommendations contained in paragraphs 202 to 246 of that report and requested the Secretary-General to ensure the widest possible distribution of the reports of the Special Rapporteur .  
At its forty-eighth session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1996 / 24 , welcomed with satisfaction the second interim report on the question of the impunity of perpetrators of violations of human rights ( economic , social and cultural rights ) prepared by Mr . El Hadji Guiss ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1996 / 15 ) , and requested the Special Rapporteur to submit his final report to the Sub-Commission at its forty-ninth session .  
At its forty-fifth session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1993 / 40 , decided to entrust Mr . Asbj \ x { 9de8 } n Eide with the task of producing a preparatory document on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights , and income distribution , at both national and international levels , taking also into account matters related to the realization of the right to development , with a view to determining how most effectively to strengthen activities in this field .  
At its forty-eighth session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1996 / 26 , welcomed the provisional report on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights , and income distribution , prepared by the Special Rapporteur , Mr . Jos Bengoa , ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1996 / 14 ) , and requested the Special Rapporteur to submit his final report to the Sub _ Commission at its forty _ ninth session .  
In its decision 1996 / 117 , the Sub _ Commission decided to request Mr . Osman El _ Hajj to prepare , without financial implications , an expanded working paper on ways and means of promoting democracy , how democracy can ensure economic , social , cultural and political rights and how to overcome obstacles to democracy , and to present the expanded working paper to the Sub _ Commission at its forty _ ninth session .  
They have done so in the context of the urgent need for understanding by non-indigenous societies of the spiritual , social , cultural , economic and political significance of lands , territories and resources to the continued survival and vitality of indigenous societies .  
In summary , each of these examples underscores a number of elements that are unique to indigenous peoples : ( 1 ) a profound relationship between indigenous peoples and their lands , territories and resources exists ; ( 2 ) that this relationship has various social , cultural , spiritual , economic and political dimensions and responsibilities ; ( 3 ) that the collective dimension of this relationship is significant ; and ( 4 ) that the inter-generational aspect of such a relationship is also crucial to indigenous peoples identity , survival and cultural viability .  
At present , it is safe to say that the use of judicial mechanisms may be risky due to the problem of different interpretive tools , the subjective and highly political nature of these State _ chartered forums , and continuing cultural biases demonstrated by Governments .  
The ethnic factor , in conjunction with other political , economic , historical and cultural factors , is eating away at the fragile political ties in Africa , with the harrowing consequences of confrontation _ whose main victims are civilian populations _ and a resurgence of the crime of genocide .  
Thus , both international war and internal armed conflicts , just as states of tension or domestic disturbances caused by political , economic , social or cultural factors , when accompanied by clashes , acts of violence , vandalism , inter _ ethnic confrontations , terrorist attacks , etc . and provided they represent an actual or at any rate imminent threat to the community as a whole , constitute a public danger or public emergency in the meaning conferred on those terms by the international instruments referred to above .  
It is against this background of societies repeatedly traumatized by economic , social , cultural and other factors that such extreme situations develop , in which the breakdown of the institutional order opens the floodgates to widespread violence and massacres of the civilian population , frequently leading in the end to actual genocide .  
After welcoming the preliminary report on the impunity of perpetrators of human rights violations ( economic , social and cultural rights ) ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1994 / 11 and Corr . 1 ) , the Sub _ Commission decided ( resolution 1994 / 34 ) to split the study in two , entrusting Mr . Joinet with the aspect of civil and political rights and Mr . El Hadji Guiss with that of economic , social and cultural rights .  
But there seems to be an obvious causal connection between the denial , or erosion , of economic , social and cultural rights , and conditions leading to subtle and cumulative transfers of populations .  
The human rights system has the legal obligation to observe the economic system and to signal the greater or lesser impact it is having in meeting the needs of individual human beings and on their enjoyment of essential civil , economic , social , political and cultural rights .  
In this spirit , the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , deeply alarmed at the widening gap between the rich and the poor , adopted resolution 1993 / 40 in which it entrusted Mr . A . Eide with the task of producing a preparatory document on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights , and income distribution , at both national and international levels .  
In the preliminary report ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1995 / 14 ) to the Sub-Commission , the Special Rapporteur underlined that income distribution , both internationally and nationally , was the principal indicator of social integration and of the fulfilment of minimum requirements in respect of economic , social and cultural rights , enabling human beings to live in society . 
It was asserted that greater communication between societies would bring growing homogenization of accepted and acceptable " standards " and levels of realization of human rights in general and of economic , social and cultural rights in particular .  
The final objective of the report is to signal the challenges to the human rights system posed by the process of globalization , especially in the field of economic , social and cultural rights .  
A framework is thus taking shape of " permanent and persistent violations " of the economic , social and cultural rights of a substantial and increasing majority of the world 's population , threatening the solidarity of international humanitarian principles and human rights .  
Reaffirming that development is a comprehensive economic , social , cultural and political progress , which aims at the constant improvement of the well-being of the entire population and of all individuals on the basis of their active , free and meaningful participation in development and in the fair distribution of benefits resulting therefrom ,  
Under the wise leadership of the great leader , the people in the northern half of our Republic vigorously accelerated the three revolutions , ideological , technical and cultural , holding high the banner of the Juche idea , and thus cemented rock-firm our revolutionary base , a decisive guarantee of national reunification .  
The right to development was one of the most important human rights , transcending both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights and standing at the nexus formed by democracy , development and respect for human rights .  
Also appeals to the international community to provide its material , technical and financial support to the non _ governmental organizations and to the groups that are working with dedication to achieve the total elimination of this cultural practice that is harmful for girl children and women ;  
Even in situations where it may be necessary to impose limitations on such a right , full compliance with article 4 of the Covenant is required so that any limitations imposed must be determined by law only insofar as this may be compatible with the nature of these [ i.e . economic , social and cultural ] rights and solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society .  
A reign of terror has been let loose , characterized by extrajudicial executions , indiscriminate killings , random and mass arrests for political reasons , forced relocation of the population , gang rapes of women and systematic efforts to obliterate the ethnic , social and cultural identity of the Kashmiri people .  
Also appeals to the international community to provide its material , technical and financial support to the non _ governmental organizations and to the groups that are working with dedication to achieve the total elimination of this cultural practice that is harmful for girl children and women ;  
Mindful that in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action ( A / CONF . 157 / 23 ) the World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , reaffirmed that the human person was the central subject of development and underlined the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,  
Recognizing the profound spiritual , cultural , social and economic relationship that indigenous peoples have to their total environment and the urgent need to respect and recognize the rights of indigenous peoples to their lands , territories and resources ,  
Recognizing that United Nations organs and Member States have increasingly acknowledged that lands and natural resources are essential to the Economic and cultural survival of indigenous peoples , and that some States have enacted legal measures that uphold indigenous land rights or have established procedures for arriving at legally binding agreements on indigenous land _ related issues ,

It is hypocritical that the Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations should level false accusations against the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus on the subject of protection of cultural heritage , when it is a well-known fact that Greece itself is engaged in a policy of forcible assimilation of the Turkish minority in western Thrace , coupled with systematic pillaging and obliteration of Turkish monuments .  
With regard to legislation , while noting with satisfaction the legal and legislative arrangements developed and implemented for the protection of land and sacred sites , including religious objects , and for the return of the religious and cultural heritage , the Special Rapporteur recommends ensuring uniformity of such legislation at the Federal and State levels , as well as its effectiveness in relation to its assigned objective , particularly by identifying and remedying shortcomings and loopholes .  
Legacies to future generations are a collective responsibility of todays citizens be this the legacy of natural capital ( the environment ) , physical capital ( infrastructure , plant and equipment ) , financial capital ( savings ) , social capital ( institutions and structures ) and cultural capital ( the values , principles and concepts that are handed down ) . 
Also invites States to develop comprehensive strategies at the national , regional and local levels to meet the increase in demand for care and support for older persons as individuals , within their families and communities , and within institutions , bearing in mind the changing socio-economic , technological and cultural environment ;  
Essentially a product of deep social and economic underdevelopment , crises in that part of the world are aggravated by ethnic , cultural and religious factors , all deeply rooted in history .  
That Constitution included clear provisions concerning collective land ownership , the management of natural resources , recognition of indigenous forms of government and administration , protection of the identity and cultural heritage of the indigenous peoples , the official status of the languages and dialects they used and the creation of special electoral districts ensuring their representation in Congress .

The ties between the Russian Federation and Egypt that are developing in the economic , cultural , humanitarian and other spheres are based on mutual respect for the specific national and cultural characteristics of the two peoples and their traditions of friendship .  
The dialogue could build on the work of the High-Level Advisory Board on Sustainable Development , which in 1996 considered how new information technologies that were broadly accessible could contribute to sustainable development by promoting economic growth , improving access to information and promoting civil society . 11 The new technologies , and related institutional changes such as privatization , offer opportunities to extend services to previously unserved communities and to promote broader participation in development , but may also have economic , social and cultural risks . 
The Programme shall be implemented in particular but not exclusively , in the following fields : political , legal , administrative , internal affairs , economic , social , cultural , educational , reconstruction and return and the media .  
As the economic basis of security , all countries and regions should , on the basis of equality and mutual benefit , promote trade , economic and technological cooperation and scientific and cultural exchanges among themselves , with a view to narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor and achieving common prosperity and development .  
Further , the Assembly called upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action .  
These include the articulation of clear development goals , strategies and priorities that are nationally prescribed and supported , where necessary , by external partners ; effective performance of functions through a well-trained human resource base ; competent organizations and management effectively to utilize and retain skilled people ; a policy and institutional environment that can facilitate the performance and accountability of the public sector and other national institutions ; and sensitivity to the overall social , economic and cultural environment in which capacity development is to take place .

An important medium of education and the heightening of awareness has been the " New Home , New Life " radio series developed by Mr . John Butt of the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) , which incorporates cultural , social , economic , human rights , peace , health , conflict resolution , mine awareness and other issues of vital daily importance for the population of Afghanistan .  
The Special Representative seeks to influence relevant actors within the international community , governmental or non-governmental , to support developments in Cambodia that would promote civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
There was a general atmosphere of insecurity , in which the population suffered from the arbitrariness and brazen arrogance of the Zairian armed forces ; an inefficient judiciary ; severe repression of freedom of expression and opinion , although within the margin of freedom tolerated since the National Sovereign Conference ; systematic torture and deplorable prison conditions ; and the absence of measures to ensure economic , social and cultural rights .  
The Ministers also agreed to continue negotiations for the speedy signing of a trade agreement , an agreement on cultural and scientific cooperation , a protocol on the equivalence of educational qualifications and levels , an agreement on cooperation in the area of tourism , and an agreement on cooperation in physical culture and sports , and to draft an agreement on cooperation to combat illegal trafficking in drugs and other psychotropic substances .  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development , which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and which take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security , and their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen economic , social , cultural and environmental cooperation in the region ,

The approach goes beyond existing formal institutional frameworks to encompass substantive and informal aspects related to the real structures and ethical and cultural traits that underlie political behaviour .  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Expresses its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his continued efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations of the United Nations system and the Organization of the Islamic Conference and its subsidiary organs and specialized and affiliated institutions to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social and cultural fields , and expresses the hope that he will continue to strengthen the mechanisms of coordination between the two organizations ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in order to enhance their capacity to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields ;  
Deeply concerned that despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , continue to persist and even grown in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
While significance of national and regional characteristics and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security , and their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen economic , social , cultural and environmental cooperation in the region ,  
Stresses its solidarity with people living in poverty in all countries , and reaffirms that the satisfaction of basic human needs is an essential element of poverty eradication , those needs being closely interrelated and comprising nutrition , health , water and sanitation , education , employment , housing and equal opportunities for participation in political , economic , cultural and social life ;  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the Office of the High Commissioner , in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security , and their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen economic , social , cultural and environmental cooperation in the region ,  
Deeply concerned about discrimination against the girl child and the violation of the rights of the girl child , which often result in less access for girls to education , nutrition , physical and mental health care and to girls enjoying fewer rights , opportunities and benefits of childhood and adolescence than boys and often being subjected to various forms of cultural , social , sexual and economic exploitation and to violence and harmful practices such as incest , early marriage , female infanticide , prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation ,  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Further recalling that in order to promote development equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
Stressing the importance of the new programme for the sustainable development of Central America and the setting of national and regional priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural and environmental spheres and in the areas of public security and regional integration ,  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
Social , religious and cultural networks can help to represent the specific economic interests of all the different groups in the community , particularly excluded groups ; to ensure that policies reflect the needs and interest of communities ; to ensure that policies do not lead to disintegration of communities ; to collect relevant data and information on the impact of economic policies ; to carry out participatory monitoring of policies ; and to ensure local representation in government structures .  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
Recognizing the sovereign right of each State to decide on the development of its private and public sectors , taking into account the comparative advantages of each sector , bearing in mind the economic , social and cultural diversity in the world ,  
In its paragraph 5 , Part I , the Vienna Declaration and Programme of action recalled that All human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated and , in paragraph 98 , Part II , that to strengthen the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights , additional approaches should be examined , such as a system of indicators to measure progress in the realization of the rights set forth in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights .  
While noting that similar bodies either were exploring the possibility of introducing such a mechanism or had already adopted an additional protocol , the Committee believed that , if the principle of the indivisibility , interdependence and interrelatedness of civil and political , and economic , social and cultural rights was to be upheld in the work of the United Nations , it was essential that a complaint procedure be established under the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights .  
The Committee also recommended that the optional protocol should apply in relation to all economic , social and cultural rights as set forth in the Covenant and that this would include all rights contained in articles 1 to 15 with the exception of the right to self _ determination which would be considered only insofar as the economic , social and cultural rights dimensions of that right were involved . 
The Committee noted that while there are a large number of thematic and related mechanisms dealing with different aspects of civil and political rights , there is none dealing solely with the economic , social and cultural rights recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , despite the acknowledged interdependence , indivisibility and interrelatedness of the two sets of rights ( E / 1997 / 22 _ E / CN . 12 / 1996 / 6 , para .  390 ) .  
In order to raise awareness of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the Department carries on a multi _ media approach to ensure the effective coverage of this issue as well as worldwide distribution of relevant public information materials on human rights .  
First , it should be noted that some replies do not correspond to the request for information made by the Secretary _ General , but they have nevertheless been included because they provided material for discussion on the realization of economic , social and cultural rights with regard to social measures at the national level , the right to self-determination and the right of countries to sovereignty over their natural resources .  
Other replies contained favourable views : the appointment of a special rapporteur was seen , in the light of article 2 of the Covenant , as a way to overcome obstacles to the realization of economic , social and cultural rights and to protect vulnerable groups such as migrants and minorities .  
We have realized that all the major political , economic , social and cultural problems of the world can be tackled meaningfully when development is fully addressed by developed and developing countries alike , as guided by the Agenda for Development .  
Inspired by the long historical and close cultural bonds between Turkey and Afghanistan , we stand ready to fulfil our share of the responsibility falling to the international community to assist the Afghan people on the path to reconciliation and to help them preserve Afghanistan 's territorial integrity , sovereignty , independence and national unity .  
The main constraints to the promotion of TCDC , as reported by many delegations and agencies , included structural and cultural differences ; lack of financial resources ; insufficient awareness of the benefits and potentials of TCDC ; limited access to information ; inadequate human resources ; and lack of coordination among the various government agencies involved in technical cooperation .  
While remaining faithful to the purposes and principles set forth in the Charter the maintenance of international peace and security , cooperation for economic , social and cultural development , defence of human rights , and humanitarian assistance the United Nations should also promote and pursue a reform process which takes into account the many changes that have taken place in a complex international scene .  
That will be in line with our policy of continuing to hold a series of multifaceted regional and international conferences and exhibitions in the cultural , social , economic , political and environmental fields .  
The Ecuadorian State is committed to following this line of conduct and to promoting and protecting all human , civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , including the right to development .  
Such enhanced and diverse contributions , in the framework of a world consensus , could spare the international community any accusation of negligence , double standards or bias towards a single cultural concept .  
Inasmuch as Europe Eastern and Western has been the main partner with Egypt in trade transactions , tourist flows and cultural interactions , so has Egypt been and will continue to be a major active party in ensuring stability and regulating a veritable interaction between the European dimension of Mediterranean security and the Mediterranean dimension of European security , in the full meaning of the comprehensive concept of contemporary security . 
Among its primary purposes , the Charter of the United Nations provides for the maintenance of international peace and security ; the fostering between nations of international relations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples ; international cooperation in the economic , social , cultural and humanitarian fields ; and the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all .  
And we all have an obligation to work towards maintaining international peace and security ; achieving international cooperation in solving economic , social , cultural or humanitarian problems ; and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms .  
Not only are large numbers of children killed and injured , but countless others grow up deprived of their material and emotional needs , including the structures that give meaning to social and cultural life .  
Transnational criminal organizations have , in fact , existed for a long time , but the globalization of international relations with regard to the economy , commerce , telecommunications and the rapid progress of technology , as well as the disappearance of ideological blocs , have permitted the activities of transnational criminal organizations to expand and have increased their power to such an extent that they are now a permanent threat to the foundation and internal security of States , to their cultural and artistic heritage and to the environment of the planet .  
Any move in this direction is bound to encourage certain dangerous phenomena that we have been witnessing of late , including legal and illegal emigration from developing to developed countries , that could sow the seeds of social , ethnic and cultural conflict . 
This leads me to say that a country such as Yemen , which mainly depends on foreign aid to carry out its internal policy that is , its economic , social and cultural development has to take into account , in seeking the financial and technical assistance needed to achieve the objectives of the internal policy , certain basic considerations that might seem to others supplementary and not mandatory .  
Convinced of the need effectively to tackle the problems confronting them in this area , they have committed themselves to creating an economic , social , political , cultural and ecological environment that is conducive to social development , as well as to giving priority to national and international policies and initiatives aimed at eliminating poverty , promoting employment , combating unemployment and fostering social integration .  
The Summit \ x { e5b8 } future-oriented outlook , as reflected in the Declaration \ x { e5b8 } principles and goals , was a commitment to a political , economic , ethical and spiritual vision for social development , which , in addition to the principles I have just referred to , called for full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of people .  
We are aware that the issue of social development can not be separated from the major transformations taking place today at the political , economic and cultural levels and that , therefore , any answers must be based on a realistic view of the social situation and the economic circumstances of development .  
The collective campaign of the world community to define , promote and protect human rights across the globe represents a great achievement of humanity at large and needs to be cherished by all ; however , the imperative of a balanced approach to all aspects of human rights , whether civil , political , economic , social or cultural , should not be theoretically underestimated or practically neglected .  
Despite doubts expressed at the session concerning its non-binding character , an international code of ethics for dealers , together with such existing codes for some dealers ' associations , could serve as a tool in the future in drawing a distinction between the licit and illicit trade in cultural objects and will provide guidance for transactions in ambiguous situations .  
The sanctions imposed on Iraq and the foreign interference in its domestic affairs have given rise to clandestine excavations that have enabled their organizers to appropriate and sell cultural property and rare art objects of inestimable value , as well as manuscripts and antique books .  
This problem is of particular significance to Korea , as numerous Korean cultural objects have been pillaged and illegally transferred abroad during our country \ x { e5b8 } history of political turmoil , especially in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century .  
Similarly , we note in the report the entry into force of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law ( UNIDROIT ) Convention and of the efforts to improve existing international conventions for the protection of world cultural properties and agree that our central goal should be increasing the number of ratifications and providing technical assistance to States with acute problems of illicit trafficking in archaeological objects , as well as aiding countries experiencing armed conflicts .  
We share the views of the representative of the Getty Information Institute on the need to rely on some standardized , basic method of exchanging information on stolen cultural property and on the importance of having precise information about such property , as well as the conclusion that only through closer cooperation between private organizations and the public sector , at both the national and the international level , will we be able to curb this illicit traffic .

In the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , 5 it is acknowledged that the family plays a key role in social development and , as such , should be strengthened , with attention to the rights , capabilities and responsibilities of its members .  Both call for creating an economic , political , social , cultural and legal environment that will enable people to achieve social development .  
The Beijing Platform for Action describes poverty as having various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure a sustainable livelihood ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increasing morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; social discrimination and exclusion ; and lack of participation in decision-making and in civil , social and cultural life .

The aims and objectives of the national youth policy of Indonesia are : ( a ) to help foster Indonesia awareness , identity , solidarity and prosperity among youth ; ( b ) to promote policies and programmes relating to youth as an integral part of social and cultural values among the Asian and Pacific nations ; and ( c ) to realize the potential of youth as human resources in regional development .  
This youth policy is coordinated on an inter-ministerial basis and involves two major non-governmental organizations : the National Union of Syrian Students ( with a membership composed of students in universities , postgraduate studies and higher and intermediate institutes ) and the Revolutionary Youth Union ( with a membership of over 1.5-million composed of young workers , rural youth , students with both political and non-political backgrounds , including social , economic , vocational , cultural , touristic , athletic and artistic . 
In section II of the Manila Declaration adopted by that meeting ( see A / 51 / 293 , annex ) , youth were affirmed the right to play an active part in all aspects of the social , economic , political , educational , cultural , spiritual and moral life as partners in the development of society .

Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
Her Government 's approach to advancing gender equality was based on the recognition that gender was a factor in the nation 's current social , economic , cultural and political systems and that the unequal status of women had its genesis in and was perpetuated by systemic causes . 
There is also discrimination with regard to the effective enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights as well as civil and political rights , by other ethnic groups , in flagrant violation of articles 2.2 , 2.3 , 3 , 4 and 5 of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , adopted by General Assembly resolution 47 / 135 .  
I also consider it important to note that , at its substantive session of 1995 , the Economic and Social Council approved the report of the Commission on Sustainable Development on the work of its third session , in which , in its discussion of progress in implementing Agenda 21 , the Commission recognized that mountain ecosystems and environments are of crucial importance as rich and unique centres of biological and cultural diversity , water stores and sources of minerals . 
Its cultural and linguistic ties with both the United States and Europe , its geographical proximity to the United States mainland and its weak institutional structures contribute to the continued use of the Caribbean subregion as a major transit point in international drug trafficking .

Attention was drawn to the frequent emphasis placed by international forums on the indivisibility , interdependence and interrelatedness of all human rights , be they civil , political , economic , social or cultural .  
The adoption of a protocol in respect of an instrument that contained civil and political , as well as economic , social and cultural human rights , would constitute an important step towards the actual realization of that principle .  
Deeply concerned about discrimination against the girl child and the violation of the rights of the girl child , which often result in less access for girls to education , nutrition , physical and mental health care and to girls enjoying fewer rights , opportunities and benefits of childhood and adolescence than boys and often being subjected to various forms of cultural , social , sexual and economic exploitation and to violence and harmful practices such as incest , early marriage , female infanticide , prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation ,  
Housing , being the most important single investment in the life of the majority of the world 's population , should not be considered only in its aspect of physical shelter , but should be given full consideration as the most important element of family life where all social , economic , cultural and political activities begin and are sustained .

Since 1968 , one of the Government 's priorities has been to put an end to all the manifestations of administrative corruption , which were widespread during previous eras , through the promulgation of numerous decrees and the adoption of effective measures to enable the Iraqi people to enjoy their economic , social and cultural rights .  
It should be noted that while ethnic and religious identities have not played a significant role in the conflict , there has been a feeling in the northern and central parts of the country that their economic and cultural interests have been neglected by the Government .  
The criteria for sustainable development should include better protection of all human rights : civil , cultural , economic , political and social , as well as protection of the most vulnerable and impoverished .  
The holistic approach to human rights requires , however , that particular attention be paid to the areas of human rights which are currently in a weaker position : from a global perspective , economic , social and cultural rights require further attention in determining their contents and strengthening the means and methods of their realization . 
On the basis of a comprehensive review of the activities of the Programme , the High Commissioner has developed the following policy orientation : the Programme focuses on countries in transition to democracy and less developed countries ; priority consideration is given to programmes addressing mandates emanating from the Vienna Declaration and Plan of Action and from resolutions of United Nations organs , such as strengthening national capacities for the promotion and protection of human rights , the promotion of economic , social and cultural rights , developing national plans of action , and building national institutions .  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,

The measures to prevent and control the phenomenon , which need to be elaborated and implemented at the national and international levels , cut across the economic , social , cultural , political and legal fields .  
The Convention on the Rights of the Child being a point of departure to guarantee child rights ; taking into consideration the progressive character of the implementation of certain social , economic and cultural rights as recognized in article 4 of the Convention , the Government of the Kingdom of Swaziland would undertake the implementation of the right to free primary education to the maximum extent of available resources and expects to obtain the cooperation of the international community for its full satisfaction as soon as possible .  
Concerned that the international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected and that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights ,  
Takes into account the Bangkok Declaration wherein it is recognized that while human rights are universal in nature , they must be considered in the context of a dynamic and evolving process of international norm _ setting , bearing in mind the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds ;  
Reaffirms , in accordance with the Amman workshop conclusions , that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu ;  
Stresses that the regional cooperation programme could , inter alia , focus upon the request of Governments concerned , on strengthening the role of national human rights institutions in promoting the progressive realization of economic , social and cultural rights , realizing the right to development , developing methodologies for effective implementation of human rights education , elaborating guidelines for national action plans in the field of human rights , and developing strategies for cooperation on common problems , which should be implemented by drawing upon the expertise within the region to the fullest extent ;  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , continue to persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Reaffirming its objectives as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations of achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
The democratic process in the Syrian Arab Republic was moving ahead steadily , in keeping with international instruments and standards and the historical , cultural , economic and religious background of the country .  
Cuba 's bilateral relationship with Canada had enabled the Cuban delegation to communicate to that countrys representatives the point of view of vast sectors of civil society in Cuba regarding the exercise of human rights by the indigenous population of Canada , particularly their economic , social and cultural rights , in respect of which much progress needed to be made .  
The underlying reason for submitting the draft resolution was the fact that the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights in an increasing number of developing countries had reached alarming proportions and had had adverse economic , social and cultural effects .  
He called on the international community to take effective measures to remove the root causes of hegemonism , the inequitable international economic order , the widening gap between rich and poor countries , and war , poverty and discrimination ; to end the neglect of economic , social and cultural rights , which were of concern to developing countries ; and to implement the long-delayed right to development .  
Recognizing also that there is no single political system or single universal model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples , and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
Recognizing the sovereign right of each State to decide on the development of its private and public sectors , taking into account the comparative advantages of each sector , bearing in mind the economic , social and cultural diversity in the world ,  
Terrorism had been clearly and definitively rejected by the international community because it violated the most basic of human rights , the right to life ; because it mutilated , tortured and violated human minds and bodies ; and because , with its underlying morbid and fascist philosophy , it aimed to paralyse social , political and cultural life and to obstruct the normal exercise of rights and freedoms .  
Saudi Arabia supported the idea of establishing a legislative machinery , under the auspices of the United Nations , that would be capable of elaborating international conventions , taking into due consideration specificities that existed between different social , cultural and juridical settings , so as to reflect mutual trust and cooperation in order to reach an acceptable formula that could be adopted by the international community as a whole .  
Recalling its resolution 1996 / 11 of 11 April 1996 and reaffirming the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , which stated the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,  
Reaffirms that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interrelated , that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis and that , while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
Takes into account the Bangkok Declaration wherein it is recognized that while human rights are universal in nature , they must be considered in the context of a dynamic and evolving process of international norm _ setting , bearing in mind the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds ;  
Reaffirms , in accordance with the Amman workshop conclusions , that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu ;  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination , inter alia against Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , negrophobia , anti _ Semitism and related intolerance continue to persist and even to grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Reaffirms that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interrelated , that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis and that , while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ;

Emphasizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated ; the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis ; while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
Urges all States to eliminate all obstacles to development at all levels , by pursuing the promotion and protection of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights and by implementing comprehensive development programmes at the national level , integrating these rights into development activities , and by promoting effective international cooperation ;  
However , their situation at the regional , national and local levels has worsened as they confront increased discrimination regarding their economic , social , civil and cultural rights .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination , inter alia against Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , negrophobia , anti _ Semitism and related intolerance continue to persist and even to grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination , inter alia against Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , negrophobia , anti _ Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
The main constraints to the promotion of TCDC , as reported by many delegations and agencies , included structural and cultural differences ; lack of financial resources ; insufficient awareness of the benefits and potentials of TCDC ; limited access to information ; inadequate human resources ; and lack of coordination among the various government agencies involved in technical cooperation .  
In the resolution concerning the question of the realization in all countries of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and study of special problems which the developing countries faced in their efforts to achieve those human rights , the Commission called upon States to secure , through national development policies and international cooperation , full respect for economic , social and cultural rights , giving priority to individuals , most often women , living in extreme poverty .  
They were urged to eliminate negative cultural practices and attitudes against girls and to eliminate all forms of discrimination against girls and the root causes of son preference , which resulted in harmful and unethical practices , inter alia , by enacting and enforcing legislation protecting girls from violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , genital mutilation , incest , sexual abuse and exploitation . 
Ten workshops : two annual regional workshops in Asia and the Pacific , for government representatives to discuss human rights issues that require a regional approach and initiatives , such as the establishment of regional arrangements for the protection and promotion of human rights ; two regional training courses in Africa and Asia on economic , social and cultural rights ; two specialized regional training courses in Latin America and Africa for trainers ; and two national training courses for lawyers and judges ; ( iii ) Fellowships .  
In 1998-1999 , ESCWA will continue to enhance regional cooperation and policy coordination and increase awareness of the economic , social , cultural , technological and environmental dimensions of development , promoting the development of technical assistance activities and projects commensurate with the needs and priorities of ESCWA member States .  
Calls for the facilitation of access by all Non-Self-Governing Territories to relevant United Nations programmes whose objectives are the promotion of the social , educational , technical , environmental , cultural and economic well-being of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories to assist in the timely progression of the process of self-determination ;  
With regard to the implementation of article 4 of the Convention , the Committee notes the lack of adequate legislative , administrative and other measures to ensure the full implementation of childrens economic , social and cultural rights to the maximum extent of the State partys available resources , in particular for the most vulnerable children , including girls , children with disabilities , abandoned children , children born out of wedlock , children from single-parent families , children victims of abuse and / or exploitation , and nomadic and refugee children .  
The High Contracting Parties shall cooperate in combating crime , especially organized crime , terrorism in all its forms and manifestations , including criminal acts directed against the safety of maritime navigation , civil aviation and other forms of transport , illegal trafficking in radioactive materials , weapons , narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and contraband , including the illegal transfer across the border of objects of cultural , historical or artistic value .  
The Presidents stressed the need for unconditional respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , the preservation and development , in accordance with universally recognized norms , of the ethnic , linguistic , cultural and religious diversity of all peoples living in the Russian Federation and Ukraine .  
In accordance with the Charter of the United Nations , the Organization aims at the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principles of sovereign equality of all its Members , equal rights and self - determination of peoples and at achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character .  
The importance of the national professional project personnel as the major source of expertise for technical cooperation projects has increased steadily in recent years because of their crucial advantages in transferring national private sector expertise to public institutions , using national talent that could be lost through the brain-drain and cultural compatibility with national work environment .  
Furthermore , under the special General Initiative Fund for Refugee Women , project support is being provided for the training of 100 traditional birth attendants in seven districts of Afghanistan ; for improving the reproductive health of refugee women in Malawi , which includes family planning advisory services , education on sexually transmitted diseases and HIV / AIDS prevention and the addressing of cultural constraints and male attitudes to reproductive health care ; and for an educational video on female genital mutilation in Eritrea and related reproductive health care .  
The representative made clear that Venezuela , as well as the rest of Latin America , was experiencing social , political , economic and cultural transformations that were having a tremendous impact on society , particularly on women , who had seen their incomes and traditional sources of support reduced and their responsibilities expanded .  
The use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel-air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium , like the dumping of other toxic and dangerous chemicals and wastes in the developing countries , violates the rights to life , health , physical security and other human rights , such as economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development .  
They included publication and dissemination of notices of stolen cultural property based on the information received from the national central bureaus of the States members of Interpol , the organization of meetings for police officers and the development of a new international database on stolen cultural objects which , he said , would be operational by the end of 1996 . 
Emphasizing the encouraging results of the regional and national training activities established by UNESCO , in cooperation with the national and international institutions concerned , to improve the implementation of the 1970 Convention on illicit traffic in cultural property ,  
Referring to Recommendation No .  3 of the Committee 's eighth session , in which the Committee invited the Director-General to examine the possibility of establishing an international fund intended to facilitate the restitution of stolen or illicitly exported cultural objects in cases where the countries concerned are unable to meet the related financial costs ,  
Since countries differed in terms of their living conditions , level of development , geographic characteristics and cultural traditions , there could be no uniform standard or model for solving the problems related to human settlements .  
This part of the study , which deals solely with economic , social and cultural rights , concerns all current or recent violations of those rights and of so _ called collective rights such as the right to development and the right to a healthy environment , irrespective of their perpetrators , whether States or their agents , groups of States , national or international private organizations or individuals or groups acting outside the competence of the State .  
The preamble common to the two International Covenants on Human Rights recognizes that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his civil and political rights . 
The 1968 Proclamation of Tehran reaffirmed that human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible ; in the context of that interdependence , the realization of economic , social and cultural rights is of crucial importance for the effective exercise of civil and political rights .  
The General Assembly of the United Nations has also stated that equal attention and urgent consideration should be devoted to the realization , promotion and protection of both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights .  
In its resolution 4 ( XXXIII ) of 21 February 1977 , the Commission on Human Rights stresses the responsibility and duty of all members of the international community to create the necessary conditions for the full realization of economic , social and cultural rights as an essential means of ensuring the real and meaningful enjoyment of civil and political rights and fundamental freedoms .  
It calls upon all States to take prompt and effective measures , both on the national and on the international level , to remove all obstacles to the full realization of economic , social and cultural rights and to promote all actions that will secure the enjoyment of the said rights .  
During the discussions on methods of implementing economic , social and cultural rights , an implementation that necessitates a certain level of economic development and material support , the representatives of several developing countries expressed the fear that the inevitably slow progress in realizing those rights might be taken for unwillingness on their part . 
It was soon observed afterwards that the fears of the former and the hypocrisy of the latter very rapidly became a source of massive and grave violations of economic , social and cultural rights and of collective rights such as the right to development and the right to a healthy environment .  
Article 22 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights specifies that Everyone . . . is entitled to realization , through national effort and international cooperation . . . of the economic , social and cultural rights indispensable for his dignity and the free development of his personality .  
While it is true that many studies have been made of economic , social and cultural rights and of collective rights such as the right to development and the right to a healthy environment from the point of view of their history , legal basis , regulation or scope , there have been very few on ways of combating violations of them .  
This definition is applicable to civil and political rights , as well as economic , social and cultural rights , and also to collective or communal rights .  
Article 1 , paragraph 3 , stipulates that one of the Purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion .  
It is for the State and the international community to organize the political and legal framework needed to undertake , with any chance of success , the campaign against impunity for violations of economic , social or cultural rights , whether individual or collective .  
The scope of this report is too narrow for a detailed description of the numerous serious violations of rights of all kinds , whether civil and political or economic , social or cultural , considered either collectively or individually .  
It was erected into a system of government and applied for about a century accompanied by violations of human rights , both economic , social and cultural rights and civil and political rights .  
In its resolution 1992 / 50 on the fraudulent or unlawful enrichment of top State officials , the Commission on Human Rights pointed clearly to the responsibility of the North in connection with the commission of that crime in the countries of the South and thus raised the question , still unclear in international law , of the restitution to despoiled peoples , for reinvestment in local economic , social and cultural development , of the funds which their leaders have extorted from them , usually with the complicity of foreign banks .  
The practices and procedures outlined above have a negative impact on the economic , social and cultural rights of individuals and also on collective or communal rights ( right to development and right to a healthy environment ) .  
These collective or communal rights are to individual economic , social and cultural rights what democracy and the rule of law are to civil and political rights .  
While producing their own negative effects on the enjoyment of human rights in general and economic , social and cultural rights in particular , these phenomena have multiplier effects which also exacerbate the increasingly serious and numerous problems faced by the populations of poor regions .  
Any transaction for the transfer of wastes is a serious violation of the right to a healthy environment and , quite obviously , of the whole set of human rights , whether individual or collective , economic , social and cultural or civil and political .  
Although applying the procedures of an optional protocol would not give the Committee any jurisdictional authority , it would provide an opportunity through regular reports and individual communications to submit useful recommendations to the States parties and would make a major contribution to the campaign against impunity for violations of economic , social and cultural rights .  
In many cases , those responsible for violations of economic , social and cultural rights and of the collective rights with an economic content such as the right to development or the right to a healthy environment , are sometimes international entities applying policies which constitute veritable sources of large-scale and serious violations of collective and individual rights in the countries with weak economies .  
In view of the massive and systematic violations of which the third-world peoples have been victims in the recent past , such as slavery , colonization and cultural looting , it is obvious that there could only be a global remedy , the purpose of which is to re-establish these peoples in their communal rights by returning to them the goods of which they have been unlawfully dispossessed .  
This approach would make it possible to eliminate several sources of violations of economic , social and cultural rights ; ( b ) Violations of economic , social and cultural rights could be declared international crimes that are consequently subject to the principles of universal jurisdiction and imprescriptibility , so that they can be punished at any time and in any place .  
The international community and States should take all the necessary measures to protect the rights of vulnerable segments of the population and give very serious consideration to holding a large _ scale discussion on the practice of embargoes and economic sanctions which are imposed on States and have adverse consequences for the realization of the economic , social and cultural rights of the segments concerned ;  
In addition , such human settlements provide equal opportunity for a productive and freely chosen livelihood ; equal access to economic resources , including the right to inheritance , the ownership of land and other property , credit , natural resources and appropriate technologies ; equal opportunity for personal , spiritual , religious , cultural and social development ; equal opportunity for participation in public decision-making ; equal rights and obligations with regard to the conservation and use of natural and cultural resources ; and equal access to mechanisms to ensure that rights are not violated .  
Also deeply concerned about the rising illicit cultivation of narcotic crops and illicit production of and trafficking in drugs , which pose the main threat to the political , economic , social and cultural structure and stability of the region ,  
Observers presented examples of cases where , in their opinion , persons belonging to minorities were unable to participate effectively in cultural , religious , social , economic and public life and where their participation in decision _ making at the national and regional levels was limited .  
Ms . Estebanez said that the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages of the Council of Europe had established undertakings on the part of States aimed at the protection of the languages of historical or regional minorities in Europe , through comprehensive treatment of linguistic minority issues in the areas of : education ; the use of minority languages in dealings with the administrative authorities and public services and in administrative proceedings ; cultural activities ; economic and social life ; and trans-border contacts .  
Considering that the dedication of a year to the act of giving thanks gives us the opportunity to remember the fundamental importance of cultural diversity in the development of a rich and harmonious International life and that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as expressed in its Charter , is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems in economic , social , cultural and humanitarian areas without creating any distinctions for reasons of race , sex , language or religion ,  
The High Contracting Parties shall actively cooperate in measures to combat organized and international crime , illegal drug-trafficking , terrorism and illegal acts directed against the safety of maritime navigation and civil aviation , and the illegal export of cultural values .  The High Contracting Parties shall conclude separate agreements on cooperation in these and other questions of mutual interest .  
Traditional cultural , social and religious values and practices had reinforced the lower status which society accorded to women and had restricted their opportunities for education , technical and vocational training and employment , thereby limiting their participation in the overall development process .  
The Ministers acknowledged the actions undertaken by the organs of the Community to implement the decisions and recommendations that had emanated from the Conference of Heads of State and Government and from the Council of Ministers , in conformity with the general guidelines contained in the Constitutive Declaration and the Statutes , in order to promote cooperation in the cultural , economic , social , scientific and legal / institutional fields , as well as to enhance political and diplomatic coordination .  
Mindful that in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action ( A / CONF . 157 / 23 ) the World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , reaffirmed that the human person was the central subject of development and underlined the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without discrimination as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the Purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Recognizing the profound spiritual , cultural , social and economic relationship that indigenous peoples have to their total environment and the urgent need to respect and recognize the rights of indigenous peoples to their lands , territories and resources ,  
Recognizing that United Nations organs and Member States have increasingly acknowledged that lands and natural resources are essential to the Economic and cultural survival of indigenous peoples , and that some States have enacted legal measures that uphold indigenous land rights or have established procedures for arriving at legally binding agreements on indigenous land _ related issues ,  
These conflicts have underlying causes which arise from a number of accumulated and complex political , commercial , socio-economic , ethnic , cultural and ideological factors .  
Guided by the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations , particularly Article 1 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter , which stipulates that one of the Purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion ,  
Scientific , technical and cultural progress and the information revolution of the past decade had made the mass media an important instrument and a true reflection of current international realities in places , especially in developing countries , undergoing civil wars and conflicts .  
In addition to the exodus from the countryside and chaotic urbanization , problems common to all developing countries , Lebanon encountered other difficulties : the destruction of housing and infrastructure ; the collapse of economic and cultural institutions ; the displacement of more than 100,000 families ; an unbalanced geographical distribution of the population ; a rise in unemployment ; the devastation of arable land ; stagnation in industry , tourism and commerce ; frequent human rights violations ; a breakdown of social and moral values ; growing drug use ; and increasing juvenile crime . 
On the contrary , the international community should provide a coherent and effective response , incorporating preventive diplomacy , political mediation , humanitarian relief , social action , economic alternatives and cultural communication .  
The Islamic Republic of Iran , as a Member of the United Nations and a concerned State , while reiterating the principle of the inalienable right of States to choose their political , social , cultural and economic systems , calls upon the Member States to resist such unlawful actions and to make every effort to eliminate their adverse impacts ; and thus preserve the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , in particular those pertaining to national sovereignty , political independence , territorial integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States .  
The Platform for Action adopted at the Conference was established as a powerful tool for the empowerment of women , aimed at removing all the obstacles to womens active participation in public and private life by promoting their full and equal participation in economic , social , cultural and political decision-making processes .  
The civil society , including those involved in its political , economic , social and cultural life , needs to be fully engaged to promote democratic principles and harmony between the society , the individual and the environment as a basis for a culture of peace .  
After welcoming the preliminary report on the impunity of perpetrators of human rights violations ( economic , social and cultural rights ) ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1994 / 11 and Corr . 1 ) , the Sub _ Commission decided ( resolution 1994 / 34 ) to split the study in two , entrusting Mr . Joinet with the aspect of civil and political rights and Mr . El Hadji Guiss with that of economic , social and cultural rights .  
Leaders thanked the Prime Minister of the Cook Islands for his presentation on the Forum theme of reform , human values and togetherness and discussed how reforms aimed at achieving sustainable development should go beyond conventional economic dimensions to embrace the essentially holistic nature of the process , and took cognizance of the need for Pacific cultural values and norms to be the basic premise and foundation of this process and the work of regional institutions .  
Iraq is a developing country that is suffering greatly as a result of the coercive economic policies and measures exemplified in the complete economic embargo imposed on it more than seven years ago that affect the health of the Iraqi people and every aspect of its economic , social and cultural life .  
Given a wide variety of types of sanctions , all cases were divided into three categories : ( a ) limited , that is , minor financial , export , cultural or travel sanctions ; ( b ) moderate , that is , broader trade or financial sanctions ; and ( c ) extensive , that is , comprehensive trade and financial sanctions .  
The principle of the indivisibility of universally recognized civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights continues to be a key element of today 's system for the promotion and protection of human rights and freedoms .  
Similarly , the promise to provide a decent living to all has been threatened by the negative effects of globalization and the inadequate attention given to economic , social and cultural rights .  
The United Nations must view all human rights civil , political , economic , social and cultural as universal , indivisible , interdependent , interrelated and embedded in the trinity of democracy , development and human rights .  
In the view of the speakers , national and international responses are required to make globalization an overall positive development so that the quality of life both economic welfare and the enjoyment of cultural heritage of all people may be improved .  
Like the undeniable truths incorporated into the founding documents of my country , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides for the civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights that are the unquestionable birthright of all people .  
Recalling these words , spoken 50 years ago , reminds us that human rights civil , cultural , economic , political and social are indivisible .  
For Malaysia , as a developing country , economic , social and cultural rights , articulated through the larger framework of the right to development , are as important as civil and political rights .  
Most of the tensions , crises and conflicts that we witness are caused first and foremost by situations that have their source in serious violations of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and in overt or covert attempts to deprave democracy .  
Be adapted to the specific legal , social , economic , ecological and cultural conditions prevalent in a given project region ;  
The seminar should not forget people living in rural and outlying regions ; access to the Internet must be given to everyone everywhere , all rights _ economic , social and cultural , not only civil and political _ must be respected .  
Alternative development programmes should be adapted to the specific , legal , social , economic , ecological and cultural conditions prevalent in a given project region .  
The Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights had to some extent neglected the civil and political parts , assuming that its work fell solely in the other area of economic , social and cultural rights .  
The new constitutional provisions in Finland extended legal protection beyond traditional civil and political rights to economic , social and cultural rights , which are directly applicable in courts of justice and before other authorities .  
Adoption of the optional protocol would be a powerful signal in favour of economic , social and cultural rights , a sign that the international community wants to take them seriously and put the two types of rights on an equal footing .  
At the World Summit , the international community acknowledged that the equal rights of girls and the equal participation of women in the social , cultural , economic and political life of societies is a prerequisite for successful and sustainable development .

Recognizing that democracy , development and respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing , and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives , * In accordance with rule 69 , paragraph 3 , of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council .  
Notes that the realization of all human rights _ civil , cultural , economic , political and social , including the right to development _ are indispensable to human dignity and the full development of human potential and are also integral to democratic society ;  
Urges all States to eliminate all obstacles to development at all levels , by pursuing the promotion and protection of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights and by implementing comprehensive development programmes at the national level , integrating these rights into development activities , and by promoting effective international cooperation ;  
They are guaranteed the right to establish and use their own mass media , cultural , educational , language and religious institutions , and to establish and foster unhindered relations and maintain peaceful contacts with co-nationals outside the Yugoslav borders , as well as the right to participate at the national , regional and local levels .  
That , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy their economic , social and cultural rights , as well as their civil and political rights ;  
That the realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms , and particularly economic , social and cultural rights , is a dynamic process and that , as is evident in today 's world , a great deal remains to be accomplished ;  
To secure progressively , through national development policies and with international assistance and cooperation , full realization of economic , social and cultural rights , giving particular attention to the individuals , most often women and children , especially girls , and communities living in extreme poverty and therefore most vulnerable and disadvantaged ;  
To consider in this context , as appropriate , the desirability of drawing up national action plans identifying steps to improve the situation of human rights in general with specific benchmarks designed to give effect to minimum essential levels of enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights ;  
Recalling also that the eradication of widespread poverty , including its most persistent forms , and the full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights and civil and political rights remain interrelated goals ,  
Deeply concerned that , 51 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries in the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness are particularly severe in developing countries ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of the country ;  
Several participants emphasized that criteria used in certification schemes should meet or exceed minimum national standards , where they exist , and should include social , cultural and economic aspects as well as environmental considerations .  
In discussing integrated coastal zone management , participants agreed that there were real biophysical limits to capacity in any particular location as well as cultural limits that should be determined at the local level by the local community .  
Recognizing that democracy , development and respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing , and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
Notes that the realization of all human rights _ civil , cultural , economic , political and social , including the right to development _ are indispensable to human dignity and the full development of human potential and are also integral to democratic society ;  
Believing that every woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social ,  
the same emphasis , and that , while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination against , inter alia , Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , Negrophobia , anti-Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Urges all States to eliminate all obstacles to development at all levels , by pursuing the promotion and protection of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights and by implementing comprehensive development programmes at the national level , integrating these rights into development activities , and by promoting effective international cooperation ;  
The need for greater understanding of the genesis of conflicts was stressed , and while it was recognized that unique circumstances might differentiate conflicts , certain causes dearth of visionary leadership ; absence of good governance , especially transparency and accountability ; neglect of human rights ; pervasive poverty ; inequitable distribution of wealth and resources ; and social and cultural exclusion which breeds ethnic clashes are common to all .  
To take strong and appropriate action , through the development and enforcement of specific legislation / measures , against any kind of illegal , abusive or exploitative tourist activity , including sexual exploitation / abuse , in recognition of the fact that such activities have particularly adverse impacts and pose significant social , health and cultural threats , and that all countries have a role to play in the efforts to stamp them out ;  
To provide relevant direction on research activities , and collect and disseminate information on best practices and techniques , including an appropriate mix of instruments to minimize negative and to promote positive environmental , social and cultural impacts from tourism in developed and developing countries and in countries with economies in transition ;  
To replace operative paragraph 3 by the following text , to be included in operative paragraph 2 as a new item ( i ) : ' The full promotion of all human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social , as well as the right to development ; ' .  
The Committee reaffirms that the Convention recognizes that womens rights include civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and that they are an inalienable , integral and indivisible part of universal human rights .  
Further escalation of military action , barbaric bombings of industrial , social , cultural and civilian targets and the peaceful population are all assuming horrible proportions .  
The strategic framework is to comprise integrated and coordinated actions for addressing any combination of political , military , humanitarian , human rights , environmental , economic , social , cultural and demographic factors .  
The Committee reiterates its previous recommendation that if measures are taken to incorporate civil and political rights treaty obligations in the Icelandic legal system , similar measures should be taken simultaneously in respect of economic , social and cultural rights .  
The precise meaning of adequacy is to a large extent determined by prevailing social , economic , cultural , climatic , ecological and other conditions , while sustainability incorporates the notion of long-term availability and accessibility .  
Concluding observations of the Committee on Economic , 1 .  The Committee considered the state of implementation by Solomon Islands of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Covenant at its 9th meeting held on 30 April 1999 ( twentieth session ) and adopted , at its 24th meeting , held on 11 May 1999 , the following concluding observations .  
Its activities may include monitoring compliance with specific rights recognized under the Covenant and providing reports thereon to the public authorities and civil society , and examining complaints alleging infringements of applicable economic , social and cultural rights standards within the State .  
With respect to the general framework within which human rights are protected and promoted , the Committee considers an independent judiciary to be an essential instrument for the protection of economic , social and cultural rights and therefore requests that information be included on the matter in the third periodic report .  
Although globalization is driving the current economic and sociological evolution of the industrialized world , regional cultural identity still represents an extraordinarily strong force in the world .  
States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , [ cultural , ] administrative , technical [ or any other ] opportunities for criminal organizations to commit [ profitable crimes ] [ any punishable offence ] and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
WFDY is a broad international non-governmental youth organization which brings together national youth organizations with diverse cultural , religious and social , economic and political systems .  
The parties expressed optimism about the prospects for expanding bilateral political , economic , commercial , scientific , technical and cultural ties .  
They have done so in the context of the urgent need for understanding by non-indigenous societies of the spiritual , social , cultural , economic and political significance to indigenous societies of their lands , territories and resources for their continued survival and vitality .  
At present , it is safe to say that the use of judicial mechanisms may be risky because of the problem of different interpretive tools , the subjective and highly political nature of these State-chartered forums , and continuing cultural biases demonstrated by Governments .  
This includes the right to maintain , protect and develop the past , present and future manifestations of their cultures , such as archaeological and historical sites , artifacts , designs , ceremonies , technologies and visual and performing arts and literature , as well as the right to the restitution of cultural , intellectual , religious and spiritual property taken without their free and informed consent or in violation of their laws , traditions and customs .  
Pursuant to agreement with the indigenous peoples concerned , just and fair compensation shall be provided for any such activities and measures taken to mitigate adverse environmental , economic , social , cultural or spiritual impact .  
In conclusion , the Committees proposal for an additional regular session to be held in New York is driven by a commitment to the interdependence and indivisibility of all rights , as well as a recognition of the renewed interest in economic , social and cultural rights which is evident in the work of the United Nations human rights system .  
While they may mean different things to different people , 29 / depending on their philosophical , ideological , political , cultural , social and economic perspectives , all agree that the expression a democratic society referred to in the Universal Declaration and in both International Covenants 30 / is a vital concept for human rights based on common values shared by human beings throughout the world community .  
A democratic society , moreover , whatever may be the cultural , political , social and economic framework in which it is achieved , is identified by certain principles and institutions , such as pluralism , the rule of law , legitimacy , political equality , popular control and public accountability of government , which , again , have their starting point in human rights and freedoms .  
Concerning bilateral issues , President Eyadma and President Taylor expressed satisfaction at the excellent relations of friendship , brotherhood , cooperation and solidarity between their two countries and decided to work to strengthen those relations at all levels , especially in the political , economic , commercial and cultural spheres , in the interest of their respective peoples .  
The aggressor 's daily targets are national parks , nature reservations , monuments of cultural and natural heritage , rare and protected plants and animal species , among which are those of international importance .  
Activities include coordination meetings and electronic discussions on the planning of cooperative activities and sharing of experience , support for subregional training courses , pilot projects on the application of telematics for development in sectors of public concern , and promotion of the African content of the World Wide Web for educational , scientific , social and cultural development .  
It will continue to cooperate fully over the coming years , as it has done in connection with the preparations for this Conference , in order to ensure that the results achieved with regard to the main economic , social and cultural interests involved in the use of outer space can be applied for the benefit of all .  
It was the first instrument in the world to set forth a list of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ( author 's emphasis ) . 
As a result of the compromise reached , Article 1 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter of the United Nations defines one of the Organization 's purposes as being to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion .  
Considering further that the States Members of the United Nations , by adopting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , reaffirmed their commitment to the observance of fundamental human rights , their faith in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women , and their determination to promote , in cooperation with the United Nations , the universal observance of civil and political as well as economic , social and cultural rights ,  
The issue under discussion involves both conceptual as well as empirical dimensions , some of which are already under consideration by the Sub _ Commission and the Commission on Human Rights . 17 / It also involves both categories of human rights , viz . , the civil and political , and the economic , social and cultural . 
At its forty _ fifth session , the Sub _ Commission , in its resolution 1993 / 40 , decided to entrust Mr . Asbjrn Eide with the task of producing a preparatory document on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights , and income distribution , at both national and international levels , taking also into account matters related to the realization of the right to development .  
At its forty _ eighth session , the Sub _ Commission , in its resolution 1996 / 26 , welcomed the provisional report on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights , and income distribution , prepared by the Special Rapporteur , Mr . Jos Bengoa ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1996 / 14 ) , and requested the Special Rapporteur to submit his final report to the Sub _ Commission at its forty _ ninth session .  
At its fifty _ fifth session , the Commission on Human Rights , in its resolution 1999 / 53 , decided that the Sub _ Commission should further review , in the light of the ongoing discussions by the Commission on its working methods , the establishment of a forum on economic , social and cultural rights , to be called the Social Forum , to meet during its annual sessions with the following objectives :  
These effects also included the extinction ( or substantial reduction ) of their territorial base and undermined their political , economic , juridical , cultural and social order in general , and even their survival as a distinct society .  
The Special Rapporteur further recommends State authorities not to take up or continue to engage in development projects that may impair the environment of indigenous lands and / or adversely affect their traditional economic activities , religious ceremonies or cultural heritage , without previously commissioning the appropriate ecological studies to determine the actual negative impact those projects will have .  
Governments at local , regional and national levels should recognize the role of multiple identities in contributing to open communities and in establishing useful distinctions between public institutional structures and cultural identities ;  
The content of adequacy is to some extent determined by prevailing social , economic , cultural , climatic , ecological and other conditions , but there are some core elements which are applicable under all circumstances and are spelled out in greater detail by the Committee .  
In its concluding observations regarding Guatemala ( E / C . 12 / 1 / Add . 3 of 28 May 1996 ) the Committee expressed serious concern at the adverse effects of the economic and social disparities on the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights by the majority of the population , particularly by the indigenous and rural populations of Guatemala .  
While on the one hand every Government should remove obstacles blocking development within its State , such as failure to observe civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , effective international cooperation is essential in providing developing countries with appropriate means and facilities to foster their comprehensive development , in accordance with the Declaration on the Right to Development .  
The precise meaning of adequacy is to a large extent determined by prevailing social , economic , cultural , climatic , ecological and other conditions , while sustainability incorporates the notion of long-term availability and accessibility .  
The United Arab Emirates , which has endeavoured to achieve complete development , has taken into account population questions and other essential issues , which should be based on justice and equality , respect for religious beliefs and acceptance of cultural , educational and economic traditions of every country so that we can achieve universal development .  
recommendations included in the ICPD Programme of Action , and those included in the document to be issued at the end of this session , is the sovereign right of each country , consistent with national laws and developmental priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its people , and in conformity with relevant and universally recognized covenants and agreements . 
The implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action and those contained in the present document is the sovereign right of each country , consistent with national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its people , and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights .  6 .  The Programme of Action recommended a set of interdependent quantitative goals and objectives .  
Within the framework of respect for human rights and strengthening democracy , the Bolivian State intends to continue seeking alternative models for dealing with sexual and reproductive health within the context of the social , economic , political and cultural factors that come into play in health matters .  
Thanks to this law , the enforcement and development of a private medical-care system part of the national policy on the population 's medical care will pay special attention to women 's health , which is far more sensitive to social and economic changes and to political , cultural and psychological factors . 
The Cairo Programme of Action , which was the outcome of a delicate compromise made in the face of diverse and even diverging cultural , religious and philosophical values , is the expression of our common will to go beyond diversity and seek together relevant responses to the challenges of sustainable development from the perspective of population , which is certainly the most powerful factor determining the economic and social progress of nations . 
In addition to providing basic services for our society and improving economic performance , the challenges of the future will make it necessary to build bridges across generations and create a more understanding and progressive cultural milieu in which young and old together embrace the new values of our evolving societies while respecting the traditions that we have inherited from our forefathers . 
Our main objectives are to eradicate absolute poverty , increase access to basic education for girls , eliminate gender disparities , increase access to reproductive health care , and reduce cultural and legal barriers that discriminate against women and girls , as well as to reduce maternal and infant mortality rates .  
It is aimed at addressing a range of interrelated challenges , protecting individual social and economic rights and human rights in general , providing legal protections and creating conditions to protect the cultural , spiritual and intellectual interests of our people .  
Quality of life is determined not simply by material goods , but is made up of a whole set of simultaneously interwoven factors : health , education , employment , elimination of poverty , respect of human rights , the possibility of self-fulfilment , social and cultural integration and living in an ecologically enlightened environment .  
These obstacles are : in the social sphere , religious and cultural diversity ; and in the economic area , a steady decline in official development assistance , the excessive burden of foreign debt , deterioration in the terms of trade and the difficulties of gaining access to the international markets for our goods .  
To redress these acts of violence and prevent a forcible and illegal occupation of other institutions of national culture , it is necessary that the international security force ( KFOR ) take immediate and effective action , including physical protection , of the following cultural institutions , so that they may continue regular work :  
Similarly , the ILO / UNESCO recommendation concerning the Status of Teachers states in its Guiding Principles that education from the earliest school years should be directed to the all _ round development of the human personality and to the spiritual , moral , social , cultural and economic progress of the community , as well as to the inculcation of deep respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
When one studies traditional practices , in particular female genital mutilation , it must first be noted that they are rooted in a whole set of beliefs , values , cultural and social behaviour patterns governing the lives of the societies concerned .  
The Special Rapporteur calls on all countries with large inflows of immigrants to develop and put into effect programmes to combat harmful traditional practices in accordance with their national laws and international standards , but always with due respect for the cultural values of the migrant population groups and without denigrating their cultures or treating the societies concerned with disdain or an air of superiority .  
The Convention favours an integrated approach to those rights , avoiding the categorization of rights that , in previous decades , had separated civil and political rights on the one hand , and economic , social and cultural rights on the other .  
Mexico thus considers that the promotion of knowledge of outer space and its technological applications should be encouraged both nationally and internationally , as part of the cultural heritage of present and future generations , fostering a comprehensive and integrated vision of the environment and a greater awareness of the potential uses of this resource and the need to preserve it .  
Recognizing that States have developed different cultural and historical uses for firearms and that the purpose of enhancing international cooperation to eradicate illicit transnational trafficking in firearms is not to discourage or diminish lawful leisure or recreational activities such as travel or tourism for sport shooting , hunting and other forms of lawful ownership and use of firearms that are recognized by States Parties ,  
Concrete projects that create jobs , open new avenues for economic cooperation , provide the chance to share cultural experience or offer more balanced media coverage work both to break down psychological barriers and to create a vested interest in a shared , peaceful and prosperous future together .  
Member States should cooperate , as a matter of urgency , to ensure that future space activities that would cause potentially harmful interference with the scientific research or natural , cultural and ethical values of other nations ( para .  73 ) are subjected to an environmental impact assessment and international consultations before approval ;  
For the purposes of the present Convention , the term " discrimination against women " shall mean any distinction , exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition , enjoyment or exercise by women , irrespective of their marital status , on a basis of equality of men and women , of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural , civil or any other field .  
Most Libyan legislative acts are directed at all citizens , irrespective of their sex , and prescribe the body of rights which they enjoy in the political , functional , economic , social , cultural , health and educational fields , without discrimination between men and women , being fundamental rights that are intrinsic to human beings , whether male or female .  
Potential barriers , whether cultural and organizational , political and legal , technical and programmatic or economic , needed to be identified and then removed or minimized .  
Japan , from the first days of its aggression against Korea , especially during the nearly half a century-long period of its military occupation of and colonial rule over Korea from the early twentieth century , pillaged and destroyed a considerable amount of valuable cultural property , which the Korean people had handed down with utmost care generation after generation .  
The meeting assessed the cooperation between the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields as outlined in General Assembly resolution 53 / 8 .  
The definition and promotion of concepts for a flexible technical infrastructure , adaptable to health services in different economic and cultural environments , including developing countries , and based on a clear vision of the existing and the emerging growth of telecommunications and information-processing capabilities ;  
The NGO community , which has contributed enormously to strengthening the human rights regime , especially regarding civil and political rights , is now moving enthusiastically to operate at the grass _ roots level to deliver economic , social and cultural rights .  
The adoption by the United Nations in 1986 of the Declaration on the Right to Development was the culmination of a long process of international deliberation on human rights which were perceived from the very beginning as an integrated whole of all civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
After that , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 clearly recognized the unity of all those rights and elaborated the theme , as noted later in the preamble to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that , the ideal of free human beings enjoying civil and political freedom and freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his civil and political rights , as well as his economic , social and cultural rights .  
However , as the years passed , the post-war solidarity gave way to the cold war and instead of one unified covenant , those rights were codified in 1966 in two international covenants - one on civil and political rights , another on economic , social and cultural rights .  
As early as 1968 , the Proclamation of Tehran stated : since human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible , the full realization of civil and political rights without the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights is impossible .  
In 1969 the Declaration on Social Progress and Development further emphasized the interdependence of these two sets of rights , and by the early 1970s the concept of the right to development emerged as a human right that unified in itself the civil and political rights as well as the economic , social and cultural rights .  
The right to development unifies civil and political rights with economic , social and cultural rights into an indivisible and interdependent set of human rights and fundamental freedoms , to be enjoyed by all human beings , without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .  
Civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights have been codified in the International Covenants and ratified by a large number of countries , but the Declaration on the Right to Development does not have the status of a treaty and therefore can not be enforced in a legal system .  
The economic , social and cultural rights , on the other hand , required to be protected through positive action over time , which would consume resources , and since resources were always limited , the realization of these rights would naturally be constrained .  
It states : The right to Development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
Then , there is a process of economic , social , cultural and political development , which is recognized as one in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
In addition , States are required , by article 6 , paragraph 3 , to take steps to eliminate obstacles to development resulting from failure to observe civil and political rights as well as economic , social and cultural rights , because the implementation , promotion and protection of these rights would be essential for realizing the right to development , as all human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ( art . 6 , para .  2 ) .  
To appreciate fully the emphasis the Declaration puts on international cooperation , article 4 should be read in conjunction with the opening sentence of the preamble to the Declaration which refers to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations relating to the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural and humanitarian nature , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The importance of the last element derives from the fact that the right to development is a human right , and as such it is interdependent and indivisible with other civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , in the sense that the denial of any one of these rights would tend to deny the right to development itself .  
All representatives endorsed and welcomed the objectives of the Conference , which included promoting the effective means of using space solutions to address problems of regional or global significance ; strengthening the capabilities of Member States , especially developing countries , to use the results of space research for economic and cultural development ; and enhancing international cooperation in space science and technology and its applications . 
Recognizing the importance of space science and space applications for the fundamental knowledge of the universe , education , health , environmental monitoring , management of natural resources , disaster management , meteorological forecasting and climate modelling , satellite navigation and communications , and the major contribution that space science and technology make to the well-being of humanity and specifically to economic , social and cultural development ,  
This shows that the net of international legal commitments relevant for economic , social and cultural rights is fairly wider than would be assumed by considering only the number of ratifications of the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights .  
The complementarity of civil and political rights to economic , social and cultural rights must be fully recognized if the latter are to be implemented in accordance with the needs of people and the actual economic potential of the State .  
For example , the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights has stressed that States parties should recognize the essential role of international cooperation and comply with their commitment to take joint and separate action to achieve the realization of economic , social and cultural rights ( see also paras . 33 and 34 below ) .  
The academic community has assisted the United Nations human rights machinery by , among other things , developing two sets of guidelines known as the Limburg Principles on the Implementation of the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights ( 1986 ) , elaborated in 1997 in the Maastricht guidelines on violations of economic , social and cultural rights .  
For example , guidelines for interviews recently prepared for the Kosovo emergency operation and shared with the partners involved in the field refer to both economic , social and cultural and civil and political rights .  
Independent national human rights institutions , acting in accordance with the 1991 Paris Principles , play an important role in the realization of economic , social and cultural rights at the national level , as was stressed by the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights in its General Comment No . 10 ( 1998 ) .  
The United Nations Development Assistance Framework , which has been designed to provide the format for continuing United Nations teamwork in responding to the development priorities of specific countries , will play an essential role in identifying needs regarding the implementation of economic , social and cultural rights and providing coordinated response to them .  
While further developing close cooperation with regional human rights organizations , the Office intends , therefore , to intensify its programme of cooperation at the regional and subregional level , a significant portion of which will focus on economic , social and cultural rights .  
The meeting held a discussion on economic , social and cultural rights and subsequently recommended that the inter-sessional workshop on the right to development and economic , social and cultural rights should focus , inter alia , on developing quantifiable benchmarks ; identifying obstacles to the realization of these rights ; and proposing relevant actions to strengthen national capacities for the promotion and protection of these rights .  
This is particularly visible with regard to the eradication of poverty , which needs a human rights underpinning , as well as concerning economic , social and cultural rights for which operationalization wavers between an unrealistic expectation that the Government will provide necessary services to all free of charge , and surrender in the face of the combined obstacles of poverty and debt servicing . 
They noted the multifaceted nature of the concept , which combines political , ideological , economic , social , cultural and ethical criteria , and identified its main elements , such as transparency in public administration , accountability , respect for human rights and legality , promotion of democracy and enhanced management of resources . 
Holy See suggested the following text : Full respect for human dignity , human rights and fundamental freedoms , as well as the various religious and ethical values , cultural backgrounds , philosophical convictions of its people , and peace and security , are also crucial for social development . 
There is also concern that the recent emphasis in financial and economic policies has not always been development-oriented , that the dominance of a limited set of macroeconomic targets and parameters over the social , political , cultural and environmental domains has gone too far , and that social and economic policies and objectives must be fully integrated .  
The interaction between population ageing and development is a complex fusion of global patterns in labour and capital markets , government pensions , services , and traditional support systems , which are further shaped by technological change and cultural transformations .  
This search is being guided by the expectation that demographic ageing holds the promise of maturing attitudes and capabilities in social , economic , cultural and spiritual undertakings , and for global peace and development in the next century .  
The increasing pace of globalization and current developments however , have proved that the structures and practices of globalization itself may often , directly and indirectly , be a cause of violations of human rights , not only with regard to economic , social and cultural rights , but also with regard to civil and political rights .  
As a result , the need to ensure the principle of the indivisibility of human rights by directly addressing the existing imbalance between civil and political rights on the one hand , and economic , social and cultural rights on the other , appears to have been neglected .  
Similarly , the creation and establishment of a balanced human rights programme and the need to allocate adequate human and financial resources to capacity building , the right to development , economic , social and cultural rights , technical cooperation etc . , are also missing from the report .  Alternative recommendation 2 : To include the establishment of a balanced human rights programme on the agenda of the working group referred to above .  
While this concern must be addressed , it is important to keep in mind that this concern is being raised at a stage when the creation of special procedures to look at various aspects of civil and political rights is almost complete and a similar exercise has just begun in the field of economic , social and cultural rights .  
According to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , international cooperation should be paramount in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian nature , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all , without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .  
The success of the review of the mechanisms can best be judged by achieving such a balance through concrete proposals , such as assigning equal budgetary and human resources to both civil and political and to economic , social and cultural rights .  
What is therefore required is a developmental approach to human rights , keeping in mind that all human rights are indivisible and the need for adequate importance to be given to economic , social and cultural rights .  
These conflicts have underlying causes which arise from a number of accumulated and complex political , commercial , socio-economic , ethnic , cultural and ideological factors .  
To meet the challenge , the Secretariat has made concerted efforts to move the discourse from a focus on definitions and prescriptive and value judgements to an emphasis on an increased understanding of the social , economic and cultural processes that affect the institution of the family in the performance of its central and irreducible functions in any society .  
With respect to the latter , the last workshop , held in February this year in New Delhi , recommended that an inter-sessional regional workshop on the right to development and economic , social and cultural rights and on steps to be taken in this regard at the national and international levels be organized .  
This does not speak only of a tolerant attitude , but also about a deliberate protection of the separatist-terrorist so-called KLA in order to shun possible responsibility for daily killings , abductions , the destruction and burning of Serbian medieval monasteries and cultural monuments - in which way KFOR becomes practically an accomplice in the great evil against the Serbian people in a flagrant massive violation of human rights and the campaign of ethnic cleansing . 
The rights of Afghan citizens are protected under the Covenants on political and civil , economic , social and cultural rights , the Geneva Conventions and other international instruments to which Afghanistan is a party , and they must be respected .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 53 / 155 of 9 December 1998 , stressed the importance of creating an economic , political , social , cultural and legal environment that will enable people to achieve social development at the national and international levels .  
The UNDP policy document entitled Integrating human rights with sustainable human development embraces a holistic vision integrating all human , civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
My own country of Saint Lucia , and our Eastern Caribbean sister State of Dominica , share special cultural , economic and social ties with the overseas departments of Guadeloupe , Martinique and French Guyana , which represents the political model of integrated status and whose representatives have been present with us here at this Seminar to discuss the intricacies of that political status .  
Other issues examined included : the economic , social and cultural factors that encourage the expectation that women will take care of the elderly ; whether care-giver is a universal female identity ; and widowhood and how it is affected by the economic and demographic changes occurring in different parts of the world .  
Some of them emphasize the increased mobility of factors of production , goods and services across borders and the resultant emergence of a truly global market , others see primarily the results and future potential of an explosive progress in information technology , while still others view globalization primarily from societal and cultural perspectives .

Consolidate the national and multinational cultural reality that confers upon the Portuguese-speaking countries an identity of their own , while reflecting the special character of their relationship and the experience of a fruitful concerted action and cooperation that has been built up over the years ;  
The Statutes of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries summarize the above in three general objectives : concerted action among its members at both the political and diplomatic level , particularly with the aim of asserting their presence in the international forums ; cooperation , particularly in the economic , social , cultural , legal and scientific spheres ; implementation of projects designed to promote and disseminate the Portuguese language .  
We know what these causes of conflict are : the huge gap between the living standards and incomes of different classes and nations ; the exponential increase in mass migration from poor to rich countries ; cultural difference and the conflicts and fanaticism it triggers ; criminal acts for the sake of glorifying or even creating a nation .  
To promote information , education and communication programmes for social mediators , for example , political , religious , educational , cultural , business and union leaders , peer educators , and representatives of non-governmental organizations and the media worldwide , so that they may convey appropriate and accurate messages about drug abuse . 
In this connection , the recommendation of the representative of the Holy See , made during the preparatory process to the Conference against Racism , is very sound : There is a need to go deeper than historical , cultural , political or social contexts and to identify and understand the spiritual and moral dimensions which underlay the universal human condition and in particular those aspects of it leading to abuses of racial discrimination .  
At the national and international levels , unjust economic , social and political systems which really constitute violations of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights contribute to the birth and / or nurturing of extremism .  
This Convention sets universal legal norms which are intended to protect children from insufficient care , ill-treatment and exploitation and to ensure their enjoyment of their fundamental human rights , including the right to survival , development and full participation in social , cultural , educational and other activities .

Expresses its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his continued efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations of the United Nations system and the Organization of the Islamic Conference and its subsidiary organs and specialized and affiliated institutions to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social and cultural fields ;  
Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security , and their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen economic , social , cultural and environmental cooperation in the region ,  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of the need for comprehensive , coherent and effective policies on international migration based on the spirit of genuine partnership and common understanding ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
These challenges called for a holistic approach , as the social , economic , cultural and environmental aspects of development were interdependent , and for more creative international cooperation based on internal democracy , fair external relations and the will to act at the appropriate level depending on the nature of the problem .  
Each actor , whether citizen , NGO , enterprise , State or international organization , respect a holistic and integrated approach and to take into consideration the interdependency of the political , social , economic , cultural and environmental factors of development ;  
The United Nations serve as the framework for political , economic , cultural , environmental and moral dialogue and that full use be made of the regional commissions which were the natural link between global and national concerns .  
One of the fundamental principles of the Programme was that the formulation and implementation of population-related policies is the responsibility of each country and should take into account the economic , social and environmental diversity of conditions in each country , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values , cultural backgrounds and philosophical convictions of its people ( A / CONF . 171 / 13 , article 1.11 ) .  
Item 10 : An open-ended working group established to elaborate policy guidelines on structural adjustment programmes and economic , social and cultural rights ( Commission decision 1999 / 104 , Economic and Social Council decision 1999 / 251 ) is scheduled to meet from 28 February to 10 March 2000 ;  
Conditions which might assist developing countries in addressing poverty issues at the macroeconomic , institutional and policy levels were , respectively , globalization ; the awareness-building role of civil society and the role of the private sector , particularly in creating jobs and spurring rapid economic growth ; and the achievement of a balance between the economic and financial aspects of development and social , cultural and institutional concerns .  
It had also urged Governments and the private sector to increase their support for developing an adequate science and technology capacity through appropriate education and research programmes as an indispensable foundation for economic , social , cultural and environmentally sound development .  
The Non-Self-Governing Territories , most of which were small island Territories , required and deserved the comprehensive support of the international community , which must assist the Territories to fulfil their aspirations to achieve not only political but also economic , social and cultural well-being .  
At subregional level , an Association of Women of West Africa ( currently chaired by Cte dIvoire ) which had been established by countries of the Economic Community of West African States planned to initiate cultural , social , economic and political programmes for advancing the status of women .  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Expresses its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his continued efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations of the United Nations system and the Organization of the Islamic Conference and its subsidiary organs and specialized and affiliated institutions to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social and cultural fields ;  
Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security , and their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen economic , social , cultural and environmental cooperation in the region ,  
In order to achieve respect for cultural differences within a context of national unity , national reconciliation and democratic coexistence , it is essential to implement a comprehensive , nationwide programme of civic education , for which the necessary human and financial resources must be provided .  
Recognizes that respect for cultural diversity and the cultural rights of all peoples and nations will enhance cultural pluralism , contributing to wider exchange of knowledge and cultural background , advance the application and enjoyment of universally accepted human rights across the world and foster stable friendly relations among peoples and nations worldwide ;  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
All countries , non-governmental organizations and international organizations concerned needed to be engaged in follow-up , and in that endeavour different methods of implementation , monitoring and evaluation that were sensitive to local cultural , political and religious traditions might be required , as well as active participation of the local population .  
States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , [ cultural , ] administrative , technical [ or any other ] opportunities for criminal organizations to commit [ profitable crimes ] [ any punishable offence ] and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,  
Accordingly , in Syria , there is no basis for any discrimination , exception , restriction or preference on grounds of race , colour , descent or national or ethnic origin that would in any way hamper or impede the recognition , enjoyment or exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms in political , economic , social or cultural fields , in employment or in any other sphere of public life .  
Emphasizes that while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Noting the desire of both organizations to consolidate , develop and enhance further the ties existing between them in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural , technical and administrative fields ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in order to enhance their capacity to serve the mutual interests and objectives of the two organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields ;  
The same perspective was defended during the preparation for the Fourth World Conference on Women and at the April 1995 preparatory seminar that constituted a debating forum on the situation of women : the realization of their civic and political rights ; their economic , social and cultural rights ; their reproductive rights and so-called new rights , inter alia , the right to development and quality of life .  
The creation of a new relationship between Government , society and indigenous peoples must be based on respect for their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and on peaceful dialogue .  
Mr . Wehbe ( Syrian Arab Republic ) said that his delegation viewed draft resolution A / C . 3 / 54 / L . 8 , which advocated abolition of the death penalty , as a flagrant violation of the principle of mutual respect for the sovereignty of States and of non-interference in their internal affairs .  It represented an attempt to force other States to change their political , judicial , social and cultural structures .  
Each State was entitled to protect its citizens and the human rights of the victims of the most serious crimes as it saw fit , and depending on its social , moral , cultural , legal and economic specificities .  
Recent calls for such reform were born of a political desire to protect human rights in the context of international consensus , rather than through the unilateral imposition of a single cultural model .  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity in the peace and security , political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
In the context of the current global difficulties , it had become increasingly evident that economic , social and cultural rights must no longer be relegated to a secondary rank .  
Despite that welcome development , the Israeli Government was continuing its policy of establishing Jewish settlements and confiscating Palestinian land , especially in East Jerusalem , in the area around Jerusalem , and in the Syrian Golan , and was still engaging in practices that adversely affected the human rights of the Palestinian people , with the result that in Jerusalem , the demographic , legal , cultural and historic situation was being altered .  
Guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , and recalling that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development and of the need for comprehensive , coherent and effective policies on international migration based on the spirit of genuine partnership and common understanding ,  
As a moral and pluralistic society , Indonesia was committed to promoting respect for human rights and taking into account the varied cultural , ethnic and religious composition of the nation , as provided for in the 1993 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action .  
Civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights were mutually reinforcing , and the international community had a responsibility to ensure a holistic approach to the protection of human rights and the elimination of poverty , one of the most urgent human rights challenges .  
The report lacks an objective approach to evaluating the repercussions of the implementation of the programme on the overall humanitarian situation in Iraq in that it neglects to make a comparative analysis of the present situation and the situation in the relevant sectors as it was prior to the imposition of sanctions and in that it ignores the cumulative impact of the sanctions on all the economic , social and cultural aspects of life for the Iraqi people , including future generations .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Reaffirming its objectives , as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations , of achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Recognizes that respect for cultural diversity and the cultural rights of all peoples and nations will enhance cultural pluralism , contributing to wider exchange of knowledge and cultural background , advance the application and enjoyment of universally accepted human rights across the world and foster stable friendly relations among peoples and nations worldwide ;  
Expresses concern that while globalization holds out the promise of prosperity , it brings with it severe challenges for the developing countries , and that the promise of prosperity has not touched the vast majority of the worlds population , especially in the least developed countries , which affects the economic , social and cultural rights of their people ;  
Recognizes that respect for cultural diversity and the cultural rights of all enhances cultural pluralism , contributing to wider exchange of knowledge and understanding of cultural background , advancing the application and enjoyment of universally accepted human rights across the world and fostering stable friendly relations among peoples and nations worldwide ;  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
The full realization of the right to development must be addressed within a global context through a constructive , dialogue-based approach , with objectivity , respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity , impartiality , non-selectivity and transparency as the guiding principles , taking into account the political , historical , social , religious and cultural characteristics of each country ;  
Urges States to eliminate all obstacles to development at all levels , inter alia , by pursuing the promotion and protection of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights and implementing comprehensive development programmes at the national level , integrating those rights into development activities and promoting effective international cooperation ;  
Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,  
Reaffirming the purposes and principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations , which , inter alia , call for collective effort to strengthen friendly relations among nations , remove threats to peace and foster international cooperation in resolving international issues of economic , social , cultural and humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ,  
New Zealand is firmly committed to the universality and indivisibility of human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social , as embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .  
In such a process , all elements of the economic system , of the juridical sphere and of the political regime undergo profound transformations , while social differences are reshaped , cultural values are modified , and the international environment also changes .  
Recognizing that States have developed different cultural and historical uses for firearms and that the purpose of enhancing international cooperation to eradicate illicit transnational trafficking in firearms is not to discourage or diminish lawful leisure or recreational activities such as travel or tourism for sport shooting , hunting and other forms of lawful ownership and use of firearms that are recognized by States Parties ,  
Those were the key elements of an informed approach to global population and development priorities for the twenty-first century and should be addressed in the context of an enabling economic , social and cultural environment at the national and international levels .  
We have always said that Iraq is a great country with a rich cultural heritage , home to one of the oldest civilizations known , and that , by virtue of its abundant natural , mineral , human and other resources , it has huge potential to become an economic force to be reckoned with , not only in the Gulf region but also worldwide .  
The Mexican Government , which accorded high priority to promoting the full participation of women in social , economic , political and cultural life on a par with men , devoted significant resources to programmes designed to eliminate poverty using a gender-specific perspective , and to training women in non-traditional activities ; it was also encouraging independent employment and the creation of microbusinesses , in view of regional , social and gender realities .  
The health of ethnic minority women is undermined by multiple factors : lack of access to health services in the sparsely populated areas where they live , cultural and language barriers to effective contact with health staff , inadequate sanitation and nutrition , and low levels of education and information .  
HTPs are traditional , cultural and religious practices handed down through succeeding generations which are often detrimental to the health and psychological and social well-being of women and girls .  
Such targeting was based on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender as defined in article 7 , paragraph 3 , of the Statute , or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law .  
The Government stressed that the people of the South required reparation and justice for impunity , neo-colonial wars , the extermination of populations and peoples , the defilement of their economic , cultural and natural heritage by countries of the North , the decapitalization of the developing countries charged with paying external debts and the dumping of toxic waste in their territories , to cite only a few examples .  
Help Age International specified that the basic economic , social and cultural rights , the right to development and civil and political rights , regardless of age , gender , ethnic , political and religious background and culture should be drawn together as fundamental standards .  
In its resolution 1998 / 33 , the Commission decided , as part of its efforts to impart a higher visibility to economic , social and cultural rights , to appoint , for a period of three years , a special rapporteur whose mandate would focus on the right to education , as laid down in article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the relevant and applicable provisions of the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights . 
One of the purposes of the United Nations is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ( Article 1 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter ) .  
The right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
The universal implementation of human rights , economic , social and cultural as well as civil and political , is the surest preventive strategy and the most effective way of avoiding the emergence of conflict .  
All human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ; equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of both civil and political , and economic , social and cultural rights .  
In the weeks that followed , members of ethnic minority groups , especially Roma and Serbs , began fleeing Kosovo owing to fear of the killings , kidnapping , looting of properties , evictions , widespread burning of villages , as well as cultural , historical and religious monuments , and other forms of intimidation directed against them.The situation of the Serb , Roma and other minority communities has been a painful one of widespread human rights violations . 
Less visible but nonetheless destructive violations of human rights are the growth of poverty in rich and developing countries alike , and the marginalization caused by violations of economic , social and cultural rights .  
The strong plea of the High Commission is : let us , in the coming century , prevent gross violations of human rights , economic , social and cultural as well as civil and political rights .  
Yet this is only one of the many purposes of our Organization ; to achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all is no less an important goal in our Charter .  
We can not deny that uncontrolled market forces and unfettered short-term capital flows , to take but a few examples of globalization , have had devastating consequences on our economies , social cohesion , political stability and cultural identity in many cases for the worse rather than for the better . 
I am confident that over the next two days the debate will be characterized by new ideas and a renewed commitment to the Proclamation on Ageing , which calls for the recognition of humanity ' s demographic coming of age and the promise it holds for maturing attitudes and innovations in political , legal , social , economic , cultural and spiritual fields as our collective and determined way of preparing ourselves towards social justice , global peace , human development equality in the next century . 
Among the activities promoted by local and regional authorities , labour unions and non-governmental organizations were international and national conferences on the issues associated with ageing , ranging from broad cultural and social debates to more focused discussions of the specific economic , medical and psychological concerns of the elderly .  
I wish to reiterate the commitment of the Kingdom of Swaziland to this process , which is aimed at meeting the challenges faced by our countries and our Organization in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character , and in promoting , as well as encouraging , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , as mapped out in the Charter of the United Nations .  
In our view , the only worthwhile approach to this problem encompasses human rights in a comprehensive , integrated and indivisible way : all human rights , which is to say the basic economic , cultural and social needs of every individual , along with civil and political rights .  
We are confident that the adoption of draft resolution A 54 L . 12 , just introduced by the Ambassador of Burkina Faso , will serve as another basis for promoting in the coming year joint activities which fall within the common purposes of both organizations , whose goals are to ensure international cooperation in seeking solutions to international economic , social , cultural and humanitarian problems .  
The ensuing concentration of power and influence lies in the hands of those nations , institutions and individuals that can master the wealth of information on all aspects of human interaction , be it economic , financial , political , social or cultural .  
One-thousand-six-hundred representatives from 131 countries came to Berlin and cooperated in the drafting of important resolutions on the promotion of international humanitarian law ; on the peaceful coexistence of ethnic , cultural and religious minorities , including migrant populations within a single State ; and on the need to revise the current global financial and economic model .  
This agreement , based on the promotion of international cooperation and the solution of problems of a political , economic , social , cultural or humanitarian nature , is designed to promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The forthcoming worldwide celebration of this epic turning point in time is an occasion imbued with profound historical , religious , spiritual and cultural dimensions of high importance for our people , for the other peoples of the region , for the faithful and for the entire international community .  
We are delighted to see la Francophonie , built up over 30 years of cultural and technical cooperation , take on a new political dimension , particularly since the Hanoi Summit of 1997 , and to see it established as a full-fledged international organization working alongside other regional organizations and at the United Nations .  
In implementing that resolution the two institutions set up cooperative machinery , thanks to a cooperative agreement designed to strengthen their ties on issues of common interest , notably in the political , economic , scientific and cultural areas .  
Can we really imagine modern international political and economic relations , trade , satellites , the Internet , aviation , technological and scientific activity , cultural exchanges , environmental protection , travel , the use of natural resources , exploration of outer space and other vital human activities without a solid international legal foundation ? 
This year such issues include the dumping of nuclear waste and other toxic substances , the regional seas programme of the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , the increasing threat to shipping from piracy and armed robbery at sea , the importance of enhancing the safety of navigation and the continued work of the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization towards a convention on the protection of the underwater cultural heritage .  
In this regard , the United States believes that there are still substantial issues on which there must be consensus before a draft convention can be considered for adoption , in particular the extent of coastal-State jurisdiction over underwater cultural heritage in the exclusive economic zone and on the continental shelf seaward of 24 nautical miles , and the treatment of vessels and aircraft entitled to sovereign immunity .  
Hence , gaining a growing number of adherents across cultural , social and economic lines , democracy is increasingly being recognized as an appropriate response to a wide range of human concerns , and as an ingredient for both sustainable development and lasting peace .  
This stage , of course , is fraught with risks and potential setbacks , especially in developing countries , due to the lack of essential conditions for pursuing a democratic course , foremost among them the existence of an economic system that meets the basic living and cultural needs of a society , in addition to the rule of law and the existence of a civil society that is robust with political and professional activities .  
India is vitally interested in peace , development and stability in the Middle East , a region close to our heart and with which we share bonds of history and culture , reinforced in modern times through multifaceted cooperation encompassing trade , investment , cultural exchanges , technical assistance and human resource development . 
The Second Protocol goes further to develop the Conventions protective powers with regard to military involvement and the need to strengthen the system of protection for those categories of cultural property deemed of vital importance to mankind or whose exceptional cultural and historical value is recognized by national legislation .  
Furthermore , the efforts of UNESCO to link existing databases and identification systems to allow for electronic transmission of information concerning stolen cultural property , including those removed from areas of conflict and occupied territories , is viewed by my delegation as a primary weapon in the ongoing struggle to achieve an advantage over those engaged in the smuggling trade .  
The plundering of the cultural heritage of Cyprus in this area has been so widespread that it led to a decision by the United States , a decision which we warmly welcome , to impose an emergency import restriction in April of this year on Byzantine ecclesiastical and ritual ethnological material from Cyprus , unless such material is accompanied by an export permit issued by the Government of Cyprus .  
However , many developing countries in Asia , Africa and Latin America , which experienced the colonial rule of foreign forces in the past , have lost numerous items of cultural property as a result of looting and destruction by colonialists , and have faced serious problems in the continuation of national tradition and the systemic development of national culture .  
The international community has paid close attention to the protection of national cultural property and established concrete norms of international law in the area of preserving the cultural property of nations through relevant international treaties and conventions .  
My delegation reaffirms its strong conviction that it is necessary to strengthen and extend every possible form of cooperation among all countries within the framework of mutual respect , respect for international law and the relevant international conventions , in order to ensure , at the international level , the protection and restoration of archaeological , historical and cultural treasures .  
We hope that international efforts will bear fruit and that the restoration of cultural properties to their legitimate owners will be encouraged , so that our various cultural heritages , which not only have historical and ancestral value but which also represent the intellectual and moral heritage of future generations , can be preserved .  
An integral part of promoting sustainable human development is respect for all social and economic rights , as well as cultural , civil and political rights .  
As we prepare to enter the twenty-first century , and cognizant of the challenges that will confront our continent and peoples , we emphasize the imperative need and a high sense of urgency to rekindle the aspirations of our peoples for stronger unity , solidarity and cohesion in a larger community of peoples transcending cultural , ideological , ethnic and national differences .  
Such activities should promote the free dissemination and mutual exchange of information and knowledge in cultural and scientific fields , assist in educational , social and economic development , particularly in the developing countries , enhance the qualities of life of all peoples and provide recreation with due respect to the political and cultural integrity of States .  
Women are occupying more important positions in everyday life , and the numbers of women participating in all economic , cultural , political , social and intellectual activities has increased significantly .  
Cairo + 5 is part of a series of international conferences that constitute fundamental elements for the advancement and improvement of the situation of mankind , and particularly that of women , who in many instances suffer major discrimination based on their gender and on historic , social and cultural beliefs that undermine their possibilities to advance and their basic right to occupy their due place in all aspects of social life on an equal footing with men .  
In short , our population policy comprises a set of measures aimed at influencing reproductive behaviour : education , training , promoting the sexual and reproductive health of our population , promoting the values of Nicaraguan society , the right to life from the moment of conception , access to education and basic health care , the irreplaceable role of the family and the social and cultural survival of ethnic groups .  
Plans will also include the design and implementation of a national policy specifically directed towards youth to promote technical and vocational training , recreational and cultural facilities and the fostering of moral and civic values that will enable them to take an active part in Salvadoran society .  
However we address the issues , emphasizing the economic , social and cultural aspects of population and development as integrated into various sectors , my Government strongly believes that the Programme of Action can be achieved only if we can accept the standard rules and procedures in principle but are able , when it comes to the implementation of programmes and activities , to be flexible to allow for adjustments based on every country ' s specific needs .  
Notwithstanding historical and cultural traditions , by which elderly people have always been greatly respected , the improvement of their standard of living requires ongoing political efforts to mobilize and utilize available resources in the context of families , communities , civil organizations and the private sector .  
The population policy thus aims at improving standards of living and quality of life ; improving health and welfare through information and education ; further reducing fertility and mortality rates ; encouraging Kenyans to adhere to small family size ; promoting family stability while recognizing the rights of women and children ; and eliminating social and cultural practices that have a negative impact on women and girls .  
It is the conviction of Malta that it must keep on working on the basis outlined in the Cairo Programme of Action and in accordance with the prevalent ethical and cultural values of Maltese society , as reflected in national legislation , so that , together with the international community , we may promote a decent and fulfilling life for every single human being on our planet and for future generations .  
Promoting healthy and responsible behaviour in the sphere of sexual and reproductive health requires profound cultural change , and the Government therefore considers it important to incorporate population issues into curricula at all levels of the national education system .  
The implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action and those contained in the present document is the sovereign right of each country , consistent with national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its people , and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights .  
The Working Group expressed its deep concern in relation to the continuing grave violations of womens human rights , including civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and the persistent and pervasive discrimination against women .  
We are confident that the Committee jurisprudence will be open to a developing interpretation of the most controversial points , in the light of the practice of other human rights treaty bodies , and also of the peculiarity of the CEDAW Convention , which provides for a wider scope of social and cultural human rights than other international instruments .  
To take strong and appropriate action , through the development and enforcement of specific legislation measures , against any kind of illegal , abusive or exploitative tourist activity , including sexual exploitation abuse , in recognition of the fact that such activities have particularly adverse impacts and pose significant social , health and cultural threats , and that all countries have a role to play in the efforts to stamp them out ;  
To provide relevant direction on research activities , and collect and disseminate information on best practices and techniques , including an appropriate mix of instruments to minimize negative and to promote positive environmental , social and cultural impacts from tourism in developed and developing countries and in countries with economies in transition ;  
Several participants emphasized that criteria used in certification schemes should meet or exceed minimum national standards , where they exist , and should include social , cultural and economic aspects as well as environmental considerations .  
In discussing integrated coastal zone management , participants agreed that there were real biophysical limits to capacity in any particular location as well as cultural limits that should be determined at the local level by the local community .  
Tourism was recognized as a key rapid growth sector in the world economy with important economic , social , cultural and environmental impacts , particularly in small island developing States and tourist destinations with fragile ecosystems .  
Tourism had the potential to make an important contribution to poverty alleviation and economic advancement , particularly through integrated plans with the inclusion of local stakeholders in planning and development and where a key objective remained the protection of the cultural and natural assets of the tourist locality .  
The Committee regrets that its dialogue with representatives of the State party regarding the root causes of the armed conflict was inconclusive ; the absence in the report of statistics relating to the north and east of the country can only reinforce the view of the Committee that the question of discrimination in relation to the economic , social and cultural rights of ethnic groups remains the central issue in the armed conflict in Sri Lanka .  
The Committee is fully aware of the human and material costs of the armed conflict in Sri Lanka and the deleterious effects this has on the economic , social and cultural rights of every person living in the country .  
The enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights is hindered by the absence of the rule of law , the existence in Nigeria of military governments , the suspension of the Constitution in favour of rule by military decree and the concomitant resort to intimidation , and the negative effects of widespread corruption on the functioning of governmental institutions .  
Detailed information , including the latest statistical data , is also requested on the progressive realization of economic , social and cultural rights in East Jerusalem , keeping in mind the concerns raised by the Committee in the relevant paragraphs of these concluding observations .  
The Committee recommends that the State party accord equal treatment to both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights in terms of their domestic legal status and that if measures are taken to incorporate civil and political rights treaty obligations consideration be given to similar measures in relation to economic , social and cultural rights .  
The Committee notes that since 1994 , in addressing the budget deficits by slashing social expenditure , the State party has not paid sufficient attention to the adverse consequences for the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights by the Canadian population as a whole , and by vulnerable groups in particular .  
Yet while IMF rigorously monitored loan recipient countries ' compliance with loan conditions for financial reform , it only lamented the ill _ effects on economic , social and cultural rights and left them to be dealt with by other international organizations and bodies .  
The benefits of free and rapid information exchange and enhanced enjoyment of freedom of expression were offset by the culturally homogenizing effect of globalization , which undermined existing cultural identity and weakened various ethical norms and social cohesion .  
Indeed , at its forty-ninth session in August 1997 , the Sub-Commission adopted resolution 1997-7 in which it requested one of its experts , Mr . Mustapha Mehedi , to prepare a working paper on the right to education with the purpose of explaining the content of the right to education , taking account , in particular , of its social dimension and the freedoms it includes and of its dual civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural character .  
The Chairperson reiterated his concern about the persistent lack of recognition of economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to education , as human rights , not only at the national level but also in various international entities .  
In calling for a renewed commitment to respect economic , social and cultural rights , the Committee wishes to emphasize that international organizations , as well as the Governments that have created and manage them , have a strong and continuous responsibility to take whatever measures they can to assist Governments to act in ways which are compatible with their human rights obligations and to seek to devise policies and programmes which promote respect for those rights .  
The World Conference on Human Rights held in 1993 underscored the interdependence of all human rights , and emphasized that all societies should work to ensure the enjoyment by all their members of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , including their right to development .  
The Convention codifies women ' s right to non _ discrimination and equality with men and also establishes that women and men are equally entitled to the full enjoyment and exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural , civil or any other field .  
To that end , they pledge to increase their efforts to assess factors and obstacles that impinge on women ' s enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social , cultural and other rights and to suggest specific actions on how such obstacles might be overcome so that full enjoyment of human rights by all , without discrimination , may be realized .  
The adoption of a rigid classification of economic , social and cultural rights which puts them , by definition , beyond the reach of the courts would thus be arbitrary and incompatible with the principle that the two sets of human rights are indivisible and interdependent .  
The promotion of educational and information programmes designed to enhance awareness and understanding of economic , social and cultural rights , both within the population at large and among particular groups such as the public service , the judiciary , the private sector and the labour movement ;  
The mandate of the permanent forum should be as broad as possible and contain all matters concerning indigenous peoples amongst which should be included civil , political , economic , social , cultural , developmental , environmental , health , education , language , land , resources , territorial , gender and children ' s rights.In particular , it should deal with the following , among others : 
The establishment of the permanent forum should have a positive impact on construction and development for indigenous peoples in areas such as economic , political , social and cultural rights , human rights , the environment , health and the expansion of cross _ cultural bilingual education based on the world view of the indigenous peoples in each State .  
In industrialized and developing countries , young people are living at a time when profound economic , political , social , cultural and environmental changes are occurring , resulting in both opportunities and constraints .  
Young women and men should therefore be involved from childhood in decisions relating to their own lives , and step by step in democratic decisions for their school , their community , in local national social and cultural organizations as well as at the national , regional and international levels .  
Also bearing in mind that democracy , development and respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
This rapid expansion denotes the development of a modern movement of associations which is determined to tackle the ever more pressing economic , social and cultural concerns and is helping to improve communications between the State and civil society .  
However , the efforts to spread basic education in rural areas are hampered by a number of constraints of a geographical , economic and cultural nature ( absence of means of communication , scattered habitations , mountainous areas in certain regions , etc . ) .  
In implementation of high royal instructions placing rural areas at the heart of governmental strategy , in the framework of the policy enabling all citizens to participate in cultural life and to contribute to the improvement of rural living conditions , and with a view to improving the geographical distribution of cultural services and facilities , the Ministry of Culture has initiated , in cooperation with local communities , an extensive programme to build and equip libraries in rural centres .  
In the framework of the decentralization and democratisation of cultural life , having regard to the role of culture in all economic and social development , and in order to enable rural areas to enjoy appropriate cultural facilities in accordance with law 47-96 on regional organization , permanent committees responsible for educational and cultural matters have been established as part of the sixteen recently created regional councils .  
These consultative bodies , comprising representatives of all the social partners concerned ( local communities , cultural associations and unions , private and banking sector , personalities from the arts and literature , etc . ) , constitute a genuine forum for debating cultural policy and determining the direction and priorities of cultural actions . 
These achievements have been made more appreciable through the promotion of social dialogue following the signing of the agreement of 1 August 1996 by the Government and the social partners , the revitalization of the consultative process , and the gradual emancipation of civil society and its increased involvement in economic , social and cultural development .  
Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security , and their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen economic , social , cultural and environmental cooperation in the region ,  
The primary objectives of UNISPACE III are : ( a ) to promote effective means of using space technology to assist in the solution of problems of regional and global significance ; and ( b ) to strengthen the capabilities of Member States , in particular the developing countries , to apply space technology for economic , social and cultural development .  
She hopes that the legal aspects , geographical conditions , economic , social and cultural factors and the environmental and human considerations underpinning the wise decision to abandon this scheme will be remembered should there be any similar plans in the future .  
In its resolution 1998-24 , the Commission on Human Rights decided to appoint for a three-year period a special rapporteur on the effects of foreign debt on the full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights , and requested the Special Rapporteur to submit to the Commission on an annual basis , beginning at its fifty-fifth session , an analytical report on the implementation of the resolution .  
The General Assembly has established the following six main committees : First Committee , disarmament and international security issues ; Second Committee , economic and financial issues ; Third Committee , social , humanitarian and cultural issues ; Fourth Committee , special political and decolonization issues ; Fifth Committee , administrative and budgetary issues ; and Sixth Committee , legal issues .  
Non-discrimination is the overriding principle of international human rights law and thus applies to civil and political , as well as to economic , social and cultural rights , as well as to the rights of the child which cut across these two categories .  
We are of the opinion that the workshops and conferences held on the subject of the permanent forum reveal a consensus in favour of endowing the permanent forum with competence in respect not only of the cultural , economic , social and political rights of the indigenous peoples but also educational and health matters affecting the indigenous peoples , with a view to promoting better services corresponding to their way of life .  
HTPs are traditional , cultural and religious practices handed down through succeeding generations which are often detrimental to the health and psychological and social well-being of women and girls .  
For instance , when local arts and crafts and cultural practices are adapted to suit foreign tastes , the result can be poor quality handicrafts , unethical trading practices and fake antiques , as well as the deterioration of cultural dances , music and festivals .  
The major challenge facing the international community is to assist Governments , especially those of developing countries , to promote tourism development within the framework of sustainable development in order to maximize the potential economic and social benefits from tourism without damaging the environment or cultural assets .  
The main adverse impacts of tourism on the environment are connected to pressure on natural resources , harm to wildlife and habitats ( with associated loss of biological diversity ) , the generation of pollution and wastes , and social and cultural pressures related to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity .  
WTO has also been active , focusing in particular on planning at the national and local levels and on indicators for sustainable tourism , and addressing sustainable tourism in a number of regional forums . 4 A number of other international organizations have developed activities for sustainable tourism ; in particular , UNESCO has addressed , inter alia , tourism in World Heritage Sites and cultural tourism .

The political and electoral platform has emphasized the migrants cost to society , yet has omitted their very important contributions in the cultural , scientific , technical , social and economic fields . 
Protection , however , extends beyond safeguarding physical security to encompass the broad range of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights provided for under international human rights law .  
The economic , ecological , social and cultural systems of small island developing States are fragile and highly sensitive to external environmental , social and economic change .

The observer for the Indian Movement Tupaj Amaru stated that , while considering the draft declaration , special attention should be given to such notions as the recognition of the right of indigenous peoples to define themselves as peoples , the principle of self-determination , the exercise of collective ancestral ownership of land , the sovereignty over natural resources , the legal protection of cultural and intellectual property .  
The observer for the Inuit Circumpolar Conference reiterated support for the draft declaration in its current form which , if adopted , would guarantee the political , social , economic and cultural rights of indigenous peoples and lead to a path of peace based on mutual respect .  
Tourism is a labour-intensive activity that does not require a high level of specialization , and if well managed and of the proper size , it may exert a strong attractive force on the rest of the islands economic system , including conservation of certain traditional activities , such as agriculture and fishing , and preservation of islands cultural heritage and natural assets .  
In order to overcome the difficulties , intensive technical assistance will be needed from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , including training courses , seminars and workshops , with a view to removing the major political , cultural and social obstacles to the consolidation of the democratic process and the effective exercise of human rights .

Efforts directed at the elimination of all inferior treatment and discrimination of which women are victims should be continued until they achieve equal opportunities with men and are fully integrated into the process of socio _ economic , cultural and political development of the country ;  
While respecting Algerias stages of political , economic , sociological and cultural development and acknowledging that popular support is necessary for any reform relating to womens rights , the Committee encourages the Government , non-governmental organizations , intellectuals and the mass media to do everything possible by means of publicity and public awareness campaigns to encourage more enlightened attitudes and accelerate womens emancipation .  
For the purposes of the present Convention , the term discrimination against women shall mean any distinction , exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition , enjoyment or exercise by women , irrespective of their marital status , on a basis of equality of men and women , of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural , civil or any other field .  
Apartheid was introduced in 1948 by the National Party as a system of racial segregation designed to maintain a situation of inequality between the Whites and the other ethnic and racial groups living in South Africa , in the economic , social , political and cultural spheres .  
A civic training programme , centred mainly on essential aspects of democracy , the South African Constitution , the Human Rights Charter , international humanitarian law , cultural diversity and military ethics , has been published in a manual entitled South African National Defense Force Civic Education Guidelines and is being implemented .  
In that predominantly Kurdish area , long-standing grievances , involving neglect , discrimination and cultural and social repression , promoted substantial support for secessionist and autonomist views , spawning the establishment of the Kurdistan Workers ' Party ( PKK ) , which , in 1984 , launched a violent and ruthless campaign of opposition to central government authority , including the reported killing in Turkey and abroad of civilians considered hostile to the organization ' s objectives .  
The Vienna Conference emphasized the need for Governments and the United Nations to make the full and equal participation of women in political , civil , economic , social and cultural life , at the national , regional and international levels , and the eradication of all forms of discrimination on grounds of sex a priority goal of their policies .  
The wide-ranging dialogue , with questions from Governments and non _ governmental organizations , covered such issues as female genital mutilation ; violence against women ; womens economic , social and cultural rights ; and ways and means of improving United Nations actions protecting the human rights of women .

In adopting the Declaration on the Right to Development , the General Assembly , in resolution 41-128 , recognized that development is a comprehensive , cultural , political , economic , and social process which aims at constant improvement of the well-being of the entire population and of all individuals on the basis of their active , free and meaningful participation in development and the fair distribution of benefits resulting therefrom .

In resolution 51-178 , the General Assembly expressed its solidarity with people living in poverty in all countries and reaffirmed that the satisfaction of basic human needs was an essential element of poverty eradication , those needs being closely interrelated and comprising nutrition , health , water and sanitation , education , employment , housing and participation in cultural and social rights .  
The poverty trap in which the poorest of the poor find themselves shows how human rights are indivisible and interdependent : the right to an adequate standard of living , to housing , to education , to work , to good health , to employment , to the protection of the family , to respect for privacy , to legal status and registration as a citizen , to life and physical integrity , to justice and participation in political , social and cultural life .  
The contribution of those living in extreme poverty could be of decisive importance in current thinking on sustainable human development and the right to development , especially since the concept of development is no longer viewed only from an economic standpoint , but also in social and cultural terms .  
International economic sanctions , particularly when imposed by the Security Council , should be conceived in such a way as to avoid aggravating conditions of extreme poverty in the countries concerned.In particular , they should be compatible with the effective exercise of human rights _ and especially economic , social and cultural rights _ by civilians .  
Although at times a writer may make outrageous statements , even wounding cultural sensitivities and commonly held beliefs , literature remains a basic medium through which imagination and the striving of the human mind are expressed most freely and in the most provocative forms .  
Article 1 of the Declaration states that the right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .

It was pleased to note that many countries had taken legal measures to eliminate cultural , religious or traditional practices , including female genital mutilation , that violated the human rights of women and girls.Although in keeping with the duty of States to protect all human rights , such actions were insufficient by themselves to end those practices and should be supplemented with education and public awareness campaigns .  
The implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action and those contained in the present document is the sovereign right of each country , consistent with national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its people , and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights . 6 .

Also bearing in mind that democracy , development and respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
While there had been a significant strengthening of civil and political rights and fundamental freedoms , there had been no real progress in economic , cultural and social rights , which had even regressed because of the introduction of costly structural adjustments that had led to increased poverty , wider income gaps , reduced social security systems and increasing unemployment .

Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , discrimination against , inter alia , Africans , people of African descent , Arabs and Muslims , and incidents of xenophobia , Negrophobia , anti-Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Stresses the necessity of establishing , at the national level , an enabling legal , political , economic and social environment for the realization of the right to development and emphasizes the importance of democratic , participatory , transparent and accountable governance , as well as the need for efficient national mechanisms such as national human rights commissions , to ensure respect for civil , economic , cultural , political and social rights , without any distinction ;  
Invites all special rapporteurs and existing thematic mechanisms of the Commission in the field of economic , social and cultural rights to pay due attention , within the scope of their respective mandates , to the negative impact and consequences of unilateral coercive measures ;  
Welcomes the report submitted by the independent expert on the effects of structural adjustment policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of all human rights , particularly economic , social and cultural rights , to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-seventh session ( E / CN . 4 / 2001 / 56 ) , commends the independent expert for his valuable work and encourages him to continue studying these issues further ;  
Also requests the independent expert to provide an advance copy of his annual report to the open-ended working group on structural adjustment programmes and economic , social and cultural rights in order to assist the group in the fulfilment of its mandate ;  
Recalls that international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social and cultural character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all is one of the purposes of the United Nations , and affirms that wider international cooperation would contribute to lasting progress in implementing economic , social and cultural rights ;  
Recalling that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his or her economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his or her civil and political rights ,  
Recalling also that the eradication of widespread poverty , including its most persistent forms , and the full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights and civil and political rights remain interrelated goals ,  
Deeply concerned that , 53 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness are particularly severe in developing countries , while acknowledging the achievements made in many parts of the world ,  
Reaffirming the human right to be free from discrimination and the equal right of women and men to the enjoyment of all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights as stipulated , inter alia , in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ,  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Alarmed by the reality of daily violations of childrens rights , including the right to life , to physical security and to freedom from arbitrary detention , torture and any form of exploitation , as well as economic , social and cultural rights , as laid out in relevant international instruments ,  
Recognizing that States must protect and promote the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous women , women who are of people of African descent , migrants , internally displaced , asylum-seekers or refugees as well as other vulnerable women , further recognizing that they are important actors and that the enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights is essential for the development of societies throughout the region ,  
Condemn all forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related forms of intolerance concerning economic , social and cultural rights and other related matters , including access to employment , government benefits , access to capital , credit , technology , education and vocational training , housing , health care , the environment , cultural activities , the protection of heritage , equal access to public services and other types of services , and national immigration policies ;  
Recognize that education and lifelong learning are basic for the respect of the racial , ethnic , cultural , linguistic and religious diversity of our societies which is essential to prevent the spread of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , and is of key importance for protecting and promoting democratic values ;  
Urge States to adopt or strengthen , as appropriate , national programmes for eradicating poverty among indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities , and also request that they expand their efforts to foster bilateral , regional and international cooperation in implementing those programmes ;

Request the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to take initiatives aimed at fostering cooperation among States , and between them and international organizations for the purpose of concluding agreements , coordinating activities and developing programmes in favour of indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities , in order to combat manifestations of racism , xenophobia and related intolerance and discrimination ;  
Request the operational programmes and agencies of the United Nations , financial and development institutions , in accordance with their mandates , to assign higher priority and provide more funding to projects in favour of indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities , in order to combat manifestations of racism , xenophobia and related intolerance and discrimination , and to include such vulnerable groups at the stage of the development and implementation of projects concerning them ;  
Request States to adopt public policies and give impetus to programmes on behalf of indigenous women , with a view to promoting their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ; to putting an end to their situation of disadvantage for reasons of gender ; to dealing with urgent problems affecting them , in education and in the economy and in the matter of domestic violence ; and to eliminating the situation of discrimination suffered by indigenous women on multiple grounds of racism and gender discrimination ;  
Also invite them to ensure their full enjoyment of all civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , in particular women , children and vulnerable groups , so that persons who admit to an HIV infection , those presumably infected and other persons affected are protected against violence , stigmatization , discrimination , unemployment and other negative consequences which may be compounded by racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
Urge States in their national efforts , and in cooperation with regional and international financial institutions , to promote the use of public investment and encourage private investment in order to eradicate poverty , particularly in those areas in which indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities predominantly live ;  
Further request States to take additional steps to protect economic , political , social and cultural rights on a non-discriminatory basis , by ensuring an increase in the delivery of public services and access to social justice and rights for indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities ;  
Also urge them to provide an accurate presentation of the history of the State , highlighting the contributions of the different culture and civilizations of the region and the world , including the role that indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities have played in building national identities in the Americas , and historical and contemporary examples of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance directed against these groups ;  
Urge States to discourage advertising that portrays stereotypical or otherwise negative images of indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants , and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities , and to encourage advertising that promotes a broader understanding of these victims of racism and fosters the values of diversity , tolerance and mutual respect ;  
Invite States to take appropriate constitutional , legislative and administrative measures , to foster equality among individuals , indigenous peoples , among people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities whose members are frequently victims of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , and review existing measures with a view to amending or repealing national legislation and administrative provisions that may give rise to discrimination ;  
INSAFOCOOP observes the National Day of Cooperative Movements which is a special holiday celebrated with many cultural , educative and social activities during the entire month of July to promote integration among the diverse cooperative associations .  
Within the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council , and at major recent international conferences , Governments have acknowledged the significance of cooperatives as associations and enterprises through which citizens can effectively improve their lives while contributing to the economic , social , cultural and political advancement of their community and nation .  
In summary , we can say that the main provisions contained in the Constitution are the following : political pluralism , separation of and collaboration among the legislative , executive and judicial powers , the right of all citizens to protection and to develop and express their ethnic , cultural , linguistic and religious identity .  
This encompasses a broad and balanced approach , placing equal emphasis on all human rights civil and political , economic , social and cultural , as well as the right to development .  
The pressures faced by families in efforts to promote the upbringing and education of the rising generation resulting from economic , social and cultural changes and the tremendous impact of globalization , with its adverse effects on the system of values , concepts , attitudes and the feeling of belonging , and on family and communal ties ;  
As indicated above , ACC continued to deepen its shared understanding of the synergies that have to be fostered among the different dimensions of globalization ( financial , economic , social , cultural , technological and human rights ) , so as to strengthen the knowledge base required for the development of integrated approaches that can serve to bridge the growing divides that globalization is bringing about in many areas , and to spread the benefits of globalization to all .  
ACCs deliberations on information and communication technologies ( ICT ) focused more broadly on the contribution ICT could make in advancing some of the basic objectives that the system was endeavouring to support and advance : the integration of developing countries in the global knowledge society , and the pursuit of growth and efficiency in key sectors of the economy , in ways that serve to further the social and cultural goals of societies . 
In several resolutions , including 2001 / 30 on the realization in all countries of the economic , social and cultural rights , the Commission noted the entry into force of the Optional Protocol and encouraged its further ratification or accession , and also decided on the appointment of an independent expert to examine the question of a draft optional protocol to the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights .  
Recognizing that , national and international actions are required to combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , in order to ensure the full enjoyment of human rights , which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and to improve the living conditions of men , women and children of all nations [ at the , economic , social , cultural , civil , and political level ] ,  
In light of these and other available reports , the Committee reiterates its deep concern over accounts that Israels recent actions in the occupied territories in violation of international human rights law and humanitarian law have resulted in gross violations of the economic , social and cultural rights of Palestinians .  
In the agreed conclusions , the Commission noted that full enjoyment by women and girls of all human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social , including the right to development which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated is of crucial importance in preventing further spread of HIV / AIDS . The Commission noted that the highest level of political commitment to the empowerment and advancement of women and to the prevention , research , care and treatment of sexually transmitted infections , especially HIV / AIDS , must be secured .  
Governments , with the assistance of relevant United Nations entities , needed to adopt a long-term , timely , coherent and integrated AIDS prevention policy , with public information , life skills-based education programmes specifically tailored to the needs of women and girls , adapted to their social cultural context and sensitivities and the specific needs in their life cycle .  
The Commission also called for the condemnation of all forms of racism and racial discrimination , and for concrete measures to promote equality based on the elimination of gender and racial prejudice in all fields , through improving access to education , health care , employment and other basic services , in order to promote full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights for all women and girls .  
In the light of the International Bill of Rights , poverty may be defined as a human condition characterized by sustained or chronic deprivation of the resources , capabilities , choices , security and power necessary for the enjoyment of an adequate standard of living and other civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
The development of an indigenous technological base will provide developing countries with the knowledge and skills necessary for the optimal use of their own human and natural resources and help in devising the production techniques relevant to their development strategies and cultural milieu .  
The objectives of third-country training , which takes place in a particular region where developing countries have a common base in terms of natural , social and cultural factors , are to transfer the technology and know-how of Japan in a form that is compatible with local conditions , and to promote TCDC .  
In addition , under article 7 ( h ) , [ p ] ersecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law is also considered a crime against humanity .  
ILO Convention No . 143 also provides that States parties pursue a national policy designed to promote and to guarantee equality of opportunity and treatment in respect of employment , occupation , social security , trade union and cultural rights , and of individual and collective freedoms for persons who as migrant workers or as members of their families are lawfully within its territory .  
Article 55 of the Charter explicitly recognizes that solutions to international economic , social , health and related problems , international , cultural and educational cooperation and universal respect for human rights are all essential for the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations .  
It also agreed to the importance of peace-building as a broad-based approach to conflict prevention , and stressed the need to address the political , military , humanitarian , human rights , environmental , economic , social , cultural and demographic root causes of conflicts .  
Efforts to prevent armed conflict should promote a broad range of human rights , including not only civil and political rights but also economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to development .  
At its forty-seventh session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1995 / 31 , endorsed the background document of the Secretary-General ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1995 / 11 ) and requested the Secretary-General to prepare a report on the impact of the activities and working methods of transnational corporations on the full enjoyment of all human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development , bearing in mind existing international guidelines , rules and standards relating to the subject matter .  
In its resolution 1998 / 7 , the Sub-Commission decided to appoint Mr . Guiss as Special Rapporteur to conduct a detailed study on the relationship between the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights and the promotion of the realization of the right to drinking water supply and sanitation , at both the national and international levels , taking also into account questions related to the realization of the right to development , in order to determine the most effective means to reinforce activities in that field .  
In May 2001 , the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights adopted a statement on poverty which recognizes that poverty constitutes a denial of human rights and defines poverty as a human condition characterized by the deprivation of the resources , capabilities , choices , security and power necessary for the enjoyment of an adequate standard of living and other civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights ( A / CONF . 191 / BP / 7 ) .  
The Sub-Commission has already addressed impunity involving civil and political rights , as well as economic , social and cultural rights , in two excellent studies .  [ 175 ] While neither study directly addresses terrorist acts , terrorist acts viewed as impairing civil and political rights have been those drawing the most attention in the Commission and the Sub-Commission and on the part of the Special Rapporteur in her previous work and in the present report as well .  
We further express our determination to maximize the benefits of globalization with a view to the realization of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development , through strengthening cooperation to create increased opportunities for trade , economic growth and sustainable development , global communications through the use of new technologies and increased intercultural exchange through the preservation and promotion of cultural diversity , which may contribute to the eradication of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
We recall the historical fact that among the most hideous manifestations of racial discrimination the African continent and Diaspora have suffered , namely the slave trade , all forms of exploitation , colonialism and apartheid , were essentially motivated by economic objectives and competition between colonial powers for strategic territorial gains , appropriation and control over and pillage of natural and cultural resources ;  
We regret the existence of inequitable political , economic , cultural and social conditions in which intolerance and racial discrimination breed and fester , and we believe that genuine equality of opportunity for development is fundamental for the eradication of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance .  
We also understand that discrimination contributes to inequitable political , economic , cultural and social conditions , and that genuine equality of opportunity [ for development ] is fundamental for the eradication of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
Calls upon States to promote and implement legal provisions and public policies ensuring Roma communities institutional development , their equal enjoyment of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights , their equal access to development resources and their full participation in decision-making process in central and local public administration , as recommended by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in its General Recommendation XXVII entitled Discrimination against Roma .  
Urges States to take the necessary measures to ensure that no person will be expelled , extradited or returned to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of being subjected to torture or persecution on account of his or her [ race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion ] racial , ethnic , cultural , religious , linguistic , or national origin [ or political affiliation ] ;  
Urges States to take concrete measures to promote equality based on the elimination of gender and racial prejudice in all fields through , inter alia , improving access to education , health care , employment and other basic services to promote full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights ;  
Urges States to establish national programmes to promote the access , without any discrimination , of people of African descent , Mestizos , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , linguistic and religious groups , minorities , and indigenous peoples , where they exist , to education , medical care and other social services and to eliminate by the year 2010 the disparities these groups experience , inter alia in infant mortality rate , childhood immunization , HIV / AIDS , heart disease , cancer and contagious diseases ;  
Urges Governments to counter social exclusion and marginalization of racial , ethnic , cultural , religious , linguistic and national minorities , in particular by providing de facto equal access to education , health services , employment and housing ;  
The World Conference also requests States to take additional steps to protect economic , political , social and cultural rights on a non-discriminatory basis , by ensuring an increase in the delivery of public services and access to social justice and rights for indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities ;  
Invites Urges States to promote and support where appropriate the organization and operation of enterprises owned by indigenous people , people of minority descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities by favouring / facilitating equal / promoting equal access to credits and training programmes ;  
Urges / invites Governments , the private sector and international [ financial ] institutions , [ particularly / including the World Bank and regional development banks ] , to promote participation by persons belonging to / members of all groups , including [ minority groups ] individuals and groups affected by or vulnerable to racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , in economic , cultural and social decision-making at all stages and levels [ in the development and implementation of poverty alleviation strategies , development projects , and trade and market assistance programmes ] ;  
It also urges them to provide the mainstream education with an accurate presentation of the history of the State , highlighting the contributions of the individuals and groups from different cultures and civilizations of the region and the world , including the role that indigenous people , people of African descent , Roma , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups and minorities have played in building national identifies ; 
Greater emphasis should be placed on teaching the history of national , racial , linguistic , cultural , religious and ethnic minorities [ and of the history of neighbouring countries ] with the aim of achieving mutual respect and understanding for others culture , religion or history / as well as of their contribution to the whole civil society ;  
Calls upon Calls uponStrongly recommends to participating States to introduce , or encourage the introduction of , or reinforce , human rights education , including promoting anti-racism , with a view to combating prejudices which lead to racial discrimination and to promoting understanding , tolerance and friendship between different racial or ethnic groups in school curricula and in institutions of higher education and to support public formal and non-formal education programmes designed to promote cultural diversity and self-esteem of vulnerable groups ;  
For the purposes of effectively combating racism and racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance in the civil , political , economic , social and cultural fields , the World Conference recommends to all Member States that their national legislative framework in criminal , civil and administrative law should expressly and specifically prohibit discrimination on grounds of actual or presumed racial , ethnic or national origin , religion and belief and provide effective judicial and other remedies or redress , including through the designation of national , independent , specialized bodies .  
Urges States to acknowledge that the centuries-long slave trade , enslavement and other forms of servitude of Africans , people of African descent and indigenous peoples have resulted in substantial and lasting economic , political and cultural damage to these peoples and in the retardation of their institutions and societies , and that justice now requires that to alleviate the inequalities that still persist because of these shameful legacies , substantial national and international efforts be made .  
Furthermore it urges them to work in partnership at the national , regional and international levels to develop appropriate policy tools that facilitate the development of legislation , policies and programmes that take into account ethnic , racial , linguistic , religious and cultural diversity ;  
[ Calls upon all relevant United Nations organs to endeavour to bring the foreign occupation of Jerusalem by Israel , together with all its racist practices , to an end , and to ensure the recognition of Jerusalem as a city of reverence and religious sanctity for the three major religions of the world which should serve as a focal point of historical and cultural inspiration , a symbol of civilization and religious dialogue and an epitome of tolerance and equality ] ;  
Urges States and financial and development institutions to mitigate the negative effects of globalization by examining how their policies and practices affect indigenous peoples ; by ensuring that their policies and practices contribute to the eradication of racism through the participation of indigenous peoples in development projects in accordance with the principle of informed consent ; by democratizing international financial institutions ; by developing enforceable codes of conduct for transnational corporations ; and by consulting with indigenous peoples in any matter that may affect their physical , spiritual or cultural integrity ;  
In the above-mentioned resolution , the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to prepare a report on human rights and cultural diversity , taking into account the views of Member States , relevant United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations , as well as the considerations in the resolution regarding the recognition and importance of cultural diversity among all peoples ; and decided to continue consideration of the question at its fifty-sixth session under the item entitled Human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
It implies a commitment to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms , particularly the rights of groups that are disadvantaged or victims of discrimination and persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and cultural minorities to have free access to the expression of their own culture and that of others .  
The right to food is the right to have regular , permanent and unobstructed access , either directly or by means of financial purchases , to quantitatively and qualitatively adequate and sufficient food corresponding to the cultural traditions of the people to which the consumer belongs , and which ensures a physical and mental , individual and collective , fulfilling and dignified life free from anxiety .  
However , even the poorest country is bound to ensure the highest level their resources will permit and , at the very least , a basic minimum level of economic , social and cultural rights . 20 The concept of progressive realization can not be used to justify persistent injustice and inequality . 
Even when economic , social and cultural rights are laid down in national constitutions , they are often considered guidelines for Governments , rather than individual rights that are enforceable in the courts .  
It also argues , in paragraph 10 of its General Comment No . 9 , that to put economic , social and cultural rights beyond the reach of courts is arbitrary and incompatible with the international principle that those rights are indivisible and interdependent with civil and political rights .  
In contrast to economic , social and cultural rights , international humanitarian law is not subject to progressive realization , but must always be implemented immediately .  
Clearly economic , social , cultural and hence nutritional situations tend to be extremely varied from one country to another and a model law would fail to address the problems experienced by people in their everyday lives and produce legislative solutions ill-adapted to legal and political systems in different countries .  
The Ministers noted with appreciation enhanced CEI cooperation in the fields of promoting sustainable social , economic and ecological development , infrastructure and private sector investment , SME development , transborder and interregional cooperation ( such as the enhanced Szeged Process ) , human resource development , cultural as well as scientific and technological cooperation ( such as the Italian-Slovenian transfrontier television project ) , including in the field of geodesy , combating organized crime , protection of minorities , womens entrepreneurship and youth affairs .  
All this may give rise to interference by mercenaries who , motivated by payment , may commit terrorist acts , attacks against persons , cultural objects or economic facilities , engage in illicit trafficking , or provoke armed or other conflicts with a view to carrying out violent and destabilizing assignments which have a profound impact on the enjoyment of human rights .  
Article 1 of the Treaty establishing the Community refers to the establishment of an overall economic union based on the implementation of a strategy by means of development plans that are complementary to the national development plans of member States and that include investment in the agricultural , industrial , social and cultural fields and in energy , and it looks towards the financial future of the Community with every confidence . 
The Preparatory Committee drew up a list of participants in the conference , including all Member States of the United Nations and observers , the various related components of the United Nations secretariat , specialized agencies , UNESCO chairs in the field of human rights and interreligious dialogue , treaty and non-treaty human rights mechanisms regional organizations , international organizations of an educational or cultural nature , national and regional human rights institutes , national human rights commissions , and experts from religious or confessional groups and non-governmental organizations .  
However , it must always be borne in mind that the task is complicated by the fact that it is not merely a question of combating laws , regulations and policies , but also of combating cultural practices that are rooted in collective memory and in the deep ancestral beliefs of people , including women themselves , and that , sometimes these harmful practices , although often contrary to religions , are perpetuated in the name of religion , or imputed to religion .  
One might therefore consider that action for the promotion of human rights should involve , on the one hand , action for the establishment , consolidation and protection of democracy , as an expression of human rights on the political level , and , on the other , action aimed at limiting and reducing extreme poverty and promoting the rights of individuals and peoples to development , as an expression of human rights and of economic , social and cultural solidarity among human beings .  
Those rights concern historical , cultural and ethnic identity , the juridical identity of indigenous communities , communal possession of traditional lands , bilingual and intercultural education , the preservation of indigenous heritage , measures to promote human development and participation in the management of their natural resources .  6 .  Argentina has established a National Institute against Discrimination , Xenophobia and Racism , a decentralized body within the framework of the Ministry of the Interior .  
Following the establishment of the Republic of Yemen in 1990 , which ushered in an era of democratization and active civil institutions , the number of non-governmental organizations and institutions engaged in activities relating to the protection and promotion of human rights in general or focusing on a particular field , such as political , civil , economic or cultural rights or protection of the rights of a specific section of society , such as women , children or the disabled , increased considerably and currently amounts to about 2,000 .  
This illegal action , which was authorized by the Israeli high court , aims to alter the legal status and the religious and cultural character of Occupied Jerusalem , in flagrant violation of relevant Security Council resolutions and the fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 1949 . 
Subscribes to the remarks of the expert to the effect that various obstacles linked to the realization of the right of everyone to drinking water supply and sanitation seriously impede the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , and that equality is an essential element for effective participation in the realization of the right to development and the right to a healthy environment ;  
Recommends to the Commission on Human Rights that it authorize the Sub-Commission to appoint Mr . El Hadji Guiss as Special Rapporteur to conduct a detailed study on the relationship between the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights and the promotion of the realization of the right to drinking water supply and sanitation , at national and international level , taking also into account questions related to the realization of the right to development , in order to determine the most effective means of reinforcing activities in this field ;  
A number of interventions recalled article 1 of the Declaration on the Right to Development of 1986 , which stated that The right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
In the opinion of Qatar , the right of peoples to self-determination is one of the most important ones acquired in the field of human rights , yet ongoing occupation is unquestionably impeding the development of international economic cooperation , preventing the social and cultural advancement of peoples subjected to occupation and negating the ideal of universal peace to which the United Nations is aspiring .  
Mindful that , in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , the World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , reaffirmed that the human person was the central subject of development and underlined the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,  
Reaffirming that , as declared in article 28 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in the Universal Declaration can be fully realized and that , as declared in article 25 , paragraph 1 , everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the full realization of economic , social and cultural rights ,  
Recalling that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his or her economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his or her civil and political rights ,  
Recalling also Commission resolution 2001 / 31 on human rights and extreme poverty , in which the Commission expressed its deep concern that 53 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continued to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness were particularly severe in developing countries , while acknowledging the achievements made in many parts of the world ,  
Reaffirming the objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations on achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without discrimination or distinction as to race , colour , sex , social class , descent , national or ethnic origin , language or religion ,  
Noting that in its resolution 52 / 111 of 12 December 1997 , in which it decided to convene the World Conference against Racism , Racial Discrimination , Xenophobia and Related Intolerance , the General Assembly set as one of the main objectives of the Conference the review of the political , historical , social , cultural and other factors leading to racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Considers it essential that the international community continue to follow very closely the situation of women and girls in the territories controlled by Afghan armed groups and bring the necessary pressure to bear so that all the restrictions imposed on women , which constitute flagrant and systematic violations of all the internationally recognized economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights , are removed ;  
In addition , Article 1 calls for achieving international cooperation to solve international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
As a result of a deliberate policy methodically implemented by Turkey in the occupied areas of Cyprus , the cultural identity of the northern part of the island , which dates back to the seventh millennium BC , is in grave danger of being permanently and completely destroyed .  
He recognized the interconnectedness of economics and politics and made a reference to the universally recognized understanding that all rights civil , political , economic , social and cultural , and the right to development are indivisible and interconnected .  
To all the parties to the conflict , political parties and key sectors of civil society in the country : ( a ) that they commit themselves fully and in good faith to the Inter-Congolese Dialogue , avoiding pointless arguments and always keeping their eyes on the goal the establishment of a democratic , participatory system and full respect for civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
In paragraph 32 of its concluding observations on the initial report of Israel , the Committee requested the State party to provide additional information on the realization of economic , social and cultural rights in the occupied territories , in order to complete the State partys initial report and thereby ensure full compliance with its reporting obligations .  
The Committee reminds the State party that even during armed conflict , fundamental human rights must be respected and that basic economic , social and cultural rights as part of the minimum standards of human rights are guaranteed under customary international law and are also prescribed by international humanitarian law .  
The Committee expresses its deep concern about the State partys continuing gross violations of economic , social and cultural rights in the occupied territories , especially the severe measures adopted by the State party to restrict the movement of civilians between points within and outside the occupied territories , severing their access to food , water , health care , education and work .  
Recognizing the importance , from an analytical and operational point of view , of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development and of the need for comprehensive , coherent and effective policies on international migration based on the spirit of genuine partnership and common understanding ,  
High rates of unemployment , in particular among young people , the non-functioning of the national safety net system , scarce opportunities for private investment , declining domestic production and other financial , cultural and criminal factors have contributed to political instability .  
The effects have included a major decline in the countrys gross domestic product and in per capita income ; a sharp increase in mortality rates , especially among mothers and children ; marked deterioration in infrastructure , especially in connection with the water supply , sewerage , electricity and hospitals and health centres ; a drop in school enrolment to 53 per cent and the consequent cultural and scientific impoverishment ; and the destruction of the social fabric .  
Despite the indivisible nature of Euro-Mediterranean security and despite the promises of partnership that have been reiterated on many occasions , the Mediterranean , as a recent declaration of the European Parliament declared , has become a zone that is a microcosm of the principal contradictions of the twenty-first century and is likely to produce irreversible demographic , economic , political and cultural divisions .  
In the developing countries generally , limited infrastructure , inadequate regulatory systems , access costs and lack of human resources were serious handicaps to connectivity and the use of information and communication technologies , which were , moreover , not geared to their languages or their social and cultural contexts . 
A worldwide campaign of solidarity was needed to meet all those growing challenges with a view to strengthening international cooperation and transparency based on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations , and of international law , namely , equality among States , non-intervention in the internal affairs of States , the right of peoples to self-defence , to self-determination and to oppose foreign occupation , and respect for cultural diversity and diversity of beliefs .  
On instructions from His Highness Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan , President of the United Arab Emirates , to make the individual in that State the pivot and the purpose of national development endeavours , the State had adopted legislation , policies and plans aimed at developing national human resources through the development and modernization of educational , health and cultural institutions and the establishment of centres to train young people and develop their scientific and technological skills in accordance with national development needs .  
At the same time , many delegates stressed that democracy was inconceivable without human rights and , in particular , the rights of women , children and minorities , and that it requires the gradual expansion of political space in order to guarantee the full exercise of the political , economic , social and cultural rights of all .  
In my view , the benchmark for a sustainable democracy is the extent to which a State acts in accordance with universal and indivisible human rights : the civil and political rights , as well as the economic , social and cultural rights defined in international human rights law .  
Equally aware of the fact that older women , in all regions of the world , represent an important human resource , and that their contribution to society and development in the economic , cultural , political and social fields often remains unseen or unrecognized ,  
The interlinkages between international migration and development were complex in the sense that they brought into play a multiplicity of factors economic , technological , demographic , social , ecological , historical and cultural depending on regional characteristics .  
Recognizing that the right of human beings to live free from fear and poverty can not be realized unless , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the other international human rights instruments , conditions are created enabling all human beings to enjoy to the full their economic , social and cultural rights , as well as their civil and political rights ,  
Recalling also that in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , the international community commits itself to treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis , bearing in mind the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds .  
Considering that there is a close relationship between the realization of economic , social and cultural rights and the realization of civil and political rights , since the various categories of rights constitute an indissoluble whole based on recognition of the dignity of the human person and therefore require permanent protection and promotion with a view to ensuring their full realization , so that there can never be any justification for violating one category of rights in order to realize others ,  
Considering that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent , and interrelated , and that the promotion and observance of economic , social and cultural rights are consubstantial with integrated development , equitable economic growth and the consolidation of democracy in the States of the region ,  
Reaffirming that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are mutually supportive concepts : democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural regime and their full participation in all aspects of life . 
Express their determination to prevent and attenuate the adverse effects of globalization and to develop to the maximum the benefits of globalization by strengthening cooperation , with a view to improving and expanding opportunities for trade , economic growth and sustainable development and , through the use of new technologies , increasing cultural exchanges , thereby preserving and promoting cultural diversity ;  
Emphasize that there are principal victims of the violations of economic , social and cultural rights , in particular indigenous peoples , migrants , persons of African origin , the unemployed , uneducated children , women , older persons , persons with a disability and other persons in situations subject to more severe discrimination , and call on States to adopt specific action to meet their needs ;  
Recognize the primary role to be played by the private sector in the exercise of economic , social and cultural rights , and call for joint action with Governments and civil society ;  
It is recommended that the executive , judicial and legislative branches , together with the private sector and civil society , act together to promote the exercise of economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development ;  
The States of the region are asked to undertake to develop and implement national plans of action for human rights covering the entire range of human rights , especially economic , social and cultural rights , through a participatory process which includes civil society ;  
It is recommended that States give broad dissemination , especially among the members of the judiciary , to the international obligations that exist in the area of economic , social and cultural rights , and ensure that the necessary professional groups are trained , including those concerned with law enforcement and with human rights education at all levels of instruction ;  
International and regional organizations and the principal international and regional financial and development institutions are asked to evaluate the impact of their policies and programmes on the enjoyment of human rights , especially economic , social and cultural rights ;  
Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,  
In Central America we have made great progress , not only in the process of transition involving painstaking work in the area of pacifying , disarming and reintegrating armed groups into civil life , as well as campaigns to promote tolerance and peaceful coexistence and integration into political , social and cultural life but also in creating awareness among our peoples about the need to develop a culture of peace , which is closely related to the promotion of civic and democratic values .  
Recognize the importance of the transparent and jointly responsible participation of civil society , including the main groups identified in Agenda 21 , in the design , implementation and follow-up of sustainable development policies and of regional and international commitments on these matters , and that it is essential to strengthen the cultural , educational and environmental training base that makes it possible to engage civil society in the achievement of sustainable development .  
Decision makers at all levels need timely , reliable access to the knowledge generated by science and engineering to introduce rational policies that reflect a better understanding of complex technical , economic , social , cultural and ethical issues concerning society , the earth , and its environment .  
To achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion .  
Consequently , the entire range of civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well as the right to development , are relevant to intellectual property systems .  
The Sub-Commission has particularly strengthened its expertise in the area of economic , social and cultural rights , and that expertise is manifesting itself in the development of the Social Forum and a number of thoughtful and timely studies and resolutions , including those on globalization , international trade and human rights , the effect of intellectual property on human rights , and the relationship between businesses and human rights .  
Globalization and its consequences , which may limit the possibility of achieving sustainable development in the Arab region , and the need to set up the Arab region in line with its own economic and institutional conditions and create a strong Arab regional bloc based on the regions cultural , civilizational and economic constituents ;  
Activities : Two workshops were held from 22 to 27 October : ( i ) application of international human rights norms by domestic courts and tribunals ; and ( ii ) the elaboration of strategies for the promotion and protection of economic , social and cultural rights . 
Take concrete measures to promote equality based on the elimination of gender and racial prejudice in all fields , through , inter alia , improving access to education , health care , employment and other basic services to promote full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights for all women and girls ;  
The implementation of a comprehensive United Nations programme to assist States , at their request , in developing and implementing national human rights plans of action strengthening , inter alia , national structures having an impact on democracy and the rule of law ; to establish national institutions to give effect to the right to development and economic , social and cultural rights ; and also to assist States , at their request , within the respective mandates of the Secretariat / Office of the High Commissioner , in the process of ratifying United Nations human rights instruments ;  
His approach to human rights is global and comprehensive , thus including civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ; he intends to pay serious attention to poverty as a fundamental human rights issue ;  
There was a need to give legal meaning and support to economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development at the domestic level ; concrete steps should be taken to entrench those rights in constitutions and ensure their justiciability as human rights and not mere aspirations ; judges and lawyers had an important role and responsibility in that regard ; their independence must be safeguarded by Governments ;  
Monitor the observation , collection and analysis of legal , institutional , political , economic , social and cultural information by drawing on the skills of treaty bodies and national institutions for regulation and mediation ;  
Special legislation , enforced by the cooperative sector , should allow cooperative associations to promote integral development but with special attention to economic , legal , administrative , social and cultural issues .  
The failure of HKSAR to establish a national human rights institution with a broad mandate and its failure to establish adequate alternative arrangements for the promotion of economic , social and cultural rights ;  
Persecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender as defined in paragraph 3 , or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law , in connection with any act referred to in this paragraph or any crime within the jurisdiction of the Court ;  
The publication of the portrait or photograph of a person shall be free only for information , scientific , cultural or teaching purposes or where it is connected with events or circumstances in the public or social interest , provided that the prestige or reputation of the person is not thereby diminished and that the publication is not contrary to morality or proper practice ;  
Include in their regular reporting to their boards of governors information on their contributions to promoting the participation of people of African descent , indigenous peoples and other marginalized groups within their organizations , and information on their efforts to facilitate the participation of racial , ethnic , religious , cultural and other minorities in the economic , social , political and cultural life of their countries ;  
Item 10 : An open-ended working group established to elaborate policy guidelines on structural adjustment programmes and economic , social and cultural rights is provisionally scheduled to meet from 25 February to 8 March 2002 ;
