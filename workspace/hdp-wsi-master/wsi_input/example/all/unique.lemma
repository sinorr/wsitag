The imposing Presidential Palace 's forbidden places are no longer unapproachable . The Presidential Palace does not combine working space and living quarters as do the White House or Buckingham Palace , which can reveal markedly different styles of interior design through the deliberate arrangement of chambers and gardens by the successive occupants . Nevertheless , for the average citizen , the Presidential Palace holds its own unique charisma .  
China 's Minority Peoples For photographers anxious to free themselves from commonplace and boring subjects , China 's ethnic minorities , with their unique customs , rustic appearances , colorful , varied clothing , and rugged , lofty mountains as a backdrop , hold a glamor that is difficult to express .  
No matter whether you are talking about the Tatun Mountains or the tail end of the Huoshan and Hsuehshan Mountains toward Keelung , anyone looking from a ship at sea would not have seen some narrow , specific little point . Perhaps we will never be able to figure out which place it was that inspired " Formosa , " but the most reasonable explanation still seems to be that ships were passing Taiwan 's northern edge . This theory also says something about the unique aesthetic of this region 's coastline . "  
These included the rites for weddings , funerals , birthdays , and anniversaries , as well as the ways to dispel bad luck or to correct malevolent influences . Chien Cheng-tung is , like Lin , a consultant for the annual Taipei Chinese Food Festival , though Chien has chosen the career path of being a hotel chef . He says that it is their understanding of proper traditional rituals that makes the bando master chefs unique , and it 's something that hotel chefs lack .  
A food supply is the most basic of human needs , and farm produce is the last bastion of protectionism in the ROC ; it is also the segment most prone to sensitive price fluctuations . This situation is not unique to Taiwan , but is common throughout the world . Fortunately , except for agricultural produce , most household items , domestic appliances , cosmetics and so on were thrown open to free competition earlier , and so have already entered an era of more stable prices in line with those in advanced countries worldwide .  
At that time I was still young , and I escaped the dreadful fate of many old scholars and authors . Like countless millions of my compatriots I merely injected my spirited youthful emotions to that unique system of thought , and became part of a unified political machine , making my mind utter unfeeling cries .  
For instance , I used to get into earnest discussions with everyone about artistic methods and schools and about what was unique to Chinese art . But after I read the Western masters I discovered that they had thought about many of these issues hundreds or even thousands of years ago , and I found that those things which I deemed so special about Chinese art also exist in Western culture . And so in looking back , those past discussions seem pretty laughable .  
Later , so the story goes , when the Song dynasty gourmet and literary giant Su Dongpo was demoted and sent to serve as an official at Huanggang in Hubei Province , to satisfy his palate in that remote , impoverished place he used cheap local pork to make his own unique version of spice-stewed meat . His recipe was passed down and grew popular , and came to be known as Dongpo Meat ; it is considered one of his greatest " achievements in office . "  
A soil researcher , Professor Wu says that the red clay widely distributed in tropical countries is usually barren , and it is difficult to coax a good crop from it . However , Chuang Yu-long has overcome this problem , and could rightly be called a model of success in organic farming . When he has the time , in the future Wu plans to write down Chuang 's unique farming experiences .  
However , a permanent solution to the problem was still required after the crisis abated . Thus , Taiwan , which because of its limited land area and dense population has developed unique intensive rice-farming techniques , stepped forward to play a major role in bringing about a kind of " green revolution . "  
Taiwan is by no means unique in encountering a growing number of elderly following rapid economic gains and improvements in the quality of medical care . The experiences of the advanced industrial nations in confronting these problems can serve as a reference for us , but we still need to do some basic homework : carrying out surveys about the different elderly age groups here and achieving general recognition of these problems and a consensus about how to deal with them .  
Wu Yii-feng emphasizes that the most unique characteristic of a documentary film is the relationship established between the film maker and the subject . " It 's unavoidable that the camera will be an intrusion . The key thing is whether or not this intrusion is uncomfortable to people , or whether or not that which is captured on film was staged deliberately . "  
Chunghsing Village was modeled after English communities . Over 40 years ago , it was unique in Taiwan for its waste water treatment and rain water drainage systems , its specially planted camphor trees , bodhi trees , and assorted grasses and plants , giving the entire village plentiful greenery and shade .  
As early as 1975 , brain specialists had discovered that the cerebral cortex , unique to primates , was responsible for intellectual activities such as language and reasoning . The limbic system lies below the cortex and pre-dates it . Sometimes called the " mammalian brain , " it is involved in the expression of emotions . On the lowest level lies the brain stem , sometimes called the reptilian brain .  
Colliding tectonic plates thrust sharp , easily eroded mountains up to high elevations from whence heavy rainfall , landslides , and river action carry the mountains back to sea bit by bit . Taiwan 's 151 rivers , which total nearly 3,000 kilometers in length , are a key part of this " wheel of life . " They have carved out some of the world 's most unique gorges in the east , and in the west have deposited the soil that makes up the most productive and beautiful plains on the island .  
Many music industry insiders in both Taiwan and the mainland agree that her former producer , the late Chang Yu-sheng , played a huge role in A-Mei 's rise to stardom . In songs like " Sisters " and " Bad Boy , " Chang masterfully brought out the " feral intensity of this small-town aboriginal girl . " Chang used distinctive lyrics , catchy tunes , A-Mei 's unique image , and an effective PR strategy to great advantage . Xiao Ke points to another example of slick promotion in the Taiwanese pop music industry .  
This outstanding editor had his own conception of modern Chinese history , and a unique understanding of where to go , who to seek out , what to ask them to write about and how it should be written . No wonder , then , that he never felt able to pass on the heavy burden of editorship , or that right up until he finally succumbed to his illness he was still reviewing articles , and left behind enough publication-ready material to fill several issues .  
To be fair , the National Assembly does have its unique set of duties and powers under the existing structure , thus few people are ready to call for its complete abolition . This is especially notable given the ambiguity of Taiwan 's constitutional structure , seeing as it is not a presidential system , a cabinet system , or a two-headed system in the true sense .  
Perhaps out of a woman 's unique empathy for the disadvantaged , Chang Fu-mei is particularly concerned with issues that ordinarily seem inconsequential to politicians and the media . When a female postal worker complained of discriminatory testing , and a young man suffered constant harassment by tax authorities after his ID card was used for someone else 's tax file , Chang took their cases to administrative authorities for the fair treatment they deserved . In her view , such efforts represent her most worthy accomplishments .  
With modern science taking steps toward the spiritual world , " Taiwan is naturally best situated to take a world-leading role in this work . " Lee Si-chen points out that both Taoism and Buddhism have unique views about the operations of the universe . Furthermore , the Chinese in Taiwan have inherited from their ancestors both the active practice of qigong ( the movement of internal energy ) and the reflective practice of meditation . Research into these has been extensive , to a degree unimaginable in the West .  
Furthermore , the Kuroshio current and the mainland coastal current converge here , the upwelling current off Taiwan 's eastern rift valley brings up organic salts from the ocean depths , and a seabed valley forms a natural barrier . Under these conditions , many organisms have developed into unique species , and the sea off Ilan contains a cornucopia of marine life .  
It is necessary because within a single nation , different local governments take in different amounts of revenue due to their unique geographic , environmental , and economic conditions . The central government can not sit idly by while people in certain areas are unable to enjoy basic government services , so it uses various means to alleviate revenue shortfalls where they exist . The Tax Redistribution Fund is one such method .  
Yeh Wen-chi emphasizes that the natural history of each dragonfly species is unique , and it is hard to generalize . For instance , the protected giant spiketail only breeds once in three years . It does not fit the general pattern of insects which live fleeting lives and may produce several generations a year .  
As well as encouraging the local people to constantly enhance their tea growing and processing skills , he devotes even more energy to managing the " tea culture " to which tea has given rise , including by-products such as tea pastries and similar light refreshments . But far more important , is to draw deeply on Pinglin 's unique and refined qualities as a tea district and imbue the hearts and minds of local inhabitants and visitors alike with a deep appreciation of tea culture .  
The local people have formed a fish conservation team and as a result the Peishih River is now protected . Many prized species of Taiwanese fish are being propagated . In the pristine forests are ancient pine forests with species unique to Taiwan , and the deep blue skies attract waves of students to Pinglin to camp out and observe the stars .  
There is still a long way to go before E . vermicola can be developed into a biocontrol for the pine wood nematode . But this fungus , which the electron microscope reveals to have a stalk like a mushroom and a cap shaped like a traditional Chinese gold or silver ingot , is just as much an endemic species , unique to Taiwan , as the treasured Formosan sika deer or Formosan landlocked salmon .  
Chen 's real worry is that state-run opera troupes , which are the dominant force in mainland China 's gezai xi , may no longer be so good at extemporaneous adaptation , and it may be difficult for different troupes to develop their own unique styles . After all , the performers earn a fixed salary , use standardized scripts , and sing a set repertoire of songs .  
When the weather in Taiwan 's low-lands begins to gradually turn cool , in the island 's high mountains the mercury is already plummeting , and all kinds of living things are getting ready for their winter rest . But despite the cold , high up on Mt . Hehuan , Yushan , Mt . Ali and elsewhere one can often see a unique Taiwanese bird species-the collared bush robin-hopping busily along the ground alone in search of food , like a solitary little knight-errant .  
WTO membership will be a blow to many agricultural counties , but in recent years tourist farms have sprouted up . These new operations offer rural residents a new way to make a living by offering visitors a taste of specialty products and unique local cultural attractions . Many novel ideas , like liquor-producing towns , and farming villages specializing in vanilla and other local crops , have appeared .  
Only 11 and a half years old at the time , Yu-ju had a unique experience one twilight evening while participating in a white-robe meditation session . With everyone swaying to the rhythm of religious music , she saw many points of silver light hovering in the air above the seat where Osho 's founder used to sit when he was alive .  
At the same time , his work is quite unique : dreamy soft landscapes like Monet 's with sharp , abstract , eye-catching colors . When he paints people , the beautiful women of his paintings always have clear and bright eyes that are overly large for their faces . When he paints reflections in water , the reflections are clearer than what they are reflecting . Things in the background of his paintings might be overly large , and things in the foreground overly small . . . .

Both spiders and insects are arthropods , but they have very different body patterns . Insects have six legs and a distinct head , thorax and abdomen , but spiders ' bodies are divided into only a " cephalothorax " ( combined head and thorax ) and abdomen , along with eight hairy legs that may be many times longer than the size of their bodies . They are very unique in form , and have some remarkable physical attributes . Spiders have fully developed digestive , circulatory , respiratory and nervous systems .

He called it " Lost in Dense Clouds . "  
In 1993 , this celebrated artist sold his paintings at Sotheby 's for prices that stunned the art world , only to put down his paintbrush a few years later .

Following this success , Huang took up painting again and continued to create his unique kingdom of colors .  
Huang Ming-che cut an impressive figure among his generation of young painters , the more so because through his engagement with Western masters close to his own sensibility , he continuously rediscovered where he needed to go .

He gradually developed his own style and found new techniques to express it . His painting style evolved from Taiwanese localism to sentimentalism .  
Taiwan has a long history of live performance , from simple shows held in crude tents , to fancy choreographed acts with crystal stages and catwalks , and everything in between .

Intending to prevent a recurrence of Bunun resistance and because it was difficult to keep the garrison roads in good repair in the deep mountain areas , the Japanese government went a step further and forced a mass displacement of the Bunun down the mountain to the lower reaches of the Lakulaku River on the Huatung Valley plain . Through contact with the Han Chinese and the Amis people living there , the unique characteristics of Bunun mountain culture were gradually lost .  
Due to Taiwan 's unique geographical position and diverse alpine terrain , as well as the numerous avenues for the immigration of new species-including transport by ocean currents , settlement by migratory birds , the mass migration of species during the ice age when Taiwan and the Chinese mainland were connected-the high level of biodiversity on the island greatly exceeds that of any other place on Earth .  
Roan Ching-yueh , well-known writer and architect , has commented that Taiwan architects are often high above the crowd , separated from the average person by an unbridgeable gap , but the works of Chen Shih-liang " exhibit a desire to make a very friendly connection , " and foster a genuine , enjoyable conversation between those who study the aesthetics of architectural space up in their ivory towers and the people who actually use architectural space .

" Besides the climatic and geographic advantages , this area has a unique background in terms of human history , " states Chen Chung . If hundreds of years ago Chinese had not flooded into Taiwan and occupied all the lowlying land , the Aboriginal peoples would never have been forced to move to high altitudes .

Decoration costs and rising rents were soon reflected in menu prices , and " sometimes their meals were more pricey than any ordinary restaurant . " Mr . Yang maintains that once beer parlors started charging stiff prices and had lost the advantage of novelty all the charm went out of them , their unique atmosphere evaporated and their business started tailing off .  
Despite Taiwan 's small size , its tropical and sub-tropical climate and unique geography mean that it has a rich flora , many original varieties of which retain excellent characteristics .

"  
The custom of raising havoc in the bridal chamber reaches back into the mists of Chinese history ; maybe it really is a " unique treasure of Chinese culture . " But as it has changed and evolved through countless generations , perhaps it has lost its original meaning , and even become a controversial practice which smacks of abusing the bride .  
The symbolic meaning of " tribe " : If you mention the harvest or new year 's festivals of the nine tribes , most people will have a stereotyped impression of a night spent singing , dancing , and drinking but will know nothing of their background or of how these unique cultural phenomena were distilled over time from tribal experience .

The imposing Presidential Palace 's forbidden places are no longer unapproachable . The Presidential Palace does not combine working space and living quarters as do the White House or Buckingham Palace , which can reveal markedly different styles of interior design through the deliberate arrangement of chambers and gardens by the successive occupants . Nevertheless , for the average citizen , the Presidential Palace holds its own unique charisma .  
China 's Minority Peoples For photographers anxious to free themselves from commonplace and boring subjects , China 's ethnic minorities , with their unique customs , rustic appearances , colorful , varied clothing , and rugged , lofty mountains as a backdrop , hold a glamor that is difficult to express .  
No matter whether you are talking about the Tatun Mountains or the tail end of the Huoshan and Hsuehshan Mountains toward Keelung , anyone looking from a ship at sea would not have seen some narrow , specific little point . Perhaps we will never be able to figure out which place it was that inspired " Formosa , " but the most reasonable explanation still seems to be that ships were passing Taiwan 's northern edge . This theory also says something about the unique aesthetic of this region 's coastline . "  
These included the rites for weddings , funerals , birthdays , and anniversaries , as well as the ways to dispel bad luck or to correct malevolent influences . Chien Cheng-tung is , like Lin , a consultant for the annual Taipei Chinese Food Festival , though Chien has chosen the career path of being a hotel chef . He says that it is their understanding of proper traditional rituals that makes the bando master chefs unique , and it 's something that hotel chefs lack .  
A food supply is the most basic of human needs , and farm produce is the last bastion of protectionism in the ROC ; it is also the segment most prone to sensitive price fluctuations . This situation is not unique to Taiwan , but is common throughout the world . Fortunately , except for agricultural produce , most household items , domestic appliances , cosmetics and so on were thrown open to free competition earlier , and so have already entered an era of more stable prices in line with those in advanced countries worldwide .  
At that time I was still young , and I escaped the dreadful fate of many old scholars and authors . Like countless millions of my compatriots I merely injected my spirited youthful emotions to that unique system of thought , and became part of a unified political machine , making my mind utter unfeeling cries .  
For instance , I used to get into earnest discussions with everyone about artistic methods and schools and about what was unique to Chinese art . But after I read the Western masters I discovered that they had thought about many of these issues hundreds or even thousands of years ago , and I found that those things which I deemed so special about Chinese art also exist in Western culture . And so in looking back , those past discussions seem pretty laughable .  
Later , so the story goes , when the Song dynasty gourmet and literary giant Su Dongpo was demoted and sent to serve as an official at Huanggang in Hubei Province , to satisfy his palate in that remote , impoverished place he used cheap local pork to make his own unique version of spice-stewed meat . His recipe was passed down and grew popular , and came to be known as Dongpo Meat ; it is considered one of his greatest " achievements in office . "  
A soil researcher , Professor Wu says that the red clay widely distributed in tropical countries is usually barren , and it is difficult to coax a good crop from it . However , Chuang Yu-long has overcome this problem , and could rightly be called a model of success in organic farming . When he has the time , in the future Wu plans to write down Chuang 's unique farming experiences .  
However , a permanent solution to the problem was still required after the crisis abated . Thus , Taiwan , which because of its limited land area and dense population has developed unique intensive rice-farming techniques , stepped forward to play a major role in bringing about a kind of " green revolution . "  
Taiwan is by no means unique in encountering a growing number of elderly following rapid economic gains and improvements in the quality of medical care . The experiences of the advanced industrial nations in confronting these problems can serve as a reference for us , but we still need to do some basic homework : carrying out surveys about the different elderly age groups here and achieving general recognition of these problems and a consensus about how to deal with them .  
Wu Yii-feng emphasizes that the most unique characteristic of a documentary film is the relationship established between the film maker and the subject . " It 's unavoidable that the camera will be an intrusion . The key thing is whether or not this intrusion is uncomfortable to people , or whether or not that which is captured on film was staged deliberately . "  
Chunghsing Village was modeled after English communities . Over 40 years ago , it was unique in Taiwan for its waste water treatment and rain water drainage systems , its specially planted camphor trees , bodhi trees , and assorted grasses and plants , giving the entire village plentiful greenery and shade .  
As early as 1975 , brain specialists had discovered that the cerebral cortex , unique to primates , was responsible for intellectual activities such as language and reasoning . The limbic system lies below the cortex and pre-dates it . Sometimes called the " mammalian brain , " it is involved in the expression of emotions . On the lowest level lies the brain stem , sometimes called the reptilian brain .  
Colliding tectonic plates thrust sharp , easily eroded mountains up to high elevations from whence heavy rainfall , landslides , and river action carry the mountains back to sea bit by bit . Taiwan 's 151 rivers , which total nearly 3,000 kilometers in length , are a key part of this " wheel of life . " They have carved out some of the world 's most unique gorges in the east , and in the west have deposited the soil that makes up the most productive and beautiful plains on the island .  
Many music industry insiders in both Taiwan and the mainland agree that her former producer , the late Chang Yu-sheng , played a huge role in A-Mei 's rise to stardom . In songs like " Sisters " and " Bad Boy , " Chang masterfully brought out the " feral intensity of this small-town aboriginal girl . " Chang used distinctive lyrics , catchy tunes , A-Mei 's unique image , and an effective PR strategy to great advantage . Xiao Ke points to another example of slick promotion in the Taiwanese pop music industry .  
This outstanding editor had his own conception of modern Chinese history , and a unique understanding of where to go , who to seek out , what to ask them to write about and how it should be written . No wonder , then , that he never felt able to pass on the heavy burden of editorship , or that right up until he finally succumbed to his illness he was still reviewing articles , and left behind enough publication-ready material to fill several issues .  
To be fair , the National Assembly does have its unique set of duties and powers under the existing structure , thus few people are ready to call for its complete abolition . This is especially notable given the ambiguity of Taiwan 's constitutional structure , seeing as it is not a presidential system , a cabinet system , or a two-headed system in the true sense .  
Perhaps out of a woman 's unique empathy for the disadvantaged , Chang Fu-mei is particularly concerned with issues that ordinarily seem inconsequential to politicians and the media . When a female postal worker complained of discriminatory testing , and a young man suffered constant harassment by tax authorities after his ID card was used for someone else 's tax file , Chang took their cases to administrative authorities for the fair treatment they deserved . In her view , such efforts represent her most worthy accomplishments .  
With modern science taking steps toward the spiritual world , " Taiwan is naturally best situated to take a world-leading role in this work . " Lee Si-chen points out that both Taoism and Buddhism have unique views about the operations of the universe . Furthermore , the Chinese in Taiwan have inherited from their ancestors both the active practice of qigong ( the movement of internal energy ) and the reflective practice of meditation . Research into these has been extensive , to a degree unimaginable in the West .  
Furthermore , the Kuroshio current and the mainland coastal current converge here , the upwelling current off Taiwan 's eastern rift valley brings up organic salts from the ocean depths , and a seabed valley forms a natural barrier . Under these conditions , many organisms have developed into unique species , and the sea off Ilan contains a cornucopia of marine life .  
It is necessary because within a single nation , different local governments take in different amounts of revenue due to their unique geographic , environmental , and economic conditions . The central government can not sit idly by while people in certain areas are unable to enjoy basic government services , so it uses various means to alleviate revenue shortfalls where they exist . The Tax Redistribution Fund is one such method .  
Yeh Wen-chi emphasizes that the natural history of each dragonfly species is unique , and it is hard to generalize . For instance , the protected giant spiketail only breeds once in three years . It does not fit the general pattern of insects which live fleeting lives and may produce several generations a year .  
As well as encouraging the local people to constantly enhance their tea growing and processing skills , he devotes even more energy to managing the " tea culture " to which tea has given rise , including by-products such as tea pastries and similar light refreshments . But far more important , is to draw deeply on Pinglin 's unique and refined qualities as a tea district and imbue the hearts and minds of local inhabitants and visitors alike with a deep appreciation of tea culture .  
The local people have formed a fish conservation team and as a result the Peishih River is now protected . Many prized species of Taiwanese fish are being propagated . In the pristine forests are ancient pine forests with species unique to Taiwan , and the deep blue skies attract waves of students to Pinglin to camp out and observe the stars .  
There is still a long way to go before E . vermicola can be developed into a biocontrol for the pine wood nematode . But this fungus , which the electron microscope reveals to have a stalk like a mushroom and a cap shaped like a traditional Chinese gold or silver ingot , is just as much an endemic species , unique to Taiwan , as the treasured Formosan sika deer or Formosan landlocked salmon .  
Chen 's real worry is that state-run opera troupes , which are the dominant force in mainland China 's gezai xi , may no longer be so good at extemporaneous adaptation , and it may be difficult for different troupes to develop their own unique styles . After all , the performers earn a fixed salary , use standardized scripts , and sing a set repertoire of songs .  
When the weather in Taiwan 's low-lands begins to gradually turn cool , in the island 's high mountains the mercury is already plummeting , and all kinds of living things are getting ready for their winter rest . But despite the cold , high up on Mt . Hehuan , Yushan , Mt . Ali and elsewhere one can often see a unique Taiwanese bird species-the collared bush robin-hopping busily along the ground alone in search of food , like a solitary little knight-errant .  
WTO membership will be a blow to many agricultural counties , but in recent years tourist farms have sprouted up . These new operations offer rural residents a new way to make a living by offering visitors a taste of specialty products and unique local cultural attractions . Many novel ideas , like liquor-producing towns , and farming villages specializing in vanilla and other local crops , have appeared .  
Only 11 and a half years old at the time , Yu-ju had a unique experience one twilight evening while participating in a white-robe meditation session . With everyone swaying to the rhythm of religious music , she saw many points of silver light hovering in the air above the seat where Osho 's founder used to sit when he was alive .  
At the same time , his work is quite unique : dreamy soft landscapes like Monet 's with sharp , abstract , eye-catching colors . When he paints people , the beautiful women of his paintings always have clear and bright eyes that are overly large for their faces . When he paints reflections in water , the reflections are clearer than what they are reflecting . Things in the background of his paintings might be overly large , and things in the foreground overly small . . . .  
The Chinkuashih area has a unique , long , and complex history of geological activity . Tahan College associate professor Yu Ping-sheng , who has extensively studied the local geology , tells us that the sedimentary rock which forms the area accumulated on the ocean floor 25 million years ago .  
Both spiders and insects are arthropods , but they have very different body patterns . Insects have six legs and a distinct head , thorax and abdomen , but spiders ' bodies are divided into only a " cephalothorax " ( combined head and thorax ) and abdomen , along with eight hairy legs that may be many times longer than the size of their bodies . They are very unique in form , and have some remarkable physical attributes . Spiders have fully developed digestive , circulatory , respiratory and nervous systems .  
In April , when the tung tree blossoms bloom , Taumi is a sea of snow white . In May , pink wild peonies crop up along the mountain trails . In June , wild ginger lilies in the western part of the community begin to give off a sweet fragrance . August , meanwhile , is when the Nakai podocarp tree - " the official tree of Taumi neighborhood " and a species unique to Taiwan-begins to fruit , presenting a remarkable picture of mixed red and green seeds and seed receptacles .  
Because of Taiwan 's unique soil and climatic conditions , the island is extraordinarily rich in wild fungi . To date over 5300 mushroom species have been recorded here . In terms of global distribution , the species of fungi found in Taiwan can be divided into those that are found worldwide , those found in the northern hemisphere , those found in tropical and subtropical regions , those found in temperate and alpine regions , and those that are unique to Taiwan .  
After his understanding of the limits of the tensile and torsional strength of eggs , he used the principle of the screw to fashion an interlocking ring of five eggs . After grasping the unique qualities of eggs , he pushed his skill to a new level by nesting a set of eight different sized eggs each within the other resulting in what looked like the traditional multi-layered balls carved from elephant ivory . He called it " Lost in Dense Clouds . "  
In 1993 , this celebrated artist sold his paintings at Sotheby 's for prices that stunned the art world , only to put down his paintbrush a few years later . He then began to experiment with stainless steel and founded the Three-Dimensional Art Studio . From there emerged a series of stunning , much-talked-about sculptures erected in northern Taiwan . Following this success , Huang took up painting again and continued to create his unique kingdom of colors .  
Huang Ming-che cut an impressive figure among his generation of young painters , the more so because through his engagement with Western masters close to his own sensibility , he continuously rediscovered where he needed to go . Without turning his back on his unique artistic qualities , Huang had the courage to accept other artists ' strong points . He gradually developed his own style and found new techniques to express it . His painting style evolved from Taiwanese localism to sentimentalism .  
Taiwan has a long history of live performance , from simple shows held in crude tents , to fancy choreographed acts with crystal stages and catwalks , and everything in between . Audiences have changed their preferences in step with the changing times . Different audiences have had unique preferences and enjoyed special interactions with certain stars .  
Intending to prevent a recurrence of Bunun resistance and because it was difficult to keep the garrison roads in good repair in the deep mountain areas , the Japanese government went a step further and forced a mass displacement of the Bunun down the mountain to the lower reaches of the Lakulaku River on the Huatung Valley plain . Through contact with the Han Chinese and the Amis people living there , the unique characteristics of Bunun mountain culture were gradually lost .  
Due to Taiwan 's unique geographical position and diverse alpine terrain , as well as the numerous avenues for the immigration of new species-including transport by ocean currents , settlement by migratory birds , the mass migration of species during the ice age when Taiwan and the Chinese mainland were connected-the high level of biodiversity on the island greatly exceeds that of any other place on Earth .  
Roan Ching-yueh , well-known writer and architect , has commented that Taiwan architects are often high above the crowd , separated from the average person by an unbridgeable gap , but the works of Chen Shih-liang " exhibit a desire to make a very friendly connection , " and foster a genuine , enjoyable conversation between those who study the aesthetics of architectural space up in their ivory towers and the people who actually use architectural space . The pictures in his books almost equal the text in volume and afford the reader a unique reading experience .  
Off and on for a total of three years he plugged away , reading and meditating , achieving a solid grounding in Buddhist learning .

With a fine ink , a literatus could produce numerous hues , draw forth the endless mysteries that lie between black and white , and create unique and exquisite images . Indeed , with such ink to hand , a literatus could hardly bear to set his brush aside .  
" Besides the climatic and geographic advantages , this area has a unique background in terms of human history , " states Chen Chung . If hundreds of years ago Chinese had not flooded into Taiwan and occupied all the lowlying land , the Aboriginal peoples would never have been forced to move to high altitudes . When the Nationalist government retreated to Taiwan in 1949 , overnight the island was flooded with two million refugees and soldiers , creating an immediate shortage of arable land , and spawning an urgent need for development in the mountains .  
A six-storied building located on Waxili Baowen Blvd . was built in 1930 and suffered partial structural damage in the 1977 earthquake .  However , the unique architectural style of this building has maintained its peculiar charm and never failed to draw the admiration of passers-by .
