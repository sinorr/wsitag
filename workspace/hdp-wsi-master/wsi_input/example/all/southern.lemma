With the opening of the domestic telecommunications market , TransAsia Telecommunications won the right to operate a cellular telephone business in southern Taiwan . The company established its headquarters in Kaohsiung but could n't find a marketing manager . Eventually , the company had to go through a head hunter which found them Sean Hsieh in Taipei . Hsieh had worked as a sales strategist at an advertising firm and as a marketing strategist at a producer of physical education products before he was hired to be TransAsia 's marketing manager .  
As the southern weather turns hot and stuffy , the ducks , missing the spring breezes which they need for their breeding season , grow bored and their hormones subside . At the same time , spring is gradually spreading across the north , melting the Earth 's icy veil . With natural enemies there few in number but food plentiful , one after the other the ducks and geese start to return home .  
In the southern Bay Area , where land is dear , the facilities at the Overseas Chinese Education Center are cramped , and most of the elderly groups try their luck elsewhere . On normal days the groups meet at municipal senior centers , apartment complexes for the elderly that house many seniors from Taiwan , or other places where they share space and resources with people of other ethnic groups .  
Also , from the Eastern Han ( 25-220 ) onward , the political center gradually moved from north China to south of the Yangtze . This geographical shift brought with it a gradual change in spatial attitudes . The limestone geology of southern China has endowed it with many deep and mysterious caves which nature has fashioned into remarkable shapes , and these constantly fired human imaginations .  
Mike Moritz , a partner in the American venture capital firm Sequoia Capital , was one of those making presentations at a venture capitalists ' forum held by the Monte Jade Science and Technology Association in the southern Bay Area in September of last year . In his presentation he noted that on average he reviews 20 applications for investment every day . He says that , in the end , what is actually required to clinch a deal is a person who is familiar with both sides involved .  
Damiana is far from being an impressive plant . In the arid areas of the peninsula , which are dominated by huge columnar cacti and wide-canopied mesquite trees , its humble appearance may belie its importance for the local inhabitants . It is a small shrubby plant that grows in the dry soils of northern Mexico , Baja California and southern Texas .  
Unlike the heavy northern lions , the " southern lions " which dominate another corner sport relaxed grins . The typical southern lion has a twisting head and wagging tail , flowing lines , and a happy smile which seems to say that over the thousands of years of Chinese history it has seen much joy and many rich harvests .  
Although there is an impressive number of lions on display , the museum is unable to ascribe an accurate date and place of origin to each pair . For the time being , it is only able to group them into rough categories . For instance , Southern Fujianese lions from Hui'an and from Tong'an near Quanzhou are placed together , and the shigandang , which have their origins in belief in stone spirits , are placed alongside the wind lion lords which protect their owners from ravaging " evil " winds on small southern islands .  
In southern Taiwan , although the election for mayor of Kaohsiung also included an independent candidate , Cheng Te-yao , and an NP candidate , Wu Chien-kuo , the real battle remained that between the DPP 's Frank Hsieh and the KMT 's Wu Den-yih . From the very beginning of the campaign it was thought that Hsieh had little chance of winning , having been involved in the Sung Chi-li cult scandal and facing an incumbent with eight years of experience as mayor . At first , there was much less coverage of the Kaohsiung mayoral race .  
In the end Frank Hsieh won by a tiny margin of just over 4,000 votes . Political observer and National Sun Yat-sen University professor Chen Mau-hsiung has argued that Wu Den-yih originally held the upper hand in the election , but lost women 's votes as a result of the tape-recording affair . In contrast , the later video merely compounded the dissatisfaction of the electorate , contributing to the DPP gaining control in southern Taiwan .  
In future manual butchering will have to give way to mechanized slaughtering with electric stunning . The well over 100,000 chickens and ducks consumed in Greater Taipei each day will also have to be slaughtered electrically close to the farms in central and southern Taiwan , to reduce the suffering they now endure when transported tightly packed in cages .  
Since then , Tainan-style pork noodles , spicy Hunan chicken and Peking roast duck have formed a chorus line on Taiwan 's restaurant buffets . Disciples of Tibetan lamas have worshipped next door to followers of the mother goddess Matzu , and gents from northeast China have made brides of Penghu ladies . For half a century , southern accents have mixed with northern ones . The Three Gorges of the Yangtze and the Chuoshui River have both nourished the imaginations of Taiwanese people .  
Nanguan is most popular in Quanzhou , Xiamen , and the Minnan-speaking region in general . There is an elegant simplicity about it , and a hint of reserve . Its songs are soft , beautiful , and expressive , and contrast sharply with the brash , bold northern music often heard at weddings , funerals , and other such functions . Both types of music are very popular in southern Fujian and Taiwan .  
In Malaysia , Fujianese is widely used in the northern part of western Malaysia and in the southern part of Malaysia , in some places in eastern Malaysia , and especially in Penang , the small island that constitutes the major Chinese settlement in all of Malaysia . I 've never heard anyone call Fujian-ese fulaoren ( literally : " Fujian old chap " ) , because the character lao has a derogatory meaning among Chinese speakers in Malaysia . I hope in the future you will be cautious in using this term .  
Facing an uncertain fate , and caught between the northern and southern governments , parliamentarians were unable to hold meaningful sessions , nor could they collect any regular salaries , so it is no surprise that these early parliamentarians , many idealistic to start with , ended up giving in to temptation . There is nothing new under the sun about intellectuals being sullied by the realities of hard-nosed politics .  
Lie-chi likes to recall the time a music troupe came all the way from southern Taiwan with a large gong that needed tuning . Lin Wu tapped it a few times , sized up the problem , and with one sharp whack of his wooden mallet announced that the gong was fixed . The visitors were deeply disappointed at Lin s seemingly cavalier attitude , but when they struck the gong and heard the results , the elated musicians could n't stop marveling at Lin 's uncanny skill .  
The only people allowed to fly in or out of Kinmen were senior military officials and persons in need of emergency medical treatment . A Kinmen native living in Taipei had to first spend two entire working days completing the paperwork , then take a day traveling by train to the southern port of Kaohsiung . From there the traveler boarded a military landing craft for a choppy trip back home lasting more than ten hours .  
Ju Ming has hired the artist Chuang Ming-chi to fly up every week from his home in southern Taiwan to spend the weekends in residence at the museum painting the outside wall of the Main Building . In bold black lines , Chuang has been covering the wall with assorted images of people and animals in stylized representations reminiscent of aboriginal art .  
With the rise of industry in Kaohsiung , the agricultural counties of central and southern Taiwan began to lag behind , but at least there was a minimal kind of balance on the island as a whole with " two heads , one north and one south . " And to some degree the provincial government 's location in Nantou-and the resulting stream of visiting city and county bureaucrats-meant that central Taiwan was n't all that forlorn .  
" If you really want to help those cities and counties , then you 've got to implement ' local self-rule , ' so that the local governments ( which are now only tertiary government units ) really acquire sufficient power and money , " argues Hsia Chu-joe . Otherwise , if the " southern science park " that is now being built in Tainan County is successful , perhaps it , in combination with the " three direct links " and the high-speed railway will create new opportunity for central and southern Taiwan .  
The mainlanders have introduced the cuisines of their home provinces and a longing for the old country . Likewise , the attitudes of civil servants loyal to the KMT have also taken firm root in Taipei . What 's more , a larger proportion of Hakkas live in Taipei than any place ooutside of their traditional bases in the countryside , and the city also has a large community of aborigines . With this population structure , the Taiwanese chauvinism so prevalent in southern Taiwan is rather rare in Taipei .  
When the Dutch took over Tainan , they encouraged the cultivation and export of cane sugar , a crop that grew exceptionally well on the Chianan Plain stretching out from Tainan in almost every direction . On the strength of this economic base , Tainan naturally became the political center of Taiwan . Although southern Taiwan is dominated today by Kaohsiung , back then the latter was just one of Tainan 's satellite ports , with development limited by heavy silting and shallow berths .  
In 1874 the Japanese , acting under the pretext that certain Ryukyu islanders had been murdered in Taiwan , sent a military expedition to occupy Mutanshe in southern Taiwan . Then in 1884 France , having declared war on China , attacked and shut down Keelung . All this made the Manchu court realize Taiwan 's importance as a gateway to the seven provinces along the southeastern coast . Clearly , the aims of foreign powers vis-a-vis Taiwan had changed .  
Over 20,000 advance tickets have been sold , and group visits are already booked solid to the end of January . Many schools in central and southern Taiwan are renting buses by the dozen to ferry their students up to Taipei , and lots of foreign tourists are also coming by for a look .  
Most of Taiwan 's venomous snakes live in low-altitude farmland and sparsely populated countryside . But the hundred-pace viper , which was never very numerous , is at home in densely forested areas at low to medium elevations in the mountains of eastern , central and southern Taiwan . It grows to one-and-a-half meters or more-much the same length as the habu and cobra-but being far thicker and meatier it is much valued by gourmands .  
Pinglin Township is situated in rural southern Taipei County . Being relatively remote , the area was not developed until the late 18th century . Pinglin is a pocket of level ground set in mountain forests , whence its name , which means " forest on level ground . "  
They 've got genuine leather furniture , real wood floors , and shelves lined with tens of thousands of manga comics and magazines . Every computer has a 15-inch flat panel display . At the other end of the market , you can go down to Pingtung in southern Taiwan and find very unassuming little Internet cafes with modest decor , barebones equipment , and none of the " all you can eat and drink " signs you 're apt to find in up-market establishments . How many is too many ?  
Elsewhere in the ROC the traditional Han Chinese culture was southern Fujianese . Meanwhile , eastern Fujian itself has experienced such rapid develpment that almost all of its traditional architecture has been destroyed . The traditional eastern Fujianese settlements on Matsu are just about the only ones left in pristine condition anywhere in the world .  
Much to his surprise , someone showed up in the middle of the night with bolt cutters and set him free . Fully awake to the treacherous intentions of his relatives , Wang decided to head for southern China and make a life there together with Yueh-ching , the sweet and innocent daughter of a tenant farmer . The two married , and warfare continued .  
Typhoon Trami , a " mini " typhoon with a radius of just 100 km , closed in on southern Taiwan on July 11 . The storm had been downgraded to a tropical depression by the time it passed over land that evening , but no sooner had the typhoon warning been lifted than the ensuing weather system unleashed a torrential downpour on Kaohsiung , causing the worst flooding in the city 's history .  
So runs a local rhyme passed down by the residents of southern Taiwan 's Tungkang Township . Tungkang is a fishing village famed not only for its " three treasures " - bluefin tuna , oilfish and banded coral shrimp-but also for its Tapeng Bay National Scenic Area . Here in Tungkang , tourists and locals rub shoulders on streets scented with the damp smell of the sea , while out on the sea a few speckled boats pitch and roll as they sail slowly towards China .  
Before Kaohsiung was founded , Tungkang was southern Taiwan 's primary commercial harbor . But World War II devastated the wealthy sections of the town . Tungkang was left a virtual ruin , and no trace of the town 's Japanese-occupation-era prosperity remains . Arriving from Pingtung or Kaohsiung , all one sees is a typical fishing village-a harbor populated by a few boats , a great deal of fishing tackle and betelnuts .  
Maxwell practiced his brand of medical missionary work in Taiwan for six-and-a-half years , travelling throughout central and southern Formosa , and he founded three Presbyterian parishes . One was in the southernmost area , inhabited by the Sir-aya indigenous people ( around today 's Mucha and Tsochen ) , a second in the south-central region of Taiwan ( Paiho , Chiaya ) , and a third in north-central Taiwan , home to the Pazeh people ( today 's Puli , Fengyuan , and Shenkang ) .  
The resulting melange , sung in the local Minnan dialect , came to be known as gezai xi , or Taiwanese Opera , a very easy and enjoyable opera form that grew within 20 years into the most popular opera genre in Minnan-speaking areas . Troupes in Taiwan that had specialized in Beiguan , Gaojia , and Liyuan Opera switched over to Taiwanese Opera , and thanks to the close ties between Taiwan and Fujian , Taiwanese Opera took southern Fujian by storm in the 1920s and 30s .  
Any performer who got a bit careless might find himself labeled a " saboteur of the model operas . " They took to singing in the very high-pitched falsetto of Peking Opera , while the costumes and makeup were based on Yue Opera . As a result , gezai xi gradually lost its distinctive character , and came more and more to resemble Peking and Yue Opera . There was also the problem of tailoring southern opera for a northern audience .  
Although the seminar was held in early November , the weather in Kinmen was still warm and sunny , with a sky so blue you could practically reach up and squeeze the water out of it . Scattered here and there amidst newly constructed five-story apartment blocks were traditional southern Fujian-style homes , with their rounded roof ridges and flying eaves . If it were n't for the camouflaged bunkers scattered all over the island , one might well have forgotten that the area once reeked of gunpowder and was stationed with 100,000 troops .  
The latter question , which comes from the recommendation system for the department of medicine at National Taiwan University , is even more interesting : It is said that many top students from famous high schools touched and smelled the white powder and ended up venturing meaningless answers like " colorless and odorless crystal substance . " Only one student , a kid from southern Taiwan who obviously knows her way around a kitchen , said nothing , but lit the kerosene lamp , and dumped the substance into the boiling water . Eureka !  
When students used to come from southern Taiwan to Taipei to study 20 years ago , they were warned about Taipei 's gray and wet winters . Friends and relatives reminded them to carry a newspaper with them at all times to keep off the fine rain of the northeastern monsoon . Over the years , however , Taipei 's winters have changed , becoming drier and less overcast .  
Through satellite observations , the fishing industry has gradually come to understand the waxing and waning of cold and warm currents . Noting the succession of warm winters in the 1990s , and a 1 �X C rise in sea temperatures around Taiwan , the Taiwan Fisheries Research Institute also began making fish catch forecasts based on sea temperatures . For instance , the temperature that best suits mullet is 21-23 �X C , but last year the institute predicted that sea temperatures around southern Taiwan would be 2-3 �X C warmer this winter than in previous years .  
The blinding light reflecting off the textured surface is both mysterious and moving . Lava story Between eight and 17 million years ago , in the southern part of the Taiwan Strait , magma forced its way through fractures in the earth 's crust . The lava poured through to the surface , accumulating and covering the earth in large and small piles , creating the impressively beautiful Penghu archipelago .  
All types of fish that can be eaten raw have a fairly high fat content , but the bluefin is particularly famed for its fattiness . The Pacific bluefin that migrate through the waters east of Taiwan prefer lower water temperatures than other tuna , and usually stay north of the 18th parallel . To protect it from cold the Pacific bluefin has more fat than the yellowfin and albacore , which are distributed around the equator , or the southern bluefin , which lives in the southern hemisphere .  
At a symposium on the control of environmental hormones held in April , Professor Liu Li-lian , director of the Institute of Marine Biology at National Sun Yat-sen University in Kaohsiung , described the results of a coastal survey in southern Taiwan . The natural ratio of males to females in oyster drills is about one to one , " so when I noticed that the Thais clavigera we were catching had all turned male , I knew something was wrong , " said Liu with alarm .  
A courageous pioneer in literary style , even when he was demoted to governor of Chaozhou Prefecture , Han Yu brought his colorful lifestyle to that far-flung uncivilized southern realm , thereby displaying once again his ability to transcend worldly concerns of fame and fortune , and his characteristic willingness to uphold the values of a life of beauty and goodness . Perhaps this is a better reason for modern scholars to offer a stick of sweet-smelling incense in his memory .  
In visiting the area , IACT members found that the Tibetans , accustomed to living in a cool , dry climate at high altitudes , still maintained some of their previous customs even after moving to southern India , and these created a higher incidence of transmission of disease .  
In winter , the northeast monsoon makes for cold and wet weather with frequent fog and gusting rains on the northern side of the pass , while the southern side stays clear and dry . The very distinct climates make for radically different kinds of vegetation on the two sides of the pass .  
A doctor from a health center located in a southern county , who wishes to remain anonymous , says that when SARS hit , because the center had been converted into a treatment center , more than half their time was spent in examining patients rather than doing general epidemic prevention work . Indeed , even now the government lacks a clear focus for future tasks such as promoting cervical examinations , encouraging neighborhood environmental hygiene , or taking preventive measures against chronic diseases .  
When dengue fever was attacking southern Taiwan , the average health center in a rural township had only five employees . But communities there are spread widely and it required a great deal of time and personnel to visit each and every community and inspect outdoor containers of standing water , destroy carrier mosquitoes , and spray disinfectant .  
The ancestors of this pint-sized member of the family Sylviidae ( the old-world warblers ) came from cold northern lands . Biogeographical evidence shows that they first spread out northeastward from the Himalayas into northern and northeastern China and Japan , and later moved south during the ice ages , reaching Taiwan via southern China or Japan .  
The Japanese faced fierce resistance in the early years of the colonial period , especially in the central and southern parts of the island . Many administrative orders went ignored outside of Taipei 's walled district where the colonial government was headquartered , and the post of governor-general changed hands in rapid succession . Relative stability was not achieved until Gentaro Gotama took over and appointed Shinpei Goto as his chief administrator . The building housing today 's Taiwan Museum was originally built in memory of these two men .  
Over time , with the constant expansion and division of academic disciplines , new units were established , including divisions of medicine , engineering , and agricultural science , as well as graduate institutes of tropical medicine , southern civilization , and southern resources . By the time Japanese rule ended in 1945 , the university had five academic divisions , a preparatory school , three graduate institutes , and 115 academic chairs , with 378 full-time academic personnel , 123 part-time personnel and 382 students .  
Wu Wei-ting points out that in the past feminist groups mostly talked to the media , but did n't do much to relate to real women at the grass-roots level . Thus , when New Awakening held a series of seminars in northern , central , and southern Taiwan on property rights of husbands and wives , you could tell the large gap between city and country from the reception they received from the audience .  
" Setting down roots and deepening our impact is the real hard job , " says Yu Mei-nu . To help close the gap between town and country , two years ago they began organizing women 's groups in northern , central , southern , and eastern Taiwan to create the NUTWA , to create a platform for information and resource sharing . They are now moving to use the Internet to link women 's groups across the island .  
Furthermore , Taiwan cuisine went through a period of study , when it was absorbing the advantages of various Chinese regional cuisines , and it created a new kind of cuisine . This represents an even bigger revolution than the one that occurred after the southward migration during the Song dynasty , when the wealthy all moved to Hangzhou and developed " northern cooking with southern ingredients . "  
In order to strengthen the tuberculosis treatment network , the Department of Health has made preliminary plans to use Taipei 's Hospital for Chronic Diseases , Taoyuan Hospital , Taichung Hospital , the Center for Chest Disease , and Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital as diagnostic referral centers for northern , central , and southern Taiwan , accepting TB patients who have been diagnosed at regular hospitals or whose disease is proving difficult to treat .  
After the western Taiwan high-speed transportation network is established , the future will bring construction projects for eastern , central and southern Taiwan where the terrain presents even greater difficulties ; and it can be predicted that the transportation , economic and environmental challenges will be greater , so that society will have greater expectations and exert more supervision .  
Its towering presence is beyond the power of words to describe . Additionally , the summit provides a panoramic view of the main sources of water that nourish the land . The Nantsaihsien River and Laonung River are the sources of southern Taiwan 's Kaoping River ; the Chenyoulan River , largest tributary of central Taiwan 's Choshui River , winds its way to the northwest ; and the valley of the Lakulaku River , which feeds eastern Taiwan 's Hsiukuluan River , is also visible in the distance .  
In September of last year , Dr . Lin , who had for a long time focused her research on blood groups and ethnic groups , published the results of a study entitled " Correlation between SARS virus infection and the human leukocyte antigen . " Lin concluded that there is a direct connection between the presence of the human leukocyte antigen HLA-B46 and the severity of a SARS infection . She found that ethnic southern Chinese who  
Boosted by record low interest rates since the beginning of the year , an atmosphere of optimism surrounds the real estate market throughout Taiwan . Offers ranging from upmarket homes in Taipei City , to townhouses in central and southern Taiwan with ads touting 100% financing , have stirred awake many people 's long-silent itch to buy .  
They attributed the crisis , one of the most severe agricultural disasters in southern Africa over the past 10 years , to " the area 's weakened farm production and supply after two years of production decline caused by bad weather coupled with economic crisis and the suspension of agricultural activities in some areas . "  
They indicated : " Natural disasters have resulted in poor harvests for 2 consecutive years .  In addition , economic crisis and disruption of farming activities in some areas have reduced production and supply of foods to the region - creating one of the worst agricultural catastrophes in southern Africa in 10 years . "  
They noted : " Two successive years of poor harvests brought about by natural calamities , coupled with economic crises and the disrupted farming in some areas , have reduced the food production and supply in this region , resulting in one of the gravest agricultural disasters in a decade in southern Africa . "  
the defense ministers of the two countries agreed in their talks to set up a rapid reaction multinational force to guarantee the security of southern europe the two ministers hoped that other member states of the western european union would join the multinational force  
The system of apartheid sought to dehumanize entire peoples and imposed on the region of southern Africa a brutal war which has resulted in untold loss of life , destruction of property and massive displacement of innocent people .  
It should be recalled that the first phase ( five years ) of this endeavour will be the strengthening of existing regional economic communities in west , eastern , central , southern and north Africa .  
However , new refugees continued to arrive from southern Iraq and , unless effective preventive policies were pursued , a larger refugee inflow could be recorded in the months ahead .  
Having considered the item entitled " Activities of foreign economic and other interests which are impeding the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples in Territories under colonial domination and efforts to eliminate colonialism , apartheid and racial discrimination in southern Africa " ,  
South Africa will meet this challenge with a firm commitment to the promotion of national welfare , prosperity and security , with a firm commitment to the strengthening of cooperation in the pursuit of the economic development and security of the southern African subregion , with an active commitment to peace , stability and good governance within the African region and elsewhere , with a firm commitment to South-South cooperation and with a commitment to responsible international citizenship .  
We are , in effect , seeing the steady growth of a series of complementary regional arrangements perhaps becoming even hemispheric in effect for the southern half of the globe which underpin the international non-proliferation regime and give it a distinctive regional commitment .  
His report was thus based on the information that he had gathered in those countries , on numerous reports of United Nations bodies and humanitarian organizations active in the southern Sudan and on detailed reports from reliable sources concerning the situation of human rights in the northern and southern regions of the Sudan .  
The informal cooperation that now exists on security issues in the region and the conclusion of more formal economic cooperation arrangements have contributed significantly towards building confidence in the prospect of a more secure , democratic and prosperous future for southern Africa .  
It needs to be emphasized that a peaceful settlement of the Angolan civil conflict is not only essential for the people of Angola themselves , but also of major importance to political stability and economic development in southern Africa as a whole .  
This blockade is being accompanied daily by heavy artillery shelling and murderous air-raids which have resulted in numerous casualties among innocent civilians in southern Lebanon and in the western Bekaa and caused considerable material damage .  
Deeply concerned further by the increasingly severe and grave violations of human rights by the Government of Iraq against the civilian population in southern Iraq , in particular in the southern marshes , where the combination of massive drainage projects and wide-ranging military operations on the part of the Government of Iraq has forced residents of the marshes to flee in large numbers , many of whom have sought refuge on the border between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran ,  
Also expresses special alarm at the grave violations of human rights in southern Iraq , and urges the Government of Iraq to implement without further delay the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur , including , inter alia , the immediate halting and reversal of the draining of the marshes and the cessation of its military activities against the marsh Arabs , whose survival as a community is endangered ;  
The facilitation of mutually beneficial joint economic projects to improve living conditions in central and southern Bosnia and Herzegovina has helped to lay a foundation of confidence and trust among a population that had previously witnessed some of the most intense fighting in the present conflict .  
In support of efforts to advance and incorporate environmental concerns at the earliest possible stages of economic decision-making , as recommended by Agenda 21 , support has been provided to a network of southern NGOs and development practitioners to build their capacity and collaboration capability in communications and research activities aimed at clarifying key policy issues before the Commission on Sustainable Development ( CSD ) .  
A regional project in southern Africa is providing training to managers and field workers in interpersonal communication skills and the use of low-cost audiovisual materials .  Rural radio remains the most effective mass medium to reach large numbers of rural audiences and FAO is continuing its efforts to strengthen rural radio services , especially in Africa .  
The war in southern Sudan , which began four decades ago and which , with the exception of the relative calm between 1972 and 1983 , has continued unabated , has claimed the lives of well over 1-million persons and has hindered , if not completely thwarted , efforts to move the country along a path of meaningful and lasting progress .  
The war in southern Sudan , which began four decades ago and which , with the exception of the relative calm between 1972 and 1983 , has continued unabated , has claimed the lives of well over 1-million persons and has hindered , if not completely thwarted , efforts to move the country along a path of meaningful and lasting progress .  
The Special Rapporteur believes that the racial dimension of the violations and abuses against children living in northern Sudan , or , in the case of children in southern Sudan , those who are abducted and sold into slavery constitutes a particularly grave and alarming circumstance , which should be of particular concern from a human rights perspective .  
NULLAs far as the situation in southern Sudan is concerned , hundreds of thousands of children continue to live in insecurity in the conflict zones , in danger of being abducted , exposed to lasting psychological trauma , or living in inappropriate conditions .  
During 1995 , the UNICEF Regional Office continued to work with the secretariat in developing analytical materials on major issues affecting southern African children , including human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) , and is exploring possible collaboration with the human resource development sector in the area of basic education .  
about continuing indiscriminate and deliberate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers ,  
about continuing indiscriminate and deliberate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers ,  
macroeconomic factors which lay beyond the control of the countries of the southern hemisphere , where the vast majority of refugee populations were to be found , had impoverished those countries even further , leading to massive outflows of people seeking better living conditions .  
NAJEM ( Lebanon ) said that Israel was responsible for flagrant and persistent violations of human rights in the occupied territories of southern Lebanon , the western Bekaa and surrounding areas .  
They conveyed the Community 's proposal to dispatch a Ministerial Trade and Investment Mission to South Africa at a mutually convenient date in 1997 and also to establish a joint CARICOM Diplomatic Mission in South Africa in the near future to advance economic , technical and cultural relations with the countries of southern Africa and with the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) .  
Although southern Africa today enjoys relative peace and stability , it will continue to need special assistance in order to address the problems of reconstruction and development of the economic , physical and social infrastructures which were destroyed or adversely affected by many years of war and racial injustice . 
Today , the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan is concentrating its efforts on tasks whose successful accomplishment will make it possible to reconstruct the social and economic infrastructure of the southern part of the Republic , which was devastated by the civil war ; to reintegrate the disrupted regional sectors of the national economy on a new basis ; and to convert the distorted centralized national economy that we inherited into a modern market economy .  
Drought or inadequate supplies of water in southern and northern parts of the continent reduced agricultural output and increased the diversion of foreign exchange earnings for food imports in several countries in 1995 .  
The system complements operational early warning systems for food security in eastern and southern Africa by providing fast and efficient data distribution capacity for environmental satellite data produced by the ARTEMIS system of FAO at Rome .  
For example , ITTO 's Guidelines and Criteria , covers forests of ITTO producer countries in all tropical regions ; the Montreal Process encompasses the temperate and boreal zone forests outside Europe in both the northern and southern hemispheres ; the Tarapoto Proposal includes humid tropical , tidal and riverine forests in the Amazon basin ; and the recent UNEP / FAO Dry-Zone Sub-Saharan Africa initiative covers the arid , semi-arid and dry sub-humid-zone forests and woodlands .  
Concerned about continuing indiscriminate and deliberate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers ,  
For the sole reason that it was a colony of the Japanese imperialists , Korea was included in the operational zone of the Allied forces at the final stage of the Second World War , when the United States of America " persuaded " the then Soviet Union that " the United States forces should participate in disarming the Japanese forces stationed in Korea " , and thereby divided Korea along the 38th parallel of north latitude " temporarily " , placing the northern part of Korea under Soviet responsibility and the southern part under United States responsibility .  
Condemning Israel 's continued occupation of parts of southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa in flagrant violation of international law and in continuing disregard of Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) and relevant subsequent resolutions ,  
To condemn Israel in the strongest terms for its continued occupation of parts of southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa ; and to call upon the international community , and upon the United Nations and all its associated bodies in particular , to strive for the implementation of Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) and the relevant subsequent resolutions calling for Israel 's immediate and unconditional withdrawal from all occupied Lebanese territory to the internationally recognized boundaries ;  
In order to support the eastern and southern regions with planned rural development projects , the Department for Priority Regions for Development was established within the State Planning Organization , and based upon certain socio-economic criteria the 28 least developed provinces were identified and included in a specific programme within the planned development projects .  
Upon instructions from my Government , I have the honour to request Your Excellency to convene an urgent meeting of the Security Council to consider the grave situation in Lebanon resulting from the large-scale Israeli bombardment of many towns and villages in my country , including the southern suburb of Beirut , causing alarming numbers of civilian dead and wounded , thousands of displaced persons and severe damage to property .  
The United States is now engaged in an intensive diplomatic effort to restore calm and establish a more stable situation in the area which would enhance the security and well-being of the civilian population of both southern Lebanon and northern Israel .  
Israel 's premeditated and unbridled aerial and artillery attacks over the past five days against many civilian quarters in towns and villages of Lebanon , including the southern suburbs of Beirut , and its naval blockade of the port of Beirut are prime examples of acts of terrorism by Israeli policy makers , who all too readily and conveniently label others either as terrorists or as supporters of terrorists . 
The Chinese delegation expresses its profound concern at the large-scale military offensive launched by Israel in recent days in southern Lebanon , which has resulted in the loss of innocent civilian lives , the massive destruction of property and a large number of civilians ' becoming homeless or refugees , consequently further escalating the conflict in southern Lebanon and aggravating the already tense situation .  
Bi \ x { 9de8 } n Lian ( Norway ) : In the Council debate last Monday , I had the opportunity to express the deep concern of the Norwegian Government with regard to the critical and fragile state of the peace process in the Middle East , and to urge the parties involved in the use of force in southern Lebanon and northern Israel to stop the spiral of violence .  
This requires : complete Israeli withdrawal from the Golan to the line of 4 June 1967 ; complete and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa to the internationally recognized boundaries ; the complete withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Palestinian territories , including Arab Jerusalem ; and recognition of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people , including its right to exercise self-determination and establish an independent State on its own soil .

A positive example for landlocked countries that lie in the centre of continents is that of Switzerland and Austria , which have served as successful hosts for short-cut routes through the Alps , providing connections from northern and western Europe to southern and eastern Europe - with notable benefits to their own economies , among the world 's most successful and richest .  
However , indicators pointing to a potential deterioration in the humanitarian situation have accumulated since early 1996 , particularly in southern Somalia , and , by the middle of the year , United Nations agencies were uncertain how much longer a renewed humanitarian crisis could be held back under prevailing conditions .  
However , the implementation of return-and-reintegration programmes was subsequently disrupted because of increased political instability and armed conflict , in particular in southern Somalia , provoking renewed population movements , mainly towards relatively peaceful areas in the north-east and north-west , but also within the southern regions of the country .  
Although the Special Envoy received commitments from all the parties to attend talks , the new political environment resulting from developments in March-April ( presidential and legislative elections in the Sudan ; realignment of certain southern movements with the Government ) prevented their actual resumption owing to the absence of recognized , legitimate interlocutors among the parties concerned .  
These include the protection and security of relief personnel and convoys ; clearance of OLS flights into southern Sudan ; the extension of the March 1994 and May 1994 IGAD agreements on OLS humanitarian assistance into areas of cooperation left unaddressed by those agreements , such as modalities for the delivery of relief supplies involving cross-line convoys and access to conflict-affected areas , as well as the modalities for monitoring compliance with the relative principles and procedures ; operational procedures for international non-governmental organizations based in Khartoum .

All that the people of southern Africa are asking for now is a chance to live in peace so that they can address the myriad problems and challenges left unattended for decades by previous colonial and racist regimes in their region . 
Overcoming the many years of conflict in Angola would not only be a major blessing for a country which is friendly to us , for its people and for other States in the region of southern Africa , but would also be a substantial success for the peacemaking efforts of the United Nations and of the international community as a whole , which have invested significant human , material and financial resources in support of the Angolan peace process .  
While underlining that the law was applied without religious discrimination and with respect for the rights of non-Muslims , Mr . Turabi explained that consumption of alcohol was not a crime in the southern states , while in the north it was authorized for non-Muslims in private and forbidden in public .  
According to unofficial reports , non-Muslims outside the southern states have been found guilty of and punished for religious offences based on Islam ( hudud ) , especially for failing to observe the Islamic dress code and the prohibition of the sale or consumption of alcohol .  
On the other hand , the missile attached launched in retaliation by the United States in the southern region of the country causing substantial loss of life , an attack that had been condemned by the international community , constituted a violation of the inalienable right of the Kurdish people to express freely their will without foreign interference and was part of a deliberate campaign by the United States authorities aimed at bringing about the disintegration of the Iraqi State and undermining the national unity and territorial integrity of a sovereign State .  
For countries like Madagascar , South-South and regional cooperation had become a necessary strategy for promoting national , regional and global development through collective autonomy , which was a basic tool for stimulating growth , technologies and accelerated development .

Over the past few years , higher international prices , new mining codes with more clearly defined rights and obligations of foreign investors , and aid-financed geologic surveys had contributed to a large increase in the exploration for mineral deposits and with notable success .  Gold production in particular has increased rapidly in several countries in western and southern Africa .

For decades , it has been growing dangerously worse and , as part of this process , the structural adjustment policies implemented by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in the countries of the southern hemisphere and in central and eastern Europe are having disastrous social consequences .  
Recurrent drought in the southern Africa region this decade , the weak economic base of the country , which is almost exclusively agricultural , a rather unbalanced social infrastructure , which is partly due to the low literacy rate inherited from the previous regime , and the problem of disease , including HIV / AIDS , pose a serious threat to our nascent democracy .

It is also natural for Algeria to plead for a global and integrated approach to the security and development of the Mediterranean , convinced as it is that there can be no genuine security for all as long as serious and intolerable imbalances persist between the northern and southern shores of the Mediterranean .  
We also express our commitment to all the various tracks of the peace process without exception , with a view to guaranteeing Israel 's total withdrawal from all occupied Arab and Palestinian territories , including the Syrian Golan , southern Lebanon and the Beka'a valley , and respect by Israel for international law and for the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people , including its rights to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent State on its national territory , with Al-Quds as its capital .

Some localities have planned to increase investment , and others have begun returning land unfit for farming to forestry and animal husbandry , raising the curtain on ecological construction .  Braving the piercingly cold wind , quite a few cadres from the western region went to the eastern and southern parts of the country , busying themselves with the introduction of projects .  
As an important measure for structural readjustment , the Chinese government has canceled the protective prices of poor-quality-seed grain , such as southern early rice and northern spring wheat , encouraged the production of marketable , good-quality-seed produce , and increased the purchase-price difference according to quality .

The Zhanjiang sub-military district , which guards China 's southern gate , recently held a joint troops and militiamen military exercise at the Baishawan in Xuwen County . The military exercise included storming the beach , rapid shifting of offensive lines , rapid putting up of air defense , and comprehensive logistics support .  
Being a close neighbor of the peninsula , China has always supported enhancing mutual trust and improving relations between the northern and southern sides of the peninsula through dialogue and contacts without foreign interference , and eventually bringing about independent and peaceful reunification through dialogue and negotiations . 
By the time these cities see an economic takeoff , it is appropriate that the factories in Hong Kong implement its active investment plans , and move their factories which are originally concentrated in southern China to the areas along the Chang Jiang or in the western regions where wages and land prices are comparatively lower , so as to occupy the commanding height .  China is gradually accelerating its efforts of opening up to the outside world .  Hong Kong is a special administrative region under the " one country , two systems . "  
In the letter Jiang Zemin reaffirmed that the north side and the south side are major parties concerned in the peninsula affairs , that China actively supports the consistent position of the northern side 's and southern side 's realizing independence and peaceful unification through dialogue and consultations , that China will , as always , continue to make positive efforts to help maintain peace and stability on the Korean peninsula .  
President of Kyrgyzstan Askar Akayev first expressed his gratitude to the " Shanghai Five " for moral support and military and technical assistance to his country when international terrorists invaded southern Kyrgyzstan in August last year .  He suggested the need to establish an anti-terrorism center for central Asia in Bishkek .  
It is necessary to intensify the support of the financial industry for economic growth and encourage all circles of society to increase their investment .  The pace of the preliminary work for major projects , such as the northward transfer of southern water and Qinghai-Tibet railway , should be quickened , with project quality management and financial management improved .  
Following a hostile confrontation that has lasted for over half a century , the northern and southern side of the Korean Peninsula have come to realize that at a time when peace and development is the major theme in the world today , confrontation has no way out ; only by seeking dialogue and cooperation , and aspiring for peace and unification will they be able to advance toward a bright and beautiful future .  
At the same time , Iraq is losing no opportunity in launching a strong diplomatic offensive in appealing to the United Nations and countries around the world to condemn the US-British outrage , so as to gain the sympathy of the international community and attain the goal of easing the 10-year sanctions on Iraq as soon as possible and abolishing the " no-fly zones " set up in northern and southern Iraq by the Americans and British .  
For this reason , during the 10th Five-Year Plan period , we will expedite the construction of major projects of overall significance , including those aimed at bringing gas and electricity from western China to eastern China , diverting water from southern China to northern China , establishing national strategic petroleum reserves , and building a rail line into Tibet .  
We shall give greater support to the faster and better development of the central area of this province with Xian at the center , and turn this area into a core base for the great development of the western part of the country .  Northern Shaanxi will be developed into our country 's major sample zone for the sustainable development of energy sources and the building of the ecological environment .  The southern part of Shaanxi will be developed into a diversified economic zone for developing biological resources , tourist resources , and water resources .  
Meanwhile , the province will also give prominence to the region 's key development areas , develop an economy that enjoys distinct regional characteristics , speed up the development of the Chengdu plain , carry out a comprehensive exploration of resources in the Panxi area , boost the construction and development of the areas in southern Sichuan , give more assistance to areas inhabited by minority nationalities , and extend vigorous support to the development of both hilly areas and the Penzhou mountain areas .  
Besides , the total quantity of water to be diverted from southern China to northern region during first phase and second phase will be only 50 billion cubic meters , accounting for just one-fourth of the need .  Therefore , judging from the current situation or a long-range plan , we still must place the economical use of water in first place .  
They visited more than six major and many minor ungazetted beaches along the coastal areas in Tuen Mun , Tsuen Wan , Sai Kung and the southern part of Hong Kong and removed rubbish washed ashore or left by inconsiderate beach-goers .  
The general planning intention of the area is to conserve the intrinsic natural character of the scenic hilly landscape on the western and northern parts , to promote recreation and productive agriculture on the valley floors , to upgrade the obsolete and sub-standard housing in the central and southern parts , and to maintain the character and intensity of the residential developments in the area .  
We owe much of our success to the speedy , reliable and efficient service of the industry , fast-growing economic growth in the Mainland and our strategic location at the hub of the Pearl River Delta area , the largest manufacturing base in the world .  Hong Kong serves as the country 's premier port for foreign trade , handling 70% of the container cargo in southern China last year .  
The Planning Scheme Area covering about 193 hectares is located in the southern tip of the Kowloon Peninsula . It is bounded by the Victoria Harbour to the south , southwest and southeast ; Jordan Road and Gascoigne Road to the north ; and Hung Hom Bay Reclamation to the east .  
The paper estimated that some 15-25% of the total outstanding Hong Kong dollar stock ( around HK $ 15-25 billion ) was held outside of Hong Kong . Most of it was held in the southern parts of Mainland China , where the demand for Hong Kong dollars had grown in recent years , despite a stable renminbi .  
Wushantou Reservoir , located between Chiayi and Tainan , is one the popular scenic spots of southern Taiwan . Surrounded by mountains , it is formed by more than thirty tributary streams . Since it resembles a piece of coral from a bird 's -eye view , it also is called Coral Lake .  
The freeway extends from Keelung , the northern port of Taiwan , traversing through the lush and densely populated narrow western plain of the island to the southern port of Kaohsiung .  
After passing through such scenic spots as Hua Yuan Hsin Cheng ( flower garden city ) , Yen Tzu Hu ( swallow lake ) , Chung Chih Kung Yuan ( loyal administration park ) , and Hong Ho Ku ( red river valley ) , the road running south from Taipei along the Hsintien Chi ( stream ) reaches Wulai , an aboriginal village located close to the southern extremity of Taipei County .  
The Central Taiwan Vocational Training Center , the southern and northern Taiwan vocational training centers operated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , the Taishan vocational training center operated by the Ministry of the Interior , the first youth vocational training center run by the National Youth Commission , the northern provincial vocational training center , Taipei municipal vocational training center , eastern Taiwan vocational training center , and a vocational training center for retired servicemen .  
Despite its imagined beauty and elegance , the silk umbrella was not very practical in tropical , rain drenched southern China . The problem was solved by using oilpaper , an excellent water repellent .  
Outside Kaohsiung , in the southern part of Taiwan , in a rural , sleepy farming community , hidden amid rice paddies is a pleasant but imposing structure surrounded on all sides by a high wall .  
Han Pao-te , chief architect of the project , stressed that the idea of the center is to give young people of today a chance to experience what daily life in the world of their ancestors was like . Sung Shih-hsuan , director of the China Youth Corps , added that hopefully the traditional architecture will help the youth of today better understand their roots and thus inspire them to seek a greater interest in traditional ideals . The complex is located at the southern end of the Hengch'un peninsula within the designated K'enting National Park area .  
Covering an area of 120 square kilometers , Hsin Tien is bordered by the Taipei suburbs of Mucha and Chingmei in the northeast and the industrial communities of Chung Ho and T'uch'eng in the northwest . The southern area is bounded by scenic Wulai and the charming community of Sanhsia . Hsin Tien is 70% mountainous , an important factor shaping its rather unique development .  
Located in the southern portion of Nant'ou County , Chushan is bordered on the east by Luku Township and to the south by Yunlin County 's Kuk'eng . The natural topography of the area has helped to shape Chushan 's unique character . The rugged , majestic peaks of the Central Mountain Range bisect the area and two sparkling rivers , the Ch'ing Shui Hsi and the Cho Shui Hsi meander through its borders .  
Included among these are numerous water fowl varieties such as wild geese , ducks and gulls . Originating from their summer nesting grounds in Japan , Manchuria , Siberia and the plateau region of Mongolia , they fly southward making Taiwan one of their chief wintering and resting stops . Those that take brief respite here continue on to destinations further to the south like the Philippines , Indonesia and sometimes fly as far south as the southern hemispheric lands of Australia and New Zealand .  
Wings of Glory Representing the glorious tradition of the Chinese air command , the Chinese Air Force Academy stands as a landmark in modern military training . Originally founded in 1932 by the late President Chiang Kai-shek , the school has grown from its original humble origins near Hangchou , to its present modern facility in Kaohsiung County , southern Taiwan .  
Hainan , like southern Taiwan and southern Yunnan , has tropical seasonal winds , year-round summer , and abundant rainfall , making it possible to achieve three or four harvests a year . And the south of the island is suited for growing coffee , rubber trees , and other tropical crops .  
Rainy , humid weather is required for frogs to lay their eggs . Because winter is southern Taiwan 's dry season , the Taipei tree frog is found only in mountainous areas under 1,000 meters in altitude north of Nantou County . Their mating season is from October to April .  
One hundred years ago , Taipei was surrounded by a sturdy protective wall . The wall , completed in three years , was square , and had four gates , one in the north , south , east , and west . There was also another small gate on the southern side .  
Wang says that all Chinese lions - - be they small-scale figures for utilitarian decoration or imposing statues designed to guard against evil - - can generally be classified into one of two styles , a northern and a southern . The northern lion is majestic and awesome , while the southern lion is warmer and gentler and often reveals a smile .  
For just this reason , Stan Shih suggested in his presidential report that the government set up four new high-tech industrial parks in northern , central , southern , and eastern Taiwan that would be integrated with neighboring universities , research organizations , and satellite high-tech industrial parks to transform Taiwan into a high-tech island .  
This includes the establishment of centers for folk arts and popular handicrafts in southern and eastern Taiwan . In the north , Chinese culture parks will be set up . And at the same time at least five large-scale museums will be added to the present number . Exhibition halls displaying the unique features of local and indigenous products will become part and parcel of the cultural centers of every county and town .  
In 1975 the director of National Central University 's Environmental Center , Lu Shih-tsung , initiated an islandwide survey of Taiwan 's rainfall . His project was taken up by the Taiwan Forestry Research Institute and other university research bodies , together with the EPA . Their report indicated that the rainfall in many parts of Taiwan , such as the central mountainous region , is still " clean , " but the rain in the major conurbations of northern and southern Taiwan , together with certain industrial zones , is becoming more and more acidic .  
The supply of eel for export to Japan ca n't meet demand , but since Taiwan is too small and labor is expensive , it 's very difficult to expand the scope of eel farming . So we have always been alert for investment opportunities abroad , " says Lin . At first , the Malaysian government wanted to rent 200 chia of land to him . " In pingtung [ in southern Taiwan ] , to have a five chia eel farm is already miraculous - - how could we deal with 200 chia ? "  
The formal features of overseas Chinese buildings in Malaysia come from southern Fukien , reflecting the deep historical ties that the local immigrants have with China proper .  
No clear plan was set out for upgrading Taichung to a metropolis , nor for opening Taichung Harbor to direct cross-strait shipping ; the high-speed railway was diverted to a coastal route via new towns far from Taichung city ; the third international airport was planned for southern Taiwan ; no increases in numbers of universities and colleges were envisaged under the plan ; and the mass transit system urgently needed to solve Taichung 's transportation problems would n't be ready until the year 2020 ! "  
But if cars can pass through on a new cross-island highway , people will just drive through , passing Yuli in an instant . " It 's like when the southern cross-island highway was built , " he says . " At first everyone at the eastern starting point of Haituan was vigorously in favor of opening the road , thinking that people would be able to get to Taitung in only an hour , but since then the city has been in gradual decline . "  
We would probably note that the trends starting in the 1980 ' s , i.e . the loosening of trade and investment restrictions , continued as mainland China gradually opened up . Development spread from the southern coastal provinces to the North and through the interior . China was transformed , the " Sleeping Dragon " awoke , jolted from its long slumber by the calls of two of the " Little Tigers , " Hong Kong from within and Taiwan from the outside .

Using a needle to implant silicone is fast and cheap and is a classic example of a technique that neither requires surgery nor leaves scars . It was an immediate hit . There are records of women from central and southern Taiwan coming north on chartered tour buses for " head-to-foot " plastic surgery .  
Usually found in the temperate zone , most of them were brought from abroad by migratory birds like the quillwort and the Sparganium fallax . Their taking root in the subtropical environment of Taiwan has greatly startled international botanists . Among them are plants found at their southern most geographical limit : The Nuphar shimadai is especially noteworthy because it belongs to temperate zone family of water plants found mostly in North America and the northern parts of the Eurasian land mass .  
Then there was the outbreak of a disease that left people with blackened feet in the coastal area of southern Chiayi which has been proved by experts on contagious diseases to have been related to the protracted use of underground water containing too much arsenic for drinking . "  
Instead , they use a blue cloth banner with the lines " Respectfully sending off the southern god of fire ; welcoming in the northern god of water , " which is exchanged for festive red couplets after the ceremony .  
In 1988 , which was the second year after Vietnam began to permit foreign investment , Chang came by himself to Ho Chi Minh City . Upon inspecting local conditions , he discovered that the natural surroundings in southern Vietnam closely approximate those in the banana growing areas of central and southern Taiwan .  
One candidate campaigning on an anti-Taiwanese independence ticket stirred up quite a bit of conflict when he went about the southern district of Taipei City " paying his respects " to his opponents . Even veteran ruling party whip Yao Eng-chi , nominated by the ruling party as candidate for Taitung County , did not exempt himself from the local customs and went to demonstrate at the Central Election Commission when his political views were misrepresented on the official election roster .  
Li Xinkui states that in the larger southern Chinese cities , there is a real " resurgence of complex characters , " but that it is " mainly restricted to a few organizations with relatively close contacts with Hong Kong and Taiwan , or else to ordinary people trying to pass themselves off as cultured , as it is fashionable to show that one is able to write complex characters . "  
Under the deep blue sky of southern Taiwan , the square , pure-white gate of the Chinese Air Force Academy at Kangshan in Kaohsiung County is adorned with a pair of mighty eagles , flying with outstretched wings .  
Situated in the southern part of Yunnan Province , Pu'er Township ( in ancient times known as Pu'er Prefecture ) from early in the Tang Dynasty onward , was Yunnan 's commercial tea center . The Tibetans , Mongolians and other ethnic minorities from the northwest , brought horses for barter . They traded horses for tea , forming the famous " tea-horse trade . " Other teas , sold in Thailand and Burma to the south or shipped to the northern capitals , all would pass through Pu'er .  
Early on in the era of Japanese occupation , Chihpen was an aboriginal dwelling place . The Japanese discovered , in the Chihpen stream between southern slopes of a mountain and the river bed , a natural hot spring , gushing out warm water . The water 's temperature was moderate ( between 45and 56 ) ; it had a dense concentration of hydrogen ions ( 7% to 8% ) . This was a very good spring , colorless , odorless , and only slightly salty .  
In the winter the northeast seasonal winds blow strong and harsh , pushing sand and rocks into the northern outlet to the sea . The water thus flows out through the southern exit point . In the summer come the southeast seasonal winds , which blow silt into the southern outlet , so that the Hsiukuluan River heads north for the summer .  
Planning an Itinerary : Most major travel destinations are south of Shihtiping . For this reason , it is best to lay an emphasis on visiting the central and southern portions of the east coast , whether traveling by private vehicle or by public transport . Be sure to plan for a journey of at least three days and two nights .  
Two or three hundred years ago Hakka began coming to Taiwan and settled in relatively interior , mountainous areas in what is now the Pingtung-Kaohsiung region in southern Taiwan and the Taoyuan-Miaoli region in central Taiwan . Here they extended their experience in pioneering harsh and demanding terrain , and their characteristic traits were passed down from generation to generation .  
Shadowless feetHuang Fei-hong was a master of the southern Chinese kungfu , which stresses planting oneself firmly . ( They call the idea " bronze bridge , iron horse . " ) In attacking they strived for steadiness , and so they did n't kick any higher than their waists . The flips and high leaps featured in the movies are derived mainly from the highly vigorous and agile movements of northern kungfu .  
" The ' huachung ' [ or central Chinese climate ] zone of mainland China and the ' huanan ' [ or southern Chinese climate ] zone divide just about at the Ta-an River . To the north , where the rains are heavy , the settlers built wooden structures offering strong protection against the rain . It 's drier to the south , so there they built cool and shady bamboo structures . " And the abundance of rocks strewn on the bed of the Ta-an River led to their use in the embankments between rice paddies .  
The magic is in the detailChen has travelled all over Taiwan and southern Fujian looking at traditional buildings , but his favorite is Chaihsing Villa in Tantsu Rural Township , Taichung County . Its carved wood , chiachishao ( decorative lead-glaze ceramics ) and carved brick-clay tiles are all superb .  
The works of Taiwanese artists who studied at the Tokyo Fine Arts College at that time were subject to the stylistic influences of the impressionist school of the West . Combined with the independent , cordial nature of the Taiwanese people , this influence resulted in the fervent , uninhibited brush strokes displayed in Wang Yue-chih 's paintings of Peking 's scenery and people , and in his bold use of bright colors , which exude the tropical heat of a southern home town .  
TapaishaAt Green Island 's southern extremity , in the water along the coast where the depth exceeds ten meters , there are a lot of large reefs , some of which even rise above the surface of the water . From 50 to 250 meters out , you can see indications of two gigantic reefs . The reefs ' rocks have a great variety of shapes , and giant pieces of coral are spread about . If divers go into the caves , they can see many creatures seeking refuge inside .  
As these five ports were all close to the teagrowing areas of southern China , the supply of tea became abundant and uninterrupted , and after the Treaty of Nanking the huge stocks of tea held in London 's warehouses expanded so much as to become a worrisome burden .  
Looked at from the ocean , he says , the volcanic mountains of the Tatun group appear to be perfectly rounded and smooth , presenting a markedly different picture from the craggy peaks of southern Taiwan . For Portuguese mariners who had already been through the Straits of Malacca and past Luzon Island it is Taiwan 's northern scenery that must have seemed especially remarkable and fresh .  
On one occasion , a KMT candidate in the southern part of the island held an outdoor rally , but cold weather kept voters at home . Fortunately the 80-plus strong overseas support group showed up , saving the candidate from a rather embarrassing situation .  
It is the dangers posed to juvenile deer by wild dogs that causes concern . Nevertheless , today with human footsteps covering every stretch of the land , it is impossible to let the deer go completely wild . Not wanting to put all their eggs in one basket , project personnel hope to select repopulation locales in northern , eastern and southern Taiwan . Since they have been operating in Kenting ( in the south ) for 12 years now , Yangming-shan National Park ( in the north ) is being considered as the second locale .  
It has spent a great amount of funds on a few species like the Formosan landlocked salmon and the Formosan sika , but concern for the maroon oriole and other species is conspicuously absent . A huge quantity of cash is spent on rebuilding sika deer numbers , but the southern cross-island highway will be allowed to divide the Mt . Tawu clouded leopard nature preserve .  
Shen requested permission to build a city in Laochiao . Today 's Hengchun is laid out largely according to those plans . Materials about how the original town was built are described in detail in the National Palace Museum documents . Shen also came up with the policy of developing the mountains with separate northern , central and southern cross-island roads .  
Among the historical materials in the National Palace Museum relating to Liu Mingchuan , one historical incident is particularly worthy of note : In 1884 the French , after failing in an attack of Keelung , attacked Fuzhou . The naval battle there , which took place in the afternoon of the third day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar , lasted only half an hour ( some say only seven minutes ) before the Qing 's southern fleet was defeated .  
Looking back in history , the entire area starting from Taipei 's Po-ai District - - where the Presidential Palace and other national governmental buildings are located - - and radiating out to Taipei 's western and southern districts , used to be named Dajiala . In the earliest period of Taiwan history , it was said to be the hunting grounds of the Ketagalan and an official site for worshipping their ancestors .  
This time the main technical challenge was one of climate : Taiwan 's wet , sub-tropical climate differs vastly from the alternately humid and dry , cold and hot climate of southern Australia . But at least it has continual moisture , which does n't do as much damage as punctuated moisture .  
Bruce Yang , who was a rehabilitation specialist at a major hospital in southern Taiwan , explains that physicians who are able to migrate to New Zealand are mostly already respected doctors at large hospitals in Taiwan , but to requalify in New Zealand they have to take examinations in both clinical practice and basic theory . Even if they do manage to pass and obtain a license to practice , they then have to serve a probationary period as junior hospital doctors .  
By the late Qing dynasty ( 1616-1911 ) , when Western influence spread through the Orient , the pressure from internal strife and external aggression reduced folk music to the percussion troupes which played at weddings , funerals and other such occasions . It was actually the Buddhist and Taoist monks of a few large temples who preserved the tradition of larger scale performances , such as the drum music of Chenghuang Temple in Xi'an , or the wind and percussion playing of the monks of southern Jiangsu .  
In those days , because of geographical factors , northern and southern Taiwan developed distinct varieties of settlement . On the wide , flat plains of southern Taiwan , villages basically massed together . In the mountainous north , settlement was spread out among many little villages .  
Possibly the earliest story of rhododendron cultivation in China is set in the freewheeling days of the Zhen'guan reign ( 627-649 ) of the Tang dynasty . A penniless monk arrives at a monastery in southern China from faraway Mt . Tiantai in Zhejiang , asking for lodging . He is dressed in a simple robe , and carries with him a crock in which he has planted a red rhododendron , which he transplants at Helin Temple in Runzhou .  
Five years ago , because he had to look after his children , he could not go too far from home , so he decided to embark on extended observation of a small , nameless earthen mountain next to the Wanfang residential development . He christened it " Little Green Mountain , " and produced a series of notes and articles describing the natural scenery and plant and animal life through the four seasons on the southern rim of the Taipei basin .  
Kun Opera , which derives its name from the Kunshan area of Jiangsu Province , where it first came into popularity , has one style of tune . As early as the late Yuan and early Ming dynasties , it was recognized as one form of southern song . This period was one of intense political , economic and cultural development in the south .  
It began with the late-Yuan Emperor Shun , who favored the south and moved the empire 's political center there . By the Ming dynasty , the scenic southern banks of the Yangtze River were also home to booming trade and a flowering of the arts which saw frequent performances of music and dance .  
The southern Taiwan sun beats down on the low , densely packed buildings of Er-kung New Village , a military dependents ' community in Tainan County . In the morning market , the crowds seem to boil . In contrast , the expansive grounds of Our Lady of the Assumption Church , located in the center of the village , seem particularly cool and serene .  
Because the economic and political situations in the countries of western and central Africa are worse than in eastern and southern Africa , many countries are worried that after the ban is lifted there the impact on the elephant will be much more severe , so these concerned countries also cast negative votes at the CITES meeting .  
In the first half of October , ROC Vice President Lien Chan paid a visit to Europe . After his itinerary was revealed , it inevitably met with intense pressure from Beijing . The result was that this journey , originally to have covered northern , central and southern Europe and intended to build friendly foreign relations with the three countries of Iceland , Austria and Spain , lost Spain as a destination .  
There are but few aboriginals left living in their tribal villages and living by hunting alone ; at best , hunting is a sideline . Like other aboriginal peoples , the Rukai of Wutai are leaving behind traditional life . But , comparatively speaking , Wutai remains less disrupted . Being in remote southern Taiwan , and as yet without intrusion by major roads , there are few outsiders , and the simple village life is relatively intact .  
With the opening of the domestic telecommunications market , TransAsia Telecommunications won the right to operate a cellular telephone business in southern Taiwan . The company established its headquarters in Kaohsiung but could n't find a marketing manager . Eventually , the company had to go through a head hunter which found them Sean Hsieh in Taipei . Hsieh had worked as a sales strategist at an advertising firm and as a marketing strategist at a producer of physical education products before he was hired to be TransAsia 's marketing manager .  
As the southern weather turns hot and stuffy , the ducks , missing the spring breezes which they need for their breeding season , grow bored and their hormones subside . At the same time , spring is gradually spreading across the north , melting the Earth 's icy veil . With natural enemies there few in number but food plentiful , one after the other the ducks and geese start to return home .  
In the southern Bay Area , where land is dear , the facilities at the Overseas Chinese Education Center are cramped , and most of the elderly groups try their luck elsewhere . On normal days the groups meet at municipal senior centers , apartment complexes for the elderly that house many seniors from Taiwan , or other places where they share space and resources with people of other ethnic groups .  
Also , from the Eastern Han ( 25-220 ) onward , the political center gradually moved from north China to south of the Yangtze . This geographical shift brought with it a gradual change in spatial attitudes . The limestone geology of southern China has endowed it with many deep and mysterious caves which nature has fashioned into remarkable shapes , and these constantly fired human imaginations .  
Mike Moritz , a partner in the American venture capital firm Sequoia Capital , was one of those making presentations at a venture capitalists ' forum held by the Monte Jade Science and Technology Association in the southern Bay Area in September of last year . In his presentation he noted that on average he reviews 20 applications for investment every day . He says that , in the end , what is actually required to clinch a deal is a person who is familiar with both sides involved .  
Damiana is far from being an impressive plant . In the arid areas of the peninsula , which are dominated by huge columnar cacti and wide-canopied mesquite trees , its humble appearance may belie its importance for the local inhabitants . It is a small shrubby plant that grows in the dry soils of northern Mexico , Baja California and southern Texas .  
Unlike the heavy northern lions , the " southern lions " which dominate another corner sport relaxed grins . The typical southern lion has a twisting head and wagging tail , flowing lines , and a happy smile which seems to say that over the thousands of years of Chinese history it has seen much joy and many rich harvests .  
Although there is an impressive number of lions on display , the museum is unable to ascribe an accurate date and place of origin to each pair . For the time being , it is only able to group them into rough categories . For instance , Southern Fujianese lions from Hui'an and from Tong'an near Quanzhou are placed together , and the shigandang , which have their origins in belief in stone spirits , are placed alongside the wind lion lords which protect their owners from ravaging " evil " winds on small southern islands .  
In southern Taiwan , although the election for mayor of Kaohsiung also included an independent candidate , Cheng Te-yao , and an NP candidate , Wu Chien-kuo , the real battle remained that between the DPP 's Frank Hsieh and the KMT 's Wu Den-yih . From the very beginning of the campaign it was thought that Hsieh had little chance of winning , having been involved in the Sung Chi-li cult scandal and facing an incumbent with eight years of experience as mayor . At first , there was much less coverage of the Kaohsiung mayoral race .  
In the end Frank Hsieh won by a tiny margin of just over 4,000 votes . Political observer and National Sun Yat-sen University professor Chen Mau-hsiung has argued that Wu Den-yih originally held the upper hand in the election , but lost women 's votes as a result of the tape-recording affair . In contrast , the later video merely compounded the dissatisfaction of the electorate , contributing to the DPP gaining control in southern Taiwan .  
In future manual butchering will have to give way to mechanized slaughtering with electric stunning . The well over 100,000 chickens and ducks consumed in Greater Taipei each day will also have to be slaughtered electrically close to the farms in central and southern Taiwan , to reduce the suffering they now endure when transported tightly packed in cages .  
Since then , Tainan-style pork noodles , spicy Hunan chicken and Peking roast duck have formed a chorus line on Taiwan 's restaurant buffets . Disciples of Tibetan lamas have worshipped next door to followers of the mother goddess Matzu , and gents from northeast China have made brides of Penghu ladies . For half a century , southern accents have mixed with northern ones . The Three Gorges of the Yangtze and the Chuoshui River have both nourished the imaginations of Taiwanese people .  
Nanguan is most popular in Quanzhou , Xiamen , and the Minnan-speaking region in general . There is an elegant simplicity about it , and a hint of reserve . Its songs are soft , beautiful , and expressive , and contrast sharply with the brash , bold northern music often heard at weddings , funerals , and other such functions . Both types of music are very popular in southern Fujian and Taiwan .  
In Malaysia , Fujianese is widely used in the northern part of western Malaysia and in the southern part of Malaysia , in some places in eastern Malaysia , and especially in Penang , the small island that constitutes the major Chinese settlement in all of Malaysia . I 've never heard anyone call Fujian-ese fulaoren ( literally : " Fujian old chap " ) , because the character lao has a derogatory meaning among Chinese speakers in Malaysia . I hope in the future you will be cautious in using this term .  
Facing an uncertain fate , and caught between the northern and southern governments , parliamentarians were unable to hold meaningful sessions , nor could they collect any regular salaries , so it is no surprise that these early parliamentarians , many idealistic to start with , ended up giving in to temptation . There is nothing new under the sun about intellectuals being sullied by the realities of hard-nosed politics .  
Lie-chi likes to recall the time a music troupe came all the way from southern Taiwan with a large gong that needed tuning . Lin Wu tapped it a few times , sized up the problem , and with one sharp whack of his wooden mallet announced that the gong was fixed . The visitors were deeply disappointed at Lin s seemingly cavalier attitude , but when they struck the gong and heard the results , the elated musicians could n't stop marveling at Lin 's uncanny skill .  
The only people allowed to fly in or out of Kinmen were senior military officials and persons in need of emergency medical treatment . A Kinmen native living in Taipei had to first spend two entire working days completing the paperwork , then take a day traveling by train to the southern port of Kaohsiung . From there the traveler boarded a military landing craft for a choppy trip back home lasting more than ten hours .  
Ju Ming has hired the artist Chuang Ming-chi to fly up every week from his home in southern Taiwan to spend the weekends in residence at the museum painting the outside wall of the Main Building . In bold black lines , Chuang has been covering the wall with assorted images of people and animals in stylized representations reminiscent of aboriginal art .  
With the rise of industry in Kaohsiung , the agricultural counties of central and southern Taiwan began to lag behind , but at least there was a minimal kind of balance on the island as a whole with " two heads , one north and one south . " And to some degree the provincial government 's location in Nantou-and the resulting stream of visiting city and county bureaucrats-meant that central Taiwan was n't all that forlorn .  
" If you really want to help those cities and counties , then you 've got to implement ' local self-rule , ' so that the local governments ( which are now only tertiary government units ) really acquire sufficient power and money , " argues Hsia Chu-joe . Otherwise , if the " southern science park " that is now being built in Tainan County is successful , perhaps it , in combination with the " three direct links " and the high-speed railway will create new opportunity for central and southern Taiwan .  
The mainlanders have introduced the cuisines of their home provinces and a longing for the old country . Likewise , the attitudes of civil servants loyal to the KMT have also taken firm root in Taipei . What 's more , a larger proportion of Hakkas live in Taipei than any place ooutside of their traditional bases in the countryside , and the city also has a large community of aborigines . With this population structure , the Taiwanese chauvinism so prevalent in southern Taiwan is rather rare in Taipei .  
When the Dutch took over Tainan , they encouraged the cultivation and export of cane sugar , a crop that grew exceptionally well on the Chianan Plain stretching out from Tainan in almost every direction . On the strength of this economic base , Tainan naturally became the political center of Taiwan . Although southern Taiwan is dominated today by Kaohsiung , back then the latter was just one of Tainan 's satellite ports , with development limited by heavy silting and shallow berths .  
In 1874 the Japanese , acting under the pretext that certain Ryukyu islanders had been murdered in Taiwan , sent a military expedition to occupy Mutanshe in southern Taiwan . Then in 1884 France , having declared war on China , attacked and shut down Keelung . All this made the Manchu court realize Taiwan 's importance as a gateway to the seven provinces along the southeastern coast . Clearly , the aims of foreign powers vis-a-vis Taiwan had changed .  
Over 20,000 advance tickets have been sold , and group visits are already booked solid to the end of January . Many schools in central and southern Taiwan are renting buses by the dozen to ferry their students up to Taipei , and lots of foreign tourists are also coming by for a look .  
Most of Taiwan 's venomous snakes live in low-altitude farmland and sparsely populated countryside . But the hundred-pace viper , which was never very numerous , is at home in densely forested areas at low to medium elevations in the mountains of eastern , central and southern Taiwan . It grows to one-and-a-half meters or more-much the same length as the habu and cobra-but being far thicker and meatier it is much valued by gourmands .  
Pinglin Township is situated in rural southern Taipei County . Being relatively remote , the area was not developed until the late 18th century . Pinglin is a pocket of level ground set in mountain forests , whence its name , which means " forest on level ground . "  
They 've got genuine leather furniture , real wood floors , and shelves lined with tens of thousands of manga comics and magazines . Every computer has a 15-inch flat panel display . At the other end of the market , you can go down to Pingtung in southern Taiwan and find very unassuming little Internet cafes with modest decor , barebones equipment , and none of the " all you can eat and drink " signs you 're apt to find in up-market establishments . How many is too many ?  
Elsewhere in the ROC the traditional Han Chinese culture was southern Fujianese . Meanwhile , eastern Fujian itself has experienced such rapid develpment that almost all of its traditional architecture has been destroyed . The traditional eastern Fujianese settlements on Matsu are just about the only ones left in pristine condition anywhere in the world .  
Much to his surprise , someone showed up in the middle of the night with bolt cutters and set him free . Fully awake to the treacherous intentions of his relatives , Wang decided to head for southern China and make a life there together with Yueh-ching , the sweet and innocent daughter of a tenant farmer . The two married , and warfare continued .  
Typhoon Trami , a " mini " typhoon with a radius of just 100 km , closed in on southern Taiwan on July 11 . The storm had been downgraded to a tropical depression by the time it passed over land that evening , but no sooner had the typhoon warning been lifted than the ensuing weather system unleashed a torrential downpour on Kaohsiung , causing the worst flooding in the city 's history .  
So runs a local rhyme passed down by the residents of southern Taiwan 's Tungkang Township . Tungkang is a fishing village famed not only for its " three treasures " - bluefin tuna , oilfish and banded coral shrimp-but also for its Tapeng Bay National Scenic Area . Here in Tungkang , tourists and locals rub shoulders on streets scented with the damp smell of the sea , while out on the sea a few speckled boats pitch and roll as they sail slowly towards China .  
Before Kaohsiung was founded , Tungkang was southern Taiwan 's primary commercial harbor . But World War II devastated the wealthy sections of the town . Tungkang was left a virtual ruin , and no trace of the town 's Japanese-occupation-era prosperity remains . Arriving from Pingtung or Kaohsiung , all one sees is a typical fishing village-a harbor populated by a few boats , a great deal of fishing tackle and betelnuts .  
Maxwell practiced his brand of medical missionary work in Taiwan for six-and-a-half years , travelling throughout central and southern Formosa , and he founded three Presbyterian parishes . One was in the southernmost area , inhabited by the Sir-aya indigenous people ( around today 's Mucha and Tsochen ) , a second in the south-central region of Taiwan ( Paiho , Chiaya ) , and a third in north-central Taiwan , home to the Pazeh people ( today 's Puli , Fengyuan , and Shenkang ) .  
The resulting melange , sung in the local Minnan dialect , came to be known as gezai xi , or Taiwanese Opera , a very easy and enjoyable opera form that grew within 20 years into the most popular opera genre in Minnan-speaking areas . Troupes in Taiwan that had specialized in Beiguan , Gaojia , and Liyuan Opera switched over to Taiwanese Opera , and thanks to the close ties between Taiwan and Fujian , Taiwanese Opera took southern Fujian by storm in the 1920s and 30s .  
Any performer who got a bit careless might find himself labeled a " saboteur of the model operas . " They took to singing in the very high-pitched falsetto of Peking Opera , while the costumes and makeup were based on Yue Opera . As a result , gezai xi gradually lost its distinctive character , and came more and more to resemble Peking and Yue Opera . There was also the problem of tailoring southern opera for a northern audience .  
Although the seminar was held in early November , the weather in Kinmen was still warm and sunny , with a sky so blue you could practically reach up and squeeze the water out of it . Scattered here and there amidst newly constructed five-story apartment blocks were traditional southern Fujian-style homes , with their rounded roof ridges and flying eaves . If it were n't for the camouflaged bunkers scattered all over the island , one might well have forgotten that the area once reeked of gunpowder and was stationed with 100,000 troops .  
The latter question , which comes from the recommendation system for the department of medicine at National Taiwan University , is even more interesting : It is said that many top students from famous high schools touched and smelled the white powder and ended up venturing meaningless answers like " colorless and odorless crystal substance . " Only one student , a kid from southern Taiwan who obviously knows her way around a kitchen , said nothing , but lit the kerosene lamp , and dumped the substance into the boiling water . Eureka !  
When students used to come from southern Taiwan to Taipei to study 20 years ago , they were warned about Taipei 's gray and wet winters . Friends and relatives reminded them to carry a newspaper with them at all times to keep off the fine rain of the northeastern monsoon . Over the years , however , Taipei 's winters have changed , becoming drier and less overcast .  
Through satellite observations , the fishing industry has gradually come to understand the waxing and waning of cold and warm currents . Noting the succession of warm winters in the 1990s , and a 1 �X C rise in sea temperatures around Taiwan , the Taiwan Fisheries Research Institute also began making fish catch forecasts based on sea temperatures . For instance , the temperature that best suits mullet is 21-23 �X C , but last year the institute predicted that sea temperatures around southern Taiwan would be 2-3 �X C warmer this winter than in previous years .  
The blinding light reflecting off the textured surface is both mysterious and moving . Lava story Between eight and 17 million years ago , in the southern part of the Taiwan Strait , magma forced its way through fractures in the earth 's crust . The lava poured through to the surface , accumulating and covering the earth in large and small piles , creating the impressively beautiful Penghu archipelago .  
All types of fish that can be eaten raw have a fairly high fat content , but the bluefin is particularly famed for its fattiness . The Pacific bluefin that migrate through the waters east of Taiwan prefer lower water temperatures than other tuna , and usually stay north of the 18th parallel . To protect it from cold the Pacific bluefin has more fat than the yellowfin and albacore , which are distributed around the equator , or the southern bluefin , which lives in the southern hemisphere .  
At a symposium on the control of environmental hormones held in April , Professor Liu Li-lian , director of the Institute of Marine Biology at National Sun Yat-sen University in Kaohsiung , described the results of a coastal survey in southern Taiwan . The natural ratio of males to females in oyster drills is about one to one , " so when I noticed that the Thais clavigera we were catching had all turned male , I knew something was wrong , " said Liu with alarm .  
A courageous pioneer in literary style , even when he was demoted to governor of Chaozhou Prefecture , Han Yu brought his colorful lifestyle to that far-flung uncivilized southern realm , thereby displaying once again his ability to transcend worldly concerns of fame and fortune , and his characteristic willingness to uphold the values of a life of beauty and goodness . Perhaps this is a better reason for modern scholars to offer a stick of sweet-smelling incense in his memory .  
In visiting the area , IACT members found that the Tibetans , accustomed to living in a cool , dry climate at high altitudes , still maintained some of their previous customs even after moving to southern India , and these created a higher incidence of transmission of disease .  
In winter , the northeast monsoon makes for cold and wet weather with frequent fog and gusting rains on the northern side of the pass , while the southern side stays clear and dry . The very distinct climates make for radically different kinds of vegetation on the two sides of the pass .  
A doctor from a health center located in a southern county , who wishes to remain anonymous , says that when SARS hit , because the center had been converted into a treatment center , more than half their time was spent in examining patients rather than doing general epidemic prevention work . Indeed , even now the government lacks a clear focus for future tasks such as promoting cervical examinations , encouraging neighborhood environmental hygiene , or taking preventive measures against chronic diseases .  
When dengue fever was attacking southern Taiwan , the average health center in a rural township had only five employees . But communities there are spread widely and it required a great deal of time and personnel to visit each and every community and inspect outdoor containers of standing water , destroy carrier mosquitoes , and spray disinfectant .  
The ancestors of this pint-sized member of the family Sylviidae ( the old-world warblers ) came from cold northern lands . Biogeographical evidence shows that they first spread out northeastward from the Himalayas into northern and northeastern China and Japan , and later moved south during the ice ages , reaching Taiwan via southern China or Japan .  
The Japanese faced fierce resistance in the early years of the colonial period , especially in the central and southern parts of the island . Many administrative orders went ignored outside of Taipei 's walled district where the colonial government was headquartered , and the post of governor-general changed hands in rapid succession . Relative stability was not achieved until Gentaro Gotama took over and appointed Shinpei Goto as his chief administrator . The building housing today 's Taiwan Museum was originally built in memory of these two men .  
Over time , with the constant expansion and division of academic disciplines , new units were established , including divisions of medicine , engineering , and agricultural science , as well as graduate institutes of tropical medicine , southern civilization , and southern resources . By the time Japanese rule ended in 1945 , the university had five academic divisions , a preparatory school , three graduate institutes , and 115 academic chairs , with 378 full-time academic personnel , 123 part-time personnel and 382 students .  
Wu Wei-ting points out that in the past feminist groups mostly talked to the media , but did n't do much to relate to real women at the grass-roots level . Thus , when New Awakening held a series of seminars in northern , central , and southern Taiwan on property rights of husbands and wives , you could tell the large gap between city and country from the reception they received from the audience .  
" Setting down roots and deepening our impact is the real hard job , " says Yu Mei-nu . To help close the gap between town and country , two years ago they began organizing women 's groups in northern , central , southern , and eastern Taiwan to create the NUTWA , to create a platform for information and resource sharing . They are now moving to use the Internet to link women 's groups across the island .  
Furthermore , Taiwan cuisine went through a period of study , when it was absorbing the advantages of various Chinese regional cuisines , and it created a new kind of cuisine . This represents an even bigger revolution than the one that occurred after the southward migration during the Song dynasty , when the wealthy all moved to Hangzhou and developed " northern cooking with southern ingredients . "  
In order to strengthen the tuberculosis treatment network , the Department of Health has made preliminary plans to use Taipei 's Hospital for Chronic Diseases , Taoyuan Hospital , Taichung Hospital , the Center for Chest Disease , and Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital as diagnostic referral centers for northern , central , and southern Taiwan , accepting TB patients who have been diagnosed at regular hospitals or whose disease is proving difficult to treat .  
After the western Taiwan high-speed transportation network is established , the future will bring construction projects for eastern , central and southern Taiwan where the terrain presents even greater difficulties ; and it can be predicted that the transportation , economic and environmental challenges will be greater , so that society will have greater expectations and exert more supervision .  
Its towering presence is beyond the power of words to describe . Additionally , the summit provides a panoramic view of the main sources of water that nourish the land . The Nantsaihsien River and Laonung River are the sources of southern Taiwan 's Kaoping River ; the Chenyoulan River , largest tributary of central Taiwan 's Choshui River , winds its way to the northwest ; and the valley of the Lakulaku River , which feeds eastern Taiwan 's Hsiukuluan River , is also visible in the distance .  
In September of last year , Dr . Lin , who had for a long time focused her research on blood groups and ethnic groups , published the results of a study entitled " Correlation between SARS virus infection and the human leukocyte antigen . " Lin concluded that there is a direct connection between the presence of the human leukocyte antigen HLA-B46 and the severity of a SARS infection . She found that ethnic southern Chinese who  
Boosted by record low interest rates since the beginning of the year , an atmosphere of optimism surrounds the real estate market throughout Taiwan . Offers ranging from upmarket homes in Taipei City , to townhouses in central and southern Taiwan with ads touting 100% financing , have stirred awake many people 's long-silent itch to buy .  
They attributed the crisis , one of the most severe agricultural disasters in southern Africa over the past 10 years , to " the area 's weakened farm production and supply after two years of production decline caused by bad weather coupled with economic crisis and the suspension of agricultural activities in some areas . "  
They indicated : " Natural disasters have resulted in poor harvests for 2 consecutive years .  In addition , economic crisis and disruption of farming activities in some areas have reduced production and supply of foods to the region - creating one of the worst agricultural catastrophes in southern Africa in 10 years . "  
They noted : " Two successive years of poor harvests brought about by natural calamities , coupled with economic crises and the disrupted farming in some areas , have reduced the food production and supply in this region , resulting in one of the gravest agricultural disasters in a decade in southern Africa .

The system of apartheid sought to dehumanize entire peoples and imposed on the region of southern Africa a brutal war which has resulted in untold loss of life , destruction of property and massive displacement of innocent people .  
It should be recalled that the first phase ( five years ) of this endeavour will be the strengthening of existing regional economic communities in west , eastern , central , southern and north Africa .  
However , new refugees continued to arrive from southern Iraq and , unless effective preventive policies were pursued , a larger refugee inflow could be recorded in the months ahead .  
Having considered the item entitled " Activities of foreign economic and other interests which are impeding the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples in Territories under colonial domination and efforts to eliminate colonialism , apartheid and racial discrimination in southern Africa " ,  
South Africa will meet this challenge with a firm commitment to the promotion of national welfare , prosperity and security , with a firm commitment to the strengthening of cooperation in the pursuit of the economic development and security of the southern African subregion , with an active commitment to peace , stability and good governance within the African region and elsewhere , with a firm commitment to South-South cooperation and with a commitment to responsible international citizenship .  
We are , in effect , seeing the steady growth of a series of complementary regional arrangements perhaps becoming even hemispheric in effect for the southern half of the globe which underpin the international non-proliferation regime and give it a distinctive regional commitment .  
His report was thus based on the information that he had gathered in those countries , on numerous reports of United Nations bodies and humanitarian organizations active in the southern Sudan and on detailed reports from reliable sources concerning the situation of human rights in the northern and southern regions of the Sudan .  
The informal cooperation that now exists on security issues in the region and the conclusion of more formal economic cooperation arrangements have contributed significantly towards building confidence in the prospect of a more secure , democratic and prosperous future for southern Africa .  
It needs to be emphasized that a peaceful settlement of the Angolan civil conflict is not only essential for the people of Angola themselves , but also of major importance to political stability and economic development in southern Africa as a whole .  
This blockade is being accompanied daily by heavy artillery shelling and murderous air-raids which have resulted in numerous casualties among innocent civilians in southern Lebanon and in the western Bekaa and caused considerable material damage .  
Deeply concerned further by the increasingly severe and grave violations of human rights by the Government of Iraq against the civilian population in southern Iraq , in particular in the southern marshes , where the combination of massive drainage projects and wide-ranging military operations on the part of the Government of Iraq has forced residents of the marshes to flee in large numbers , many of whom have sought refuge on the border between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran ,  
Also expresses special alarm at the grave violations of human rights in southern Iraq , and urges the Government of Iraq to implement without further delay the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur , including , inter alia , the immediate halting and reversal of the draining of the marshes and the cessation of its military activities against the marsh Arabs , whose survival as a community is endangered ;  
The facilitation of mutually beneficial joint economic projects to improve living conditions in central and southern Bosnia and Herzegovina has helped to lay a foundation of confidence and trust among a population that had previously witnessed some of the most intense fighting in the present conflict .  
In support of efforts to advance and incorporate environmental concerns at the earliest possible stages of economic decision-making , as recommended by Agenda 21 , support has been provided to a network of southern NGOs and development practitioners to build their capacity and collaboration capability in communications and research activities aimed at clarifying key policy issues before the Commission on Sustainable Development ( CSD ) .  
A regional project in southern Africa is providing training to managers and field workers in interpersonal communication skills and the use of low-cost audiovisual materials .  Rural radio remains the most effective mass medium to reach large numbers of rural audiences and FAO is continuing its efforts to strengthen rural radio services , especially in Africa .  
The war in southern Sudan , which began four decades ago and which , with the exception of the relative calm between 1972 and 1983 , has continued unabated , has claimed the lives of well over 1-million persons and has hindered , if not completely thwarted , efforts to move the country along a path of meaningful and lasting progress .

The Special Rapporteur believes that the racial dimension of the violations and abuses against children living in northern Sudan , or , in the case of children in southern Sudan , those who are abducted and sold into slavery constitutes a particularly grave and alarming circumstance , which should be of particular concern from a human rights perspective .  
NULLAs far as the situation in southern Sudan is concerned , hundreds of thousands of children continue to live in insecurity in the conflict zones , in danger of being abducted , exposed to lasting psychological trauma , or living in inappropriate conditions .  
During 1995 , the UNICEF Regional Office continued to work with the secretariat in developing analytical materials on major issues affecting southern African children , including human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) , and is exploring possible collaboration with the human resource development sector in the area of basic education .

Although southern Africa today enjoys relative peace and stability , it will continue to need special assistance in order to address the problems of reconstruction and development of the economic , physical and social infrastructures which were destroyed or adversely affected by many years of war and racial injustice . 
Today , the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan is concentrating its efforts on tasks whose successful accomplishment will make it possible to reconstruct the social and economic infrastructure of the southern part of the Republic , which was devastated by the civil war ; to reintegrate the disrupted regional sectors of the national economy on a new basis ; and to convert the distorted centralized national economy that we inherited into a modern market economy .  
Drought or inadequate supplies of water in southern and northern parts of the continent reduced agricultural output and increased the diversion of foreign exchange earnings for food imports in several countries in 1995 .  
The system complements operational early warning systems for food security in eastern and southern Africa by providing fast and efficient data distribution capacity for environmental satellite data produced by the ARTEMIS system of FAO at Rome .  
For example , ITTO 's Guidelines and Criteria , covers forests of ITTO producer countries in all tropical regions ; the Montreal Process encompasses the temperate and boreal zone forests outside Europe in both the northern and southern hemispheres ; the Tarapoto Proposal includes humid tropical , tidal and riverine forests in the Amazon basin ; and the recent UNEP / FAO Dry-Zone Sub-Saharan Africa initiative covers the arid , semi-arid and dry sub-humid-zone forests and woodlands .

For the sole reason that it was a colony of the Japanese imperialists , Korea was included in the operational zone of the Allied forces at the final stage of the Second World War , when the United States of America " persuaded " the then Soviet Union that " the United States forces should participate in disarming the Japanese forces stationed in Korea " , and thereby divided Korea along the 38th parallel of north latitude " temporarily " , placing the northern part of Korea under Soviet responsibility and the southern part under United States responsibility .  
Condemning Israel 's continued occupation of parts of southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa in flagrant violation of international law and in continuing disregard of Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) and relevant subsequent resolutions ,

Upon instructions from my Government , I have the honour to request Your Excellency to convene an urgent meeting of the Security Council to consider the grave situation in Lebanon resulting from the large-scale Israeli bombardment of many towns and villages in my country , including the southern suburb of Beirut , causing alarming numbers of civilian dead and wounded , thousands of displaced persons and severe damage to property .  
The United States is now engaged in an intensive diplomatic effort to restore calm and establish a more stable situation in the area which would enhance the security and well-being of the civilian population of both southern Lebanon and northern Israel .  
Israel 's premeditated and unbridled aerial and artillery attacks over the past five days against many civilian quarters in towns and villages of Lebanon , including the southern suburbs of Beirut , and its naval blockade of the port of Beirut are prime examples of acts of terrorism by Israeli policy makers , who all too readily and conveniently label others either as terrorists or as supporters of terrorists . 
The Chinese delegation expresses its profound concern at the large-scale military offensive launched by Israel in recent days in southern Lebanon , which has resulted in the loss of innocent civilian lives , the massive destruction of property and a large number of civilians ' becoming homeless or refugees , consequently further escalating the conflict in southern Lebanon and aggravating the already tense situation .

A positive example for landlocked countries that lie in the centre of continents is that of Switzerland and Austria , which have served as successful hosts for short-cut routes through the Alps , providing connections from northern and western Europe to southern and eastern Europe - with notable benefits to their own economies , among the world 's most successful and richest .  
However , indicators pointing to a potential deterioration in the humanitarian situation have accumulated since early 1996 , particularly in southern Somalia , and , by the middle of the year , United Nations agencies were uncertain how much longer a renewed humanitarian crisis could be held back under prevailing conditions .  
However , the implementation of return-and-reintegration programmes was subsequently disrupted because of increased political instability and armed conflict , in particular in southern Somalia , provoking renewed population movements , mainly towards relatively peaceful areas in the north-east and north-west , but also within the southern regions of the country .  
Although the Special Envoy received commitments from all the parties to attend talks , the new political environment resulting from developments in March-April ( presidential and legislative elections in the Sudan ; realignment of certain southern movements with the Government ) prevented their actual resumption owing to the absence of recognized , legitimate interlocutors among the parties concerned .  
These include the protection and security of relief personnel and convoys ; clearance of OLS flights into southern Sudan ; the extension of the March 1994 and May 1994 IGAD agreements on OLS humanitarian assistance into areas of cooperation left unaddressed by those agreements , such as modalities for the delivery of relief supplies involving cross-line convoys and access to conflict-affected areas , as well as the modalities for monitoring compliance with the relative principles and procedures ; operational procedures for international non-governmental organizations based in Khartoum .  
On instructions from my Government , and further to our earlier letters concerning Israel 's repeated attacks on southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa and the arbitrary practices against the local inhabitants in which Israel engages on a daily basis , I have the honour to notify you of the series of such incidents that took place during the second half of July and in August 1996 .  
In many countries , although scarcity is less of a problem at the national level , overuse of groundwater , contributing to waterlogging and salinity , has become a major problem in specific regions , such as northern China , western and southern India and parts of Mexico . 
The Summit noted that the prevailing situation in Angola is the remaining major obstacle to total regional stability within the SADC region which is seriously hindering the joint development programmes of the region , and , in this context urged UNITA to commit itself to peace and democracy in Angola so as to contribute effectively to the establishment of a new era of peace and cooperation in southern Africa . 
All that the people of southern Africa are asking for now is a chance to live in peace so that they can address the myriad problems and challenges left unattended for decades by previous colonial and racist regimes in their region . 
Overcoming the many years of conflict in Angola would not only be a major blessing for a country which is friendly to us , for its people and for other States in the region of southern Africa , but would also be a substantial success for the peacemaking efforts of the United Nations and of the international community as a whole , which have invested significant human , material and financial resources in support of the Angolan peace process .  
While underlining that the law was applied without religious discrimination and with respect for the rights of non-Muslims , Mr . Turabi explained that consumption of alcohol was not a crime in the southern states , while in the north it was authorized for non-Muslims in private and forbidden in public .  
According to unofficial reports , non-Muslims outside the southern states have been found guilty of and punished for religious offences based on Islam ( hudud ) , especially for failing to observe the Islamic dress code and the prohibition of the sale or consumption of alcohol .  
On the other hand , the missile attached launched in retaliation by the United States in the southern region of the country causing substantial loss of life , an attack that had been condemned by the international community , constituted a violation of the inalienable right of the Kurdish people to express freely their will without foreign interference and was part of a deliberate campaign by the United States authorities aimed at bringing about the disintegration of the Iraqi State and undermining the national unity and territorial integrity of a sovereign State .  
For countries like Madagascar , South-South and regional cooperation had become a necessary strategy for promoting national , regional and global development through collective autonomy , which was a basic tool for stimulating growth , technologies and accelerated development .  Madagascar was involved in the Indian Ocean Commission and had participated in the work of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa ( COMESA ) , which united the countries of eastern and southern Africa .

While it remains committed to its decision , taken in response to the proposal of the governments of a number of friendly countries , notably the Russian Federation and France , to give political action a chance to remedy the situation with respect to the unlawful no-flight zones in northern and southern Iraq , the Government of Iraq has sought to inform you of the facts of the matter so that the international community may be aware of the dangers posed by the continued maintenance of the no-flight zones to security and peace in the region . 
The cooperation between UNHCR and SADC will focus , inter alia , on the social , economic and political issues in the southern African region that have a bearing on the root causes of forced population displacement , refugee protection , provision of humanitarian assistance and the search for durable solution .  
The European Union , wishing to respond to the challenges of the post-cold-war world , proposes to take up three major challenges over the years ahead : the establishment of an economic and monetary union ; the strengthening of its institutional base through the implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty ; and preparation for further enlargement towards the eastern and southern Europe .  
We are concerned at the constant threat to the southern borders of the Commonwealth of Independent States coming from Afghanistan ; the flow of narcotics and contraband weapons ; reports that reach us about gross violations of humanitarian law by the warring factions , including mass killings of civilians and prisoners of war ; the blockade by the Taliban of the central regions of Afghanistan populated by the Hazara people , and the continuing large-scale violations of human rights , particularly the rights of women and children .  
The aim is to facilitate farming activities for more than 20,000 rural families , to demine energy and transport infrastructures and to destroy the 85,000 mines that are still scattered across our national territory in various locations , including around high-tension pylons , electrical substations , bridges , relay stations and areas with radio aerials along the northern and southern borders .  
Through the Treaty of Tlatelolco , whose thirtieth anniversary is being celebrated this year , the treaties of Rarotonga , Bangkok and Pelindaba , and the Antarctic Treaty , the southern hemisphere and adjacent areas covered by these treaties are rapidly becoming free of nuclear weapons , as the General Assembly recognized with satisfaction last autumn .  
Over the past few years , higher international prices , new mining codes with more clearly defined rights and obligations of foreign investors , and aid-financed geologic surveys had contributed to a large increase in the exploration for mineral deposits and with notable success .  Gold production in particular has increased rapidly in several countries in western and southern Africa .  
Those events had a direct impact on humanitarian conditions , owing to the resultant imposition of increased restrictions on the Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in northern Cyprus , stricter security measures and interruption of regular medical transport to the southern part of the island as well as loss of employment for Turkish Cypriots working in the southern part of Cyprus .

To condemn the persistent Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied regions of southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa , as exemplified by the kidnapping and arbitrary arrest of civilians and the destruction of their homes , the confiscation of their property and their expulsion from their land , as well as by the shelling of peaceful villages and urban areas ;  
They included : the particularly high proportion of women living in poverty in southern Italy ; the need to ensure greater participation by women in policy-making ; the excessive glorification of women 's role in domestic life ; the inadequate emphasis on article 4 of the Convention and the absence of quantitative goals for women 's participation in political and public life ; and the need to address questions relating to violence against women from a broader societal prospective which would reject traditional patriarchal attitudes .  
In approving the new distribution plan , I have informed the Government that the United Nations accepts the Government 's assurances as a commitment that the necessary additional resources will be available for vulnerable groups in central and southern Iraq .

As documented in the present report and in previous reports , these restrictions relate primarily to access by Operation Lifeline Sudan to needy populations , whether in the form of relief flights from the base at Lokichokio into southern Sudan , humanitarian action in favour of the over 2-million internally displaced persons living in and around greater Khartoum , or permission to assess the conditions of civilian populations in the Nuba Mountains or in new areas of need created as a result of a resurgence of hostilities .  
For decades , it has been growing dangerously worse and , as part of this process , the structural adjustment policies implemented by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in the countries of the southern hemisphere and in central and eastern Europe are having disastrous social consequences .  
Recurrent drought in the southern Africa region this decade , the weak economic base of the country , which is almost exclusively agricultural , a rather unbalanced social infrastructure , which is partly due to the low literacy rate inherited from the previous regime , and the problem of disease , including HIV / AIDS , pose a serious threat to our nascent democracy .  
In that statement baseless and unsubstantiated allegations were made against some regional States , including my country , to divert the attention of the international community from the illegal policies and inhuman actions of Israel , such as the continued occupation of the territories of others , including Al-Quds Al-Sharif , southern Lebanon and the Syrian Golan .  
It is also natural for Algeria to plead for a global and integrated approach to the security and development of the Mediterranean , convinced as it is that there can be no genuine security for all as long as serious and intolerable imbalances persist between the northern and southern shores of the Mediterranean .  
We also express our commitment to all the various tracks of the peace process without exception , with a view to guaranteeing Israel 's total withdrawal from all occupied Arab and Palestinian territories , including the Syrian Golan , southern Lebanon and the Beka'a valley , and respect by Israel for international law and for the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people , including its rights to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent State on its national territory , with Al-Quds as its capital .

However , in complex or overtly political situations , such as Cambodia , southern Sudan , northern Iraq and the former Yugoslavia , special arrangements were put in place on a case _ by _ case basis , including the designation of a lead agency to coordinate the international humanitarian response .  
In this context we must recall the brutal acts of aggression carried out on Lebanese territory by the Israelis on an almost daily basis , the bombardments by Israeli military aircraft , the use against civilians of proscribed weapons , the naval blockade of Lebanon 's southern coast and the inhumane practices carried out against Lebanese citizens in the occupied area .

In the interim , consultations are continuing on ways and means to implement the southern African regional action programme on light arms and illicit arms trafficking , developed at a workshop of southern African and European Union officials and experts held near Pretoria in May 1998 .  
Surely the subject deserved some mention , and some trifling consideration might have been given to the possibility of an effort to cleanse central and southern Iraq of the effects of this radioactive weapon , which is killing tens of thousands of Iraqi children every year and will continue to affect future generations as well .  
It was therefore truly regrettable that violations of such principles continued to occur , as in the imposition of the aerial exclusion zones in northern and southern Iraq by two permanent members of the Security Council , the continuing military attacks on Iraq and the interference in its internal affairs .
