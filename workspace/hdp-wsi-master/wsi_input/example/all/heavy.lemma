The Department also set up a Healthy Living into the 21st Century exhibition counter at the Victoria Park Fair venue to disseminate environmental protection , hygiene and health related messages with a heavy focus on the activities of the Council in these matters .  The exhibition materials included photographs , video-tapes , and model display on environmental protection activities such as waste reduction , environmental hygiene , healthy living style among students , etc .  
" In the coming rainy seasons , the Observatory will give , to the extent possible , some advance indication of the issuance of warnings and signals so that people will have sufficient time to take precautions against severe weather .  " We have maintained the thrust on development works aimed at improving the forecasting of heavy rains in the coming rainy season , " he said .  
People with existing heart or respiratory illnesses should reduce physical exertion and avoid prolonged stay in polluted areas such as roadside with heavy traffic and surrounded by tall buildings .  
( v ) medium and heavy diesel vehicles : subject to on-going operational trials , we intend to provide free installation of catalytic converters which are capable of reducing up to 50 per cent of the particulate emissions for all pre-Euro standard medium and heavy diesel vehicles ;  
We estimated that the 40,000 medium and heavy diesel vehicles operating in Hong Kong contributed to about 30% of the particulate emissions from the motor vehicle fleet .  The proportion of total particulate emissions which could be attributed to cross boundary vehicles would , therefore , be about 10% ( 30% x 12,000 / 40,000 ) .  
Chairman of TAC , Dr Cheng Hon-Kwan , said : " The package of proposals including the re-arrangement of the existing seven types of private driving instructors into three groups ( Group 1 : private cars and light goods vehicles ; Group 2 : buses and public light buses ; and Group 3 : articulated vehicles , heavy goods vehicles and medium goods vehicles ) were widely supported by the trade .  
He pointed out that since the 1980s , the HKO had been using solar energy to power remote automatic weather stations which helped to give early warnings on impending weather such as tropical cyclones , heavy rain , high wind and cold fronts .  
It has been reported that the tests conducted by the California Department of Health Services of the United States ( " US " ) on the composition of Chinese patent medicines sold there have found in some of the samples the presence of heavy metals exceeding the relevant standards or of western pharmaceutical ingredients .  
Contrary to what some have alleged , there has been no unfair targetting of certain demonstrators by the police ; there has been no arbitrary or improper use of the discretion to prosecute ; no heavy penalties have been imposed on demonstrators ; and there is no evidence whatsoever that the current law unfairly restricts the right to peaceful assembly .  
However , based on intelligence , experience and alertness of the force , when suspicious consignments were found aboard cross-boundary lorries , the officers would check them thoroughly , sometimes even have to dig into the inner compartment by unloading the cargoes onto the examination compound , " she added .  Despite the heavy workload and unfavourable weather conditions , the working spirit of the task force has been regularly sharpened by the good progress of cases or hefty court punishments .  
Looking ahead , we will concentrate in the new financial year on implementing a programme to provide financial assistance for retrofitting 50,000 pre-Euro heavy diesel vehicles with suitable catalytic converters , mapping out a way forward for replacing diesel light buses with alternative fuel models and drawing up codes of practice in conjunction with the relevant parties on controlling idling engines .  
Yet the market lost momentum soon after , along with the slides in the US and Tokyo stock markets , the heavy plunge in telecom and technology shares worldwide , and also the setback in financial shares .  The Hang Seng Index fell back to a 17-month low of 12 583 on 23 March , before recovering slightly to stand at 12 761 at end-March 2001 , 15% lower than at end-2000 .  
( b ) Computer wastes from commercial and industrial sources normally come in larger quantities .  They have to be collected by licensed collectors as required by the Waste Disposal Ordinance to ensure that the heavy metals contained therein will not pollute the environment during transportation .  
With an active trough of low pressure lingering over the vicinity of the south China coast for about two thirds of the month , the weather of June was marked by persistent heavy rain and thunderstorms .  The monthly rainfall amounted to 1083.6 millimetres , about three times the normal figure .  
( b ) whether it will take other water quality indicators ( including the level of harmful pollutants such as heavy metal , etc . ) into consideration before deciding whether the Harbour is suitable for holding the cross-harbour swimming race ?  
" Fuji Musume " , accompanied by traditional Japanese live music in the magnificent set , is lively , colourful , filled with subtle movements and dozed with heavy fantasy .  
" We still can not rule out the possibility of sporadic cases of dengue fever even during the cooler seasons , as mosquitoes can breed and grow if the weather is mild and wet , " he said , adding that heavy rainfalls were recorded last week , which provided a favourable environment for mosquito breeding .  
While movements in the US stock market continued to exert a heavy influence on the local stock market , the lacklustre corporate performance and uncertain business outlook also posed a drag .  
In regard to capital expenditure , we need to set aside about $ 0.3 billion for the installation of particulate reduction devices on pre-Euro heavy diesel vehicles , and for the provision of a one-off grant to encourage early replacement of diesel public light buses with liquefied petroleum gas ( LPG ) or electric ones to further improve roadside air quality .  
We will introduce legislative amendments in the middle of this year to require installation of particulate traps and catalytic converters on all pre-Euro light diesel vehicles .  The same statutory requirements will be imposed on all pre-Euro heavy diesel vehicles upon completion of the current programme to provide financial assistance for retrofitting of catalytic converters next year .  
" In view of the heavy demand for temporary accommodation among health care staff due to various reasons , the Government has been working hard to identify suitable buildings and fitting them with basic facilities to enable our exhausted health care staff to have a decent place , as an alternative to their home , to take a well-earned rest between shifts and after duty .  
The chemically enhanced primary treatment ( CEPT ) process at Stonecutters Island removes substantial quantities of pollutants from the incoming sewage , notably about 80% of suspended solids , 70% of biochemical oxygen demand , 30% of total nitrogen , 40% of phosphorus , 60% of heavy metals and 50% of sewage indicator bacteria .  
The wide and fertile western plain , with its dense population , heavy concentration of industry and convenient communications , has been developed rapidly in the past 30 years . Facing the Pacific Ocean on one side and backed by steep mountain ranges on the other , the East coast is isolated , sparsely populated and has little industry . This slow progress has been due to a large extent to the lack of a direct , rapid and reliable communications link .  
In the past , surface communications between northern and eastern Taiwan were more or less limited to the Suao-Hualien Highway , a one-way road traversing rugged mountains which is both dangerous and easily disrupted by landslides during typhoons or other periods of heavy rain .  
Though progress has been made in heavy industry , and nuclear weapons have been produced , India 's grassroots social construction work lags far behind . Most of the people are poverty-stricken , and disparity in the distribution of wealth between rich and poor is tremendous . When floods and droughts occur , many die of hunger . " What uses are such highly educated people to their country if they live in exile ? "  
In the reeducation camp , Tang was chained hand and foot and forced to do heavy and demeaning work such as carting stones and spreading manure . Most of Tang 's colleagues , undernourished , overworked and lacking his physical stamina and determination , eventually succumbed . Tang 's will to live and to drive out China 's enemies gave him the strength he needed .  
By chemical injections into the roots , combined with periodic drainage of underground water during the heavy rain season , many of the trees have recovered their previous vitality . Matou pomelos , approximately palm sized , are round and plump at the base and pointed towards the top .  
The Republic of China has already passed the stage where its comparative advantage lies in a cheap labor supply , " says Wu Hui-lin of the Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research . " We 've moved into a period where technologically advanced and capital-intensive industries are more important . For mainland China in the short term to compete with us in the area of heavy industry would just be matching their weak point against our strongest . "  
Moreover , the heavy rains and intense heat of tropical areas rob the soil of its nutrients , and crop blight is always a worry . Vegetables thus made a logical choice , with tomatoes , Chinese cabbage , sweet potatoes , soybeans , and green lentils being the primary crops .  
What makes scientists even more worried is that acid rain can dissolve heavy metals , many of which are present in soil . Where for example aluminum is a major component of the soil , if the aluminum is dissolved it raises the concentration of heavy metal in the soil and will harm the root systems of plants . When it reaches a lake , the dissolved aluminum will turn into a granular colloid which damages the breathing systems of fish .  
Explaining the reasons underlying soil acidification , Chang Hsueh-k'un , director of the Taoyuan Agricultural Improvement Farm , points out that in addition to factors such as the relatively high acidity of northern Taiwan 's red soil , the loss of alkaline cations from the soil through heavy rainfall and the heavy use of chemical fertilizers by Taiwan farmers , " sulphurous discharges released by Taiwan 's petrochemical plants are another reason why the soil is turning acidic . "  
From the anxious youth of Lou Ti , to the love of home and country of the overseas student of Women ti Ke , the broken dream of returning home in Fei-ts'ui Chieh-chih , up to the coming together of China and the West in the period of the Boxer Rebellion , Chao Shu-hsia has written down the heavy burden of her own heart while also speaking out about the sorrow and suffering of the overseas Chinese .  
My foreigner friends were warmhearted and dear , but for someone like myself , with an especially heavy China complex , who feels down in the dumps after not chatting in Chinese or not seeing another person with black hair and tawny skin for too long , things could get pretty lonesome , and my longing for home and country would often flood over me in waves and drown me .  
The Kumon Cultural and Educational Foundation once looked into a true case like this : a child that was bright enough to begin was admitted to a class for gifted students through intensive cramming but found he could n't keep up and had to transfer out . His classmates made fun of him and called him " a phony who was kicked out of the brainy kids ' class " - - a heavy trial for a child at his tender age . "  
Yang Ming-chao says , " Our environment is getting worse day by day . The river water and soil are enduring heavy pollution . The standard of living is low , and we are cut off from the outside . Our public works are backward , and no one is willing to come and invest .  
At a time of limitless expectations about a prosperous future , we have no way to avoid the heavy costs of technology : environmental pollution , the rapid depletion of natural resources , and even human vulgarity .  
The natural distribution of heavy metals has been disturbed and they have been dispersed from their originally secure ecological position . In the course of life and industrial production people lack any real sense of alarm about all this . With the failure to take precautions the situation has gradually become harder to contain .  
However , ailments such as cadmium , lead and mercury induced damage to the central nervous system , sterility and deformities , impairment of the immune system , damage to the respiratory system , liver poisoning and irreversible chronic poisoning are all on the rise . In relation to the chemical substances that are increasingly coming to permeate our daily lives , people are gradually coming to realize the risks they face from heavy metals .  
Although many environmental scholars believe that there is also a problem of organic pollution , the scholarly community still lacks indepth under-standing in this area . In any case , organic waste is highly mobile ; Taiwan also has strong winds and heavy rains , " and has the good fortune to be surrounded by sea on all sides , so just two or three storms and most of it gets washed away , " is how one scholar describes it .  
But heavy metals are inorganic materials , different from organic materials which can link up with carbon molecules . They are processed out of ores and originally have the special characteristic of close binding with the soil . They lack the mobility of organic matter and can stay in one place for hundreds or thousands of years . And the microbes in the soil which can dismember virtually anything are useless against them .  
Mr . Bigs should clean up their heavy metal : Faced with the red , blue , green , and other variously colored liquid pollutants generated by the electroplating industry , the industrial community ten years ago thought to follow the example of Japan and establish a special electroplating industrial zone to concentrate the scattered factories in one place and treat the waste water collectively .  
Due to the close relationship between heavy metals and the soil , along with the extremely complex composition of soil , it is much harder to get rid of this kind of pollution than it is when dealing with water and air . More time is required and the technology in this field is not as mature as it is with other industrial environmental techniques . So if you want to improve the problem of soil pollution , the costs are exorbitant .  
If earthworms could be raised in polluted soil , and then after a time moved out , even if the total amount of heavy metals in the environment was not changed , the land could be improved in this way , and the speed at which heavy metals are " passed on ' ' could be increased , thus lowering the recuperation time for the land .  
Because puppets are heavy and hard to manipulate , and the minute and complicated Peikuan rhythmic shifts of the accompanying music are difficult to sing , puppetry is the only traditional performance art whose study can not be promoted in elementary schools .  
As for outsider divers , Mr . Chen has " some thing I 'd like to say " : " They go down to the bottom wearing heavy gear , but do n't understand the nature of the water ; when they 're hit by a sudden current and ca n't get their footing , they end up carelessly grabbing and breaking off and stepping all over and destroying the coral . " But it 's the local fishermen who get stuck with the reputation for destroying the ecology .  
The tropical climate of heavy rains and high temperatures typical of the Indochina Peninsula is a natural hothouse for banana growing . Vietnam 's land , ten times larger than Taiwan 's , provides broad spaces to roam , and Pan Viet chairman C . F . Chang moved quickly to seize the investment opportunity .  
Toxological studies have shown that heavy metal poisoning damages every system of the body . Inacute poisoning , ingested heavy metals cause clear damage to the digestive system , producing nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , colic or melanosis . Inhaled in the lungs , they can cause necrotic bronchitis , tuberculosis or pneumoatothorax . In chronic poisoning , the central nervous system and the hematopoietic system are especially sensitive .  
The concept of fetal toxicosis originated in the ancients ' misunderstanding of rashes and communicable diseases . Red lead and cinnabarre still sometimes misused in Chinese medicine today , in spite of scientific evidence , resulting in heavy metal poisoning . I hope that agencies in charge of public health will extend regulation to Chinese medicine .  
After being pulled from the oil , it is golden in color , crispy on the outside and tender inside . Its special flavor is matched with heavy flavorings like hot sauce , garlic , and vinegar . Or you can add some pickled vegetables .  
But electroplating first requires that rust and impurities on the metal be washed away using nitric acid or other solvents . The electroplating process itself requires use of liquid which includes an incredibly toxic ingredient . Waste water includes poisonous heavy metal ions of nickel , zinc , and copper .  
Many practical difficulties : If children are required to study additional subject matter which is not related to future examinations , then implementing local vernacular instruction in a situation where schoolchildren are already under heavy academic pressure is bound to provoke a reaction from many sides , including the children 's parents , the pupils themselves , the schools and certain sections of society .  
Because he had chosen ophthalmology he took up a highly self-disciplined lifestyle He forced himself to strictly abstain from smoking and drinking , avoid anger , lead a settled , regular life , maintain a placid frame of mind , and not even to pick up heavy objects , so as to avoid any physical or mental imbalance which might make his hands unsteady and thereby affect the quality of his treatment of people 's eyes .  
Thirty years ago , Wu Sung-he 's father had injured his spine through heavy labor , and over the years his condition gradually grew worse , to the point where even the tissues around his spine were swollen with pus . Seeing that his condition was critical , the impoverished Wu family were at their wit 's end until at a friend 's suggestion they used a wooden handcart to bring the patient to Dr . Chen 's clinic in Luotung .  
Just take a walk through the village , and you 'll see a couple of stone slabs on the side of this family 's garden ; that family over there has a stone wheel tied by wire to its roof to keep it from blowing off in a heavy wind ; still another family has a stone wheel on its chicken coop . You ca n't help but get the feeling that these priceless artifacts are n't being fully appreciated . My younger cousins of the Huakangshan Culturelived on the northeast coast , giving them certain geographical advantages .  
A heavy load of paper work , mostly administrative in nature , stirred in him strong feelings of nostalgia for the simple life he led as a straight weather forecaster . Hence , when a television station invited him to serve primarily as a weather forecaster , this tallied with his special interests , and after only a moment 's reflection he agreed .  
For example , on occasion the Central Weather Bureau will make a special broadcast warning of impending heavy downpours of rain , but on the succeeding day , everybody will enjoy perfect sunshine . He will still have to be brazen-faced , go up to the counter and explain : " Because of a sudden increase in the high atmospheric pressure over the Pacific Ocean , the heavy downfall of rain was prevented from coming down . "  
Looking in turn at the three major forms of enterprises in the mainland today , state-run enterprises still labor under a heavy burden of weak incentives created by the " iron rice bowl " ; private enterprises are still in their infancy ; and township collective enterprises , which stand between these first two types in terms of scale , are mainly rural , and still lack the capital , information , and trained personnel to pose a direct challenge to Taiwan firms .  
" The ' huachung ' [ or central Chinese climate ] zone of mainland China and the ' huanan ' [ or southern Chinese climate ] zone divide just about at the Ta-an River . To the north , where the rains are heavy , the settlers built wooden structures offering strong protection against the rain . It 's drier to the south , so there they built cool and shady bamboo structures . " And the abundance of rocks strewn on the bed of the Ta-an River led to their use in the embankments between rice paddies .  
In our report this month , you can read how these budding reporters were selected , how they have received intellectual stimulation and professional training , how through constant self-examination they have found their way from their initial bewilderment to an objective and fair perspective , and how afterjust three short months they should be able to bear the heavy responsibility of going out with cameras on their shoulders and microphones in their hands .  
Although he knows that this spot is a favorite haunt of tawny fish owls , this trip into the mountains ends no differently for Sun Yuan-hsun than most of his other forays since returning to Taiwan . After a heavy tropical rainstorm the streams have risen , and in the valleys we hear nothing but the sound of rushing water , and see only the distant mountains shrouded in mist ; there is no sign of the tawny fish owl .  
Though the palace stands tall in a central position in downtown Taipei with countless people and vehicles streaming along the wide roads on all sides , the heavy guard of military police all around it has long made it an unapproachable , sternly mysterious forbidden territory in the eyes of the public .  
Tall and slender " Little Cutey " came onto the stage , a heavy cloak draped over her shoulders . Her body wriggled in serpentine motions . Every once in a while , she would unlatch her buttons and , walking toward the east end of the stage , flash open her cloak . Then she would walk toward the west end and flash her cloak open again .  
Previously salmon had taken advantage of different types of topography to adapt to natural disasters . Today there are no pools for them to escape to , and when heavy rains come the fish are washed downstream . No fish , no matter how strong , can overcome the meters-high dams to get back upstream , so they are left to die from the higher water temperatures downstream .  
But a heavy , dense oil painting is not suited to be rolled up in a scroll . To address this problem , Wang Yue-chih thinned his paint , abandoning the layered brush strokes of normal oil painting in favor of a flat application of color . This painting , completed sixty years ago , is ahead of its time in its pronounced Chinese character .  
Easier said than done . Unfortunately , she also had to consider the fact that her women readers have become accustomed to a soft style of reporting that " does n't pose brain-bending problems . " She worried that readers would n't be able to digest a heavy dose of economic and fiscal issues added in to the discussion of family matters , and that sales would fall . In the end she decided not to take the risk of changing the format .  
Kong recalls that life in the mainland was already burdened with more than enough heavy symbolism . " Under that kind of stress , people lost sight of and then completely forgot many ordinary feelings - - things like appreciating nature , missing one 's home , treasuring one 's family and friends , experiencing the change of seasons , and coming to some understanding of life just by living it , not to mention something as forbidden as love between the sexes . "  
We are surrounded by good things to eat in our prosperous society , and the need to carry heavy things , walk long distances , or perform manual labor is greatly reduced . Our bodies take in more energy than they expend , and while the food is easy to eat , it 's hard to get rid of . So it 's difficult to avoid accumulating fat .  
Huang Sheng-yuan had thought that his own main ideas for the design , such as the many semi-outdoor areas around the house for people to linger or chat , the sloping roofs , the use of the terrazzo-type floors distinctive of the Lanyang area , and the features drawn from traditional building experience such as the heavy wooden protective boards on the eaves and the typhoon shutters on the Windows , would fit in well with e family 's wishes .  
" As our society becomes more open , people are less bothered about other people 's reproductive and marital choices , " says Chen Hsin-mu , but coercive structural forces in society are more powerful : " The cost in money and time of raising and educating a family is so heavy that it reduces the scope for flexibility in family size . Thus just as in mainland China , there is no scope for having extra children . "  
Given the current intense anti-drug efforts and heavy sentences , it is difficult to move drugs within Taiwan , and the price of heroin has increased as supply has been unable to keep up with demand . Depending upon how much major suppliers have in stock , one kilo can be sold for NT $ 15 million .  
" Actually , calligraphy is a kind of exercise that fluctuates between fast and slow , relaxed and tense , light and heavy , lifting and pressing . When you wield the brush , you must direct your qi to have a good effect .  
Of Mr . Shih 's six years of employment , he spent the first three doing clerical work in the inspection department of a pharmaceuticals manufacturer . After seeing an ad in the paper in which an advertising company was looking for a legal assistant , he rushed to apply . In the company , he wrote letters demanding loan repayment and drafted complaints to be used in lawsuits . The job was extremely interesting to him , but , unfortunately , " the boss was too demanding and the workload was too heavy . "  
Former EPA director Jaw Shau-kong recently drew up a list of " seven major problems " behind the Shihmen Reservoir 's poor water quality and heavy silting . But only one-the adverse natural geology-is a " congenital defect . " The rest are all " acquired dysfunctions . "  
But the charms of the traditional fishing industry are being threatened . Factories on the land emit poisonous waste , deforming the spines of the fish that swim at the mouth of the river . Liao has witnessed large-scale drift nets thrown by large fishing vessels catching all fish large and small . The heavy iron chains of the drift net destroy the sea bed , and it will take the sea bed , which nourishes the sea , decades to heal its wound .  
Along with the evolution of time , the untoward condition of indigenous society has made many of these " facial tattoo treasures " lose the shelter of their younger relatives , due to alcoholism and other problems . Among the medical records of the tattooed old folks of Tai-an Rural Township , quite a few have an impoverished family and live long-term in unhygienic environments . A couple even live alone . Although most of them are taken care of by their relatives , chronic diseases of old age constitute a heavy burden on their children .  
Shih Yun-chung carefully tells of his ancestor 's merit , while pointing out the ornamental courtly insignia depicted in fine and colorful detail on the painting ; the long fingernails , demonstrating that this was a person who did n't need to do any heavy manual labor ; and the gold flake decoration which is seen on many parts of the picture , are all details which combine to proclaim the awesome glory of the Shih family 's power in former days .  
Just as botanists describe , on the most inhospitable mountaintops , amid powerful winds , biting frosts and heavy snow , on dry , infertile soil where conditions are too harsh even for the Formosan cypress and Hinoki cypress which otherwise grow to such huge size , Taiwan 's Yu-shan rhododendron ( R . pseudochrys-anthum ) shrugs off the unrelenting onslaught of the elements and grows in thick clumps everywhere , changing the color of the mountain forests and grassland .  
Kuo , who has designed many of the trails in the Taipei vicinity , emphasizes that Taiwan is very special . It is at the juncture of tropical and sub-tropical climatic regions , with high temperatures and heavy rains year round . Moreover , given its mountainous terrain , all the forest forms of the northern hemisphere are here , layered one on top of the other .  
Because Kaohsiung harbor has a huge capacity , and is a pivotal spot for routes to southeast Asia , in the Japanese occupation era the authorities made it a concentration point for heavy industry and petroleum refining . After the outbreak of the war in the Pacific , Japan used Kaohsiung as a base for advancing southward , and established many military facilities there .  
What 's really depressing about this highway is the desolate vista presented by the heavy industry lining both sides . Whatever kind of grey and ugly industrial form you can think of-concrete factories , petroleum refineries , rusting old oil drums , discarded tire dumps , corrugated-steel structures put up without regard to building codes , construction machinery parks , steel smelters , chemical companies , oil pipeline , huge storage towers-they are all here . There 's only one thing you ca n't find , in fact : a tall green tree .  
Old hunting grounds have been claimed by the state , with every tree and blade of grass strictly protected . With heavy punishments imposed from above , and the attraction of external economic opportunities , the social status of hunters has dropped precipitously , from an honored class to a virtually criminal class .  
Liu Ming-lung , secretary-general of the Environmental Quality Education Foundation , notes that wet paddy field has a number of useful environmental functions , including stabilizing flow volume in rivers , absorbing excess in times of heavy rains and floods , improving water quality , reducing soil erosion , and improving air quality .  
Among the heavy responsibilities weighing on the superintendent 's shoulders , besides having to find financial donations , is that of finding people . Recruiting local doctors has proved difficult-several times when the hospital advertised for staff there were very few applicants , and some doctors who did agree to come and work subsequently changed their minds when another opportunity came up . The disappointed Huang Sheng-hsiung saw no choice but to cast his net wider , and try to recruit doctors from America .  
ATM leader Shen explains that some of the land in the reclamation area is of poor quality . The soil is very rocky , making planting of paddy rice difficult , so the land must be cleared to a depth of at least 20 centimeters . Though large stones can be dug up with heavy machinery , small stones have to be removed by hand as they are uncovered during plowing .  
According to ROC law , when a ship takes a foreign registry , when its catch is sent back to Taiwan , it is treated as imported , and customs taxes must be paid . This is a heavy burden . Moreover , to prevent the industry growing excessively and exhausting resources , the government gives only a limited number of licenses . Ships may be scrapped and replaced , but no new ones may be added .  
The outer wall and major buildings of the compound are built of blocks of rough-hewn stone in irregular sizes , laid with a mortar mixed from malt sugar , glutinous rice flour and lime , and topped with roofs of heavy , stable red tiles .  
In the creation story of Pangu , which deeply influenced the early Chinese , the universe is egg-shaped , and as Pangu incubates within it for 18,000 years , the light , transparent material floats slowly upwards to form the heavens , while the heavy , opaque material sinks downwards to become the earth . By this slow process , heaven and earth are born . Whether Pangu finally died or-as another version has it-just fell asleep , there was no other universe outside his .  
Taiwan 's " plum rains " were particularly heavy this year . The storms brought by the stationary front that creates the plum rains in June quickly raised water levels in the island 's reservoirs to dangerous levels . In the center and south of the island , from the mountains to the coastal plains , there were almost daily reports of flooding and landslides .  
On a platform marked " northern lions " stands a stocky , powerful lion with well-defined bones and muscles and the heavy brows and large eyes of a true-grit son of North China . His angry gaze is reminiscent of the many stone lions which crouch along both sides of Marco Polo Bridge , where they witnessed the blood and tears of China 's eight-year war with Japan .  
Unlike the heavy northern lions , the " southern lions " which dominate another corner sport relaxed grins . The typical southern lion has a twisting head and wagging tail , flowing lines , and a happy smile which seems to say that over the thousands of years of Chinese history it has seen much joy and many rich harvests .  
Taiwan 's estuarine shellfish live on plankton and organic matter , and heavy metals accumulate in their bodies ; the fleshy parts such as the foot and adductor muscle can still be eaten , but the central viscera are best left alone . " Even the ' best ' seafood today is n't fit to eat , " writes Lin Ming-yu , a reporter with the Min Sheng Pao newspaper , lamenting the difficulty of finding good seafood in Taiwan .  
" During the retreat the Volunteers carried heavy loads of provisions . The route was lined with exhausted troops who were falling behind , staggering on their feet , looking wrecked , suffering from dysentery , malaria . . . . Some soldiers were so worn out that when they squatted to drink from a mountain stream they could n't get up again .  
Hayashi Eidai says , of the Volunteers : " Do n't be distracted by their seemingly pro-Japanese public appearance , sometimes dressed in Japanese uniforms , with Japanese caps , and singing Japanese army songs . As soon as they had a drink it was not at all unknown for them to start cursing the Japanese for being heartless and immoral , and damning Japanese imperialism . " Clearly , the Volunteers carry heavy psychological baggage from the war .  
Because students in New Zealand do not have such a heavy homework load , she has also rekindled her former interest in music . Before entering medical school she played piano for three years and practiced the violin for four . She now has an appreciation for music and has mastered the basic techniques of playing musical instruments .  
" In the past , the scrap left behind in Wanli had little recycling value , so it was simply burnt , " says Tony Kang , an assistant manager at Taiwan May Chia Metal Company ( TMCM ) . But the mixed electronics wastes such as printed circuit boards which make up the bulk of electrical scrap today contain many valuable heavy metals which can be recovered and sold after intermediate processes such as sorting and smelting .  
Colliding tectonic plates thrust sharp , easily eroded mountains up to high elevations from whence heavy rainfall , landslides , and river action carry the mountains back to sea bit by bit . Taiwan 's 151 rivers , which total nearly 3,000 kilometers in length , are a key part of this " wheel of life . " They have carved out some of the world 's most unique gorges in the east , and in the west have deposited the soil that makes up the most productive and beautiful plains on the island .  
The story of the Sun brothers surviving in the collapsed Tunghsing building in Taipei City thanks to a big old refrigerator was widely reported , but few people are aware that in the stricken areas many of the dead were crushed by falling heavy furniture and electrical appliances , or were trapped by overturned furniture which blocked their escape routes .  
" He had absolutely no idea that his children all had to swallow their own share of hurt and disappointment while growing up , but never complained to him . Now each of them felt afresh the grievances of childhood , and began to strike back , one after another . " Li described the ensuing scenario : " Some wheeled out their heavy artillery and some used the machine-gun approach . Cannon and gunfire rang out on that cold rainy night , while tears flowed and fireworks exploded .  
This outstanding editor had his own conception of modern Chinese history , and a unique understanding of where to go , who to seek out , what to ask them to write about and how it should be written . No wonder , then , that he never felt able to pass on the heavy burden of editorship , or that right up until he finally succumbed to his illness he was still reviewing articles , and left behind enough publication-ready material to fill several issues .  
Since Chen Shui-bian assumed the presidency , however , the new administration has been concerned that a sudden termination of the nuclear plant might hamper economic development and strike a heavy blow to the business community . The administration accordingly instructed the Ministry of Economic Affairs ( MOEA ) to set up the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant Re-Evaluation Committee to weigh the relative merits of building versus scrapping the plant .  
In Christian culture the mother is a sacred figure , symbolizing purity , charity , and tolerance . In traditional Chinese culture , by contrast , mothers not only were supposed to have certain moral virtues , but were also bearers of heavy burdens of pain and suffering . A mother was fated to cry endless tears and submit to countless indignities .  
When the Dutch took over Tainan , they encouraged the cultivation and export of cane sugar , a crop that grew exceptionally well on the Chianan Plain stretching out from Tainan in almost every direction . On the strength of this economic base , Tainan naturally became the political center of Taiwan . Although southern Taiwan is dominated today by Kaohsiung , back then the latter was just one of Tainan 's satellite ports , with development limited by heavy silting and shallow berths .  
Later , because strong winds and heavy seas made landing impossible , the camera team 's plans were delayed . The next time they were able to land on the islet where the birds were filmed , the Chinese crested terns had already moved on , so the team missed the opportunity to observe them more closely .  
The jian also contributed to a dashing appearance . In the view of Professor Chen Pingyuan of Peking University 's Chinese literature department , " Bearing a jian makes one handsome and dignified ; it confers a heroic air .

But only Lo Liu-chih knows that at little more than arm 's length , the tangled vegetation hides many nests laboriously built by a bird found only in Taiwan .  
Taiwan farmers found it increasingly difficult to compete against mainland China pork on the Japanese market .

" The growth of the false cypress forests represents a process of stabilization of the rolling mountain rivers . The false cypress trees are the living deities of the process of natural restoration of the land , " writes Chen Yu-feng in his book The Flora of Taiwan . In particular , the medium-elevation cloud forests are unstable zones of heavy rainfall and powerful erosion , and when mighty false cypress trees spring up along the lines of collapse they mend the gashes in the forest and bring new life to the broken ground .  
The false cypress forests which bear the heavy responsibility of stabilizing Taiwan 's fragmented earth , also form a safety valve for the Shihmen Reservoir , Tanshui River and Lanyang River on which the people of northern Taiwan depend for their drinking water . The band of cypress forest that runs from Mt . Chilan to Mt . Lala forms a huge natural reservoir that soaks up heavy rainfall and releases it in gentler flows while keeping the soil firmly in its grasp , in a way that no human engineering project could replicate .  
The dialogue in Hero was superficial and too modern sounding , and the film laid greater emphasis on form than the actual storyline .

The Daoist priest Li Chi-chang used white rice to form a dragon on the mat , with eggs as its eyes , two large bowls as its mouth and nose , rolled-up paper spirit money as its ears and horns , and sticks of fragrant wood as its whiskers . What 's more , the Paoan Temple especially forged 108 heavy gold coins to be the scales of the dragon .

Chen Chung believes that the small cultivated plots of traditional farming make it difficult to use efficient , labor-saving technologies and thus hinder competitiveness in international markets . The usual remedy for this has been even further exploitation of the land , and as Chen Chung points out with a pained expression , " the result was heavy use of pesticides and fertilizers , increased soil depletion , and environmental pollution . "

Wu Bangguo said : As a traditional industry , the coal industry has to shoulder a heavy historical burden .  In the current process , in which great changes have taken place in market supply and demand and the old economic system is being changed into the new , it is difficult for coal enterprises themselves to completely overcome difficulties they have encountered .  The government must make efforts to create an essential external environment and conditions in all aspects and give them specific support and assistance .  
and for servicemen who have served in areas known for harsh conditions or in some special posts .  As for economically underdeveloped areas faced with a heavy or difficult settlement task , the people 's governments at the provincial level may extend to a certain extent the scope of relocated settlement after taking all factors into account .  
In another development , the Chinese put on display for the first time an advanced guided missile whose name remains unknown .  Though it was only a model and was attached to the model of the Qianhong 7 aircraft ( namely , the Flying Leopard heavy bomber especially manufactured for its naval air force ) , it has attracted the attention of foreign military experts .  A US military expert who is taking part in the show , believes that is a new supersonic antiradar , antiship guided missile recently developed by the CPC military .  
Leading enterprises are shouldered with the heavy responsibility of bringing along the growth of peasant households , exploring new markets , making scientific and technological innovations , and boosting the development of the regional economy .  The success or failure of leading enterprises has a direct bearing on our work to improve the economic efficiency of agriculture , to increase the income of our peasants , and to maintain the stability of rural areas .  
The circular called for placing the focus of safety production work on coalmines ( with chief emphasis on preventing gas and coal dust explosions ) , on the transport of fireworks and firecrackers , toxic and inflammable products , on public entertainment districts , on civil aviation , on railway , on waterways , and on highway transport .  As the 2001 New Year and the Spring Festival holidays are spaced close within each other , the spring transport task will be very arduous and passenger flow will be very heavy .  
Charged with a heavy task , the women 's federations or their organizations at all levels should give full scope to the unique superiority of the broad masses of women and families in resisting an evil cult ; should help " Falungong " practitioners free themselves from the spiritual control of the evil cult ideologically , organizationally , and once and for all ; and should help them keep abreast with the pace of the times by enjoying to the full a warm or progressive life brought by science and civilization as well .  
In addition , the government has imposed mandatory reductions on some industries with excess production capacity ( such as the textiles , iron and steel , and coal-mining industries ) and limited their output .  Enterprises that used backward technology or caused heavy pollution were ordered to close .  In response to market competition , moreover , some enterprises have closed their doors , gone out of business , suspended operations , or scaled back production .  
In his letter , Wu Bangguo said : Beginning from 2001 , the Three Gorges Project will enter the most arduous construction period .  The concrete pouring work will be more difficult than before .  In addition , the work of installing heavy metal components as well as mechanical and electronic equipment will enter a peak period .  
The direct cause of the inability to reduce farmers ' burden is that township financial budgets have to support too great a population , have to meet goals and upgrade in various activities , and complete " cosmetic projects " which can not be halted despite repeated attempts to do so .  This leaves townships with weak financial budgets and a heavy debt load .  
After listening to what others said , Jiang Zemin pointed out that since the beginning of the new century , profound changes have been taking place in the international situation , and the domestic tasks in reform and construction are also quite heavy and formidable .  He said that we have rare opportunities and favorable conditions for speeding up development , but we also face new situations , new contradictions , and new difficulties , and we may encounter all kinds of risks as we move ahead .  
enhance the overall quality and competitiveness of industry ; speed up the development of such pillar industries as electronics and information , hydropower , machinery and metallurgy , medicine and chemical industry , and beverages and foodstuffs ; and strive to build up eight major industrial bases for electronics and information , hydropower , heavy machinery and equipment , special steel products , new vanadium-titanium materials , modern Chinese medicine , natural gas and chemical industry , and beverages and foodstuffs .  
Article 14 .  If a Sino-foreign joint venture incurs heavy losses , a partner fails to fulfill its obligations specified in relevant contracts and regulations , or irresistible incidents took place , with the agreement of all partners of the joint venture , their contracts may be terminated after it is approved by the examination and approving organ in charge and after it is registered with a state department in charge of administration of industry and commerce .  
In the new century , international competition will get more and more intense , the reform and construction tasks at home will also be heavy and arduous .  The objective conditions are continuously changing .  If we do not emancipate our minds , do not carry out innovations , then our cause will not be advanced further , and we will not able to meet various challenges .  
New arrangements for the warning of heavy rain , including a revised rainstorm warning system , the termination of the flood warning , and the introduction of special announcements on flooding in the northern New Territories , will be implemented for the coming rain season , the Director of the Hong Kong Observatory , Dr H K Lam , announced today ( Thursday ) .  
A cold front developed to the north of Hong Kong and moved south on May 24 bringing heavy showers and squally thunderstorms to local areas .  
The Principal Environmental Protection Officer , Mr Pang Sik-wing said : " This air pollution level was observed at the Causeway Bay Roadside Air Quality Station , which represents the urban roadside in busy commercial area with very heavy traffic and surrounded by many tall buildings . 
" However , persons with existing heart or respiratory illnesses are advised to avoid prolonged stay in areas with heavy traffic .  If it is necessary to stay in these streets or roads , they are advised to minimise physical exercise , especially energetic or laborious outdoor activities , " Mr Pang said .  
However , persons with existing heart or respiratory illnesses are advised to avoid prolonged stay in areas with heavy traffic .  If it is necessary to stay in these streets or roads , they are advised to minimise physical exercise , especially energetic or laborious outdoor activities , " Mr Tse said .  
High level of nitrogen dioxide continued to be recorded at the Causeway Bay Roadside Air Quality Station , which represented the urban roadside in busy commercial area with very heavy traffic and surrounded by many tall buildings . 
It has enhanced the oxidation of nitric oxide emitted from diesel vehicles into nitrogen dioxide .  It was accumulated in the busy urban roadside with heavy traffic and surrounded by tall buildings .  
" The current pollution level would have little effect on a healthy person .  However , people with existing heart or respiratory illnesses are advised to avoid prolonged stay in areas with heavy traffic .  If it is necessary to stay in these streets or roads , they are advised to minimise physical exercise , especially energetic or laborious outdoor activities , " Mr Pang said .

Very high air pollution level would be localised and confined to busy urban streets with very heavy traffic and surrounded by high-rise buildings .  The general air pollution level would be in the " high " API band , with the forecast API ranging from 60 to 75 .  
The Water Supplies Department ( WSD ) conducts physical , chemical , radiological and bacteriological tests on treated water .  More than 100 tests are carried out , including general tests , tests on heavy metal , organic and inorganic compounds , and those listed under the 1993 Guidelines of the WHO .  
The Department also set up a Healthy Living into the 21st Century exhibition counter at the Victoria Park Fair venue to disseminate environmental protection , hygiene and health related messages with a heavy focus on the activities of the Council in these matters .  The exhibition materials included photographs , video-tapes , and model display on environmental protection activities such as waste reduction , environmental hygiene , healthy living style among students , etc .  
" In the coming rainy seasons , the Observatory will give , to the extent possible , some advance indication of the issuance of warnings and signals so that people will have sufficient time to take precautions against severe weather .  " We have maintained the thrust on development works aimed at improving the forecasting of heavy rains in the coming rainy season , " he said .  
People with existing heart or respiratory illnesses should reduce physical exertion and avoid prolonged stay in polluted areas such as roadside with heavy traffic and surrounded by tall buildings .  
( v ) medium and heavy diesel vehicles : subject to on-going operational trials , we intend to provide free installation of catalytic converters which are capable of reducing up to 50 per cent of the particulate emissions for all pre-Euro standard medium and heavy diesel vehicles ;  
We estimated that the 40,000 medium and heavy diesel vehicles operating in Hong Kong contributed to about 30% of the particulate emissions from the motor vehicle fleet .  The proportion of total particulate emissions which could be attributed to cross boundary vehicles would , therefore , be about 10% ( 30% x 12,000 / 40,000 ) .  
Chairman of TAC , Dr Cheng Hon-Kwan , said : " The package of proposals including the re-arrangement of the existing seven types of private driving instructors into three groups ( Group 1 : private cars and light goods vehicles ; Group 2 : buses and public light buses ; and Group 3 : articulated vehicles , heavy goods vehicles and medium goods vehicles ) were widely supported by the trade .  
He pointed out that since the 1980s , the HKO had been using solar energy to power remote automatic weather stations which helped to give early warnings on impending weather such as tropical cyclones , heavy rain , high wind and cold fronts .  
It has been reported that the tests conducted by the California Department of Health Services of the United States ( " US " ) on the composition of Chinese patent medicines sold there have found in some of the samples the presence of heavy metals exceeding the relevant standards or of western pharmaceutical ingredients .  
Contrary to what some have alleged , there has been no unfair targetting of certain demonstrators by the police ; there has been no arbitrary or improper use of the discretion to prosecute ; no heavy penalties have been imposed on demonstrators ; and there is no evidence whatsoever that the current law unfairly restricts the right to peaceful assembly .  
However , based on intelligence , experience and alertness of the force , when suspicious consignments were found aboard cross-boundary lorries , the officers would check them thoroughly , sometimes even have to dig into the inner compartment by unloading the cargoes onto the examination compound , " she added .  Despite the heavy workload and unfavourable weather conditions , the working spirit of the task force has been regularly sharpened by the good progress of cases or hefty court punishments .  
Looking ahead , we will concentrate in the new financial year on implementing a programme to provide financial assistance for retrofitting 50,000 pre-Euro heavy diesel vehicles with suitable catalytic converters , mapping out a way forward for replacing diesel light buses with alternative fuel models and drawing up codes of practice in conjunction with the relevant parties on controlling idling engines .  
Yet the market lost momentum soon after , along with the slides in the US and Tokyo stock markets , the heavy plunge in telecom and technology shares worldwide , and also the setback in financial shares .  The Hang Seng Index fell back to a 17-month low of 12 583 on 23 March , before recovering slightly to stand at 12 761 at end-March 2001 , 15% lower than at end-2000 .  
( b ) Computer wastes from commercial and industrial sources normally come in larger quantities .  They have to be collected by licensed collectors as required by the Waste Disposal Ordinance to ensure that the heavy metals contained therein will not pollute the environment during transportation .  
With an active trough of low pressure lingering over the vicinity of the south China coast for about two thirds of the month , the weather of June was marked by persistent heavy rain and thunderstorms .  The monthly rainfall amounted to 1083.6 millimetres , about three times the normal figure .  
( b ) whether it will take other water quality indicators ( including the level of harmful pollutants such as heavy metal , etc . ) into consideration before deciding whether the Harbour is suitable for holding the cross-harbour swimming race ?  
" Fuji Musume " , accompanied by traditional Japanese live music in the magnificent set , is lively , colourful , filled with subtle movements and dozed with heavy fantasy .  
" We still can not rule out the possibility of sporadic cases of dengue fever even during the cooler seasons , as mosquitoes can breed and grow if the weather is mild and wet , " he said , adding that heavy rainfalls were recorded last week , which provided a favourable environment for mosquito breeding .  
While movements in the US stock market continued to exert a heavy influence on the local stock market , the lacklustre corporate performance and uncertain business outlook also posed a drag .  
In regard to capital expenditure , we need to set aside about $ 0.3 billion for the installation of particulate reduction devices on pre-Euro heavy diesel vehicles , and for the provision of a one-off grant to encourage early replacement of diesel public light buses with liquefied petroleum gas ( LPG ) or electric ones to further improve roadside air quality .  
We will introduce legislative amendments in the middle of this year to require installation of particulate traps and catalytic converters on all pre-Euro light diesel vehicles .  The same statutory requirements will be imposed on all pre-Euro heavy diesel vehicles upon completion of the current programme to provide financial assistance for retrofitting of catalytic converters next year .  
" In view of the heavy demand for temporary accommodation among health care staff due to various reasons , the Government has been working hard to identify suitable buildings and fitting them with basic facilities to enable our exhausted health care staff to have a decent place , as an alternative to their home , to take a well-earned rest between shifts and after duty .  
The chemically enhanced primary treatment ( CEPT ) process at Stonecutters Island removes substantial quantities of pollutants from the incoming sewage , notably about 80% of suspended solids , 70% of biochemical oxygen demand , 30% of total nitrogen , 40% of phosphorus , 60% of heavy metals and 50% of sewage indicator bacteria .  
The wide and fertile western plain , with its dense population , heavy concentration of industry and convenient communications , has been developed rapidly in the past 30 years . Facing the Pacific Ocean on one side and backed by steep mountain ranges on the other , the East coast is isolated , sparsely populated and has little industry . This slow progress has been due to a large extent to the lack of a direct , rapid and reliable communications link .  
In the past , surface communications between northern and eastern Taiwan were more or less limited to the Suao-Hualien Highway , a one-way road traversing rugged mountains which is both dangerous and easily disrupted by landslides during typhoons or other periods of heavy rain .  
Though progress has been made in heavy industry , and nuclear weapons have been produced , India 's grassroots social construction work lags far behind . Most of the people are poverty-stricken , and disparity in the distribution of wealth between rich and poor is tremendous . When floods and droughts occur , many die of hunger . " What uses are such highly educated people to their country if they live in exile ? "  
In the reeducation camp , Tang was chained hand and foot and forced to do heavy and demeaning work such as carting stones and spreading manure . Most of Tang 's colleagues , undernourished , overworked and lacking his physical stamina and determination , eventually succumbed . Tang 's will to live and to drive out China 's enemies gave him the strength he needed .  
By chemical injections into the roots , combined with periodic drainage of underground water during the heavy rain season , many of the trees have recovered their previous vitality . Matou pomelos , approximately palm sized , are round and plump at the base and pointed towards the top .  
The Republic of China has already passed the stage where its comparative advantage lies in a cheap labor supply , " says Wu Hui-lin of the Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research . " We 've moved into a period where technologically advanced and capital-intensive industries are more important . For mainland China in the short term to compete with us in the area of heavy industry would just be matching their weak point against our strongest . "  
Moreover , the heavy rains and intense heat of tropical areas rob the soil of its nutrients , and crop blight is always a worry . Vegetables thus made a logical choice , with tomatoes , Chinese cabbage , sweet potatoes , soybeans , and green lentils being the primary crops .  
What makes scientists even more worried is that acid rain can dissolve heavy metals , many of which are present in soil . Where for example aluminum is a major component of the soil , if the aluminum is dissolved it raises the concentration of heavy metal in the soil and will harm the root systems of plants . When it reaches a lake , the dissolved aluminum will turn into a granular colloid which damages the breathing systems of fish .  
Explaining the reasons underlying soil acidification , Chang Hsueh-k'un , director of the Taoyuan Agricultural Improvement Farm , points out that in addition to factors such as the relatively high acidity of northern Taiwan 's red soil , the loss of alkaline cations from the soil through heavy rainfall and the heavy use of chemical fertilizers by Taiwan farmers , " sulphurous discharges released by Taiwan 's petrochemical plants are another reason why the soil is turning acidic . "  
From the anxious youth of Lou Ti , to the love of home and country of the overseas student of Women ti Ke , the broken dream of returning home in Fei-ts'ui Chieh-chih , up to the coming together of China and the West in the period of the Boxer Rebellion , Chao Shu-hsia has written down the heavy burden of her own heart while also speaking out about the sorrow and suffering of the overseas Chinese .  
My foreigner friends were warmhearted and dear , but for someone like myself , with an especially heavy China complex , who feels down in the dumps after not chatting in Chinese or not seeing another person with black hair and tawny skin for too long , things could get pretty lonesome , and my longing for home and country would often flood over me in waves and drown me .  
The Kumon Cultural and Educational Foundation once looked into a true case like this : a child that was bright enough to begin was admitted to a class for gifted students through intensive cramming but found he could n't keep up and had to transfer out . His classmates made fun of him and called him " a phony who was kicked out of the brainy kids ' class " - - a heavy trial for a child at his tender age . "  
Yang Ming-chao says , " Our environment is getting worse day by day . The river water and soil are enduring heavy pollution . The standard of living is low , and we are cut off from the outside . Our public works are backward , and no one is willing to come and invest .  
At a time of limitless expectations about a prosperous future , we have no way to avoid the heavy costs of technology : environmental pollution , the rapid depletion of natural resources , and even human vulgarity .  
The natural distribution of heavy metals has been disturbed and they have been dispersed from their originally secure ecological position . In the course of life and industrial production people lack any real sense of alarm about all this . With the failure to take precautions the situation has gradually become harder to contain .  
However , ailments such as cadmium , lead and mercury induced damage to the central nervous system , sterility and deformities , impairment of the immune system , damage to the respiratory system , liver poisoning and irreversible chronic poisoning are all on the rise . In relation to the chemical substances that are increasingly coming to permeate our daily lives , people are gradually coming to realize the risks they face from heavy metals .  
Although many environmental scholars believe that there is also a problem of organic pollution , the scholarly community still lacks indepth under-standing in this area . In any case , organic waste is highly mobile ; Taiwan also has strong winds and heavy rains , " and has the good fortune to be surrounded by sea on all sides , so just two or three storms and most of it gets washed away , " is how one scholar describes it .  
But heavy metals are inorganic materials , different from organic materials which can link up with carbon molecules . They are processed out of ores and originally have the special characteristic of close binding with the soil . They lack the mobility of organic matter and can stay in one place for hundreds or thousands of years . And the microbes in the soil which can dismember virtually anything are useless against them .  
Mr . Bigs should clean up their heavy metal : Faced with the red , blue , green , and other variously colored liquid pollutants generated by the electroplating industry , the industrial community ten years ago thought to follow the example of Japan and establish a special electroplating industrial zone to concentrate the scattered factories in one place and treat the waste water collectively .  
Due to the close relationship between heavy metals and the soil , along with the extremely complex composition of soil , it is much harder to get rid of this kind of pollution than it is when dealing with water and air . More time is required and the technology in this field is not as mature as it is with other industrial environmental techniques . So if you want to improve the problem of soil pollution , the costs are exorbitant .  
If earthworms could be raised in polluted soil , and then after a time moved out , even if the total amount of heavy metals in the environment was not changed , the land could be improved in this way , and the speed at which heavy metals are " passed on ' ' could be increased , thus lowering the recuperation time for the land .  
Because puppets are heavy and hard to manipulate , and the minute and complicated Peikuan rhythmic shifts of the accompanying music are difficult to sing , puppetry is the only traditional performance art whose study can not be promoted in elementary schools .  
As for outsider divers , Mr . Chen has " some thing I 'd like to say " : " They go down to the bottom wearing heavy gear , but do n't understand the nature of the water ; when they 're hit by a sudden current and ca n't get their footing , they end up carelessly grabbing and breaking off and stepping all over and destroying the coral . " But it 's the local fishermen who get stuck with the reputation for destroying the ecology .  
The tropical climate of heavy rains and high temperatures typical of the Indochina Peninsula is a natural hothouse for banana growing . Vietnam 's land , ten times larger than Taiwan 's , provides broad spaces to roam , and Pan Viet chairman C . F . Chang moved quickly to seize the investment opportunity .  
Toxological studies have shown that heavy metal poisoning damages every system of the body . Inacute poisoning , ingested heavy metals cause clear damage to the digestive system , producing nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , colic or melanosis . Inhaled in the lungs , they can cause necrotic bronchitis , tuberculosis or pneumoatothorax . In chronic poisoning , the central nervous system and the hematopoietic system are especially sensitive .  
The concept of fetal toxicosis originated in the ancients ' misunderstanding of rashes and communicable diseases . Red lead and cinnabarre still sometimes misused in Chinese medicine today , in spite of scientific evidence , resulting in heavy metal poisoning . I hope that agencies in charge of public health will extend regulation to Chinese medicine .  
After being pulled from the oil , it is golden in color , crispy on the outside and tender inside . Its special flavor is matched with heavy flavorings like hot sauce , garlic , and vinegar . Or you can add some pickled vegetables .  
But electroplating first requires that rust and impurities on the metal be washed away using nitric acid or other solvents . The electroplating process itself requires use of liquid which includes an incredibly toxic ingredient . Waste water includes poisonous heavy metal ions of nickel , zinc , and copper .  
Many practical difficulties : If children are required to study additional subject matter which is not related to future examinations , then implementing local vernacular instruction in a situation where schoolchildren are already under heavy academic pressure is bound to provoke a reaction from many sides , including the children 's parents , the pupils themselves , the schools and certain sections of society .  
Because he had chosen ophthalmology he took up a highly self-disciplined lifestyle He forced himself to strictly abstain from smoking and drinking , avoid anger , lead a settled , regular life , maintain a placid frame of mind , and not even to pick up heavy objects , so as to avoid any physical or mental imbalance which might make his hands unsteady and thereby affect the quality of his treatment of people 's eyes .  
Thirty years ago , Wu Sung-he 's father had injured his spine through heavy labor , and over the years his condition gradually grew worse , to the point where even the tissues around his spine were swollen with pus . Seeing that his condition was critical , the impoverished Wu family were at their wit 's end until at a friend 's suggestion they used a wooden handcart to bring the patient to Dr . Chen 's clinic in Luotung .  
Just take a walk through the village , and you 'll see a couple of stone slabs on the side of this family 's garden ; that family over there has a stone wheel tied by wire to its roof to keep it from blowing off in a heavy wind ; still another family has a stone wheel on its chicken coop . You ca n't help but get the feeling that these priceless artifacts are n't being fully appreciated . My younger cousins of the Huakangshan Culturelived on the northeast coast , giving them certain geographical advantages .  
A heavy load of paper work , mostly administrative in nature , stirred in him strong feelings of nostalgia for the simple life he led as a straight weather forecaster . Hence , when a television station invited him to serve primarily as a weather forecaster , this tallied with his special interests , and after only a moment 's reflection he agreed .  
For example , on occasion the Central Weather Bureau will make a special broadcast warning of impending heavy downpours of rain , but on the succeeding day , everybody will enjoy perfect sunshine . He will still have to be brazen-faced , go up to the counter and explain : " Because of a sudden increase in the high atmospheric pressure over the Pacific Ocean , the heavy downfall of rain was prevented from coming down . "  
Looking in turn at the three major forms of enterprises in the mainland today , state-run enterprises still labor under a heavy burden of weak incentives created by the " iron rice bowl " ; private enterprises are still in their infancy ; and township collective enterprises , which stand between these first two types in terms of scale , are mainly rural , and still lack the capital , information , and trained personnel to pose a direct challenge to Taiwan firms .  
" The ' huachung ' [ or central Chinese climate ] zone of mainland China and the ' huanan ' [ or southern Chinese climate ] zone divide just about at the Ta-an River . To the north , where the rains are heavy , the settlers built wooden structures offering strong protection against the rain . It 's drier to the south , so there they built cool and shady bamboo structures . " And the abundance of rocks strewn on the bed of the Ta-an River led to their use in the embankments between rice paddies .  
In our report this month , you can read how these budding reporters were selected , how they have received intellectual stimulation and professional training , how through constant self-examination they have found their way from their initial bewilderment to an objective and fair perspective , and how afterjust three short months they should be able to bear the heavy responsibility of going out with cameras on their shoulders and microphones in their hands .  
Although he knows that this spot is a favorite haunt of tawny fish owls , this trip into the mountains ends no differently for Sun Yuan-hsun than most of his other forays since returning to Taiwan . After a heavy tropical rainstorm the streams have risen , and in the valleys we hear nothing but the sound of rushing water , and see only the distant mountains shrouded in mist ; there is no sign of the tawny fish owl .  
Though the palace stands tall in a central position in downtown Taipei with countless people and vehicles streaming along the wide roads on all sides , the heavy guard of military police all around it has long made it an unapproachable , sternly mysterious forbidden territory in the eyes of the public .  
Tall and slender " Little Cutey " came onto the stage , a heavy cloak draped over her shoulders . Her body wriggled in serpentine motions . Every once in a while , she would unlatch her buttons and , walking toward the east end of the stage , flash open her cloak . Then she would walk toward the west end and flash her cloak open again .  
Previously salmon had taken advantage of different types of topography to adapt to natural disasters . Today there are no pools for them to escape to , and when heavy rains come the fish are washed downstream . No fish , no matter how strong , can overcome the meters-high dams to get back upstream , so they are left to die from the higher water temperatures downstream .  
But a heavy , dense oil painting is not suited to be rolled up in a scroll . To address this problem , Wang Yue-chih thinned his paint , abandoning the layered brush strokes of normal oil painting in favor of a flat application of color . This painting , completed sixty years ago , is ahead of its time in its pronounced Chinese character .  
Easier said than done . Unfortunately , she also had to consider the fact that her women readers have become accustomed to a soft style of reporting that " does n't pose brain-bending problems . " She worried that readers would n't be able to digest a heavy dose of economic and fiscal issues added in to the discussion of family matters , and that sales would fall . In the end she decided not to take the risk of changing the format .  
Kong recalls that life in the mainland was already burdened with more than enough heavy symbolism . " Under that kind of stress , people lost sight of and then completely forgot many ordinary feelings - - things like appreciating nature , missing one 's home , treasuring one 's family and friends , experiencing the change of seasons , and coming to some understanding of life just by living it , not to mention something as forbidden as love between the sexes . "  
We are surrounded by good things to eat in our prosperous society , and the need to carry heavy things , walk long distances , or perform manual labor is greatly reduced . Our bodies take in more energy than they expend , and while the food is easy to eat , it 's hard to get rid of . So it 's difficult to avoid accumulating fat .  
Huang Sheng-yuan had thought that his own main ideas for the design , such as the many semi-outdoor areas around the house for people to linger or chat , the sloping roofs , the use of the terrazzo-type floors distinctive of the Lanyang area , and the features drawn from traditional building experience such as the heavy wooden protective boards on the eaves and the typhoon shutters on the Windows , would fit in well with e family 's wishes .  
" As our society becomes more open , people are less bothered about other people 's reproductive and marital choices , " says Chen Hsin-mu , but coercive structural forces in society are more powerful : " The cost in money and time of raising and educating a family is so heavy that it reduces the scope for flexibility in family size . Thus just as in mainland China , there is no scope for having extra children . "  
Given the current intense anti-drug efforts and heavy sentences , it is difficult to move drugs within Taiwan , and the price of heroin has increased as supply has been unable to keep up with demand . Depending upon how much major suppliers have in stock , one kilo can be sold for NT $ 15 million .  
" Actually , calligraphy is a kind of exercise that fluctuates between fast and slow , relaxed and tense , light and heavy , lifting and pressing . When you wield the brush , you must direct your qi to have a good effect .  
Of Mr . Shih 's six years of employment , he spent the first three doing clerical work in the inspection department of a pharmaceuticals manufacturer . After seeing an ad in the paper in which an advertising company was looking for a legal assistant , he rushed to apply . In the company , he wrote letters demanding loan repayment and drafted complaints to be used in lawsuits . The job was extremely interesting to him , but , unfortunately , " the boss was too demanding and the workload was too heavy . "  
Former EPA director Jaw Shau-kong recently drew up a list of " seven major problems " behind the Shihmen Reservoir 's poor water quality and heavy silting . But only one-the adverse natural geology-is a " congenital defect . " The rest are all " acquired dysfunctions . "  
But the charms of the traditional fishing industry are being threatened . Factories on the land emit poisonous waste , deforming the spines of the fish that swim at the mouth of the river . Liao has witnessed large-scale drift nets thrown by large fishing vessels catching all fish large and small . The heavy iron chains of the drift net destroy the sea bed , and it will take the sea bed , which nourishes the sea , decades to heal its wound .  
Along with the evolution of time , the untoward condition of indigenous society has made many of these " facial tattoo treasures " lose the shelter of their younger relatives , due to alcoholism and other problems . Among the medical records of the tattooed old folks of Tai-an Rural Township , quite a few have an impoverished family and live long-term in unhygienic environments . A couple even live alone . Although most of them are taken care of by their relatives , chronic diseases of old age constitute a heavy burden on their children .  
Shih Yun-chung carefully tells of his ancestor 's merit , while pointing out the ornamental courtly insignia depicted in fine and colorful detail on the painting ; the long fingernails , demonstrating that this was a person who did n't need to do any heavy manual labor ; and the gold flake decoration which is seen on many parts of the picture , are all details which combine to proclaim the awesome glory of the Shih family 's power in former days .  
Just as botanists describe , on the most inhospitable mountaintops , amid powerful winds , biting frosts and heavy snow , on dry , infertile soil where conditions are too harsh even for the Formosan cypress and Hinoki cypress which otherwise grow to such huge size , Taiwan 's Yu-shan rhododendron ( R . pseudochrys-anthum ) shrugs off the unrelenting onslaught of the elements and grows in thick clumps everywhere , changing the color of the mountain forests and grassland .  
Kuo , who has designed many of the trails in the Taipei vicinity , emphasizes that Taiwan is very special . It is at the juncture of tropical and sub-tropical climatic regions , with high temperatures and heavy rains year round . Moreover , given its mountainous terrain , all the forest forms of the northern hemisphere are here , layered one on top of the other .  
Because Kaohsiung harbor has a huge capacity , and is a pivotal spot for routes to southeast Asia , in the Japanese occupation era the authorities made it a concentration point for heavy industry and petroleum refining . After the outbreak of the war in the Pacific , Japan used Kaohsiung as a base for advancing southward , and established many military facilities there .  
What 's really depressing about this highway is the desolate vista presented by the heavy industry lining both sides . Whatever kind of grey and ugly industrial form you can think of-concrete factories , petroleum refineries , rusting old oil drums , discarded tire dumps , corrugated-steel structures put up without regard to building codes , construction machinery parks , steel smelters , chemical companies , oil pipeline , huge storage towers-they are all here . There 's only one thing you ca n't find , in fact : a tall green tree .

The disappointed Huang Sheng-hsiung saw no choice but to cast his net wider , and try to recruit doctors from America .  
ATM leader Shen explains that some of the land in the reclamation area is of poor quality .

Ships may be scrapped and replaced , but no new ones may be added .  
The outer wall and major buildings of the compound are built of blocks of rough-hewn stone in irregular sizes , laid with a mortar mixed from malt sugar , glutinous rice flour and lime , and topped with roofs of heavy , stable red tiles .  
In the creation story of Pangu , which deeply influenced the early Chinese , the universe is egg-shaped , and as Pangu incubates within it for 18,000 years , the light , transparent material floats slowly upwards to form the heavens , while the heavy , opaque material sinks downwards to become the earth . By this slow process , heaven and earth are born . Whether Pangu finally died or-as another version has it-just fell asleep , there was no other universe outside his .  
Taiwan 's " plum rains " were particularly heavy this year . The storms brought by the stationary front that creates the plum rains in June quickly raised water levels in the island 's reservoirs to dangerous levels . In the center and south of the island , from the mountains to the coastal plains , there were almost daily reports of flooding and landslides .  
On a platform marked " northern lions " stands a stocky , powerful lion with well-defined bones and muscles and the heavy brows and large eyes of a true-grit son of North China . His angry gaze is reminiscent of the many stone lions which crouch along both sides of Marco Polo Bridge , where they witnessed the blood and tears of China 's eight-year war with Japan .  
Unlike the heavy northern lions , the " southern lions " which dominate another corner sport relaxed grins . The typical southern lion has a twisting head and wagging tail , flowing lines , and a happy smile which seems to say that over the thousands of years of Chinese history it has seen much joy and many rich harvests .  
Taiwan 's estuarine shellfish live on plankton and organic matter , and heavy metals accumulate in their bodies ; the fleshy parts such as the foot and adductor muscle can still be eaten , but the central viscera are best left alone . " Even the ' best ' seafood today is n't fit to eat , " writes Lin Ming-yu , a reporter with the Min Sheng Pao newspaper , lamenting the difficulty of finding good seafood in Taiwan .  
" During the retreat the Volunteers carried heavy loads of provisions .

Hayashi Eidai says , of the Volunteers : " Do n't be distracted by their seemingly pro-Japanese public appearance , sometimes dressed in Japanese uniforms , with Japanese caps , and singing Japanese army songs .

" In the past , the scrap left behind in Wanli had little recycling value , so it was simply burnt , " says Tony Kang , an assistant manager at Taiwan May Chia Metal Company ( TMCM ) . But the mixed electronics wastes such as printed circuit boards which make up the bulk of electrical scrap today contain many valuable heavy metals which can be recovered and sold after intermediate processes such as sorting and smelting .  
Colliding tectonic plates thrust sharp , easily eroded mountains up to high elevations from whence heavy rainfall , landslides , and river action carry the mountains back to sea bit by bit . Taiwan 's 151 rivers , which total nearly 3,000 kilometers in length , are a key part of this " wheel of life . " They have carved out some of the world 's most unique gorges in the east , and in the west have deposited the soil that makes up the most productive and beautiful plains on the island .  
The story of the Sun brothers surviving in the collapsed Tunghsing building in Taipei City thanks to a big old refrigerator was widely reported , but few people are aware that in the stricken areas many of the dead were crushed by falling heavy furniture and electrical appliances , or were trapped by overturned furniture which blocked their escape routes .

Cannon and gunfire rang out on that cold rainy night , while tears flowed and fireworks exploded .  
This outstanding editor had his own conception of modern Chinese history , and a unique understanding of where to go , who to seek out , what to ask them to write about and how it should be written .

When the Dutch took over Tainan , they encouraged the cultivation and export of cane sugar , a crop that grew exceptionally well on the Chianan Plain stretching out from Tainan in almost every direction .

Later , because strong winds and heavy seas made landing impossible , the camera team 's plans were delayed . The next time they were able to land on the islet where the birds were filmed , the Chinese crested terns had already moved on , so the team missed the opportunity to observe them more closely .  
The jian also contributed to a dashing appearance . In the view of Professor Chen Pingyuan of Peking University 's Chinese literature department , " Bearing a jian makes one handsome and dignified ; it confers a heroic air . " Chen notes that it would have been hard to travel far carrying a heavy dao or a pair of axes . Moreover , being adrift with book and sword carries strong connotations of refinement .  
Liu Chia-lang , head of the office of civil affairs , also has strong feelings on the future of development and industry in Tungkang : " Only Japan and Tungkang produce banded coral shrimp , which is one of the main seafood products of the town . And Tapeng Bay abounds in natural resources . Tungkang has what it takes to develop . But Taiwan 's entry into the WTO is going to be a heavy blow to Tungkang 's fishing industry . "  
In the domestic market , most goods can already be imported freely , although the automotive sector is still protected by regional import quotas and will be affected by the opening of Taiwan 's market to vehicles from the US , Japan and Korea .

As visitors hurry by on their way from one scenic spot to the next , on the steep slopes they see the patches of Japanese knotweed , stonecrop and spiraea , with little flowers blossoming shyly in all shades of yellow and red ; the dense , short arrow bamboo ; and the Yushan roses heavy with rose hips . But only Lo Liu-chih knows that at little more than arm 's length , the tangled vegetation hides many nests laboriously built by a bird found only in Taiwan .  
Taiwan farmers found it increasingly difficult to compete against mainland China pork on the Japanese market .

" The growth of the false cypress forests represents a process of stabilization of the rolling mountain rivers . The false cypress trees are the living deities of the process of natural restoration of the land , " writes Chen Yu-feng in his book The Flora of Taiwan . In particular , the medium-elevation cloud forests are unstable zones of heavy rainfall and powerful erosion , and when mighty false cypress trees spring up along the lines of collapse they mend the gashes in the forest and bring new life to the broken ground .  
The false cypress forests which bear the heavy responsibility of stabilizing Taiwan 's fragmented earth , also form a safety valve for the Shihmen Reservoir , Tanshui River and Lanyang River on which the people of northern Taiwan depend for their drinking water . The band of cypress forest that runs from Mt . Chilan to Mt . Lala forms a huge natural reservoir that soaks up heavy rainfall and releases it in gentler flows while keeping the soil firmly in its grasp , in a way that no human engineering project could replicate .  
The dialogue in Hero was superficial and too modern sounding , and the film laid greater emphasis on form than the actual storyline . Moreover , director Zhang Yimou overextended himself attempting to confine so heavy and broad a theme within a two-hour format . As a result , the entire story comes off as a stiff and unnatural . Lacking in vitality , the characters are merely functional .  
On the ground in front of the Sanching altar was laid a straw mat with a bagua pattern . The Daoist priest Li Chi-chang used white rice to form a dragon on the mat , with eggs as its eyes , two large bowls as its mouth and nose , rolled-up paper spirit money as its ears and horns , and sticks of fragrant wood as its whiskers . What 's more , the Paoan Temple especially forged 108 heavy gold coins to be the scales of the dragon .

The Committee also notes the major problems experienced as a consequence of the armed conflict , which has imposed serious hardships on the entire population , including heavy casualties , long _ lasting physical , emotional and psychological effects , and the disruption of some basic services .  
Although Nicaragua had been able to make progress in solving the problem of the external debt , through the cooperation of the international community and friendly countries , such as the Russian Federation , which had recently announced the cancellation of the debt balance , the external debt was still a very heavy burden which impeded economic growth and inhibited public and private investment .  
Despite its political will to carry out the necessary reforms , the Cambodian Government continued to face two major obstacles : the enormous bilateral and multilateral debt , which constituted a heavy burden on the Government , and poorer access to markets and deteriorating terms of trade .  
Given the vast territory of Angola and the deployment of MONUA at Luanda , six regional headquarters and 18 provincial offices , these aircraft are essential in providing support for the transport of military and civilian personnel , the transport of medium and heavy cargo from the Viana logistics base throughout the mission area and for medical and casualty evacuation purposes .

Poverty was particularly severe on the African continent , which experienced a wide variety of epidemic and endemic diseases , a very low literacy rate , hunger and malnutrition and heavy external debt .  
Practical measures were needed to alleviate the heavy debt burden shouldered by developing countries , and those measures should be carried out at the multilateral level without diverting development funds from other uses or increasing pressure on bilateral donors .  
The cruel irony is that the very victims of development are the ones who are being forced to tighten their belt and eat less in order to pay for the extravagant mistakes of powerful local elites and their external supporters .  25 .  The heavy borrowing of the 1970s alone did not precipitate the debt crisis .  
Since Africa continued to suffer from a heavy external debt burden that contributed to the increase in poverty and affected the political and social sectors , SADC reiterated its call for urgent , effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the problems of external debt and debt servicing in the developing countries .

This would seem to suggest that Governments may follow one of two paths to development , the first encompassing a vision of a free trade economy with heavy reliance on foreign investment and foreign technology , and the other centring on a vision of a deep and diverse industrial sector with predominantly nationally owned enterprises capable of autonomous innovation .  
While pointing out that peace was a prerequisite for development , a number of delegations stated that , in recent years , armed conflict had exacted and was continuing to exact a heavy toll on human settlements and human settlements development and several called on the Centre to provide reconstruction assistance to countries and regions afflicted by armed conflict and natural and man-made disasters .  
Space environmental exploration and research has been carried out on energy electrons , protons , heavy ions and their single particle effects , radiation dosage effects , space thermal plasma , upper atmospheric density and components and solar energy electromagnetic radiation .  
Satellite data are used operationally to lessen the impact of natural disasters such as tropical cyclones , flash floods , heavy snowstorms , volcanic ash clouds , sea ice , toxic effects on coastal waters and harmful algal blooms .  
All these initiatives have been carried out despite the climate of uncertainty prevailing throughout the country , characterized by potential and actual food shortages , a hard-to-reach population scattered throughout Katanga , and a volatile situation in Kasa hindering the effective distribution of humanitarian assistance ( scattered population , heavy military presence , etc . ) . 
In fact , evidence obtained by the military authorities of the Islamic State of Afghanistan on the command and control of military campaigns , the extensive use of heavy artillery and superior air power and the use of night vision equipment to advance in the dark clearly casts aside all doubts about the discernible direct and large-scale Pakistani involvement in Afghanistan and overt military assistance to the Taliban .  
Africas heavy dependence on primary commodity exports ( accounting for about 80 per cent of total export earnings ) is evidence of the low level of human resource development and limited technological capability to take advantage of emerging trade and investment opportunities .  
Mr . Leiro ( Norway ) said that the assumption that globalization benefited everyone had yet to be proven ; the gap between rich and poor was growing both within and between nations and many poor countries attracted minimal foreign investment , lacked a dynamic private sector and were often deprived of the benefits of increased export earnings by heavy debt burdens and limited market access . 
For many commodities exported by developing countries , there has also been substantial substitution by synthetic materials over the past two decades , while a shift away from traditional &amp; lt ; heavy = industries , such as iron and steel , has also limited the rate of expansion in demand for natural raw materials .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the policies of reform being implemented by African countries , their economic situation remains critical and African recovery and development continue to be severely hindered by , inter alia , the persistence of lower commodity prices and the heavy debt burden and are also substantially affected by the levels of official development assistance and foreign direct investment , as well as the ongoing conflicts in some regions of the continent ,

This political confrontation has effectively pitted local communities against each other , and as a consequence the indigenous population has paid a heavy price in terms of human suffering and remains under the constant threat of renewed violence .  
The Caribbean region and sea possessed a number of unique features which justified according them priority attention : exceptional biological diversity , highly fragile ecosystems and heavy reliance by most of the countries of the region on the coastal land and marine environment in order to achieve sustainable development .

A key question for UNCTAD to consider is : can the barriers to international trade in agriculture and agro-industrial products be reduced far enough and fast enough to enable a poverty reduction strategy for the rural developing world to be based primarily on agricultural growth and rural non-farm employment rather than on a heavy reliance on social programmes and social safety net ?  
The economic weaknesses of small island developing States were well known : narrow economic base , low levels of diversification , heavy dependence on external trade ; shortage of skilled manpower ; and the brain drain .

Both countries sustained heavy losses of human life and much of their infrastructure and productive economic base have been destroyed , casting more doubts upon the future prospects of these countries to address structural poverty and underdevelopment .  
In retrospect , for some developing countries the period of the 1980s was considered a lost decade because of the heavy burden of debt servicing , falling commodity prices , negative economic growth , unemployment and structural adjustment .  
Recognition of the particular problems faced by small island developing States relating to their remoteness from major markets , modest natural resource and export bases , narrow skills bases , heavy reliance on costly imports , limited access to private capital , and vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental degradation .  
Declining availability of financial resources , domestic and external , including ODA , a heavy and unsustainable debt burden , falling or volatile commodity prices , complex trade barriers , lack of economic and export diversification and market access for key products which LDCs benefit from , as well as supply-side constraints , have seriously affected the growth and development prospects of LDCs .  
The institutional location of Trainmar centres is not generally relevant for an integrated approach to maritime transport and commerce , or to overall national interest : there is evidence that in some cases national authorities have not been given the opportunity of considering the most opportune institutional location of the Trainmar centres as among available educational and training institutions ; there is a heavy focus on locating Trainmar centres in ports or training facilities attached to ports .
