In the coming 5 years , the step of attracting investments should be accelerated ; industry structures , product structures and enterprise structures will be gradually adjusted .  " Three transformations " are to be realized : to immediately develop from single export processing to comprehensive functionality , to transform from a focus on traditional industries into focusing on developing of the new technology industry , and to transform from a focus on scattered , small-scale investment attraction into actively introducing large industry &amp; trade projects from foreign multinational companies and groups .  
In the event of a water pollution accident that has caused or may cause harms or damage beyond a single administrative division , the local people 's governments at or above the county level governing the place of accident shall promptly notify the people 's governments of relevant localities , which have suffered or may suffer the harms or damage of the accident , of such circumstances as the time , place , and type of accident ; varieties and quantities of pollutants discharged ; and preventive measures that need to be taken .  
These are mainly expressed as follows : We have changed the single taxation system structure under planned economy conditions and established a new-style circulation taxation system with value-added tax as the main component , supplemented by consumption and business tax , and have perfected the income tax system ; we have separated government from enterprises ;  
From 1996 to 1997 , as aboveground pirated production turned underground , China published the provision for awarding 300,000 yuan to anyone who effectively informs against a pirated CD production line .  It set a record by awarding 1.2-million yuan to a single person who informed against four production lines .  During this stage , 90 pirated CD production lines were removed , which was well received by the international community .  
However , since the goals were not clear and the standards were not clear , the understanding of " computerization and informationization " led to an emphasis on hardware , while taking software lightly ; an emphasis on single units , while taking networking lightly ; and an emphasis on development and redundant construction projects .  Shortcomings occurred where systems construction was not complete ; technical systems were not compatible ; and non unified standards increased daily .  
At that time our country 's capacity for screening chemical compounds was less than one-tenth of that of a single US research institute .  Despite the circumstances , members of the project group were determined to carry out innovative research .  Eventually they triumphed over their powerful adversaries , smashed the preoccupation that " developing countries are unable to develop new drugs " and captured the world 's commanding height of developing the anti-malaria drug .  
On the battlefield of the Liaoning-Shenyang Camp of the old days , a certain motorized infantry brigade conducted a special live-ammunition practice : Operating tanks , firing antiaircraft guns , and launching missiles , the " leading members " of the brigade 's party committee operated some 10 authorized main-battle firearms , and not a single shot missed its target ;  
China has preliminarily established the socialist market economic system .  The " Proposal " has not put forward more specific targets .  It only sets a single target of a predictive nature to " double the GDP " by 2010 .  
Upon receiving orders , the anti-chemical warfare battalion of a group army under the Lanzhou Military Region immediately took part in rescue work .  Through 34 hours of hard efforts , the battalion successfully completed its task without harm to a single soldier .  It has demonstrated the high technological and tactical level of anti-chemical warfare troops and their indomitable style and fearless spirit .  
The 20th century saw a series of major events that affected the course of the world history , but what had the greatest impact on the changes in human society and induced the most profound speculations is the transformation of the socialist ideal into practice , from practice into system , from the practice of a single country into the practice of numerous countries , and again from a triumphant march into a tortuous journey .  
Practice has proven that since the actual foundations on which individual countries establish socialism vary , their methods of gaining political power vary , and their ethnic and national conditions vary , there can be no single model of development that fits every country .  
During a major contest organized by their fleet to review scientific and technological training , Zhang and his crew won first place in 14 single categories and became the champion of the whole contest .  
A vast ocean separates China and the United States . China has never sent a single soldier to areas near the US continent , nor has China dispatched a reconnaissance plane to US coastal areas .  The United States , on the contrary , has never stopped conducting hostile surveillance , probing flights and harassing activities toward China since the founding of New China .  
The troops deployed at the base will first conduct tactical training under reciprocal conditions from the single soldier , single vehicle , single artillery up to battalion level , learning coordinated operations among the various branches of the armed forces .  After that , comprehensive exercises will be carried out , and the base will conduct comprehensive examinations .  
Not long ago , they sent 200-odd special vehicles of all types to conduct a long-distance exercise , during which they alternately engaged in defensive and offensive drills for four times , crossing beaches , battling through shoals , and traversing dangerous tracks without one single vehicle being left behind .  
Supporting the Party 's principles , guiding public opinion in the correct direction , the overall situation of serving Tibet : these are three mutual relationships coexisting in a single entity ; this is a political demand the Party makes of its organs ' newspapers , the sublime mission of those who run the newspapers .  
Dalai as the representative of the backward feudal serfdom has unceasingly carried out splittist and sabotage activities beyond our borders after betraying the motherland and Tibetan people in 1959 .  He not only has not done a single good deed for the Tibetan people but instead has jeopardized Tibet 's social stability and economic development and even resorted to every trick to thwart aid projects arranged and implemented by the World Bank and other organizations for Tibet and other Tibetan areas in the country .  
In our research and explorations , we should be mindful of avoiding and overcoming research methods that are isolated and focus on separate points only , be mindful of avoiding and overcoming the conventional thinking that looks at only a single , specific object , and observe and analyze issues from multiple dimensions and angles , so that our research takes on more characteristics of the times and that the theory and practice of joint operations can better cater to the development of the times .  
During those warring years , the reason for the strength of the party growing from small to big , the propositions of the party conforming with the popular feelings , and the armed forces of the party developing like a single spark starting a prairie fire was because the party regarded doing everything for the masses and relying on the masses in doing everything as its fundamental line .  As it could fulfill what it said and represented the fundamental interests of the people , it won the hearts of the people .  
On 24 May , the Public Security Department of Guangdong cracked down an exceptionally big drug manufacturing and trafficking syndicate in a single operation and destroyed an underground drug processing plant in the Hunan city of Gongyi together with several hideouts in Guangzhou after six months of careful planning based on information supplied , seizing 260,000 head-shaker pills , 320,000 methaqualone pills and large quantities of raw materials and equipment for making drugs .  Also tracked down and seized were 20-million yuan in cash , seven vehicles and other ill-gotten property .  
All comrades in the party should set up a lofty communist ideal , fortify their conviction and spur themselves on by holding to lofty ideological and moral standards .  More importantly , they should make unremitting efforts in a down-to-earth manner to realize the party 's basic program for the current stage and put their heart into each single piece of work now .  
The experiment on the reform of the state treasury centralized collection and payment system should be carried out in accordance with the guiding ideology and basic principles approved by the State Council , and the specific content of reform should be implemented step by step around core issues such as the establishment of single treasury accounts and the standardization of procedures for receipts , disbursements , payments and appropriations , with attention to the key areas of reform .  
Iraqi Foreign Minister Dr . Naji Sabri stated on 2 August : At a time when the international community as a whole has raised a demand for sanctions against Iraq to be lifted , the United States is again threatening Iraq with another air strike , and this shows that the United States , finding its policy on Iraq isolated and foiled , has exhausted its tricks , and has decided to risk everything on a single venture .  Dr .  
The spokesman said : Attempts , plans , and actions by a single country to seek military and strategic advantages in outer space not only have always existed but are being further developed .  If this is not prohibited , it is likely that weapons will be employed in outer space in the near future , which could even lead to a multilateral arms race in outer space .  
After China 's " entry into WTO , " China 's automobile , pharmaceutical , chemical , agricultural , and service industries will be faced with the pressure of competition in the short-run .  The entering of foreign goods into China 's market will have some adverse influence on China 's national industries .  However , there is not a single country going bankrupt due to " entry into WTO . "

Through structural adjustment , we need to improve grain production in both breadth and depth , to convert from common varieties to quality and exclusive varieties , from the single production of grain to the overall development of grain plus diversified operations , and from simply providing primary farm products to developing the intensive processing of farm and sideline products .  
Countries differ in many ways , in their social systems , historical backgrounds , cultural heritage , economic development , standard of living , religious beliefs , and values .  Therefore , it is not possible to expect all countries to develop after a single model or system .  
In early 1998 , the state made public the project to protect the natural forests along upper reaches of Chang Jiang by announcing that " not a single tree in natural forests can be cut down . "  Since then , the state has allocated one billion yuan every year to help transfer 200,000 woodcutters into forest protectors , and localities have recorded a yearly drop of several billion yuan in local revenues .  
Anti-narcotics law enforcement departments have always maintained a high-pressure posture of striking hard at narcotics-related illegal and criminal activities and persisted in rehabilitating every single drug addict , punishing every single drug trafficker , rooting out every single narcotic plant grown , and investigating and affixing the responsibility for every single case of narcotics production .  
The national flags of China , Tajikistan , Russia , Kazakhstan , and Kyrgyzstan were suspended along both sides of every single main street from the airport to downtown Dushabe . Hung on streets were horizontal boards with inscriptions written in Tajik , Chinese , and Russian and reading as " warmly welcome the distinguished guest from China , " " the friendship between the peoples of China , Tajikistan , Russia , Kazakhstan , and Kyrgyzstan last forever , " " unity is power , " and so on .  
Commenting on the issues of direct cross-strait postal , commercial , and transport links [ hereafter termed as the " three links " ] during a meeting with a Taiwan Lien-Ho Pao delegation in Beijing in late August , Qian Qichen , vice premier of the State Council , pointed out : So long as Taiwan authorities acknowledge that cross-strait exchanges of air and shipping services will be conducted within the domestic flight and shipping routes of a single country , relevant concrete problems can be easily resolved .  
To resolve the " three-link " issues , if both sides jointly recognize that cross-strait exchanges of air and shipping services will be conducted within the domestic flight and shipping routes of a single country , both sides could simplify relevant provisions as much as possible .  Both sides definitely could refer and use the provisions governing direct experimental shipping between Fuzhou and Kaohsiung and between Xiamen and Kaohsiung . Thus , a lot of troubles can be avoided and sensitive issues can be easily resolved .  
However , relevant departments are unable to find a single piece of evidence to support the case all this time , but are faced with constant public queries .  To get the government out of the predicament , the Justice Department and the FBI had to seek a compromise with Lee Wen-ho , asking Lee to plead guilty to a felony count of " improperly downloading classified information " in exchange for his personal freedom .  
With those in subordinate positions following the example set by their superiors , the entire industrial and commercial administration department of Zhuhai was " rotten from the inside out . "  The local common people all said that if the industrial and commercial administration cadres were all dragged out to be shot , there would not be a single innocent man wrongly killed .  
Sheng Huaren , minister in charge of the State Economic and Trade Commission , said : In 1998 , the state authorities decided to changed several specialized economic management departments into state bureaus which would undergo transition in the period of three years , because the main concern was that if the change was made thoroughly in one single step , the conditions might not be well prepared and mature .  
The Chinese people have never recognised the unequal treaties imposed on them , never forgotten for a single day the humiliating state of Hong Kong under occupation and never stopped their indomitable struggle for state sovereignty and national emancipation .  
Other time periods are indicated by a single solid yellow line marked by the kerbside .  " The new colour scheme for the sign posts which serves advisory purpose can make different stopping restrictions more comprehensible and more easily identified by motorists , " Mr Kwok said .  
" It is inappropriate and often misleading to describe the actual change in households ' well-being without taking into account the various welfare provisions by the Government including free-subsidised education service , low cost public housing , free medical care , retraining and other government subvented welfare services all of which contribute to improving the living standard of the disabled , the elderly , the single parents and the low income households , " the spokesman added .

" It is too simplistic - and also unfair - to judge our commitment to the free market by a single , extraordinary battle at a time of great economic turmoil , and when massive , secretive and destructive capital flows were creating havoc in the markets . "  
The first half of the year was very unusual in that not a single tropical cyclone was formed over the entire western North Pacific and the South China Sea . This broke all records since 1946 .

Firstly , the waiting time for public rental flats for the single elderly has been reduced from four years in 1997 to three years at present on average as a result of the implementation of the elderly priority scheme and provision of additional rental flats for the elderly by the Housing Authority .  
Let me emphasise that it is not our intention to target any single offshore gambling operation - in fact , in drafting this provision , we have considered whether the regulation of live broadcast of odds on TV and radio should be extended to all sporting events .  
While conceding that there may not be a single quick fix strategy to turn Hong Kong into a regional innovation and technology hub , Mr Ho was confident that the Government 's continued commitment , coupled with a focused approach and pragmatic programmes to lay a sound foundation , would help Hong Kong develop towards this end .  
As far as some other A-level practical subjects , such as technical and computer subjects are concerned , the practical examinations have been abolished after the introduction of TAS . This is because of the short duration and more complex nature of the practical tests involved and hence it is impossible to fully assess the candidates ' performance in the application of technical skills in one single practical examination .  
The Board noted the current position of Hong Kong in the compilation of disability statistics .  Board members were aware that data on persons with disabilities were scattered in various administrative records maintained by different Government departments , statutory bodies and non-governmental organizations .  There was no single and comprehensive data source that could provide a complete picture on the demographic and socio-economic profiles of such persons .  
" Women have special needs in areas such as physical and mental health , and they face different barriers and difficulties .  These include sexual violence and domestic violence problems , lack of formal education opportunities while they were young , unemployment at middle age , the digital divide , immense pressures faced by working women with dual roles , single parent families lacking sufficient support , as well as difficulties faced by disabled women .  All these lead us to feel that there is a need to empower women , " Ms Kao continued .  
The 35-hectare development is the largest single environmentally friendly feature development in Hong Kong . Features such as balconies , sky gardens , wider corridors , utility platforms , mail rooms , elevated landscape decks , internal electric powered shuttle service and seawater cooling for major air-conditioning system are proposed .  
Generally speaking , other than in some circumstances ( where , for example , the suppliers concerned in a single or restricted tender have not yet joined ETS ) , all GSD-originated tenders for supply of goods not exceeding HK $ 10 million in value are promulgated concurrently through the ETS and in the traditional paper format .  
The funded projects cover a wide spectrum including research into real-time bilateral teleoperation of internet based robotic systems , economic reforms and labour market transitions in urban China , studies on dendritic cell functions in chronic Chinese Hepatitis B patients , high performance non-lead piezoelectric single crystal materials , interactions of trace metals and macronutrients in marine plankton , etc .  
" Even though the tenancy between the single operators and the licensees is a commercial matter between the two , the Housing Authority has , in the light of the experience in the 1998 rent re-assessment , considered that it could take a more proactive approach to ensure that the rent reductions granted to the single operators after the rent re-assessment would be passed on to the licensees in full .  This would help the licensees through the current economic hard times , " Ms Chung said in her letter .  
" At present , about two-thirds of the HA 's domestic tenants , or some 400,000 households , pay monthly rents of below $ 1,500 .  The lowest rental - for an interim housing flat - is a mere $ 241 per month .  The highest single rental of $ 3,810 is in respect of a public rental flat converted from an Home Ownership Scheme ( HOS ) flat of over 60 square metres including a master suite and other HOS facilities .  
As for the construction and engineering contracts , a major reason for single tendering was to avoid technical problems or contractual disputes that might arise from the employment of different contractors on the works .  Another main reason was that the works required were of extreme urgency : for example , the works had to be completed before the typhoon or rain season ; open tendering in these circumstances would delay the works and prejudice public or security interests .  
After braving 800 miles through the world 's worst seas for 17 days , they miraculously arrived on the uninhabited south coast of South Georgia . However , they had to cross over the glaciers and mountains to reach the rescue station on the other side .  In 1916 , Shackleton returned to rescue the men on Elephant Island . After isolated for nearly two years in the barren and frigid Antarctic , no single one member of the 28-man crew was lost .  
Extra convenience will be provided for public housing tenants living in Harmony Blocks as the Housing Department allows an additional location for the installation of laundry racks .  Starting from August 15 , tenants may apply to erect a drying rack , at their own expenses , at a designated position to the external wall outside the living room .

About half a year ago , the National Science Council established a Taipei regional analytical instrument center and purchased a single crystal diffractometer for the measurement of molecular structure .  
His first major task became road development . In order to fund the enormous task , Mayor Shu sought a loan from the provincial government . As the standard yearly appropriation for all public construction throughout the island is US $ 72,500,000 , officials of the provincial government were astounded when Mayor Shu requested five times that amount for a single city .  
It involves many complicated factors and to single out one country as the culprit is unfair . Many companies feel they are the victims says one official from the Ministry of Economic Affairs , but the real damage is done to the country as a whole .

This so-called " domain of single subjectivity " refers to the main characteristic that in traditional Chinese history social , economic , academic , cultural , and artistic activities as subjectivities were deeply influenced by political activity as subjectivity .  
I sat motionless in the floral room , quietly gazing at the orchids , like a Taoist adept in ancient times peering at the heavens . Although the entire room had but this single lovely star , I felt as though I had been transported to the midst of a star-filled sky .  
In fact , flowers or " sacrifices , " aside from differences in religious connotation , both contain a single heartfelt meaning . And using animals as offerings has been known in both east and west ; in China , they also carry thousands of years of unbroken tradition and symbolic meaning .  
The sky ca n't be reached in a single bound though , as the Chinese expression goes . For Taiwan to develop a satellite will be like a child learning to cook , watching and observing first and then starting out slowly with some simple dishes . The dishes may not look like much , but they can lay the foundation for more elaborate ones later . (  
In this flourishing market the real estate companies often inflated prices even within a single day , producing a stampede of buyers anxious not to lose out and sending house prices skyrocketing to almost double their previous level .  
Those who finished high in the number of interpellations expressed satisfaction that their daily diligence at pursuing public policy is finally laid out for the public . Others are busy trying to defend themselves , patiently explaining to reporters why their numbers of interpellations are so low , or so biased in content toward a single side .  
These lions are fine statuary , and despite weathering caused by exposure to the European climate the sculptor 's verve is still evident . As I look upon their worn and pitted surfaces I often wonder what the sculptor must have felt as he wielded the mallet in some gloomy atelier , his youth slowly turning to old age as his life and work blended into a single whole , free of all regret .  
One major reason is that these diseases - - ulcers , high blood pressure , heart and arterial disease , and so on - - are not acute illnesses brought on by a single cause , as many past epidemic diseases were , but are chronic illnesses brought on by numerous factors , so it is relatively hard to clarify cause and effect relationships .  
Five years ago , a major battle was fought in the media between the natural ecology and communications construction . The result was that the " egg " ( the environment ) defeated the " stone . " The New Central Cross-Island Highway had originally been planned to cut across the Central Mountain Range to Yuli in Hualien . But because Yushan National Park was " a single man able to hold a narrow mountain pass against an army , " the plan was shrunk so that the road became the park 's " scenic highway . "  
But in more than a few ways , cab drivers are also the object of criticism - - for refusing to ride short distances , for finding the longest distance between two points , for illegally raising fares during rush hour , for acting rudely , etc . And because it is easy for undesirables to become drivers , as public security has deteriorated , illegal behavior by a few drivers has tarnished the image of the industry . As the Chinese expression goes , " A single mouse dropping ruins the pot of congee . "  
For example , the Tun Hwa Radio fleet , the first to make use of radio communication , was established three years ago as a pilot project of the Institute of Transportation of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications . It upholds a policy of hiring only drivers of outstanding moral character and of employing not a single driver with a bad record so that passengers can feel at ease about riding a cab at any hour .  
Heavy on Public Opinion : In the 1985 Taipei City Council election , his vote total was high enough to elect four city councilmen [ Taiwan uses a multiple member single vote system ] . In the 1986 Legislative Yuan election , he was elected with 140,000 votes , highest in his district . In repeated electoral victories , he has overwhelmingly won over voters .  
" The system of agents has long been in place abroad , and is the long-term trend , " explains Luc Kwanten . For people overseas who have the publishing rights , dealing with a single agent saves a great deal of trouble over negotiating with individual publishers whose operating situations are unclear . For the domestic publishing industry , going through an agency saves even more in expenses than setting up your own publishing rights department or hiring specially trained negotiators . "  
Shih Tsui-feng feels that , apart from the fortunate few who have their own homes , most modern urbanites are hard put to share their cramped living spaces with the traditional New Year 's couplets , but he says , " Still , even if it 's just a single character , such as ' Spring ' or ' good fortune ' - - hung upside down - - it 's always nice to hang something that adds a little holiday spirit and traditional flavor to the season . "  
One unmarried social worker is worried that if she marries , it will affect her current employment . Another is worried about the problem of educating her children in the future , and keeps putting off getting married . Yet another , a single woman who owns an interior design business , quite frankly sticks to a philosophy of remaining single as a way to reduce the responsibilities of housework , " states the Cheng-Liao study .  
The ancestral home , in use for four generations , was thus levelled overnight . For the older generation who are accustomed to living in the ho-yuan , there are psychological obstacles in making the leap into a tall building in a single bound .  
" One shovelful could fill a tin can . " Today vast stretches of land have been developed , and pesticides have been badly overused in cultivated areas . Earthworms are highly vulnerable to sudden acute poisoning , " so that in many hectares of farmland , you could n't find a single worm , " says Huang , who worked hard with Kuo looking for the creatures in agricultural areas in Hsinchu .  
Alliance case study number four - - palmtop computers . Although the main trend for the future seems to be small , specialized R &amp; D centers belonging exclusively to a single industry , the Industrial Technology Research Institute - - which has been in a league by itself for the past nineteen years and has accumulated countless resources - - is still the center of attention .  
Climbing up onto an observation platform at the farm , banana trees are lined up in meticulous ranks one after another in the square and regular groves . More unusual is that each and every tree is upright and green , with hardly a single withered leaf to be found .  
Different in thinking but not in status : Wildlife protection groups around the world today generally come in two kinds : One takes radical action to support the total prohibition of trade in endangered species ; the other believes that wildlife protection can not be accomplished in a single step and tries to study and gain an understanding of local conditions and works with local agencies or scholars in order to carry out long-term , systematic protection .  
It seems that Taichung has now become the " great grey mullet harbor . " This is also related to the fact that the cold fronts have not been able to come further southward . Improvements in fishing gear over the past few years , such as two boats cooperating to create a single large trap , increasing the horsepower of fishing boat motors , and improvements in two-way radios , have enabled the work of catching the fish in winter , unattainable in recent years , to go along swimmingly in the warmer weather .  
Since people 's environments ( both natural and social ) are extremely variegated and complex , preventing people from having firsthand knowledge of all of the people , matters and things in the world , sociologists have theorized that people by necessity simplify things , making people who share one characteristic - - such as old people or poor people conform to a single mold .  
Liang Chia-chen , a commercial secretary in the Ministry of Economic Affairs currently assigned to Belgium , is a female " single noble . " She does n't hide the fact that she 's never been very serious about getting married precisely because it might affect her chances of foreign assignments in the future .  
Environmental environment needs upgrading : Environmentally friendly products are the wave of the future . For example , Acer , which already has a sound foundation in Germany and Holland , in order to meet European environmental regulations , began a year and a half ago to offer a personal computer which " does n't use a single screw , " but is fit together out of molded parts .  
The attacking force goes straight down to the foot of the dike . Add to this that there is a pulling effect when the waves retreat , so-called " backwash " , says Lin Yung-teh . Given the iron law that the force of the waves can not be reduced , although the dikes will not be smashed in a single blow , they can not stand up against the continual digging away of the soft sand under their feet over a long period of time .  
The institution Mr . Chen worked for was a unit dealing with foreign affairs . During the six years of his employment there , he had many opportunities to be stationed abroad , but not once did he take so much as a single step outside the country . Always remembering that he was the only male in the third generation of his extended family , every week he returned to the family ' s home several times to help his paraplegic grandfather bathe . Such traditional filial responsibilities were his to shoulder .  
Liu Kuang-ming says that although the problem is complex , it is not inevitable that the day will come when fishermen are banned from having even a single shark in their nets . Instead , it would be better if , after surveys , endangered sharks ' breeding grounds can be protected , the amount of shark to be caught each year can be limited , or a set of practical measures can be devised as early as possible for the use of sharks .  
This in turn drew on the neoclassical style that appeared in Europe in the mid-18th century . That style emphasized " reason " and rationality , which designers of the period found embodied in the nearly pure geometric shapes of classical architecture . This trend , combined with the cultural exchange that came from colonial expansionism and the rise of archaeology as a field of study , produced new structures in Europe that incorporated a number of classical themes into a single building .  
After being returned to China , Taiwan was kept apart and given a special status because the mainland had not returned to a state of normalcy . Administration was placed in the hands of a single " hsing-cheng chang-kuan " appointed by the central government . This term is generally rendered into English as " governor , " but its literal translation is " chief executive official . " Meanwhile , other aspects of life in Taiwan - - such as the currency , rationing , and so on - - were also different from the mainland .  
To be sure , there is not a single naturalist writer who has not expressed great anguish at the rapid destruction of Taiwan 's environment . In fact , the entire field of naturalist literature has carried the responsibility of raising the environmental consciousness of Taiwan 's residents , and has therefore never been pure literary description .  
The Ministry of Education , which has jurisdiction over sunken ships , argues that Huang has always been trying to get commissioned to do the work of recovering the artifacts . However , due to academic considerations , the Ministry can not sign a contract with a single individual . Thus plans for exploring and salvaging the ships have been delayed for eight years .  
Wang Yi-ju , the National Taiwan Normal University Institute of Environmental Education , who chose stray dogs as the subject for her master 's thesis , notes that none of Taiwan 's elementary school text books mention how to care for dogs , with the exception of a single essay by the writer Lin Liang on the warm feelings between him and his pet . No text book explains to children that raising dogs requires a number of conditions , including sufficient space and a responsible commitment to the dog .  
Ten years ago , a number of Southeast Asian women were brought to this traditional Hakka community to look for partners among the local widowers and single men , but less than ten of them married and settled in the area , and " foreign brides " remained a rarity . Later , the practice was stopped from catching on when the government began to restrict the entry of single women from Southeast Asia on tourist visas .  
He adds : " In fact , looking at our jade collection alone is like entering a 7000-year time tunnel . " Private treasuresFrom the jade totems of the Shang and Yin dynasties to the ritual jade of the Zhou dynasty and the burial jade of the Han , and on through to the ornamental jade and " ingeniously carved jade " - - such as the Chinese cabbage carved from a single piece of green and white jadeite - - of the Ming and Qing dynasties , the Chinese have always treasured jade above all else .  
A : I think we should avoid a proliferation of so - called " international " productions which try to attract a poorly defined audience , and to sign themselves up for a round of " patchwork " festivals . I believe we should present the public with a more coherent series of performances from a single country or a group of countries , which relate the history of that region 's performing arts , ranging from traditional forms ( folk ) to classical cultures , up to and including modern or contemporary forms .  
This is particularly because the marriage market has subtle self-regulating abilities : not only is there flexibility in the age at which people marry , but with today 's increasing numbers of divorced , remarried and single people , marriage has broken away from its traditional form , and concern that future Adams will find no Eve seems unnecessary .  
In the US , for example , residential and agricultural areas are clearly separate , and huge areas of agricultural land are often devoted to a single crop , so it is easy to differentiate the objects in the satellite image .  
Often many different crops are planted in a single small area ; small towns and large urban areas are not clearly defined and often are mixed together ; and there are rapid changes in construction . These make it difficult to interpret satellite images .  
In regard to this problem , Paolaban believes that each indigenous group has its own distinct naming method ; recovering the names is not the action of individuals , but should be based on information from a detailed survey . From common discussions among the nine groups and linguistic scholars , a single universal system should be derived .  
Paul Perng says it used to be thought that clear targets were needed to bring about ecological protection , and so preservation areas were created for specific animals , such as the clouded leopard or panda . But in the future nature reserves wo n't be devoted to a single rare species but rather will be aimed at protecting the greatest diversity of ecology . Even areas that appear to contain nothing special but are nonetheless ecologically important will require protection .  
Liu explains , " China 's court music was the music and dance extolled by Confucianists . Confucius combined rites , music , dance , poetry , and song into a coherent whole , creating a single integrated set of rules for proper ritual and decorum . " For instance , there were rules stipulating what dance the emperor was to use when worshipping Heaven , or what music was to be played for an imperial inspection tour . The fundamental principle was to create a harmonious society through cultivation of character and delineation of status .  
The clock tower 's main structure comprised three levels . The upper level bore an armillary sphere , used for astronomical observations ; on the middle level was a celestial globe , which displayed the movements of celestial bodies ; while on the bottom level were wooden mannikins which struck the time of day . The whole formed " a single mechanism , turned by the power of water , without human effort . "  
Grass huts offer people numerous advantages-they are convenient , flexible , simple , and can be made entirely from materials readily at hand . Li Juei-tsung , an associate professor of architecture and environmental design at the Chung-Hua Polytechnic Institute , suggests , " Thatched houses are the single greatest expression of the culture of ordinary people , and they are one of the great creative products of man and nature . It 's too bad they have been ignored in architectural history . "  
In 1980 , when the North Link Railway was completed , this stretch of track , essential for connecting the east and west coast main lines , became even more important . The single track was turned into a double track , and many of the old single-track tunnels were taken out of service . Now they are objects of our explorations .  
In The Competitive Advantage of Nations , published in 1990 , Porter advanced the now famous " Porter 's Diamond , " a four-sided framework in which the vague concept of competitive advantage is turned into something clear and concrete . From organizations as small as a single company to those as large as a nation , the basic forces at work in shaping competitive advantage are herein clearly exposed .  
In 1973 , it was generally agreed that jurisdiction over the media should be unified in a single agency . So the Executive Yuan took publication industry affairs from the Ministry of the Interior , and film and broadcast affairs out of the Bureau of Education and Culture , and moved both to the GIO . The GIO doubled in size overnight , assuming its current structure of six departments and three divisions .  
" When the old songs are no longer adequate to evoke a particular emotion , then there 's no choice but to write new pieces , " avers Ho Lo administrative director Ko Ming-feng , who plays sanxian and yueqin ( both guitar-like instruments ) . He points out , for example , how in one case a new style was produced by combining the high-pitched singing of Beiguan with the rapid single drumming of a Peking opera song to sing a genteel duma-style melody ( one of the characteristic Taiwanese opera styles ) .  
Liao Yu-hui suggested that the feelings of being married are something that single people can not really understand . She really loves that feeling of having to think of the other person before doing anything . You Hsia , on the other hand , averred that intimate relations between married couples today ought to be similar to a black-and-white yin-yang circle ; they make up a single , coherent picture , but with the black and white very clearly distinguished , each keeping their own character , and not mixing together into one gray field .  
The traditional dress of India is the " sari , " a single sheet of cloth made into a skirt that goes to the ground ; it is both mysterious and graceful . The Philippines , using locally produced palmetto cloth , has crocheted and embroidered shirts . Indonesian " batik , " wax-dyed or hand-dyed , is cool and comfortable ; a sarong around the waist with a short jacket open in the front is comfortable and beautiful .  
Chinese ink painting , on the other hand , approaches the canvas from a kind of " shifting " vantage point . Layer upon layer of mountain ridges overlap across the painting , a thatched hut enclosed by a bamboo fence rests at the mountain base , and a river runs along the summit , flowing off into the distance . Questions of height and distance are irrelevant ; everything seems to be encompassed by a single perspective . Even variations in size or brightness of lighting are lacking .  
Two years ago , the special education center at National Taiwan Normal University conducted a survey of Taiwanese firms which made the above bias all too clear . The results indicated that bosses were most willing to hire handicapped persons whose disability involved their arms or legs . The next most " popular " were the hearing impaired , followed by the mentally retarded . Visually-impaired persons did not make a single boss ' list .  
In one media report , a doctor was quoted as saying : " It has been discovered that if women who have been single for a long time have introverted personalities , and are self-absorbed , their emotional life often becomes very bizarre . As they repress their sexual desires , their hormone secretions fall out of balance , and they are susceptible to tumors in the reproductive system .  
She adds , with particular reference to the problem of overtime pay , " It is especially unfair given that employer and employee interact as economic entities , a status in which every individual should be equal . " The final irony of all is that the overtime regulations are frequently not observed by employers , so the people who are punished most are those single women who obediently agree to work past the legal limits on their overtime hours .  
In many of the more remote mountain districts , the population drain has led to Earth Lords being consolidated together for joint worship , while in major industrial areas , and sites where large development projects are in progress , numerous Earth Lords , suddenly deprived of their own hideaways , now have to cram together at a single altar .  
Wang , who studied in the West for many years , and who says that there is only a single universal standard of press freedom , recalls that when the ROC government first moved to Taiwan , it was facing a life-or-death crisis . Putting the regime 's survival first , it set aside notions of balance and press oversight inherent in democratic politics and argued that the media had to serve the state in order to ensure stability and the public interest .  
The recently passed budgets covering the second half of fiscal 1999 and all of fiscal 2000 ( i.e . a total of 18 months ) provide for total appropriations of more than NT $ 36.9 billion for social welfare . This accounts for 16.4% of the budget , more than for culture and education ( 16.1% ) , defense ( 15.8% ) , and economic development ( 15.7% ) . In fact , for the first time ever , social welfare is the single largest spending item in the national budget .  
Donations have come pouring in by the truckload-instant noodles , mineral water , crackers , sleeping bags , blankets-and medical personnel have also swarmed to the area , but a lack of coordination has resulted in an excess of personnel and materiel in some areas and a complete lack in others . When well-equipped international rescue operations arrived at the disaster area , the lack of information forced many of them to set out on their own in search of victims . In some cases , five or six different rescue groups converged on a single site .  
If a big clan lived in a traditional compound centered around their own courtyard , anyone that was sick or out of work could recuperate under the protective wings of the extended family , " says Taipei County deputy chief Lin Wan-yi , who is currently planning the county 's social welfare system . Within a single generation , the functions of the family declined greatly .  
According to museum employee Lu Yu-hua , many people express surprise that there should be an entire museum devoted solely to paper , but when you really think about it , there 's really nothing strange about it . When paper was first invented , the raw materials from which it was made differed from one region to the next . A single sheet of paper spoke volumes about local climates and vegetation ; its very existence enabled the spread of knowledge , and could record the history of an individual or an entire nation !  
They are the main theme of a series of works by Guatemalan painter Moises Barrios . In one work , a banana graces the cover of a popular magazine . Another painting parodies the work of Piet Mondrian , one of the most famous representatives of rationalism . Mondrian 's canvas with nothing but a single color divided by a few straight lines becomes a banana peel , with a few dark splotches here and there against a yellow background .  
In 1990 , the Ministry of Education announced a new policy , called somewhat misleadingly the " self-study plan , " which provided junior high school students with an option of seeking senior high school admission without taking the joint entrance exam . Scores in five different areas of school performance ( ethical , intellectual , physical , group spirit , and aesthetic ) started being used in place of a single score in the joint entrance exam for determining senior high school admissions .  
With his enthusiastic and unselfish personality , Lin has been collaborating with grateful artists in this way for 20 happy years . In the process he has amassed an entire storehouse full of ceramic works-a veritable museum of ceramics-without paying a single cent .  
Huang Min-nan , who formerly headed pop music planning at Rock Records , says : " Buddhist music now changes several times a year . " Not so long ago Chinese-style symphonic music , or chanting accompanied by a single instrument was popular , but at the moment it 's all about " spiritual " music and dance tunes .  
He illustrates his point by mentioning Straight Ahead with a Rifle , in which Dong continually returns to the image of a bombing range , communicating how it feels to live next to such a place . It is a factor always on the minds of local residents . This repeated use of a single image is a very unusual technique , but it does n't bore the viewer ; on the contrary , it leaves one feeling that he has gained new insight into the subject of the documentary .  
" In the township of Puli , for example , every single public structure collapsed , including the town hall , the police station , and the schools . That 's hard to believe . Public structures house the very agencies that are supposed to work for our safety . They should be the last buildings to fall , not the first , " says Wang , who adds that the government was only worried about tearing down and clearing away destroyed buildings after the quake , very possibly destroying evidence of fraudulent construction practices in the process .  
" The two easiest places to make a living in Taiwan back then were Chiufen in the north ( with its gold mine in Chinkuashih ) and Chishan in the south , " says Ku , who recalls that a kilo of bananas sold for NT $ 6 . One only needed to cut down a single bunch of bananas weighing 30 kilos to take in NT $ 180 , the equivalent of an entire week 's pay back then for the average working woman .  
As Lo says , " The ROC must move in the direction of flexible diplomacy and utilize foreign policy resources more flexibly . " In the future , overseas offices of the ROC will undertake functional integration at the continental level , with different locations having different specialties , such as overseas Chinese affairs , political affairs , and media relations . All the offices in a particular region will be linked into a single , more efficient , and more richly endowed cooperative group .  
It is necessary because within a single nation , different local governments take in different amounts of revenue due to their unique geographic , environmental , and economic conditions . The central government can not sit idly by while people in certain areas are unable to enjoy basic government services , so it uses various means to alleviate revenue shortfalls where they exist . The Tax Redistribution Fund is one such method .  
The 47% share previously allotted to Taipei and Kaohsiung was decided upon last year after the government canceled a plan to abolish all local sales taxes and replace them with a single national sales tax . Now that this share has been lowered to 43% , the other cities and counties have seen their combined share go up to 39% , with each local government 's individual share calculated on the basis of population , land area , and other factors .  
The whole trip takes about half the day . She had thought that these stores were only crowded on the weekends , but on a rainy weekday in November she decided she did n't feel like cooking and went to buy some prepared foods at the RT-Mart 's deli department . She discovered that there was n't a single open parking space among the hundreds on the first and second floors of the parking structure . She was quite surprised to find that business was so good on a weekday .  
Largely due to his unflagging efforts , Chinese archeology attained a sturdy theoretical and practical foundation that enabled it to emerge as a world-class discipline . His research showed that the rise of Chinese civilization did not occur exclusively in the area around the Yellow River Valley . Rather it emerged from several languages , ethnic groups and cultures spread over a vast landscape . This overturned the " single origin theory " and debunked Western assumptions about " oriental despotism . "  
With longer lifespans and less rigid social values , patterns of living once shared by all have been replaced by a growing diversity of individual experiences . In middle age , some people set up successful businesses , while others lose their jobs and are faced with poverty ; working women find themselves squeezed between the exhausting demands of children and housework on the one hand and their jobs on the other , while at the same time many single women face a daily battle with loneliness .  
At the age of 50 , some people already have grandchildren at their knee , while others are getting married for the first time . With more and more people remaining single , rising divorce rates , growing numbers of unmarried mothers , increasing occurrence of infertility , and the emergence of large numbers of families where husband and wife live in different cities , or even-as for many expatriate Taiwanese business people-in different countries , many middle-aged people 's carefully laid life plans have suddenly come to nothing .  
Born with the proverbial silver spoon in her mouth and well acquainted with the finer privileges in life , she never attended a single day of school in the regular education system , but that has n't kept her from developing into one of Taiwan 's best inkwash artists .  
But with a combination of superb cinematography , fine musical scores , and gorgeous stars in a single package , something clicks . The Korean shows appeal most to viewers who already have their own share of life experiences , enabling them to watch what might be their own stories , retold onscreen before them , rendered beautiful and poetic , with all of life 's wild storms , dreams , and regrets .  
Every 11 years , when the solar magnetic field goes into overdrive , in some areas of the sun 's surface the temperature sinks to 4000oC , so that these areas look darker in color than the surrounding photosphere . Seen from the earth they appear as small dark spots on the face of the sun , but in fact a single sunspot may be many times larger than the total surface area of the earth .  
9-11 has left us at the brink of war , but the possibility of military conflict as a result of US retaliation is not the only worry . A fluke incident and a single leader 's misjudgment in many other flashpoints worldwide could push us beyond the point of no return . The historic enmity between Israel and Palestine comes to mind , as do the ethnic and religious killing in Eastern Europe . North and South Korea are another cause for concern .  
The ITRI 's fever chip applies similar principles . Oligonucleotides from 25 of the most common fever-causing pathogens are arranged on the chip , and infection with any of them can be detected from a single drop of a patient 's blood , urine or cerebrospinal fluid . The fever chip too is currently in clinical trials at National Taiwan University Hospital .  
" The integrated curriculum should not be too disruptive for elementary schools , " says Ou Yung-sheng , because the subject divisions in elementary schools were already very broad , and their teaching arrangements are generally close to a single " class teacher " system , with one teacher teaching several different subjects . Therefore integrating the subjects should not be too difficult .  
With the current staffing structure in junior high schools , physics and chemistry teachers are not equipped to cross over and teach biology , and biology teachers can not teach information technology . Thus teaching in a single study field may be split between five different teachers , and pupils may be left to guess from the content of each unit which teacher will appear on any particular day . What kind of uncertainty will that introduce into the pupil-teacher relationship ?  
The students frolic on the wooden floors in sneakers , running , jumping , sitting , lying down . Students are relaxed and there 's a certain kind of warm atmosphere that they might not even find in their own homes . The classrooms at Yung'an are not divided into a single room per class , as at regular schools .  
The Internet in fact closely resembles the intangible , borderless world of connected individual " pearls . " We never know how extensive or long-lasting might be the impact of a single small idea or action , but we can imagine that every molecule in the vast universe is connected . The area which illustrates such profound ideas is also , interestingly enough , the one that provides the most plain fun .  
The little rural township of Luku , located in Nantou County , has a population of only 20,000 or so . Fifty-nine percent of the people are tea farmers . It is estimated that Nantou County accounts for one-third of the 18,000 hectares of land in Taiwan devoted to tea plantations , with Luku accounting for one half of Nantou 's total . Whether measured by cultivated area or production volume , Luku is the largest single tea-producing township in Taiwan .  
Moreover , because the cafe was located right next to the Hsimenting movie theater district , it attracted many young people , especially when blockbusters were showing on nearby cinema screens . The cafe would be filled with movie-going students , some of whom would order a single cup of coffee and stay an entire afternoon , and whom the proprietors never felt right about asking to move on . After a while , other customers stopped coming , and Literary Salon was forced to close .  
A third of Taiwan 's native fern species grow in the damp , shady forest , and endemic Taiwanese plants such as the Taiwan pleione orchid live here too . The ancient false cypresses are a paradise for epiphytic plants , with up to 80 species living on a single tree .  
In Lukang , the clans Hsu , Huang , and Shih controlled half the town / In the Qianlong reign , the city prospered , and the sails of boats were as numerous as flying fish / In Lukang , spring and autumn dreams , it rose and fell in a single 60-year cycle / Clouds from the west , currents from the east , tourists bring change without knowing what they do .  
Because the boy was born out of wedlock , his mother had no choice but to abandon him in the fields . A crab and duck nursed the infant until he was adopted by a farmer , who named him Lei Haiqing . Lei Haiqing acquired great musical skill as a boy growing up in the countryside , but throughout his childhood he never uttered a single word .  
Eventually , Min Sheng Daily agreed to add another gig , and the 2500 tickets for that were cleaned out in a single morning . After the event , the emcee , Chen Kai-lun , said that this was the most moving event he had ever hosted . There was not an empty seat to be found , no one left halfway through , and everyone felt as if they were being carried back in time on a genteel current of luxurious music .  
With the growing number of single parent families and DINKs ( Double Income No Kids ) , modern people have a broader understanding and greater acceptance of what makes a home . What 's more , today 's young parents themselves have grown up in a freer atmosphere when the entire culture was changing . And so , as a result of all these factors combined , the outlook on filial piety within society as a whole has taken a 180-degree turn .  
In reality , neglected sites need not be publicly owned spaces , and they need not be limited to separate and distinct buildings . Idle spaces can be found everywhere . Their scope includes a single empty building , a sidewalk , a row of houses , or an abandoned or wild piece of land . " So long as spaces are n't managed well and do n't function well , then public and private spaces can both be included , " says Lin Po-nian , publisher of Space Magazine .  
It is still in operation , on track to celebrate its 70th birthday in 2004 . Two or three generations of people in a single family may share the collective memory of dishes like " French Provincial Duck , " which have changed not at all since the 1930s . The restaurant also continues its tradition , dating back to the Japanese colonial era , but having all male staff . One change , however , is that the waiters no longer are required to have their heads shaved , though they still sport uniform hair styles .  
A survey conducted in Kaohsiung County showed a clear rising trend in the number of domestic violence cases reported by foreign brides . Before 1998 the number of such reports was in the single digits . After 1998 there was a yearly increase such that by the end of April , 2001 , there was a monthly average of seven reports .  
Under the old system of economic planning , the distribution of published works in the mainland was all handled through a single state-owned channel ( known as the " first channel " ) - every region in the country had a Xinhua bookstore and supply unit . These Xinhua stores held sole control of delivery and distribution , a system entirely inappropriate for a free market .  
Autumn maples stand tall along the roadside , with fields spreading out beside the highway , the different shades of green spreading out , one after another , into a single beautiful rustic landscape . White herons dotting the fields , the whole area flanked by winding mountain ranges , and dotted with elegant farmhouses and field walls built of rough-hewn stone ; all these illustrate the peaceful beauty of Sanhsing .  
At the opening ceremony in Changhua , ROC president and master of ceremonies Chen Shui-bian remarked that the Sun Yat-sen Freeway represented the island 's first transportation revolution . Now the opening of National Highway No . 3 , in conjunction with the 12 high-speed east-west connectors and the main branch of the Western Coastal Expressway construction projects , as well as the high-speed railway ( scheduled to open at the end of 2005 ) , will turn the entire western corridor into a single living area and thus constitute nothing short of a second transportation revolution .  
Little Li Fu-huei , barely three years old , sits on her father 's lap reciting the 3000-odd-character-long essay by Zhuangzi , " Man in the World , Associated with Other Men . " Although her speech is still very childish , she recites the entire essay from memory , making not a single mistake . Zhou Hong , renowned on both sides of the Taiwan Strait as mainland China 's foremost specialist on family education , in Taiwan on a visit , is dumbstruck by Li 's performance : " Children really do have astounding potential ! "  
At the threshold of the modestly sized temple are a pair of lions carved from a single slab of stone-female on the right , male on the left . The male is playing with a ball , while the female is supporting a cub . The carving of the hard stone is exquisite .  
For a work like No Holding Back , with the trio sculpted completely in the round , the posture and attitude of the three figures was a huge compositional challenge . In each stroke of the knife , there was little room for error . Every single angle had to be taken into consideration . Although the subject of the work was a traditional story , the piece nevertheless had a distinctly modern feel to it .  
According to Chi , single mothers receive very little support in Taiwan . At the GHF , for example , only a minority of girls who decide to keep their baby get any financial or emotional support from their parents , and then only after considerable resistance from them . Most unmarried girls who choose the hard road of raising their child , do so without the proper skills or support from their family or boyfriend .  
Kids do n't have the least opportunity to figure out what it is they really like as individuals . Gerald Durrell , author of My Family and Other Animals , never had single day of formal schooling , but enjoyed a childhood in which he had no particular goals set for him and could follow his own interests entirely . In this setting , he developed a deep love and understanding of animals and changed world conservation history . What would have happened to Durrell if he had been born in Taiwan ?  
Last year the Taiwan Major League terminated operations and the two leagues merged , returning baseball to a single market . The merger included a " traitors ' clause " which barred players who had jumped from the CPBL to the TML from returning to the enlarged CPBL . This forced a number of veterans to retire from the game . Even Mr . Baseball himself , Li Chu-ming , was let go and had to start picking up an unemployment check ; he eventually opened a coffee shop .  
Minister of Justice Chen Ding-nan has declared that individuals who have suffered losses because government employees leaked their personal information are entitled to seek compensation from the government . According to existing regulations , the maximum aggregate compensation for a single personal information leak case is only NT $ 20 million . The Ministry of Justice is currently rewriting the law to raise this amount to NT $ 50 million . Department stores and major retailers will also fall under the LPCMPI .  
Society sighs and shakes it collective head at this subgroup , which consists of disadvantaged individuals , often unemployed and / or single parents , stuck on the lower rungs both socially and economically . When faced with injustice or adversity , they often do not know how to express their emotions or where to seek help . These lonely , helpless , marginalized individuals are most vulnerable to anger-whether as its wielders or its victims .  
Huang Yuan-cheng currently makes a living by selling tea , telling fortunes , and gravesite divination . He was divorced when his daughter was only six months old , yet , in what seems like a short stretch of time , his daughter is ready to start elementary school . Looking back on the many bumps in the road and setbacks he has seen as a single father , Huang still does n't know how he made it this far .  
The most exciting game was that against Japan , which went into extra innings , with Chinese Taipei being clipped by only a single run . Head coach Hsu Sheng-ming said that although the team lost , no one had even expected it to give Japan much of a fight , so their efforts both at the plate and in the field were very admirable . Star pitcher Tsao Chin-hui threw until his hand blistered and began bleeding , giving an idea of the determination shown by the whole squad .  
Second , there is the question as to how specific intent to commit an act of genocide ( where an accused is alleged to have killed a single human being ) is to be distinguished from an act of ordinary murder or the killing of several from mass murder . 
They emphasized the fact that the Moroccan nation was historically and constitutionally a single indivisible whole , but they wondered why censuses and studies carried out by the authorities employed only socio-economic and not racial , ethnic or linguistic criteria , which would give a more complete idea of the composition of the population .  
Equally satisfying in our opinion is the compromise solution reached after long discussion , namely to circulate as an official document of the General Assembly a single compendium including the valuable joint assessment , prepared by the two Vice-Chairmen in their personal capacity , of the two rolling papers on clusters 1 and 2 , as well as proposals and contributions presented by individual countries and groups of countries .  
Further , the Assistant Secretary-General noted that the problems produced by rapid urbanization could not be solved by a single level of government ; it required close collaboration between all levels of government and the entire spectrum of civil society .  Of special importance were local authorities , and in that connection , the Assistant Secretary-General made reference to the recently signed " Protocol of Lisbon " between the Centre and prominent international local-government associations .  
Though this sense of equality was repressed for three centuries by pragmatic measures that were respected but not implemented , and by the extreme zeal of monks who consulted no one in imposing a single faith on this immense geographical area , it was imbued with the spaciousness of the land , the rivers , the forests , the gentle climate , the mountains and prairies , whose influence produced a different type of human character .  
The creation of the United Nations 50 years ago awakened tremendous hopes for mankind , which had , in the space of a single generation , suffered from two particularly savage wars with consequences that sorely affected the entire world and for which all peoples paid a heavy toll . 
The commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations affords an opportunity for giving deep thought to finding the best means of facing up to the challenges of our times and to equipping our Organization with the military capability and material resources that would enable it to address problems at the international level with a single standard based on the principles of equality and justice .  
It is my feeling that the United Nations and the Olympic Movement share a single universal ideal : to promote peace and understanding among nations and among peoples , with all their differences and their complementary features , by contributing to bringing cultures closer together and to promoting friendship among human beings in this world so often battered and torn apart .  
The single , modest , intention of our document was to sound a warning concerning the profound collateral effects on the entire United Nations system of the possible expansion of the number of permanent members .  
The United Nations must tirelessly continue to demonstrate to the men and women of this era that the prevailing openness in the world offers a formidable opportunity for the future , an unexpected chance to transcend our differences in order to attain what I once referred to as the irreducible human element , that is , the quintessence of the values by which we define ourselves as a single human community .  
I am fully aware that the task is a daunting one because of the fundamental divergence of views that exist within the Conference on the international arms-control and disarmament agenda in the post-cold-war era and following the indefinite extension of the NPT and , in the final analysis , on the role of the Conference on Disarmament as the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum at this crucial juncture .  
Throughout this period , worldwide alarm , reflected in numerous United Nations resolutions , grew over the fact that the threat posed by nuclear weapons remained the single most critical global issue .  
According to some scenarios , sustainable biomass energy systems could be the largest single contributor to global energy supply , providing from 17 per cent to 35 per cent of the total demand for primary energy in 2050 .  Such a development would not occur under " business as usual " conditions but would derive from sustainability policies and technological advances with regard to liquid , solid and gaseous fuel production from biomass .  
However , in order to use the limited resources in an optimal manner to meet these different needs a single comprehensive framework of training materials should be developed through modules that would be applicable to countries depending on their status and capability in national accounts .  
It is my earnest desire for an early solution to the Cyprus problem based on a bi-communal , bi-zonal federation with one single sovereignty , one citizenship and one international personality and I am anxious that no further time shall be wasted through repetition of endless discussions and arguments , but strongly recommend that the main issues of the Cyprus problem be addressed in a comprehensive manner and in a way that will yield results .  
Thus , it was suggested that the creation of a single international criminal court would better serve the rule of law by offering fuller guarantees of the objective , impartial and uniform application of the future Code of Crimes against the Peace and Security of Mankind than would ephemeral , ad hoc jurisdictions .  
Recognizing also that there is no single political system or single model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples , and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
To facilitate their effective implementation , it may be necessary to assemble , with full participation of all concerned entities of the United Nations system , all the pieces in a single , integrated operational framework with clear-cut priorities , time-bound targets in line with those set by the World Summit for Social Development in the most crucial areas , and well-defined responsibilities for national and international efforts .  
While we are truly thankful for every single life that has been saved , we must be bitter about all the lives that have not been reached to be rescued and , most critically today , about all the lives that , after three years of systematic human rights abuses , deprivation and sieges , continue to be endangered and subject to the whims of those who have proven their disregard for human life .  
Needless to say that these allegations are mainly propagated by a Government which has been the primary supporter and sponsor of Israel 's State-sponsored terrorism , of its aggressive policies , and of its production of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , and has also backed despotic Governments which have not experienced parliamentarianism , consultation and elections in their political life even for a single day .  
Section III of the IAEA 's seventh semi-annual report ( document S / 1995 / 287 dated 11 April 1995 ) on the implementation of the IAEA 's plan for ongoing monitoring and verification of Iraq 's compliance with the relevant obligations specified in UNSC resolutions 687 ( 1991 ) and 715 ( 1991 ) , addressed the implications of two , single page , documents which were represented as official Iraqi correspondence , generated in April / May 1994 , suggesting the reconstitution of a nuclear weapons programme .  
While acknowledging that the problems covered by the mandate are multidimensional , ranging from structural or systemic to individual and less organized incursions against children , for which no single solution will ever be possible , the report nevertheless offers recommendations as to the first steps of a long , arduous journey .  
It is generally agreed among mainstream economists that outward orientation in economic development has been the single most important factor responsible for rapid economic development and the reduction of inequality in the first and second generations of the newly industrialized economies and the other developing economies that have opened their economies to trade in the past decade .  
Policies directed at raising the productivity of the agricultural sector or developing entrepreneurship do not achieve the desired results unless they take into account the fact that within a single household separate economic accounting units exist and the pattern of the exchange of labour and distribution of resources among them reflects the differences in the bargaining power of its members , which in turn depends on their entitlement .

Fads in policy design have repeatedly swept across segments of the community of policy advisers , only to be followed by reassessments after unanticipated difficulties have arisen .  No single model of financial development applies equally well in all institutional , cultural and technological situations .  
NULLIt is worth noting that during the past two years the Government of the Sudan in its extensive written replies to the Special Rapporteur 's reports did not put forward one single argument supporting the consistency of the analysed provisions of its State legislation with applicable international human rights norms and standards .  
Even in normal times , particularly in developing countries , the capacities of these infrastructures are often strained to manage even the most basic social and economic development programmes , and a single disaster can severely disrupt the community lifelines that provide food distribution , water supplies , health-care services , waste disposal and communications locally and with the rest of the world .  
With regard to the new text of draft article 21 , Slovenia felt that the original intention to include in a single group both crimes against humanity as recognized by customary law on the basis of the Charter of the N \ x { e16c } nberg Tribunal , which applied only in time of war , and systematic and massive violations of human rights , represented an attempt to further the progressive development of international law .  
Initially , i.e . , before the establishment of ICSC 20 years ago , these relationship agreements tying the specialized agencies to the United Nations through adherence to " a single unified international civil service " ( later termed " United Nations common system " ) were intended to be between equals .  
The implementation of this crash programme , if successful , would have reduced the time required to attain sufficient nuclear material for a single nuclear weapon by up to two years compared to the probable production time-scale of Iraq 's EMIS and centrifuge enrichment programmes .  
also that there is no single political system or single universal model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
achievement of sustainable solutions required national , regional and international solidarity , which meant that financial and human resources exceeding the capacity of a single country or small group of countries had to be mobilized .  
also that there is no single political system or single universal model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples , and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
He also drew attention to some remaining difficulties such as the possible additional resources that Conference Services would need for the editing , translation and printing of the supplement , the heavy burden that the concentration of the review work within a single division would place on that division and the priority to be given to other urgent responsibilities in the current period of financial crisis and diminishing resources .  
In the development debate , globalization and the call for integration into a single global economic grid are held out as the primary or even the sole option for developing countries seeking cooperation with developed countries .  
Even when , as is more usual , the formal political boundaries remain intact , the ability of capitals of large and relatively homogeneous States to impose a single direction over all their constituent parts is clearly diminishing . 
Given the proliferation of internal conflicts and regional tensions , the harmful effects of economic disorder , the spread of the AIDS pandemic , the rise of crime and terrorism , violations of human rights , the ever-widening international character of drug-trafficking networks and the deterioration of the environment , there is no single area of international relations that does not require a collective effort on the part of States if it is to be mastered . 
Indeed , 72 per cent of single heads of households , most of them female , live below the official poverty line , which simply implies a lack of access or limited access to basic social services , including food , sanitation , shelter , basic education and primary health care . 
There may be no other single individual who has been as instrumental or as effective in leading the world community in recent years in the difficult search for common ground , particularly on issues relating to environmentally sustainable development .  
Above and beyond the proposals of the Summit of major industrialized countries at Lyon , which I welcome , I advocate a single rigorous coordination structure for all economic and social activities and , especially , a concerted restructuring of the bodies and mandates concerned .  
The new ARIANE-5 launcher has a dual purpose : first , to make the ARIANE family more competitive by enhancing performance levels , reducing launch costs , improving reliability and increasing the useful diameter under the fairing , so that ARIANE-5 will be capable of launching into geostationary transfer orbit either two-3,000 kilogram satellites simultaneously or a single satellite of up to 6,800 kilograms ; second , to satisfy Europe 's need for a low-orbit facility using manned vehicles or space station sections .  
The draft resolution failed to take account of the fact that no single political system or electoral process was suited to all nations and peoples and that political systems were subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors .  
The empowerment of women and their full and equal participation in political , social and economic life , the improvement of health , and the alleviation of poverty are essential to achieving sustainable human settlements .  Paragraphs 10 and 10 bis should be joined as a single paragraph .  
Assessments of the potential impact of variability and change of climate and the atmospheric environment were conducted by some countries through bilateral and multilateral support and as part of the UNEP-implemented World Climate Impact and Response Strategies Programme concerning areas both within and outside their national jurisdiction , including studies of vulnerability to sealevel rise , effects on agriculture , forests and other sensitive and important sectors , either as single or regional group efforts .  
According to some scenarios , sustainable biomass energy has the potential to become the largest single source of energy globally , providing from 17 per cent to 35 per cent of the total demand for primary energy in 2050 if sustainability policies are adopted and technological advances achieved in the production of liquid , solid and gaseous fuels from biomass , based on the use of fast-growing species , soil-water species relationships , new harvesting and conversion techniques or the application of genetically engineered bacteria .  
Forest decline is defined in this overview as an episodic event characterized by premature , progressive loss of tree and stand vigour and health over a given period without obvious evidence of a single clearly identifiable causal factor such as a physical disturbance or an attack by an aggressive disease or insect .  
Recognizing also that there is no single political system or single universal model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples , and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
It was not really possible to develop a special legal status applicable to all the objects and systems concerned , because of their great dissimilarities ; it was more realistic to choose a legal status based on certain aspects , such as the capability of the aerospace object to travel through outer space and to remain in airspace for a certain period of time , and the technical design and nature of the object or system , for example whether it was single - or multi-staged , piloted or unpiloted , and launched vertically or horizontally .  
Part of the problem for the international community in trying to deal with organized transnational crime is that there is no single organizational or behavioural paradigm that provides a constant and accessible target .  
Argentina hopes that the members of the international community will deploy the necessary efforts and resources to make it possible , within a reasonable time , to embody in a general convention the political commitments of countries to combat this form of crime and to ensure mutual cooperation to that end .  The conclusion of a general convention would afford the international community a single , efficient and effective instrument for responding suitably to the activities and manifestations of organized transnational crime .  
Indeed , the alternative to the " cumbersome procedure " proposed in the Seventh report is represented either by unilateral and possibly arbitrary action by single , allegedly injured , States or groups thereof , or by merely political decisions by a political body and the action it may authorize .  
As the umbrella term children and youth in especially difficult circumstances covers a wide range of disparate target groups , it is evident that no single strategy will be effective in preventing or responding to the problems of substance abuse to which they are exposed .  
During the visit , I was able to meet with the local political leadership and express support for those who seek to implement the Peace Agreement and its vision of a single multi-ethnic country , two entities peacefully coexisting and elections that are free and fair .  
Regional development and global changes included published studies on the impact of the single European market on ESCWA countries ; privatization in the Gulf countries and in Arab countries with more diversified economies ; and on industrial strategies in the ESCWA region within a changing international and regional environment .

Keeping open the availability of additional alternative corridors for transit in an uncertain world , even at some cost , as compared with putting more resources into expanding the current most efficient single route , may be the most effective long-term investment and best insurance " policy " for landlocked countries .  
The continuing convenience of these traditional rail connections stems from the fact that the Central Asian rail lines had been part of the single rail system of the former Soviet Union ( which , in many operating respects , such as scheduling of through trains and the setting of tariffs , continues to function as a coordinated system ) and the fact that the use of some alternative routes has been constricted because of political unrest and because other newer options are only beginning to come on line .  
Likewise , it is essential to study , starting now , all the necessary modalities for resuming development aid once peace , national reconciliation , democracy and strict respect for human rights have become established and have finally triumphed , both in the thinking and in the conduct of all the citizens of Burundi , who will finally be brought together and will coalesce into a single , unified nation .  
A call for harmonization and uniformity was first expressed in Council resolution 1743 ( LIV ) of 4 May 1973 , in which the Council , mindful of the increase of unitization and containerization of cargoes as part of total world transportation , invited " international organizations concerned to foster the adoption of a single system of identification , classification and labelling of dangerous goods " and requested the Committee to continue to investigate divergencies currently existing in the modal practices in that respect .  
The strengthening of the private sector 's role in the development process and in the creation of jobs has been accompanied by an investment promotion policy focused on a recasting of the Investment Codes into a single , better adapted and more flexible Code covering all economic sectors and the financial and fiscal reforms .  
By 1973 the time had come to codify these various instruments in a single convention , Convention No . 138 concerning Minimum Age for Admission to Employment , which is general in scope and obliges States to pursue a national policy designed to secure the effective abolition of child labour and progressively to raise the minimum age for admission to employment to a level enabling young people to attain the fullest possible physical and mental development . 
The chairpersons further recommend that consideration be given to more creative approaches whereby several of the various procedural amendments to the human rights treaties could be packaged together in a single , comprehensive document to be transmitted to the States parties to allow them the option of invoking their constitutional amendment procedures only once for all the amendments .  
Brazil stressed that , since the country has a federal structure with states and municipalities endowed with autonomy as far as the organization of the educational system is concerned , it would not be appropriate to establish a single focal point at the federal level to deal with school and university teaching .  
The Committee is particularly concerned at the insufficient measures and programmes for the protection of the rights of the most vulnerable children , especially girls , children living in rural areas , children who are victims of abuse , children of single parents , children born out of wedlock , abandoned children , disabled children , and children who are , in order to survive , forced to live and / or work in the streets .

Further , the precise content of the freedom of transit has in each single case to be agreed upon by the transit State and the landlocked State concerned , and in the absence of agreement concerning the terms and modalities for exercising the right of access of persons and goods , transit through the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany is regulated only by national law , in particular with regard to ways and means of transport and the use of traffic infrastructure .  
The international community should take a single , firm and unwavering stand against mercenary activities , avoiding a contradiction between statements formally condemning mercenaries and concessions made in practice to efficient services performed by individuals or companies with a mercenary past that were currently engaged in suspicious activities .  
The Heads of State called for the all-round development of trade and economic cooperation among the Turkish-speaking countries , the expansion of economic ties at various levels , the promotion of economic integration processes , the elimination of obstacles to joint trade and the establishment of a favourable legal regime for individuals and legal entities engaging in economic cooperation in order to create a single market for goods , services , capital and labour , without prejudice to their international obligations .  
The Covenant , which was considered by many to be the single most important human rights instrument , codified the essential freedoms which people must enjoy in an effective democratic society , such as the right to vote and to participate in government , to freedom of peaceful assembly , to equal protection of the law , the right to liberty and security and to freedom of opinion and expression .  
The European Union is convinced that the role of the United Nations in the field of development activities would be substantially strengthened if the three secretariat departments with responsibilities in this area were to be merged under the authority of a single Under-Secretary-General responsible for policy formulation and coordination in the fields of sustainable development and economic cooperation , while coherence and coordination of operational activities should also be appropriately enhanced through the strengthening of the relevant secretariat function .  
The implementation of those recommendations , which included the creation of a national civil register responsible for issuing a single identity and voter card , the introduction of residential voting , and the introduction of proportional representation in the municipal councils , would constitute a significant advance in El Salvador 's electoral system . 
A single , integrated international database containing extensive basic statistics and indicators covering a wide range of topics in these fields is being developed for wide dissemination pending the provision of extrabudgetary support .  
Convinced that education and public information activities in the field of human rights were prerequisites for the full and effective enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the three main sponsors , Australia , Costa Rica and Namibia , had decided to draft a single text combining two previous General Assembly resolutions on that issue . 
However , since special arrangements regulating the diversity of such objects do not exist in the applicable international law and considering probable future technological developments in this area , a single and unified regime does not seem legally necessary at this stage .  
In that connection , bearing in mind that the draft Code and the international criminal court would form part of a single international legal regime , he hoped that the court 's statute would provide more specific guidance on issues which were not clearly defined in , or omitted from , the draft Code .  
At the same time , the Panel acknowledged that at present no single multilateral body , organization or instrument has either a mandate or the capacity to address , in a balanced , [ integrated ] [ holistic ] and mutually reinforcing way , all forest-related issues currently on the international agenda on sustainable forest management .  
Europe possesses what is essential for achieving this - a space with a single world-view extending from Vancouver to Vladivostok , where the bipolar world no longer exists and a common value system based on the philosophy of democratic liberalism and respect for human rights is being established . 
This Declaration reflected the central goals of a common , comprehensive , indivisible security zone free from demarcation lines ; security ; cooperation between the OSCE and other international organizations to achieve these goals ; recognition that no single organization , State or group can bear the predominant responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and stability in the OSCE region ; and recognition of the importance of States complying with their obligations regarding national minorities .  
Taking full advantage of historical affinities , cultural ties and religious bonds and sparing no effort to utilize in an efficient and coordinated manner the human and natural potential and resources of the region constitute the single best long-term guarantee of security and tranquillity .  
Although there are numerous examples of good practices by business and industry , the number of companies that are making strides in becoming sustainable development enterprises is small relative to the global total , a disappointing trend given that business and industry is the single most dominant factor influencing the direction of investments and financial flows , as well as the type of products produced and the processes with which they are made . 
Recalling General Assembly resolution 45 / 179 of 21 December 1990 , by which the Assembly established the United Nations International Drug Control Programme as the single body with the exclusive responsibility for coordinating all drug control activities within the United Nations system and for providing effective leadership in promoting international cooperation in drug control , thereby producing a catalytic impact on other international and national bodies ,  
He agreed that there should not be a single legal definition of indigenous peoples at the international level at this time , although a definition might be required at the national level .  
It is becoming difficult for a single firm to muster all the resources required to be innovative and competitive in the global markets , and firms are therefore aligning themselves with others , including competitors , with complementary capabilities or resources . 
An expert involved in the Uganda Connect project pointed to a highly original way of overcoming existing limitations through the use of donated older PCs which are linked up through a hybrid technology using VHF single side band radio communications .  
The proposed draft declaration deals not with some sort of single concrete mechanism for preventing and settling conflicts , but rather with the total number of such mechanisms , of course , while maintaining the specific characteristics of each of them , and with the formulation of the fundamental basic principles and criteria for their establishment and functioning , while retaining the main responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security .  
Such enhanced and diverse contributions , in the framework of a world consensus , could spare the international community any accusation of negligence , double standards or bias towards a single cultural concept .  
The programme of the workshop covered four main topics : conceptual issues of poverty in old age ; women as one of the groups at risk , and the process known as the feminization of poverty ; specific issues of poverty among other groups at risk ; disabled and single persons ; and ways to create an enabling environment for the improved well-being of older people .  
Despite promises by senior officials that they would furnish to the Special Rapporteur evidence that the State addressed cases of abuse of power and unlawful conduct on the part of its officials , he never received any proof of a single investigation or administrative or criminal proceeding against an official responsible for abuse of power or any other offence .

Forms of international cooperation which will make a worthwhile contribution during the initial stages are the exchange of space data and the joint elaboration of international projects aimed at coordinating national space resources within a single comprehensive international remote sensing system .  
Housing , being the most important single investment in the life of the majority of the world 's population , should not be considered only in its aspect of physical shelter , but should be given full consideration as the most important element of family life where all social , economic , cultural and political activities begin and are sustained .  
Based on a peoples own efforts , the strategy of rapid economic and social progress can not be deduced from single models or rigid formulas : it must be drawn up in the light of national conditions and characteristics and necessitates a commitment on the part of each State and the cooperation of all States .  
In order to achieve this , the foundation for a single normative legal basis is to be laid by the end of 1997 , chiefly by developing general norms as well as unifying civil and customs codes and simultaneously introducing common taxation legislation .

Finally , the United States pointed out that , although it was engaged in a continuous process of seeking and establishing , whenever possible , more effective bilateral and multilateral means of combating all forms of organized transnational crime , it agreed that the time had come to give serious consideration to the elaboration of a single new international convention in that area .  
As a single united Government of Angola takes up the daunting task of providing all Angolans with the political stability and economic development which they have so long awaited , it is our sincerest hope that a successful transition to democratic pluralism will replace , once and for all , the violence and mistrust which have historically marked relations between the Government and UNITA .  
The current issues are concerned with choices between a cost-plus regime ( typified by many United States utilities ) or a price cap ( typified by the RPI-X formula started in the United Kingdom ) ; between a single regulator , a regulatory board , or sectoral regulatory agencies ; whether to break up a national monopoly into regional monopolies ; the rate at which competitors should be licensed , bearing in mind the need for the incumbent enterprise to finance major expansion as far as possible from internally generated surpluses ; etc .  
Databases on contraceptive use ; fertility levels and trends ; mortality ; international migration ; world population ; demographic indicators ; sex and age in five year groups ; populations ; sex and age in single years ; age patterns of fertility ; urban and rural areas ; urban agglomerations ; global review and inventory of population policies ; and population , resources , environment and development ; ( iv ) Information materials and services .  
This was done for practical reasons , including a desire to allow the Ministry a high degree of flexibility in securing numerous and diverse offers from a variety of sources , at competitive prices and on the customary commercial terms , and in order to avoid being restricted to a single brand name under which all our requirements for a particular item might not be available within the period the Memorandum of Understanding is in effect .  
Disaggregated data and appropriate indicators seem to be lacking to assess the situation of children , especially those who are victims of abuse , ill _ treatment or child labour or are involved with the administration of juvenile justice , as well as refugee and internally displaced children , children of single _ parent families , children in rural and remote areas , abandoned , institutionalized and disabled children , and children who are living and / or working on the street .  
The international community , by redirecting its focus to sustainable development , would be able to overcome the false dichotomy between economic , social and environmental measures and instead view such measures as integral parts of a single whole .  
First , the new and equitable global partnership must be based on equality and recognize that there was no single model for development that was universally applicable ; since the world was characterized by diversity , there must be respect for the economic and social development model chosen by each country and any attempt to use aid as a leverage for exerting political pressure must be abandoned .  
When the provision of such vital services as telecommunications , electricity supply , railways , freight transport , fuel distribution and so forth are acquired by private owners , whether through the acquisition of a State monopoly by a single large private corporation or through a widely distributed share ownership , it is appropriate that the Government set up an independent and effective regulatory body to look after consumer interests and wider national and environmental concerns .  
Similarly , the Department 's publication , Image &amp; amp ; Reality , the single publication devoted to help correct common misconceptions about the United Nations , has been thoroughly revised to counter criticisms about the Organization , both in specific areas such as peacekeeping and more generally as part of current debate over reform .  
To begin with , as international firms begin to operate in the world economy as if it were a single market and production space , the issue of competitive markets is now being posed in terms of the " contestability " of markets , i.e . not only actual trade competition in goods and services , but also potential competition resulting from the establishment of foreign firms through direct investment .  
In Eritrea , foreign nationals , whatever their origin , were treated justly , in accordance with the law and their human rights were respected ; there had not been a single incident involving ethnic or national minorities in the seven years since independence .  
In a perfect world , it would be desirable to negotiate a single treaty which addressed both future production of fissile material , as well as existing stockpiles .

While the Covenant represents the most comprehensive single global legal instrument on economic , social and cultural rights , such rights are contained in many other international , regional or national instruments .  
UNPF implemented a complicated and time-consuming exercise of converting multiple inventory databases , supported by individual asset managers , into a single , unified mission-wide inventory database based on the REALITY systems fixed assets module .  
An FMCT is , strictly speaking , not in itself an instrument of disarmament since no single warhead will be dismantled because of it , and the quantity of fissile material available for nuclear arms will be frozen at its current level .  
The existence of common historical , political , economic and cultural and humanitarian links with countries which in the past formed a single whole necessitates the maintenance and development of relations through bilateral and multilateral cooperation .  
Pensioners and invalids receive monetary benefits , housing and communal services on advantageous terms , and free travel on urban overground electrically powered public transport , all as part of a single package .  
For that reason , my delegation believes that we must reflect the cultural , social and religious diversity of all countries as we strive to attain realistic and objective social development , without imposing a single model on everyone . 
In 19961998 its programme goals included Furthering the vision of the founders to advance the status of women , in all of its dimensions , including human rights , health issues and internationalism / multiculturalism ; and promoting a unified purpose and direction to ensure that Zonta International remains an international organization by addressing global concerns and issues with a single voice and a combined effort .  
When human rights are used to advance one single political agenda while the rights of countless others are ignored , human rights are denigrated , becoming a political instrument of narrow interests instead of a universal standard for the protection of all humanity .  
The view was expressed that , while the scientific principles formulated in the working paper submitted by the Czech Republic were acceptable , a comprehensive analysis of the legal aspects , as well as the scientific and technical aspects , of the geostationary orbit in one single document was required , taking into consideration the regulations of ITU , as the examination of those issues should not be approached in a piecemeal manner .  
The Committee remains concerned , however , at the large and increasing number of single _ parent families as well as the high number of abandoned children , especially children born out of wedlock , children of poor families , and children whose parents have left the country in search of economic opportunities .  
Even the initial analysis of the recommendations and proposals made by several United Nations bodies and mechanisms active in the field of human rights makes it possible to single out a number of major themes that could be considered by the World Conference with a view to formulating recommendations for the adoption of additional measures to combat racism at the national , regional and international levels .  
The Special Rapporteur is encouraged to note the passage of the Domestic Violence Act of 1995 , which includes provision for : a new single protection order ; a broadening of the definition of domestic violence to include psychological abuse ; increased penalties for breaches of protection orders ; free legal aid with respect to protection orders ; and new guidelines to ensure the arrest of violent abusers and the automatic revocation of firearms licences .  
We are all aware that it is not easy to combine differing viewpoints in a single package , but when we recall the current nuclear arms race and the massive stockpiles of nuclear arsenals with all the dangers that they entail , this should induce us to appeal to the international forums specialized in the field of disarmament to place this issue on their list of priorities and to apply its criteria thereto in a comprehensive manner and without any exception .  
The view was expressed that , while the scientific principles formulated in the working paper submitted by the Czech Republic were acceptable , a comprehensive analysis of the legal aspects , as well as the scientific and technical aspects , of the geostationary orbit in one single document was required , taking into consideration the regulations of ITU , as the examination of those issues should not be approached in a piecemeal manner .  
In the case of TCDC programmes initiated or coordinated by the Special Unit or by other bodies of the United Nations system , the involvement of multiple players in single TCDC interventions , which has now become common practice , would seem to indicate that the system is successfully adopting the mandate set out in the new directions strategy - i.e . , that TCDC activities should be designed to have the maximum impact on a large number of developing countries .  
Recognizing also that there is no single political system or single universal model of democracy equally suited to all nations and their peoples and that political systems and the electoral processes which guarantee the establishment of democratic governments are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
Every political and popular capability will be mobilized in order to protect Palestinian land , the Palestinian people and Palestinian rights , sustained by national unity and the just and legitimate struggle to reach the single national goal of ending the occupation , exercising self-determination , establishing the State and resolving the issue of the refugees , pursuant to General Assembly resolution 194 ( III ) and the resolutions of international legitimacy . 
Following current practice in cases of loss or damage resulting from a single hostile action or forced abandonment , the United Nations will assume liability for each and every item of major equipment when the collective generic fair market value equals or exceeds the threshold value of $ 250,000 .  
In paragraph 10 of its report ( A / 52 / 410 ) , the Advisory Committee stated that it had been informed that annex B , section 6 , Loss or damage , paragraph 18 , of the contribution agreement would read as follows : In cases of loss or damage resulting from a single hostile action or forced abandonment , the United Nations will assume liability for each and every item of major equipment when the collective generic fair market value equals or exceeds the threshold value of $ 250,000 .  
In fact , it is quite the contrary : the fate of the Kosovars has become entirely incidental , and the humanitarian banner is being used as a cover for NATO 's attempts to destroy the present world order , which is based on respect for international law and for the Charter of the United Nations . This , in fact , is the big picture , not the fact that one single person is responsible for all of this . 
The combination of a major issue , such as biotechnology , and a minor theme , such as agriculture , had proved an effective way of approaching a single field of activity from multiple and complimentary perspectives , and the Commission might like to take a similar approach to the development of a work programme for the next inter-sessional period .  
Small island developing States are threatened to a similar degree , but due to their physical isolation and limited economic base are often dependent on a single industry , such as tourism .  
The Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that to link the determination of the original legal status of indigenous peoples as nations ( in the contemporary sense of international law ) or as non-nations to the single factor of whether or not they have formalized relations with non-indigenous colonizing powers , is faulty .  
Space environmental exploration and research has been carried out on energy electrons , protons , heavy ions and their single particle effects , radiation dosage effects , space thermal plasma , upper atmospheric density and components and solar energy electromagnetic radiation .  
A number of functional commissions did not concur with proposals , contained , inter alia , in the 1998 consolidated report ( E / 1999 / 3 ) that certain topics , such as gender equality and human rights , should be addressed exclusively by the single functional commission which has the primary responsibility for the subject matter , in particular in the context of implementation and follow-up to a major conference .

Features such as balconies , sky gardens , wider corridors , utility platforms , mail rooms , elevated landscape decks , internal electric powered shuttle service and seawater cooling for major air-conditioning system are proposed .  
Generally speaking , other than in some circumstances ( where , for example , the suppliers concerned in a single or restricted tender have not yet joined ETS ) , all GSD-originated tenders for supply of goods not exceeding HK $ 10 million in value are promulgated concurrently through the ETS and in the traditional paper format .  
The funded projects cover a wide spectrum including research into real-time bilateral teleoperation of internet based robotic systems , economic reforms and labour market transitions in urban China , studies on dendritic cell functions in chronic Chinese Hepatitis B patients , high performance non-lead piezoelectric single crystal materials , interactions of trace metals and macronutrients in marine plankton , etc .  
" Even though the tenancy between the single operators and the licensees is a commercial matter between the two , the Housing Authority has , in the light of the experience in the 1998 rent re-assessment , considered that it could take a more proactive approach to ensure that the rent reductions granted to the single operators after the rent re-assessment would be passed on to the licensees in full .  This would help the licensees through the current economic hard times , " Ms Chung said in her letter .  
" At present , about two-thirds of the HA 's domestic tenants , or some 400,000 households , pay monthly rents of below $ 1,500 .  The lowest rental - for an interim housing flat - is a mere $ 241 per month .  The highest single rental of $ 3,810 is in respect of a public rental flat converted from an Home Ownership Scheme ( HOS ) flat of over 60 square metres including a master suite and other HOS facilities .  
As for the construction and engineering contracts , a major reason for single tendering was to avoid technical problems or contractual disputes that might arise from the employment of different contractors on the works .  Another main reason was that the works required were of extreme urgency : for example , the works had to be completed before the typhoon or rain season ; open tendering in these circumstances would delay the works and prejudice public or security interests .  
After braving 800 miles through the world 's worst seas for 17 days , they miraculously arrived on the uninhabited south coast of South Georgia . However , they had to cross over the glaciers and mountains to reach the rescue station on the other side .  In 1916 , Shackleton returned to rescue the men on Elephant Island . After isolated for nearly two years in the barren and frigid Antarctic , no single one member of the 28-man crew was lost .  
Extra convenience will be provided for public housing tenants living in Harmony Blocks as the Housing Department allows an additional location for the installation of laundry racks .  Starting from August 15 , tenants may apply to erect a drying rack , at their own expenses , at a designated position to the external wall outside the living room .  They have a choice of a single or double stainless steel rods or nylon ropes .  
( d ) of the measures ( such as punitive measures ) adopted by HD , apart from assessing the performance of single operators and not renewing the tenancy agreements with those who have failed to meet the required performance standard , to ensure that the quality of services provided by single operators during their agreement period is up to HD 's prescribed standard ?  
" Project beneficiaries include those who are homeless , people displaced and living in interim housing estates , youth with limited life skills or work options , single parents , new arrivals , the unskilled and unemployed , people with disabilities and elders who have retired early or in need of community-care . "  
The direct income based taxation system in Hong Kong consists of three individual taxes , Property Tax , Salaries Tax and Profits Tax , each of which is separately assessed independently of the others .  Only Salaries Tax carries an entitlement to deduct personal allowances and to be charged at progressive rates of tax ; the other taxes are charged at a fixed single rate of tax with no deductions for personal allowances .  
About half a year ago , the National Science Council established a Taipei regional analytical instrument center and purchased a single crystal diffractometer for the measurement of molecular structure .  
His first major task became road development . In order to fund the enormous task , Mayor Shu sought a loan from the provincial government . As the standard yearly appropriation for all public construction throughout the island is US $ 72,500,000 , officials of the provincial government were astounded when Mayor Shu requested five times that amount for a single city .  
It involves many complicated factors and to single out one country as the culprit is unfair . Many companies feel they are the victims says one official from the Ministry of Economic Affairs , but the real damage is done to the country as a whole . The goal of economic upgrading and technological progress will be thwarted if this belief persists .  
This so-called " domain of single subjectivity " refers to the main characteristic that in traditional Chinese history social , economic , academic , cultural , and artistic activities as subjectivities were deeply influenced by political activity as subjectivity .  
I sat motionless in the floral room , quietly gazing at the orchids , like a Taoist adept in ancient times peering at the heavens . Although the entire room had but this single lovely star , I felt as though I had been transported to the midst of a star-filled sky .  
In fact , flowers or " sacrifices , " aside from differences in religious connotation , both contain a single heartfelt meaning . And using animals as offerings has been known in both east and west ; in China , they also carry thousands of years of unbroken tradition and symbolic meaning .  
The sky ca n't be reached in a single bound though , as the Chinese expression goes . For Taiwan to develop a satellite will be like a child learning to cook , watching and observing first and then starting out slowly with some simple dishes . The dishes may not look like much , but they can lay the foundation for more elaborate ones later . (  
In this flourishing market the real estate companies often inflated prices even within a single day , producing a stampede of buyers anxious not to lose out and sending house prices skyrocketing to almost double their previous level .  
Those who finished high in the number of interpellations expressed satisfaction that their daily diligence at pursuing public policy is finally laid out for the public . Others are busy trying to defend themselves , patiently explaining to reporters why their numbers of interpellations are so low , or so biased in content toward a single side .  
These lions are fine statuary , and despite weathering caused by exposure to the European climate the sculptor 's verve is still evident . As I look upon their worn and pitted surfaces I often wonder what the sculptor must have felt as he wielded the mallet in some gloomy atelier , his youth slowly turning to old age as his life and work blended into a single whole , free of all regret .  
One major reason is that these diseases - - ulcers , high blood pressure , heart and arterial disease , and so on - - are not acute illnesses brought on by a single cause , as many past epidemic diseases were , but are chronic illnesses brought on by numerous factors , so it is relatively hard to clarify cause and effect relationships .  
Five years ago , a major battle was fought in the media between the natural ecology and communications construction . The result was that the " egg " ( the environment ) defeated the " stone . " The New Central Cross-Island Highway had originally been planned to cut across the Central Mountain Range to Yuli in Hualien . But because Yushan National Park was " a single man able to hold a narrow mountain pass against an army , " the plan was shrunk so that the road became the park 's " scenic highway . "  
But in more than a few ways , cab drivers are also the object of criticism - - for refusing to ride short distances , for finding the longest distance between two points , for illegally raising fares during rush hour , for acting rudely , etc . And because it is easy for undesirables to become drivers , as public security has deteriorated , illegal behavior by a few drivers has tarnished the image of the industry . As the Chinese expression goes , " A single mouse dropping ruins the pot of congee . "  
For example , the Tun Hwa Radio fleet , the first to make use of radio communication , was established three years ago as a pilot project of the Institute of Transportation of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications . It upholds a policy of hiring only drivers of outstanding moral character and of employing not a single driver with a bad record so that passengers can feel at ease about riding a cab at any hour .  
Heavy on Public Opinion : In the 1985 Taipei City Council election , his vote total was high enough to elect four city councilmen [ Taiwan uses a multiple member single vote system ] . In the 1986 Legislative Yuan election , he was elected with 140,000 votes , highest in his district . In repeated electoral victories , he has overwhelmingly won over voters .  
" The system of agents has long been in place abroad , and is the long-term trend , " explains Luc Kwanten . For people overseas who have the publishing rights , dealing with a single agent saves a great deal of trouble over negotiating with individual publishers whose operating situations are unclear . For the domestic publishing industry , going through an agency saves even more in expenses than setting up your own publishing rights department or hiring specially trained negotiators . "  
Shih Tsui-feng feels that , apart from the fortunate few who have their own homes , most modern urbanites are hard put to share their cramped living spaces with the traditional New Year 's couplets , but he says , " Still , even if it 's just a single character , such as ' Spring ' or ' good fortune ' - - hung upside down - - it 's always nice to hang something that adds a little holiday spirit and traditional flavor to the season . "  
One unmarried social worker is worried that if she marries , it will affect her current employment . Another is worried about the problem of educating her children in the future , and keeps putting off getting married . Yet another , a single woman who owns an interior design business , quite frankly sticks to a philosophy of remaining single as a way to reduce the responsibilities of housework , " states the Cheng-Liao study .  
The ancestral home , in use for four generations , was thus levelled overnight . For the older generation who are accustomed to living in the ho-yuan , there are psychological obstacles in making the leap into a tall building in a single bound .  
" One shovelful could fill a tin can . " Today vast stretches of land have been developed , and pesticides have been badly overused in cultivated areas . Earthworms are highly vulnerable to sudden acute poisoning , " so that in many hectares of farmland , you could n't find a single worm , " says Huang , who worked hard with Kuo looking for the creatures in agricultural areas in Hsinchu .  
Alliance case study number four - - palmtop computers . Although the main trend for the future seems to be small , specialized R &amp; D centers belonging exclusively to a single industry , the Industrial Technology Research Institute - - which has been in a league by itself for the past nineteen years and has accumulated countless resources - - is still the center of attention .  
Climbing up onto an observation platform at the farm , banana trees are lined up in meticulous ranks one after another in the square and regular groves . More unusual is that each and every tree is upright and green , with hardly a single withered leaf to be found .  
Different in thinking but not in status : Wildlife protection groups around the world today generally come in two kinds : One takes radical action to support the total prohibition of trade in endangered species ; the other believes that wildlife protection can not be accomplished in a single step and tries to study and gain an understanding of local conditions and works with local agencies or scholars in order to carry out long-term , systematic protection .  
It seems that Taichung has now become the " great grey mullet harbor . " This is also related to the fact that the cold fronts have not been able to come further southward . Improvements in fishing gear over the past few years , such as two boats cooperating to create a single large trap , increasing the horsepower of fishing boat motors , and improvements in two-way radios , have enabled the work of catching the fish in winter , unattainable in recent years , to go along swimmingly in the warmer weather .  
Since people 's environments ( both natural and social ) are extremely variegated and complex , preventing people from having firsthand knowledge of all of the people , matters and things in the world , sociologists have theorized that people by necessity simplify things , making people who share one characteristic - - such as old people or poor people conform to a single mold .  
Liang Chia-chen , a commercial secretary in the Ministry of Economic Affairs currently assigned to Belgium , is a female " single noble . " She does n't hide the fact that she 's never been very serious about getting married precisely because it might affect her chances of foreign assignments in the future .  
Environmental environment needs upgrading : Environmentally friendly products are the wave of the future . For example , Acer , which already has a sound foundation in Germany and Holland , in order to meet European environmental regulations , began a year and a half ago to offer a personal computer which " does n't use a single screw , " but is fit together out of molded parts .  
The attacking force goes straight down to the foot of the dike . Add to this that there is a pulling effect when the waves retreat , so-called " backwash " , says Lin Yung-teh . Given the iron law that the force of the waves can not be reduced , although the dikes will not be smashed in a single blow , they can not stand up against the continual digging away of the soft sand under their feet over a long period of time .  
The institution Mr . Chen worked for was a unit dealing with foreign affairs . During the six years of his employment there , he had many opportunities to be stationed abroad , but not once did he take so much as a single step outside the country . Always remembering that he was the only male in the third generation of his extended family , every week he returned to the family ' s home several times to help his paraplegic grandfather bathe . Such traditional filial responsibilities were his to shoulder .  
Liu Kuang-ming says that although the problem is complex , it is not inevitable that the day will come when fishermen are banned from having even a single shark in their nets . Instead , it would be better if , after surveys , endangered sharks ' breeding grounds can be protected , the amount of shark to be caught each year can be limited , or a set of practical measures can be devised as early as possible for the use of sharks .  
This in turn drew on the neoclassical style that appeared in Europe in the mid-18th century . That style emphasized " reason " and rationality , which designers of the period found embodied in the nearly pure geometric shapes of classical architecture . This trend , combined with the cultural exchange that came from colonial expansionism and the rise of archaeology as a field of study , produced new structures in Europe that incorporated a number of classical themes into a single building .  
After being returned to China , Taiwan was kept apart and given a special status because the mainland had not returned to a state of normalcy . Administration was placed in the hands of a single " hsing-cheng chang-kuan " appointed by the central government . This term is generally rendered into English as " governor , " but its literal translation is " chief executive official . " Meanwhile , other aspects of life in Taiwan - - such as the currency , rationing , and so on - - were also different from the mainland .  
To be sure , there is not a single naturalist writer who has not expressed great anguish at the rapid destruction of Taiwan 's environment . In fact , the entire field of naturalist literature has carried the responsibility of raising the environmental consciousness of Taiwan 's residents , and has therefore never been pure literary description .  
The Ministry of Education , which has jurisdiction over sunken ships , argues that Huang has always been trying to get commissioned to do the work of recovering the artifacts . However , due to academic considerations , the Ministry can not sign a contract with a single individual . Thus plans for exploring and salvaging the ships have been delayed for eight years .  
Wang Yi-ju , the National Taiwan Normal University Institute of Environmental Education , who chose stray dogs as the subject for her master 's thesis , notes that none of Taiwan 's elementary school text books mention how to care for dogs , with the exception of a single essay by the writer Lin Liang on the warm feelings between him and his pet . No text book explains to children that raising dogs requires a number of conditions , including sufficient space and a responsible commitment to the dog .  
Ten years ago , a number of Southeast Asian women were brought to this traditional Hakka community to look for partners among the local widowers and single men , but less than ten of them married and settled in the area , and " foreign brides " remained a rarity . Later , the practice was stopped from catching on when the government began to restrict the entry of single women from Southeast Asia on tourist visas .  
He adds : " In fact , looking at our jade collection alone is like entering a 7000-year time tunnel . " Private treasuresFrom the jade totems of the Shang and Yin dynasties to the ritual jade of the Zhou dynasty and the burial jade of the Han , and on through to the ornamental jade and " ingeniously carved jade " - - such as the Chinese cabbage carved from a single piece of green and white jadeite - - of the Ming and Qing dynasties , the Chinese have always treasured jade above all else .  
A : I think we should avoid a proliferation of so - called " international " productions which try to attract a poorly defined audience , and to sign themselves up for a round of " patchwork " festivals . I believe we should present the public with a more coherent series of performances from a single country or a group of countries , which relate the history of that region 's performing arts , ranging from traditional forms ( folk ) to classical cultures , up to and including modern or contemporary forms .  
This is particularly because the marriage market has subtle self-regulating abilities : not only is there flexibility in the age at which people marry , but with today 's increasing numbers of divorced , remarried and single people , marriage has broken away from its traditional form , and concern that future Adams will find no Eve seems unnecessary .  
In the US , for example , residential and agricultural areas are clearly separate , and huge areas of agricultural land are often devoted to a single crop , so it is easy to differentiate the objects in the satellite image .  
Often many different crops are planted in a single small area ; small towns and large urban areas are not clearly defined and often are mixed together ; and there are rapid changes in construction . These make it difficult to interpret satellite images .  
In regard to this problem , Paolaban believes that each indigenous group has its own distinct naming method ; recovering the names is not the action of individuals , but should be based on information from a detailed survey . From common discussions among the nine groups and linguistic scholars , a single universal system should be derived .  
Paul Perng says it used to be thought that clear targets were needed to bring about ecological protection , and so preservation areas were created for specific animals , such as the clouded leopard or panda . But in the future nature reserves wo n't be devoted to a single rare species but rather will be aimed at protecting the greatest diversity of ecology . Even areas that appear to contain nothing special but are nonetheless ecologically important will require protection .  
Liu explains , " China 's court music was the music and dance extolled by Confucianists . Confucius combined rites , music , dance , poetry , and song into a coherent whole , creating a single integrated set of rules for proper ritual and decorum . " For instance , there were rules stipulating what dance the emperor was to use when worshipping Heaven , or what music was to be played for an imperial inspection tour . The fundamental principle was to create a harmonious society through cultivation of character and delineation of status .  
The clock tower 's main structure comprised three levels . The upper level bore an armillary sphere , used for astronomical observations ; on the middle level was a celestial globe , which displayed the movements of celestial bodies ; while on the bottom level were wooden mannikins which struck the time of day . The whole formed " a single mechanism , turned by the power of water , without human effort . "  
Grass huts offer people numerous advantages-they are convenient , flexible , simple , and can be made entirely from materials readily at hand . Li Juei-tsung , an associate professor of architecture and environmental design at the Chung-Hua Polytechnic Institute , suggests , " Thatched houses are the single greatest expression of the culture of ordinary people , and they are one of the great creative products of man and nature . It 's too bad they have been ignored in architectural history . "  
In 1980 , when the North Link Railway was completed , this stretch of track , essential for connecting the east and west coast main lines , became even more important . The single track was turned into a double track , and many of the old single-track tunnels were taken out of service . Now they are objects of our explorations .  
In The Competitive Advantage of Nations , published in 1990 , Porter advanced the now famous " Porter 's Diamond , " a four-sided framework in which the vague concept of competitive advantage is turned into something clear and concrete . From organizations as small as a single company to those as large as a nation , the basic forces at work in shaping competitive advantage are herein clearly exposed .  
In 1973 , it was generally agreed that jurisdiction over the media should be unified in a single agency . So the Executive Yuan took publication industry affairs from the Ministry of the Interior , and film and broadcast affairs out of the Bureau of Education and Culture , and moved both to the GIO . The GIO doubled in size overnight , assuming its current structure of six departments and three divisions .  
" When the old songs are no longer adequate to evoke a particular emotion , then there 's no choice but to write new pieces , " avers Ho Lo administrative director Ko Ming-feng , who plays sanxian and yueqin ( both guitar-like instruments ) . He points out , for example , how in one case a new style was produced by combining the high-pitched singing of Beiguan with the rapid single drumming of a Peking opera song to sing a genteel duma-style melody ( one of the characteristic Taiwanese opera styles ) .  
Liao Yu-hui suggested that the feelings of being married are something that single people can not really understand . She really loves that feeling of having to think of the other person before doing anything . You Hsia , on the other hand , averred that intimate relations between married couples today ought to be similar to a black-and-white yin-yang circle ; they make up a single , coherent picture , but with the black and white very clearly distinguished , each keeping their own character , and not mixing together into one gray field .  
The traditional dress of India is the " sari , " a single sheet of cloth made into a skirt that goes to the ground ; it is both mysterious and graceful . The Philippines , using locally produced palmetto cloth , has crocheted and embroidered shirts . Indonesian " batik , " wax-dyed or hand-dyed , is cool and comfortable ; a sarong around the waist with a short jacket open in the front is comfortable and beautiful .  
Chinese ink painting , on the other hand , approaches the canvas from a kind of " shifting " vantage point . Layer upon layer of mountain ridges overlap across the painting , a thatched hut enclosed by a bamboo fence rests at the mountain base , and a river runs along the summit , flowing off into the distance . Questions of height and distance are irrelevant ; everything seems to be encompassed by a single perspective . Even variations in size or brightness of lighting are lacking .  
Two years ago , the special education center at National Taiwan Normal University conducted a survey of Taiwanese firms which made the above bias all too clear . The results indicated that bosses were most willing to hire handicapped persons whose disability involved their arms or legs . The next most " popular " were the hearing impaired , followed by the mentally retarded . Visually-impaired persons did not make a single boss ' list .  
In one media report , a doctor was quoted as saying : " It has been discovered that if women who have been single for a long time have introverted personalities , and are self-absorbed , their emotional life often becomes very bizarre . As they repress their sexual desires , their hormone secretions fall out of balance , and they are susceptible to tumors in the reproductive system .  
She adds , with particular reference to the problem of overtime pay , " It is especially unfair given that employer and employee interact as economic entities , a status in which every individual should be equal . " The final irony of all is that the overtime regulations are frequently not observed by employers , so the people who are punished most are those single women who obediently agree to work past the legal limits on their overtime hours .  
In many of the more remote mountain districts , the population drain has led to Earth Lords being consolidated together for joint worship , while in major industrial areas , and sites where large development projects are in progress , numerous Earth Lords , suddenly deprived of their own hideaways , now have to cram together at a single altar .  
Wang , who studied in the West for many years , and who says that there is only a single universal standard of press freedom , recalls that when the ROC government first moved to Taiwan , it was facing a life-or-death crisis . Putting the regime 's survival first , it set aside notions of balance and press oversight inherent in democratic politics and argued that the media had to serve the state in order to ensure stability and the public interest .  
The recently passed budgets covering the second half of fiscal 1999 and all of fiscal 2000 ( i.e . a total of 18 months ) provide for total appropriations of more than NT $ 36.9 billion for social welfare . This accounts for 16.4% of the budget , more than for culture and education ( 16.1% ) , defense ( 15.8% ) , and economic development ( 15.7% ) . In fact , for the first time ever , social welfare is the single largest spending item in the national budget .  
Donations have come pouring in by the truckload-instant noodles , mineral water , crackers , sleeping bags , blankets-and medical personnel have also swarmed to the area , but a lack of coordination has resulted in an excess of personnel and materiel in some areas and a complete lack in others . When well-equipped international rescue operations arrived at the disaster area , the lack of information forced many of them to set out on their own in search of victims . In some cases , five or six different rescue groups converged on a single site .  
If a big clan lived in a traditional compound centered around their own courtyard , anyone that was sick or out of work could recuperate under the protective wings of the extended family , " says Taipei County deputy chief Lin Wan-yi , who is currently planning the county 's social welfare system . Within a single generation , the functions of the family declined greatly .  
According to museum employee Lu Yu-hua , many people express surprise that there should be an entire museum devoted solely to paper , but when you really think about it , there 's really nothing strange about it . When paper was first invented , the raw materials from which it was made differed from one region to the next . A single sheet of paper spoke volumes about local climates and vegetation ; its very existence enabled the spread of knowledge , and could record the history of an individual or an entire nation !  
They are the main theme of a series of works by Guatemalan painter Moises Barrios . In one work , a banana graces the cover of a popular magazine . Another painting parodies the work of Piet Mondrian , one of the most famous representatives of rationalism . Mondrian 's canvas with nothing but a single color divided by a few straight lines becomes a banana peel , with a few dark splotches here and there against a yellow background .  
In 1990 , the Ministry of Education announced a new policy , called somewhat misleadingly the " self-study plan , " which provided junior high school students with an option of seeking senior high school admission without taking the joint entrance exam . Scores in five different areas of school performance ( ethical , intellectual , physical , group spirit , and aesthetic ) started being used in place of a single score in the joint entrance exam for determining senior high school admissions .  
With his enthusiastic and unselfish personality , Lin has been collaborating with grateful artists in this way for 20 happy years . In the process he has amassed an entire storehouse full of ceramic works-a veritable museum of ceramics-without paying a single cent .  
Huang Min-nan , who formerly headed pop music planning at Rock Records , says : " Buddhist music now changes several times a year . " Not so long ago Chinese-style symphonic music , or chanting accompanied by a single instrument was popular , but at the moment it 's all about " spiritual " music and dance tunes .  
He illustrates his point by mentioning Straight Ahead with a Rifle , in which Dong continually returns to the image of a bombing range , communicating how it feels to live next to such a place . It is a factor always on the minds of local residents . This repeated use of a single image is a very unusual technique , but it does n't bore the viewer ; on the contrary , it leaves one feeling that he has gained new insight into the subject of the documentary .  
" In the township of Puli , for example , every single public structure collapsed , including the town hall , the police station , and the schools . That 's hard to believe . Public structures house the very agencies that are supposed to work for our safety . They should be the last buildings to fall , not the first , " says Wang , who adds that the government was only worried about tearing down and clearing away destroyed buildings after the quake , very possibly destroying evidence of fraudulent construction practices in the process .  
" The two easiest places to make a living in Taiwan back then were Chiufen in the north ( with its gold mine in Chinkuashih ) and Chishan in the south , " says Ku , who recalls that a kilo of bananas sold for NT $ 6 . One only needed to cut down a single bunch of bananas weighing 30 kilos to take in NT $ 180 , the equivalent of an entire week 's pay back then for the average working woman .  
As Lo says , " The ROC must move in the direction of flexible diplomacy and utilize foreign policy resources more flexibly . " In the future , overseas offices of the ROC will undertake functional integration at the continental level , with different locations having different specialties , such as overseas Chinese affairs , political affairs , and media relations . All the offices in a particular region will be linked into a single , more efficient , and more richly endowed cooperative group .  
It is necessary because within a single nation , different local governments take in different amounts of revenue due to their unique geographic , environmental , and economic conditions . The central government can not sit idly by while people in certain areas are unable to enjoy basic government services , so it uses various means to alleviate revenue shortfalls where they exist . The Tax Redistribution Fund is one such method .  
The 47% share previously allotted to Taipei and Kaohsiung was decided upon last year after the government canceled a plan to abolish all local sales taxes and replace them with a single national sales tax . Now that this share has been lowered to 43% , the other cities and counties have seen their combined share go up to 39% , with each local government 's individual share calculated on the basis of population , land area , and other factors .  
The whole trip takes about half the day . She had thought that these stores were only crowded on the weekends , but on a rainy weekday in November she decided she did n't feel like cooking and went to buy some prepared foods at the RT-Mart 's deli department . She discovered that there was n't a single open parking space among the hundreds on the first and second floors of the parking structure . She was quite surprised to find that business was so good on a weekday .  
Largely due to his unflagging efforts , Chinese archeology attained a sturdy theoretical and practical foundation that enabled it to emerge as a world-class discipline . His research showed that the rise of Chinese civilization did not occur exclusively in the area around the Yellow River Valley . Rather it emerged from several languages , ethnic groups and cultures spread over a vast landscape . This overturned the " single origin theory " and debunked Western assumptions about " oriental despotism . "  
With longer lifespans and less rigid social values , patterns of living once shared by all have been replaced by a growing diversity of individual experiences . In middle age , some people set up successful businesses , while others lose their jobs and are faced with poverty ; working women find themselves squeezed between the exhausting demands of children and housework on the one hand and their jobs on the other , while at the same time many single women face a daily battle with loneliness .  
At the age of 50 , some people already have grandchildren at their knee , while others are getting married for the first time . With more and more people remaining single , rising divorce rates , growing numbers of unmarried mothers , increasing occurrence of infertility , and the emergence of large numbers of families where husband and wife live in different cities , or even-as for many expatriate Taiwanese business people-in different countries , many middle-aged people 's carefully laid life plans have suddenly come to nothing .  
Born with the proverbial silver spoon in her mouth and well acquainted with the finer privileges in life , she never attended a single day of school in the regular education system , but that has n't kept her from developing into one of Taiwan 's best inkwash artists .  
But with a combination of superb cinematography , fine musical scores , and gorgeous stars in a single package , something clicks . The Korean shows appeal most to viewers who already have their own share of life experiences , enabling them to watch what might be their own stories , retold onscreen before them , rendered beautiful and poetic , with all of life 's wild storms , dreams , and regrets .  
Every 11 years , when the solar magnetic field goes into overdrive , in some areas of the sun 's surface the temperature sinks to 4000oC , so that these areas look darker in color than the surrounding photosphere . Seen from the earth they appear as small dark spots on the face of the sun , but in fact a single sunspot may be many times larger than the total surface area of the earth .  
9-11 has left us at the brink of war , but the possibility of military conflict as a result of US retaliation is not the only worry . A fluke incident and a single leader 's misjudgment in many other flashpoints worldwide could push us beyond the point of no return . The historic enmity between Israel and Palestine comes to mind , as do the ethnic and religious killing in Eastern Europe . North and South Korea are another cause for concern .  
The ITRI 's fever chip applies similar principles . Oligonucleotides from 25 of the most common fever-causing pathogens are arranged on the chip , and infection with any of them can be detected from a single drop of a patient 's blood , urine or cerebrospinal fluid . The fever chip too is currently in clinical trials at National Taiwan University Hospital .  
" The integrated curriculum should not be too disruptive for elementary schools , " says Ou Yung-sheng , because the subject divisions in elementary schools were already very broad , and their teaching arrangements are generally close to a single " class teacher " system , with one teacher teaching several different subjects . Therefore integrating the subjects should not be too difficult .  
With the current staffing structure in junior high schools , physics and chemistry teachers are not equipped to cross over and teach biology , and biology teachers can not teach information technology . Thus teaching in a single study field may be split between five different teachers , and pupils may be left to guess from the content of each unit which teacher will appear on any particular day . What kind of uncertainty will that introduce into the pupil-teacher relationship ?  
The students frolic on the wooden floors in sneakers , running , jumping , sitting , lying down . Students are relaxed and there 's a certain kind of warm atmosphere that they might not even find in their own homes . The classrooms at Yung'an are not divided into a single room per class , as at regular schools .  
The Internet in fact closely resembles the intangible , borderless world of connected individual " pearls . " We never know how extensive or long-lasting might be the impact of a single small idea or action , but we can imagine that every molecule in the vast universe is connected . The area which illustrates such profound ideas is also , interestingly enough , the one that provides the most plain fun .  
The little rural township of Luku , located in Nantou County , has a population of only 20,000 or so . Fifty-nine percent of the people are tea farmers . It is estimated that Nantou County accounts for one-third of the 18,000 hectares of land in Taiwan devoted to tea plantations , with Luku accounting for one half of Nantou 's total . Whether measured by cultivated area or production volume , Luku is the largest single tea-producing township in Taiwan .  
Moreover , because the cafe was located right next to the Hsimenting movie theater district , it attracted many young people , especially when blockbusters were showing on nearby cinema screens . The cafe would be filled with movie-going students , some of whom would order a single cup of coffee and stay an entire afternoon , and whom the proprietors never felt right about asking to move on . After a while , other customers stopped coming , and Literary Salon was forced to close .  
A third of Taiwan 's native fern species grow in the damp , shady forest , and endemic Taiwanese plants such as the Taiwan pleione orchid live here too . The ancient false cypresses are a paradise for epiphytic plants , with up to 80 species living on a single tree .  
In Lukang , the clans Hsu , Huang , and Shih controlled half the town / In the Qianlong reign , the city prospered , and the sails of boats were as numerous as flying fish / In Lukang , spring and autumn dreams , it rose and fell in a single 60-year cycle / Clouds from the west , currents from the east , tourists bring change without knowing what they do .  
Because the boy was born out of wedlock , his mother had no choice but to abandon him in the fields . A crab and duck nursed the infant until he was adopted by a farmer , who named him Lei Haiqing . Lei Haiqing acquired great musical skill as a boy growing up in the countryside , but throughout his childhood he never uttered a single word .  
Eventually , Min Sheng Daily agreed to add another gig , and the 2500 tickets for that were cleaned out in a single morning . After the event , the emcee , Chen Kai-lun , said that this was the most moving event he had ever hosted . There was not an empty seat to be found , no one left halfway through , and everyone felt as if they were being carried back in time on a genteel current of luxurious music .  
With the growing number of single parent families and DINKs ( Double Income No Kids ) , modern people have a broader understanding and greater acceptance of what makes a home . What 's more , today 's young parents themselves have grown up in a freer atmosphere when the entire culture was changing . And so , as a result of all these factors combined , the outlook on filial piety within society as a whole has taken a 180-degree turn .  
In reality , neglected sites need not be publicly owned spaces , and they need not be limited to separate and distinct buildings . Idle spaces can be found everywhere . Their scope includes a single empty building , a sidewalk , a row of houses , or an abandoned or wild piece of land . " So long as spaces are n't managed well and do n't function well , then public and private spaces can both be included , " says Lin Po-nian , publisher of Space Magazine .  
It is still in operation , on track to celebrate its 70th birthday in 2004 . Two or three generations of people in a single family may share the collective memory of dishes like " French Provincial Duck , " which have changed not at all since the 1930s . The restaurant also continues its tradition , dating back to the Japanese colonial era , but having all male staff . One change , however , is that the waiters no longer are required to have their heads shaved , though they still sport uniform hair styles .  
A survey conducted in Kaohsiung County showed a clear rising trend in the number of domestic violence cases reported by foreign brides . Before 1998 the number of such reports was in the single digits . After 1998 there was a yearly increase such that by the end of April , 2001 , there was a monthly average of seven reports .  
Under the old system of economic planning , the distribution of published works in the mainland was all handled through a single state-owned channel ( known as the " first channel " ) - every region in the country had a Xinhua bookstore and supply unit . These Xinhua stores held sole control of delivery and distribution , a system entirely inappropriate for a free market .  
Autumn maples stand tall along the roadside , with fields spreading out beside the highway , the different shades of green spreading out , one after another , into a single beautiful rustic landscape . White herons dotting the fields , the whole area flanked by winding mountain ranges , and dotted with elegant farmhouses and field walls built of rough-hewn stone ; all these illustrate the peaceful beauty of Sanhsing .  
At the opening ceremony in Changhua , ROC president and master of ceremonies Chen Shui-bian remarked that the Sun Yat-sen Freeway represented the island 's first transportation revolution . Now the opening of National Highway No . 3 , in conjunction with the 12 high-speed east-west connectors and the main branch of the Western Coastal Expressway construction projects , as well as the high-speed railway ( scheduled to open at the end of 2005 ) , will turn the entire western corridor into a single living area and thus constitute nothing short of a second transportation revolution .  
Little Li Fu-huei , barely three years old , sits on her father 's lap reciting the 3000-odd-character-long essay by Zhuangzi , " Man in the World , Associated with Other Men . " Although her speech is still very childish , she recites the entire essay from memory , making not a single mistake . Zhou Hong , renowned on both sides of the Taiwan Strait as mainland China 's foremost specialist on family education , in Taiwan on a visit , is dumbstruck by Li 's performance : " Children really do have astounding potential ! "  
At the threshold of the modestly sized temple are a pair of lions carved from a single slab of stone-female on the right , male on the left . The male is playing with a ball , while the female is supporting a cub . The carving of the hard stone is exquisite .  
For a work like No Holding Back , with the trio sculpted completely in the round , the posture and attitude of the three figures was a huge compositional challenge . In each stroke of the knife , there was little room for error . Every single angle had to be taken into consideration . Although the subject of the work was a traditional story , the piece nevertheless had a distinctly modern feel to it .  
According to Chi , single mothers receive very little support in Taiwan . At the GHF , for example , only a minority of girls who decide to keep their baby get any financial or emotional support from their parents , and then only after considerable resistance from them . Most unmarried girls who choose the hard road of raising their child , do so without the proper skills or support from their family or boyfriend .  
Kids do n't have the least opportunity to figure out what it is they really like as individuals . Gerald Durrell , author of My Family and Other Animals , never had single day of formal schooling , but enjoyed a childhood in which he had no particular goals set for him and could follow his own interests entirely . In this setting , he developed a deep love and understanding of animals and changed world conservation history . What would have happened to Durrell if he had been born in Taiwan ?  
Last year the Taiwan Major League terminated operations and the two leagues merged , returning baseball to a single market . The merger included a " traitors ' clause " which barred players who had jumped from the CPBL to the TML from returning to the enlarged CPBL . This forced a number of veterans to retire from the game . Even Mr . Baseball himself , Li Chu-ming , was let go and had to start picking up an unemployment check ; he eventually opened a coffee shop .  
Minister of Justice Chen Ding-nan has declared that individuals who have suffered losses because government employees leaked their personal information are entitled to seek compensation from the government . According to existing regulations , the maximum aggregate compensation for a single personal information leak case is only NT $ 20 million . The Ministry of Justice is currently rewriting the law to raise this amount to NT $ 50 million . Department stores and major retailers will also fall under the LPCMPI .  
Society sighs and shakes it collective head at this subgroup , which consists of disadvantaged individuals , often unemployed and / or single parents , stuck on the lower rungs both socially and economically . When faced with injustice or adversity , they often do not know how to express their emotions or where to seek help . These lonely , helpless , marginalized individuals are most vulnerable to anger-whether as its wielders or its victims .  
Huang Yuan-cheng currently makes a living by selling tea , telling fortunes , and gravesite divination . He was divorced when his daughter was only six months old , yet , in what seems like a short stretch of time , his daughter is ready to start elementary school . Looking back on the many bumps in the road and setbacks he has seen as a single father , Huang still does n't know how he made it this far .  
The most exciting game was that against Japan , which went into extra innings , with Chinese Taipei being clipped by only a single run . Head coach Hsu Sheng-ming said that although the team lost , no one had even expected it to give Japan much of a fight , so their efforts both at the plate and in the field were very admirable . Star pitcher Tsao Chin-hui threw until his hand blistered and began bleeding , giving an idea of the determination shown by the whole squad .  
Second , there is the question as to how specific intent to commit an act of genocide ( where an accused is alleged to have killed a single human being ) is to be distinguished from an act of ordinary murder or the killing of several from mass murder . 
They emphasized the fact that the Moroccan nation was historically and constitutionally a single indivisible whole , but they wondered why censuses and studies carried out by the authorities employed only socio-economic and not racial , ethnic or linguistic criteria , which would give a more complete idea of the composition of the population .  
Equally satisfying in our opinion is the compromise solution reached after long discussion , namely to circulate as an official document of the General Assembly a single compendium including the valuable joint assessment , prepared by the two Vice-Chairmen in their personal capacity , of the two rolling papers on clusters 1 and 2 , as well as proposals and contributions presented by individual countries and groups of countries .  
Further , the Assistant Secretary-General noted that the problems produced by rapid urbanization could not be solved by a single level of government ; it required close collaboration between all levels of government and the entire spectrum of civil society .  Of special importance were local authorities , and in that connection , the Assistant Secretary-General made reference to the recently signed " Protocol of Lisbon " between the Centre and prominent international local-government associations .  
Though this sense of equality was repressed for three centuries by pragmatic measures that were respected but not implemented , and by the extreme zeal of monks who consulted no one in imposing a single faith on this immense geographical area , it was imbued with the spaciousness of the land , the rivers , the forests , the gentle climate , the mountains and prairies , whose influence produced a different type of human character .  
The creation of the United Nations 50 years ago awakened tremendous hopes for mankind , which had , in the space of a single generation , suffered from two particularly savage wars with consequences that sorely affected the entire world and for which all peoples paid a heavy toll . 
The commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations affords an opportunity for giving deep thought to finding the best means of facing up to the challenges of our times and to equipping our Organization with the military capability and material resources that would enable it to address problems at the international level with a single standard based on the principles of equality and justice .  
It is my feeling that the United Nations and the Olympic Movement share a single universal ideal : to promote peace and understanding among nations and among peoples , with all their differences and their complementary features , by contributing to bringing cultures closer together and to promoting friendship among human beings in this world so often battered and torn apart .  
The single , modest , intention of our document was to sound a warning concerning the profound collateral effects on the entire United Nations system of the possible expansion of the number of permanent members .  
The United Nations must tirelessly continue to demonstrate to the men and women of this era that the prevailing openness in the world offers a formidable opportunity for the future , an unexpected chance to transcend our differences in order to attain what I once referred to as the irreducible human element , that is , the quintessence of the values by which we define ourselves as a single human community .  
I am fully aware that the task is a daunting one because of the fundamental divergence of views that exist within the Conference on the international arms-control and disarmament agenda in the post-cold-war era and following the indefinite extension of the NPT and , in the final analysis , on the role of the Conference on Disarmament as the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum at this crucial juncture .  
Throughout this period , worldwide alarm , reflected in numerous United Nations resolutions , grew over the fact that the threat posed by nuclear weapons remained the single most critical global issue .  
According to some scenarios , sustainable biomass energy systems could be the largest single contributor to global energy supply , providing from 17 per cent to 35 per cent of the total demand for primary energy in 2050 .  Such a development would not occur under " business as usual " conditions but would derive from sustainability policies and technological advances with regard to liquid , solid and gaseous fuel production from biomass .  
However , in order to use the limited resources in an optimal manner to meet these different needs a single comprehensive framework of training materials should be developed through modules that would be applicable to countries depending on their status and capability in national accounts .  
It is my earnest desire for an early solution to the Cyprus problem based on a bi-communal , bi-zonal federation with one single sovereignty , one citizenship and one international personality and I am anxious that no further time shall be wasted through repetition of endless discussions and arguments , but strongly recommend that the main issues of the Cyprus problem be addressed in a comprehensive manner and in a way that will yield results .  
Thus , it was suggested that the creation of a single international criminal court would better serve the rule of law by offering fuller guarantees of the objective , impartial and uniform application of the future Code of Crimes against the Peace and Security of Mankind than would ephemeral , ad hoc jurisdictions .  
Recognizing also that there is no single political system or single model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples , and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
To facilitate their effective implementation , it may be necessary to assemble , with full participation of all concerned entities of the United Nations system , all the pieces in a single , integrated operational framework with clear-cut priorities , time-bound targets in line with those set by the World Summit for Social Development in the most crucial areas , and well-defined responsibilities for national and international efforts .  
While we are truly thankful for every single life that has been saved , we must be bitter about all the lives that have not been reached to be rescued and , most critically today , about all the lives that , after three years of systematic human rights abuses , deprivation and sieges , continue to be endangered and subject to the whims of those who have proven their disregard for human life .  
Needless to say that these allegations are mainly propagated by a Government which has been the primary supporter and sponsor of Israel 's State-sponsored terrorism , of its aggressive policies , and of its production of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , and has also backed despotic Governments which have not experienced parliamentarianism , consultation and elections in their political life even for a single day .  
Section III of the IAEA 's seventh semi-annual report ( document S / 1995 / 287 dated 11 April 1995 ) on the implementation of the IAEA 's plan for ongoing monitoring and verification of Iraq 's compliance with the relevant obligations specified in UNSC resolutions 687 ( 1991 ) and 715 ( 1991 ) , addressed the implications of two , single page , documents which were represented as official Iraqi correspondence , generated in April / May 1994 , suggesting the reconstitution of a nuclear weapons programme .  
While acknowledging that the problems covered by the mandate are multidimensional , ranging from structural or systemic to individual and less organized incursions against children , for which no single solution will ever be possible , the report nevertheless offers recommendations as to the first steps of a long , arduous journey .  
It is generally agreed among mainstream economists that outward orientation in economic development has been the single most important factor responsible for rapid economic development and the reduction of inequality in the first and second generations of the newly industrialized economies and the other developing economies that have opened their economies to trade in the past decade .  
Policies directed at raising the productivity of the agricultural sector or developing entrepreneurship do not achieve the desired results unless they take into account the fact that within a single household separate economic accounting units exist and the pattern of the exchange of labour and distribution of resources among them reflects the differences in the bargaining power of its members , which in turn depends on their entitlement .

Fads in policy design have repeatedly swept across segments of the community of policy advisers , only to be followed by reassessments after unanticipated difficulties have arisen .  No single model of financial development applies equally well in all institutional , cultural and technological situations .  
NULLIt is worth noting that during the past two years the Government of the Sudan in its extensive written replies to the Special Rapporteur 's reports did not put forward one single argument supporting the consistency of the analysed provisions of its State legislation with applicable international human rights norms and standards .  
Even in normal times , particularly in developing countries , the capacities of these infrastructures are often strained to manage even the most basic social and economic development programmes , and a single disaster can severely disrupt the community lifelines that provide food distribution , water supplies , health-care services , waste disposal and communications locally and with the rest of the world .  
With regard to the new text of draft article 21 , Slovenia felt that the original intention to include in a single group both crimes against humanity as recognized by customary law on the basis of the Charter of the N \ x { e16c } nberg Tribunal , which applied only in time of war , and systematic and massive violations of human rights , represented an attempt to further the progressive development of international law .  
Initially , i.e . , before the establishment of ICSC 20 years ago , these relationship agreements tying the specialized agencies to the United Nations through adherence to " a single unified international civil service " ( later termed " United Nations common system " ) were intended to be between equals .  
The implementation of this crash programme , if successful , would have reduced the time required to attain sufficient nuclear material for a single nuclear weapon by up to two years compared to the probable production time-scale of Iraq 's EMIS and centrifuge enrichment programmes .  
also that there is no single political system or single universal model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
achievement of sustainable solutions required national , regional and international solidarity , which meant that financial and human resources exceeding the capacity of a single country or small group of countries had to be mobilized .  
also that there is no single political system or single universal model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples , and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
He also drew attention to some remaining difficulties such as the possible additional resources that Conference Services would need for the editing , translation and printing of the supplement , the heavy burden that the concentration of the review work within a single division would place on that division and the priority to be given to other urgent responsibilities in the current period of financial crisis and diminishing resources .  
In the development debate , globalization and the call for integration into a single global economic grid are held out as the primary or even the sole option for developing countries seeking cooperation with developed countries .  
Even when , as is more usual , the formal political boundaries remain intact , the ability of capitals of large and relatively homogeneous States to impose a single direction over all their constituent parts is clearly diminishing . 
Given the proliferation of internal conflicts and regional tensions , the harmful effects of economic disorder , the spread of the AIDS pandemic , the rise of crime and terrorism , violations of human rights , the ever-widening international character of drug-trafficking networks and the deterioration of the environment , there is no single area of international relations that does not require a collective effort on the part of States if it is to be mastered . 
Indeed , 72 per cent of single heads of households , most of them female , live below the official poverty line , which simply implies a lack of access or limited access to basic social services , including food , sanitation , shelter , basic education and primary health care . 
There may be no other single individual who has been as instrumental or as effective in leading the world community in recent years in the difficult search for common ground , particularly on issues relating to environmentally sustainable development .  
Above and beyond the proposals of the Summit of major industrialized countries at Lyon , which I welcome , I advocate a single rigorous coordination structure for all economic and social activities and , especially , a concerted restructuring of the bodies and mandates concerned .  
The new ARIANE-5 launcher has a dual purpose : first , to make the ARIANE family more competitive by enhancing performance levels , reducing launch costs , improving reliability and increasing the useful diameter under the fairing , so that ARIANE-5 will be capable of launching into geostationary transfer orbit either two-3,000 kilogram satellites simultaneously or a single satellite of up to 6,800 kilograms ; second , to satisfy Europe 's need for a low-orbit facility using manned vehicles or space station sections .  
The draft resolution failed to take account of the fact that no single political system or electoral process was suited to all nations and peoples and that political systems were subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors .  
The empowerment of women and their full and equal participation in political , social and economic life , the improvement of health , and the alleviation of poverty are essential to achieving sustainable human settlements .  Paragraphs 10 and 10 bis should be joined as a single paragraph .  
Assessments of the potential impact of variability and change of climate and the atmospheric environment were conducted by some countries through bilateral and multilateral support and as part of the UNEP-implemented World Climate Impact and Response Strategies Programme concerning areas both within and outside their national jurisdiction , including studies of vulnerability to sealevel rise , effects on agriculture , forests and other sensitive and important sectors , either as single or regional group efforts .  
According to some scenarios , sustainable biomass energy has the potential to become the largest single source of energy globally , providing from 17 per cent to 35 per cent of the total demand for primary energy in 2050 if sustainability policies are adopted and technological advances achieved in the production of liquid , solid and gaseous fuels from biomass , based on the use of fast-growing species , soil-water species relationships , new harvesting and conversion techniques or the application of genetically engineered bacteria .  
Forest decline is defined in this overview as an episodic event characterized by premature , progressive loss of tree and stand vigour and health over a given period without obvious evidence of a single clearly identifiable causal factor such as a physical disturbance or an attack by an aggressive disease or insect .

It was not really possible to develop a special legal status applicable to all the objects and systems concerned , because of their great dissimilarities ; it was more realistic to choose a legal status based on certain aspects , such as the capability of the aerospace object to travel through outer space and to remain in airspace for a certain period of time , and the technical design and nature of the object or system , for example whether it was single - or multi-staged , piloted or unpiloted , and launched vertically or horizontally .  
Part of the problem for the international community in trying to deal with organized transnational crime is that there is no single organizational or behavioural paradigm that provides a constant and accessible target .  
Argentina hopes that the members of the international community will deploy the necessary efforts and resources to make it possible , within a reasonable time , to embody in a general convention the political commitments of countries to combat this form of crime and to ensure mutual cooperation to that end .  The conclusion of a general convention would afford the international community a single , efficient and effective instrument for responding suitably to the activities and manifestations of organized transnational crime .  
Indeed , the alternative to the " cumbersome procedure " proposed in the Seventh report is represented either by unilateral and possibly arbitrary action by single , allegedly injured , States or groups thereof , or by merely political decisions by a political body and the action it may authorize .  
As the umbrella term children and youth in especially difficult circumstances covers a wide range of disparate target groups , it is evident that no single strategy will be effective in preventing or responding to the problems of substance abuse to which they are exposed .  
During the visit , I was able to meet with the local political leadership and express support for those who seek to implement the Peace Agreement and its vision of a single multi-ethnic country , two entities peacefully coexisting and elections that are free and fair .  
Regional development and global changes included published studies on the impact of the single European market on ESCWA countries ; privatization in the Gulf countries and in Arab countries with more diversified economies ; and on industrial strategies in the ESCWA region within a changing international and regional environment .  
In Brazil , for example , the National Confederation of Health-care Cooperatives ( Unimed do Brasil ) has grown from a single cooperative set up in 1967 to a business complex now comprising 304 provider-owned health cooperatives , many owning hospitals , organized in 17 State-level networks , and a national holding company that owns subsidiaries in insurance and provides bulk purchasing and common services for members ' hospitals and clinics ; data management and communications ; and training , research and development .  
Keeping open the availability of additional alternative corridors for transit in an uncertain world , even at some cost , as compared with putting more resources into expanding the current most efficient single route , may be the most effective long-term investment and best insurance " policy " for landlocked countries .  
The continuing convenience of these traditional rail connections stems from the fact that the Central Asian rail lines had been part of the single rail system of the former Soviet Union ( which , in many operating respects , such as scheduling of through trains and the setting of tariffs , continues to function as a coordinated system ) and the fact that the use of some alternative routes has been constricted because of political unrest and because other newer options are only beginning to come on line .  
Likewise , it is essential to study , starting now , all the necessary modalities for resuming development aid once peace , national reconciliation , democracy and strict respect for human rights have become established and have finally triumphed , both in the thinking and in the conduct of all the citizens of Burundi , who will finally be brought together and will coalesce into a single , unified nation .  
A call for harmonization and uniformity was first expressed in Council resolution 1743 ( LIV ) of 4 May 1973 , in which the Council , mindful of the increase of unitization and containerization of cargoes as part of total world transportation , invited " international organizations concerned to foster the adoption of a single system of identification , classification and labelling of dangerous goods " and requested the Committee to continue to investigate divergencies currently existing in the modal practices in that respect .  
The strengthening of the private sector 's role in the development process and in the creation of jobs has been accompanied by an investment promotion policy focused on a recasting of the Investment Codes into a single , better adapted and more flexible Code covering all economic sectors and the financial and fiscal reforms .

The chairpersons further recommend that consideration be given to more creative approaches whereby several of the various procedural amendments to the human rights treaties could be packaged together in a single , comprehensive document to be transmitted to the States parties to allow them the option of invoking their constitutional amendment procedures only once for all the amendments .  
Brazil stressed that , since the country has a federal structure with states and municipalities endowed with autonomy as far as the organization of the educational system is concerned , it would not be appropriate to establish a single focal point at the federal level to deal with school and university teaching .  
The Committee is particularly concerned at the insufficient measures and programmes for the protection of the rights of the most vulnerable children , especially girls , children living in rural areas , children who are victims of abuse , children of single parents , children born out of wedlock , abandoned children , disabled children , and children who are , in order to survive , forced to live and / or work in the streets .

Further , the precise content of the freedom of transit has in each single case to be agreed upon by the transit State and the landlocked State concerned , and in the absence of agreement concerning the terms and modalities for exercising the right of access of persons and goods , transit through the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany is regulated only by national law , in particular with regard to ways and means of transport and the use of traffic infrastructure .  
The international community should take a single , firm and unwavering stand against mercenary activities , avoiding a contradiction between statements formally condemning mercenaries and concessions made in practice to efficient services performed by individuals or companies with a mercenary past that were currently engaged in suspicious activities .  
The Heads of State called for the all-round development of trade and economic cooperation among the Turkish-speaking countries , the expansion of economic ties at various levels , the promotion of economic integration processes , the elimination of obstacles to joint trade and the establishment of a favourable legal regime for individuals and legal entities engaging in economic cooperation in order to create a single market for goods , services , capital and labour , without prejudice to their international obligations .  
The Covenant , which was considered by many to be the single most important human rights instrument , codified the essential freedoms which people must enjoy in an effective democratic society , such as the right to vote and to participate in government , to freedom of peaceful assembly , to equal protection of the law , the right to liberty and security and to freedom of opinion and expression .  
The European Union is convinced that the role of the United Nations in the field of development activities would be substantially strengthened if the three secretariat departments with responsibilities in this area were to be merged under the authority of a single Under-Secretary-General responsible for policy formulation and coordination in the fields of sustainable development and economic cooperation , while coherence and coordination of operational activities should also be appropriately enhanced through the strengthening of the relevant secretariat function .  
The implementation of those recommendations , which included the creation of a national civil register responsible for issuing a single identity and voter card , the introduction of residential voting , and the introduction of proportional representation in the municipal councils , would constitute a significant advance in El Salvador 's electoral system . 
A single , integrated international database containing extensive basic statistics and indicators covering a wide range of topics in these fields is being developed for wide dissemination pending the provision of extrabudgetary support .  
Convinced that education and public information activities in the field of human rights were prerequisites for the full and effective enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the three main sponsors , Australia , Costa Rica and Namibia , had decided to draft a single text combining two previous General Assembly resolutions on that issue . 
However , since special arrangements regulating the diversity of such objects do not exist in the applicable international law and considering probable future technological developments in this area , a single and unified regime does not seem legally necessary at this stage .  
In that connection , bearing in mind that the draft Code and the international criminal court would form part of a single international legal regime , he hoped that the court 's statute would provide more specific guidance on issues which were not clearly defined in , or omitted from , the draft Code .  
At the same time , the Panel acknowledged that at present no single multilateral body , organization or instrument has either a mandate or the capacity to address , in a balanced , [ integrated ] [ holistic ] and mutually reinforcing way , all forest-related issues currently on the international agenda on sustainable forest management .  
Europe possesses what is essential for achieving this - a space with a single world-view extending from Vancouver to Vladivostok , where the bipolar world no longer exists and a common value system based on the philosophy of democratic liberalism and respect for human rights is being established . 
This Declaration reflected the central goals of a common , comprehensive , indivisible security zone free from demarcation lines ; security ; cooperation between the OSCE and other international organizations to achieve these goals ; recognition that no single organization , State or group can bear the predominant responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and stability in the OSCE region ; and recognition of the importance of States complying with their obligations regarding national minorities .  
Taking full advantage of historical affinities , cultural ties and religious bonds and sparing no effort to utilize in an efficient and coordinated manner the human and natural potential and resources of the region constitute the single best long-term guarantee of security and tranquillity .  
Although there are numerous examples of good practices by business and industry , the number of companies that are making strides in becoming sustainable development enterprises is small relative to the global total , a disappointing trend given that business and industry is the single most dominant factor influencing the direction of investments and financial flows , as well as the type of products produced and the processes with which they are made . 
Recalling General Assembly resolution 45 / 179 of 21 December 1990 , by which the Assembly established the United Nations International Drug Control Programme as the single body with the exclusive responsibility for coordinating all drug control activities within the United Nations system and for providing effective leadership in promoting international cooperation in drug control , thereby producing a catalytic impact on other international and national bodies ,

An expert involved in the Uganda Connect project pointed to a highly original way of overcoming existing limitations through the use of donated older PCs which are linked up through a hybrid technology using VHF single side band radio communications .  
The proposed draft declaration deals not with some sort of single concrete mechanism for preventing and settling conflicts , but rather with the total number of such mechanisms , of course , while maintaining the specific characteristics of each of them , and with the formulation of the fundamental basic principles and criteria for their establishment and functioning , while retaining the main responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security .  
Such enhanced and diverse contributions , in the framework of a world consensus , could spare the international community any accusation of negligence , double standards or bias towards a single cultural concept .  
The programme of the workshop covered four main topics : conceptual issues of poverty in old age ; women as one of the groups at risk , and the process known as the feminization of poverty ; specific issues of poverty among other groups at risk ; disabled and single persons ; and ways to create an enabling environment for the improved well-being of older people .

The proposed draft declaration deals not with some sort of single concrete mechanism for preventing and settling conflicts , but rather with the total number of such mechanisms , of course , while maintaining the specific characteristics of each of them , and with the formulation of the fundamental basic principles and criteria for their establishment and functioning , while retaining the main responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security .  
Forms of international cooperation which will make a worthwhile contribution during the initial stages are the exchange of space data and the joint elaboration of international projects aimed at coordinating national space resources within a single comprehensive international remote sensing system .  
Housing , being the most important single investment in the life of the majority of the world 's population , should not be considered only in its aspect of physical shelter , but should be given full consideration as the most important element of family life where all social , economic , cultural and political activities begin and are sustained .  
Based on a peoples own efforts , the strategy of rapid economic and social progress can not be deduced from single models or rigid formulas : it must be drawn up in the light of national conditions and characteristics and necessitates a commitment on the part of each State and the cooperation of all States .  
In order to achieve this , the foundation for a single normative legal basis is to be laid by the end of 1997 , chiefly by developing general norms as well as unifying civil and customs codes and simultaneously introducing common taxation legislation .  
The representative of the Netherlands felt that a provision for resource mobilization as proposed by the representative of South Africa should not include a reference to the single general domestic legislation clause , because it would be redundant and might set a bad precedent for the inclusion of similar restrictions in other provisions contained in the consolidated text .

Finally , the United States pointed out that , although it was engaged in a continuous process of seeking and establishing , whenever possible , more effective bilateral and multilateral means of combating all forms of organized transnational crime , it agreed that the time had come to give serious consideration to the elaboration of a single new international convention in that area .  
As a single united Government of Angola takes up the daunting task of providing all Angolans with the political stability and economic development which they have so long awaited , it is our sincerest hope that a successful transition to democratic pluralism will replace , once and for all , the violence and mistrust which have historically marked relations between the Government and UNITA .  
The current issues are concerned with choices between a cost-plus regime ( typified by many United States utilities ) or a price cap ( typified by the RPI-X formula started in the United Kingdom ) ; between a single regulator , a regulatory board , or sectoral regulatory agencies ; whether to break up a national monopoly into regional monopolies ; the rate at which competitors should be licensed , bearing in mind the need for the incumbent enterprise to finance major expansion as far as possible from internally generated surpluses ; etc .  
Databases on contraceptive use ; fertility levels and trends ; mortality ; international migration ; world population ; demographic indicators ; sex and age in five year groups ; populations ; sex and age in single years ; age patterns of fertility ; urban and rural areas ; urban agglomerations ; global review and inventory of population policies ; and population , resources , environment and development ; ( iv ) Information materials and services .  
This was done for practical reasons , including a desire to allow the Ministry a high degree of flexibility in securing numerous and diverse offers from a variety of sources , at competitive prices and on the customary commercial terms , and in order to avoid being restricted to a single brand name under which all our requirements for a particular item might not be available within the period the Memorandum of Understanding is in effect .  
Disaggregated data and appropriate indicators seem to be lacking to assess the situation of children , especially those who are victims of abuse , ill _ treatment or child labour or are involved with the administration of juvenile justice , as well as refugee and internally displaced children , children of single _ parent families , children in rural and remote areas , abandoned , institutionalized and disabled children , and children who are living and / or working on the street .  
The international community , by redirecting its focus to sustainable development , would be able to overcome the false dichotomy between economic , social and environmental measures and instead view such measures as integral parts of a single whole .  
First , the new and equitable global partnership must be based on equality and recognize that there was no single model for development that was universally applicable ; since the world was characterized by diversity , there must be respect for the economic and social development model chosen by each country and any attempt to use aid as a leverage for exerting political pressure must be abandoned .  
When the provision of such vital services as telecommunications , electricity supply , railways , freight transport , fuel distribution and so forth are acquired by private owners , whether through the acquisition of a State monopoly by a single large private corporation or through a widely distributed share ownership , it is appropriate that the Government set up an independent and effective regulatory body to look after consumer interests and wider national and environmental concerns .  
Similarly , the Department 's publication , Image &amp; amp ; Reality , the single publication devoted to help correct common misconceptions about the United Nations , has been thoroughly revised to counter criticisms about the Organization , both in specific areas such as peacekeeping and more generally as part of current debate over reform .  
To begin with , as international firms begin to operate in the world economy as if it were a single market and production space , the issue of competitive markets is now being posed in terms of the " contestability " of markets , i.e . not only actual trade competition in goods and services , but also potential competition resulting from the establishment of foreign firms through direct investment .  
In Eritrea , foreign nationals , whatever their origin , were treated justly , in accordance with the law and their human rights were respected ; there had not been a single incident involving ethnic or national minorities in the seven years since independence .  
In a perfect world , it would be desirable to negotiate a single treaty which addressed both future production of fissile material , as well as existing stockpiles .

UNPF implemented a complicated and time-consuming exercise of converting multiple inventory databases , supported by individual asset managers , into a single , unified mission-wide inventory database based on the REALITY systems fixed assets module .  
An FMCT is , strictly speaking , not in itself an instrument of disarmament since no single warhead will be dismantled because of it , and the quantity of fissile material available for nuclear arms will be frozen at its current level .  
The existence of common historical , political , economic and cultural and humanitarian links with countries which in the past formed a single whole necessitates the maintenance and development of relations through bilateral and multilateral cooperation .  
Pensioners and invalids receive monetary benefits , housing and communal services on advantageous terms , and free travel on urban overground electrically powered public transport , all as part of a single package .  
For that reason , my delegation believes that we must reflect the cultural , social and religious diversity of all countries as we strive to attain realistic and objective social development , without imposing a single model on everyone . 
In 19961998 its programme goals included Furthering the vision of the founders to advance the status of women , in all of its dimensions , including human rights , health issues and internationalism / multiculturalism ; and promoting a unified purpose and direction to ensure that Zonta International remains an international organization by addressing global concerns and issues with a single voice and a combined effort .  
When human rights are used to advance one single political agenda while the rights of countless others are ignored , human rights are denigrated , becoming a political instrument of narrow interests instead of a universal standard for the protection of all humanity .  
The view was expressed that , while the scientific principles formulated in the working paper submitted by the Czech Republic were acceptable , a comprehensive analysis of the legal aspects , as well as the scientific and technical aspects , of the geostationary orbit in one single document was required , taking into consideration the regulations of ITU , as the examination of those issues should not be approached in a piecemeal manner .  
The Committee remains concerned , however , at the large and increasing number of single _ parent families as well as the high number of abandoned children , especially children born out of wedlock , children of poor families , and children whose parents have left the country in search of economic opportunities .  
Even the initial analysis of the recommendations and proposals made by several United Nations bodies and mechanisms active in the field of human rights makes it possible to single out a number of major themes that could be considered by the World Conference with a view to formulating recommendations for the adoption of additional measures to combat racism at the national , regional and international levels .  
The Special Rapporteur is encouraged to note the passage of the Domestic Violence Act of 1995 , which includes provision for : a new single protection order ; a broadening of the definition of domestic violence to include psychological abuse ; increased penalties for breaches of protection orders ; free legal aid with respect to protection orders ; and new guidelines to ensure the arrest of violent abusers and the automatic revocation of firearms licences .  
We are all aware that it is not easy to combine differing viewpoints in a single package , but when we recall the current nuclear arms race and the massive stockpiles of nuclear arsenals with all the dangers that they entail , this should induce us to appeal to the international forums specialized in the field of disarmament to place this issue on their list of priorities and to apply its criteria thereto in a comprehensive manner and without any exception .  
The view was expressed that , while the scientific principles formulated in the working paper submitted by the Czech Republic were acceptable , a comprehensive analysis of the legal aspects , as well as the scientific and technical aspects , of the geostationary orbit in one single document was required , taking into consideration the regulations of ITU , as the examination of those issues should not be approached in a piecemeal manner .  
In the case of TCDC programmes initiated or coordinated by the Special Unit or by other bodies of the United Nations system , the involvement of multiple players in single TCDC interventions , which has now become common practice , would seem to indicate that the system is successfully adopting the mandate set out in the new directions strategy - i.e . , that TCDC activities should be designed to have the maximum impact on a large number of developing countries .  
Recognizing also that there is no single political system or single universal model of democracy equally suited to all nations and their peoples and that political systems and the electoral processes which guarantee the establishment of democratic governments are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,

Following current practice in cases of loss or damage resulting from a single hostile action or forced abandonment , the United Nations will assume liability for each and every item of major equipment when the collective generic fair market value equals or exceeds the threshold value of $ 250,000 .  
In paragraph 10 of its report ( A / 52 / 410 ) , the Advisory Committee stated that it had been informed that annex B , section 6 , Loss or damage , paragraph 18 , of the contribution agreement would read as follows : In cases of loss or damage resulting from a single hostile action or forced abandonment , the United Nations will assume liability for each and every item of major equipment when the collective generic fair market value equals or exceeds the threshold value of $ 250,000 .  
In fact , it is quite the contrary : the fate of the Kosovars has become entirely incidental , and the humanitarian banner is being used as a cover for NATO 's attempts to destroy the present world order , which is based on respect for international law and for the Charter of the United Nations . This , in fact , is the big picture , not the fact that one single person is responsible for all of this . 
The combination of a major issue , such as biotechnology , and a minor theme , such as agriculture , had proved an effective way of approaching a single field of activity from multiple and complimentary perspectives , and the Commission might like to take a similar approach to the development of a work programme for the next inter-sessional period .  
Small island developing States are threatened to a similar degree , but due to their physical isolation and limited economic base are often dependent on a single industry , such as tourism .  
The Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that to link the determination of the original legal status of indigenous peoples as nations ( in the contemporary sense of international law ) or as non-nations to the single factor of whether or not they have formalized relations with non-indigenous colonizing powers , is faulty .  
Space environmental exploration and research has been carried out on energy electrons , protons , heavy ions and their single particle effects , radiation dosage effects , space thermal plasma , upper atmospheric density and components and solar energy electromagnetic radiation .  
A number of functional commissions did not concur with proposals , contained , inter alia , in the 1998 consolidated report ( E / 1999 / 3 ) that certain topics , such as gender equality and human rights , should be addressed exclusively by the single functional commission which has the primary responsibility for the subject matter , in particular in the context of implementation and follow-up to a major conference .

Such a system should cover all children up to the age of 18 years , with specific emphasis on those who are particularly vulnerable , including children with disabilities , children living in poverty , children in the juvenile justice system , children of single _ parent families , children born out of wedlock , sexually abused children and institutionalized children .  
In the 1997 report , while stating that accumulations of small arms and light weapons become excessive and destabilizing when a State , whether supplier or recipient , does not exercise restraint in the production , transfer , acquisition and holding of such weapons beyond those needed for legitimate national or collective defence and internal security , notes that there is no single cause for the accumulation of small arms and their subsequent transformation into instability and conflict .

The meeting concluded that successful gender mainstreaming is more likely to take place in countries where responsibility for it is not located in a single governmental body and where civil society is actively involved in advancing gender-equality issues .  
This is what makes the ultimate sanction of the United Nations so indispensable , since an international legal standard can not except in exceptional temporary situations be the prerogative of any single group of States .  
Our rich flora and fauna , marine life , mineral wealth and human potential is unparalleled , and this God-given untapped wealth can best be developed not by a single country but by our Mano River Union .  
In that connection , the Hungarian Parliament was expected to adopt a decision to reissue the four Geneva Conventions in a single document in the near future and a national interministerial commission on humanitarian law had been established as a practical means of ensuring the enhanced implementation of international humanitarian law in Hungary .  
Recent calls for such reform were born of a political desire to protect human rights in the context of international consensus , rather than through the unilateral imposition of a single cultural model .

As a representative had once said , the work of the Committee was the hardest of all , because it did not consist in merely discussing practical issues , reconciling interests or solving technical problems , but rather in something as basic as deciding what exactly was a society for all and achieving consensus among the different viewpoints of States on a single definition , based on a common concept of humanity . 
In 1992 , the member countries signed the Maastricht Treaty , agreeing to eliminate over 280 physical , technical , and fiscal barriers to the creation of a single market , and moved one step closer to the final stage of currency union .

One-thousand-six-hundred representatives from 131 countries came to Berlin and cooperated in the drafting of important resolutions on the promotion of international humanitarian law ; on the peaceful coexistence of ethnic , cultural and religious minorities , including migrant populations within a single State ; and on the need to revise the current global financial and economic model .  
It is the conviction of Malta that it must keep on working on the basis outlined in the Cairo Programme of Action and in accordance with the prevalent ethical and cultural values of Maltese society , as reflected in national legislation , so that , together with the international community , we may promote a decent and fulfilling life for every single human being on our planet and for future generations .  
The combination of a major development issue , such as biotechnology , with a focus approach on a specific aspect such as food production , had proved an effective way of approaching a single field of activity from multiple and complementary perspectives , and the Commission might like to take a similar approach to the development of a work programme for the next inter-sessional period .  
The reportedly typical public building accommodation visited by the Representative provides cramped living space , with extended families occupying single rooms originally designed to house one student attending higher education or technical institutes .  
My delegation hopes that in the future , instead of having to adopt two separate draft resolutions on the same subject , the First Committee and the General Assembly will be able to render unanimous support for a single draft resolution on nuclear disarmament negotiations that is comprehensive and acceptable to all .  
Mr . GOOSEN ( South Africa ) : It is obviously with deep regret that we hear today that the Conference on Disarmament , which is defined as the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum of the international community and which has the primary role in substantive negotiations on priority questions of disarmament , remains unable to reach a consensus on the establishment of a mechanism to deliberate on the issue of nuclear disarmament .  
It must not be forgotten that the European Union already has a single currency , is developing common foreign and defence policies , and even recently appointed a high official to coordinate that undertaking .

While there was no single model to resolve the problem of underdevelopment , international cooperation was increasingly necessary for the strengthening and sharing of the human , institutional , economic and technical capacities of States .  
Thus this single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum has been incapable of continuing negotiations on halting the production of fissile material for military purposes , known as cutoff , negotiations which were started in 1998 .  
The bright light of civil society and an active media is often discouraged by a single entity , thereby reducing the possibility of sunshines discouraging corruption and other inefficient decisions .  
Some government financial assistance is given to pensioners , single parent families , the temporarily disabled , the permanently mentally or physically handicapped and the unemployed or underemployed who do not have sufficient income to live on .  
Furthermore , the threat may not be determined on the basis of ulterior political motives there must be genuine international concern behind the sanctions , not the foreign or domestic policy considerations of a single State or group of States .

The Principles were developed with the express purpose of filling a gap : to meet the urgent need for a single document which restates existing international law pertaining to the rights of internally displaced persons and the obligations of Governments and insurgent groups towards these populations , and which provides practical guidance for the work of the Representative , international agencies and organizations and NGOs in the field .  
The vulnerability of the population is compounded by the continuing effects of the drought , the escalating conflict , massive internal displacement , the disruption of the livelihoods of farmers and labourers normally engaged in poppy cultivation , the absence of significant economic recovery , and the lack of a single effective national authority .  
That delegation also raised concerns regarding the possible transfer of access codes and control of space objects to creditors in cases of default , in particular in cases where the facilities of a single satellite were being shared by multiple users , including States , or where satellites served governmental and public service functions in addition to those of a purely commercial nature .  
Also recommends that international financial institutions , regional , national and local housing financing institutions and other credit facilities promote the participation of women and take into account their views to remove discriminatory policies and practices , giving special consideration to single women and households headed by women , and that these institutions evaluate and measure progress to this end ;  
During the biennium 2002-2003 , emphasis will be placed on better utilization of interpretation capacity ; further integration of the text-processing and electronic publishing functions into a single electronically supported work process through the more versatile utilization of staff resources , leading to greater efficiency ; and improvement of composition and graphic work by increasing in-house productivity through the use of new technologies and through contractual arrangements .  
Also recommends that international financial institutions , regional , national and local housing financing institutions and other credit facilities promote the participation of women and take into account their views to remove discriminatory policies and practices , giving special consideration to single women and households headed by women , and that these institutions evaluate and measure progress to this end ;  
That delegation also raised concerns regarding the possible transfer of access codes and control of space objects to creditors in cases of default , in particular in cases where the facilities of a single satellite were being shared by multiple users , including States , or where satellites served governmental and public service functions in addition to those of a purely commercial nature .

The UNMIBH police commissioner project remains an essential institutional initiative for creating an apolitical police service , shielded from direct political interference from the ministries by functioning under a single chain of command led by an experienced police professional , designated Police Commissioner or Director of Police .  
Action is required at all levels national , regional and worldwide and in many areas : disarmament , peacekeeping and peace-building , combating organized crime , ensuring the responsibility of producer and consumer States , without forgetting the need , in parallel , to pursue the whole range of actions to prevent and combat the underlying causes of conflicts .

The Final Document of the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament stated that it was deeply aware of the continuing requirement for a single disarmament negotiating forum of limited size , taking decisions on the basis of consensus .  
We must make good use of the forthcoming Review Conference to take more effective measures to address the remaining two core issues : strict control of private ownership and prevention of the transfer of small arms to non-state actors .  We continue to believe that the Conference on Disarmament is the single multilateral negotiating forum for all relevant disarmament matters .  
It is time that the necessary political will is displayed by those countries whose ambiguous positions have led the Conference on Disarmament to its current comatose state , so that the Conference can be activated to fulfil its intended role as the single multilateral negotiating forum on disarmament .  
Yet now , in contradiction to the remarks we have grown accustomed to hearing against those whom you accuse of dictatorship and authoritarian rule , we are seeing dozens of emergency measures and laws being adopted by the Governments of Western States , first and foremost the United States , as a result of a single painful event that has befallen them .  Do you realize , distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen , how many painful events have befallen the countries and peoples you have been accusing of being undemocratic ?
