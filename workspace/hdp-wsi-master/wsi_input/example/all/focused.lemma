The election also showed what might be a weakness in the KMT policy of priming its most elite members for central government offices , out of the desire to put the best brain power in decision-making positions concerning overall public policies .

The principle of recognizing mainland degrees has not changed , and the position of the MAC on this question has never changed .  
" The larger his paintings are , the greater they are , and these large paintings from after he was 70 are his most important and representative , " says Lin Hsin-yueh . Yang , whose work focused on nature throughout his life , had a hearty and robust character . " He was a real man .

Amidst the excitement and fury of a new tide of literary activity , 26-year-old Wang Anyi published The Falling Rain , a romantic short story about Wenwen walking through the rain in hopes of running across a boy she had once happened to meet . According to Sung Ju-shan , " Under the communist regime , with its stress on historical materialism , no one had ever before published a story that focused on the emotions of an adolescent girl .  
Wang Anyi 's short story was a trailblazer , because it appeared at a time when communist ideology still held considerable sway in the literary sphere . " Wang feels that there is no need for a writer to play the part of a social scientist and use a novel as a means of criticizing anything . She has always focused on the individual .  
Mr . Tseng , who makes his living from manufacturing metal parts for pet products , lives with his wife in Hsinchu , where they are both deeply involved in local charity work .

They are also both counselors in the Hsinchu Family Education Service Center . Their colleagues consider them a perfect couple .  
And when Taichung police cracked down on illegal drinking establishments , one station focused entirely on the response of the bars ' " public relations girls , " running a six-minute report in which the camera spent most of its time aimed at the girls ' thighs and skimpy tops .  
For example , in his efforts to photograph the brown tree frog , which lives in fast-flowing water , he risked being washed away himself . To get the spotted frog , an expert diver , he had to soak himself in ponds , picking up a skin disease and getting eaten alive by mosquitoes in the process . And , with his attention focused on frogs , he has accidentally brushed up against stinging nettles , been stung by highly toxic bees , and found himself face-to-face with poisonous snakes .  
He then issued a second statement , mainly to apologize for his previous gaffe , but this gesture was late in coming , and did little to assuage his critics , who continue to lambaste him . The most regrettable aspect of the whole brouhaha is the fact that it has thrown salt on the wounds of Taiwan 's former comfort women and focused painful public attention upon them once again . No one should have to go through what these women have endured .  
The Western-led model of environmental protection that focused on rescuing a few big creatures , like the panda , rhino , and whale , has failed . Despite huge sums of money spent on these causes , as in the case of the Formosan landlocked salmon , these species remain threatened . Meanwhile , micro-organisms of far greater importance to mankind are given the cold shoulder .  
Tzeng Ren-yow remarks , " Over the last two or three years , attention has been focused on flooding . " However , Tzeng himself is far more concerned about the coming drought . " Droughts are more costly than floods . Fields lie fallow ; reservoirs run short of water ; factories have their water cut off ; there is little water for residential use ; rivers become less able to cleanse themselves . . . .  
Because there are so many wonderful uses for sensors , the National Science Council listed them as a scientific and technological focal point more than 10 years ago , and the ITRI started to research and develop them . Unfortunately , at that time most investors were focused on the stock and real estate markets , and the hot electronics sector swept away all investment capital . This left no money whatsoever for unfashionable fields such as sensors .  
Therefore , in the first decade of the FFTC 's existence , its programs were focused on soil and fertilizer management , the nutrient requirements of rice plants , and control of major rice pests . It was the first international center to specialize in control of rice brown plant hopper , which became much more destructive after the introduction of short-term high-yielding rice varieties and chemical pesticides .  
Over the past few decades , the history of Taiwan has become a hot academic specialty , and breakthroughs have been many , but the field remains plagued by a certain lack of depth . Ever since the Ming loyalist Koxinga ( Zheng Chenggong ) ruled over the island in the late 17th century , almost all Chinese-language scholarship on the subject has consisted of written tracts , with very few visual images . Japanese-language scholarship has been more diverse in nature , but has focused largely on the period of Japan 's colonial rule here .  
Before the 1980s , academic work on aborigines was largely confined to anthropology . Research focused on things like the clothing , social structure , and myths and legends of the various tribes . Aboriginal culture was treated as something already dead , as a museum specimen . This type of research was of no help at all in understanding how living indigenous people were responding to changing times .  
In recent years , annual reports published by American and European business associations based in Taipei have focused on the key question of opening the " three links , " shorthand for resuming normal trade , transportation , and mail routes with mainland China , and other cross-strait economic and trade policy . In fact , this issue has caused a number of foreign manufacturers to close their operations in Taiwan and to relocate to mainland China .  
However , external criticism focused on how the Ministry of Finance turned the eighth seat over to representation by the Executive Yuan Development Fund . If the shares held by the Executive Yuan Development Fund are sold off under the announced privatization policy , the government will lose its board majority . If there is a change of government after the presidential elections next year , the huge operational power of Mega Holdings will revert to private shareholders and chairman Cheng Shen-chi 's position will become unassailable .  
But it 's a model suitable only to authors willing to demean themselves . As a whole , mainland writers are either concerned with popular urban lit or more focused on their own high personal expectations about their work . Few are candidates to write popular motivational books , let alone take long tours around the country to publicize these books .  
( Laura Li / tr . by Anthony W . Sariti ) The recent referendum held in Pinglin Township favoring the opening of a Pinglin exit on the Taipei-Ilan Freeway led to the resignation of Environmental Protection Administrator Hao Lung-bin and focused public opinion on the issue of advisory referendums . The possibility that during the March presidential election next year referendums will be simultaneously held on entry into the World Health Organization , the fourth nuclear power station , and the reform of the National Assembly is also drawing close attention from observers .  
On the vast Chianan Plain with its endless views of green rice paddies redolent with rice blossoms , Wu Ching , a teacher of fine carving , kneels on the ground , head bent and eyes intently scanning the earth beneath him . A line of ants are marching across the ground . It could be accurately stated that the ants are focused on their work and completely oblivious to Wu Ching .  
" Sadly , the average person does n't know very much about this , " laments Nelson Yang . Because in the past mountain climbers or naturalists neglected the history of the opening and development of Taiwan 's mountain areas , people have focused only on the flatlands and shoreline that make up just one fourth of the total land area of the island . They have little knowledge of the length and breadth of the mountains and are unable properly to understand the development of Taiwan 's ethnic and cultural diversity .  
Aside from the perils of daily life , the great exploits of history that are worthy of the name " exploration " were highly focused in their goals . Tang-dynasty monk Xuanzang 's 17-year quest for Buddhist scriptures in India , Genghis Khan 's long westward campaign to take Khwarazm , or the " voyages of discovery " of Zheng He in the late 14th century and the Spanish and Portuguese in the 15th , were daring adventures that reaped rich rewards and inspired many to follow after .  
In September of last year , Dr . Lin , who had for a long time focused her research on blood groups and ethnic groups , published the results of a study entitled " Correlation between SARS virus infection and the human leukocyte antigen .

In fact , although the spotlight tends , quite understandably , to be on newsworthy issues - bank rescues , intervention in the stock market , the latest Exchange Fund results , the " alarming " strengthening of the Hong Kong dollar - much of the work of any central bank has to be focused on the longer term , on the implementation of sustainable , consistent , dependable policies on a horizon that lies well beyond the daily concerns of most of us .  
The election also showed what might be a weakness in the KMT policy of priming its most elite members for central government offices , out of the desire to put the best brain power in decision-making positions concerning overall public policies .

The principle of recognizing mainland degrees has not changed , and the position of the MAC on this question has never changed .  
" The larger his paintings are , the greater they are , and these large paintings from after he was 70 are his most important and representative , " says Lin Hsin-yueh . Yang , whose work focused on nature throughout his life , had a hearty and robust character . " He was a real man . " The powerful and moving brushstrokes in these large works that need no detailed commentary completely convey his forthright personality as well as the incomparable power of nature .

It 's like regaining one 's youth , " says Dr . Wang , a former director of the surgical ward of Chang Gung Children 's Hospital . He states that in Europe geriatric medicine focused on controlling aging long ago developed into a full-fledged specialization providing full medical services , and that this field is now being introduced into Taiwan .  
Amidst the excitement and fury of a new tide of literary activity , 26-year-old Wang Anyi published The Falling Rain , a romantic short story about Wenwen walking through the rain in hopes of running across a boy she had once happened to meet . According to Sung Ju-shan , " Under the communist regime , with its stress on historical materialism , no one had ever before published a story that focused on the emotions of an adolescent girl .  
Wang Anyi 's short story was a trailblazer , because it appeared at a time when communist ideology still held considerable sway in the literary sphere . " Wang feels that there is no need for a writer to play the part of a social scientist and use a novel as a means of criticizing anything . She has always focused on the individual .  
Mr . Tseng , who makes his living from manufacturing metal parts for pet products , lives with his wife in Hsinchu , where they are both deeply involved in local charity work .

For example , in his efforts to photograph the brown tree frog , which lives in fast-flowing water , he risked being washed away himself . To get the spotted frog , an expert diver , he had to soak himself in ponds , picking up a skin disease and getting eaten alive by mosquitoes in the process . And , with his attention focused on frogs , he has accidentally brushed up against stinging nettles , been stung by highly toxic bees , and found himself face-to-face with poisonous snakes .  
He then issued a second statement , mainly to apologize for his previous gaffe , but this gesture was late in coming , and did little to assuage his critics , who continue to lambaste him . The most regrettable aspect of the whole brouhaha is the fact that it has thrown salt on the wounds of Taiwan 's former comfort women and focused painful public attention upon them once again . No one should have to go through what these women have endured .  
The Western-led model of environmental protection that focused on rescuing a few big creatures , like the panda , rhino , and whale , has failed . Despite huge sums of money spent on these causes , as in the case of the Formosan landlocked salmon , these species remain threatened .

Tzeng Ren-yow remarks , " Over the last two or three years , attention has been focused on flooding . " However , Tzeng himself is far more concerned about the coming drought . " Droughts are more costly than floods . Fields lie fallow ; reservoirs run short of water ; factories have their water cut off ; there is little water for residential use ; rivers become less able to cleanse themselves . . . .  
Because there are so many wonderful uses for sensors , the National Science Council listed them as a scientific and technological focal point more than 10 years ago , and the ITRI started to research and develop them .

Over the past few decades , the history of Taiwan has become a hot academic specialty , and breakthroughs have been many , but the field remains plagued by a certain lack of depth . Ever since the Ming loyalist Koxinga ( Zheng Chenggong ) ruled over the island in the late 17th century , almost all Chinese-language scholarship on the subject has consisted of written tracts , with very few visual images . Japanese-language scholarship has been more diverse in nature , but has focused largely on the period of Japan 's colonial rule here .  
Before the 1980s , academic work on aborigines was largely confined to anthropology . Research focused on things like the clothing , social structure , and myths and legends of the various tribes . Aboriginal culture was treated as something already dead , as a museum specimen . This type of research was of no help at all in understanding how living indigenous people were responding to changing times .  
In recent years , annual reports published by American and European business associations based in Taipei have focused on the key question of opening the " three links , " shorthand for resuming normal trade , transportation , and mail routes with mainland China , and other cross-strait economic and trade policy .

However , external criticism focused on how the Ministry of Finance turned the eighth seat over to representation by the Executive Yuan Development Fund . If the shares held by the Executive Yuan Development Fund are sold off under the announced privatization policy , the government will lose its board majority .

But it 's a model suitable only to authors willing to demean themselves . As a whole , mainland writers are either concerned with popular urban lit or more focused on their own high personal expectations about their work . Few are candidates to write popular motivational books , let alone take long tours around the country to publicize these books .  
( Laura Li / tr . by Anthony W . Sariti ) The recent referendum held in Pinglin Township favoring the opening of a Pinglin exit on the Taipei-Ilan Freeway led to the resignation of Environmental Protection Administrator Hao Lung-bin and focused public opinion on the issue of advisory referendums .

A line of ants are marching across the ground . It could be accurately stated that the ants are focused on their work and completely oblivious to Wu Ching .  
" Sadly , the average person does n't know very much about this , " laments Nelson Yang . Because in the past mountain climbers or naturalists neglected the history of the opening and development of Taiwan 's mountain areas , people have focused only on the flatlands and shoreline that make up just one fourth of the total land area of the island . They have little knowledge of the length and breadth of the mountains and are unable properly to understand the development of Taiwan 's ethnic and cultural diversity .  
Aside from the perils of daily life , the great exploits of history that are worthy of the name " exploration " were highly focused in their goals . Tang-dynasty monk Xuanzang 's 17-year quest for Buddhist scriptures in India , Genghis Khan 's long westward campaign to take Khwarazm , or the " voyages of discovery " of Zheng He in the late 14th century and the Spanish and Portuguese in the 15th , were daring adventures that reaped rich rewards and inspired many to follow after .

Attention continued to be focused on disadvantaged persons in peasant and indigenous settlements , as well as on the improvement , during this period , of services in the outlying neighbourhoods of Asuncin , which were reorganized and rescaled because they were out of step with the actual demographic situation and the demand for services .  
The programme budget for the biennium 19961997 , as approved by the General Assembly , stated that the efforts of the international community were still focused on weapons of mass destruction , particularly nuclear ones , but were becoming increasingly concerned with the growth and proliferation of various types of conventional weapons ( A / 50 / 6 / Rev . 1,3 para .  2.81 ) .

A focused , transparent and accountable Centre was also worthy of support and commitment from Member States , and he urged the Commission at its current session to send a positive financial signal in that regard , otherwise some very difficult decisions would have to be made .  
The discussion focused on six main subjects : measures to promote recovery and sustained economic growth ; financial architecture and financial flows for development ; increasing participation and cross-sectoral coherence ; international policy on external debt ; economic crisis and social policy initiatives ; and further cooperation between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions .  
UNDPs second country programme for St .

It emphasized the creation of a free trade area in SADC and focused on the issue of non-tariff barriers .  
A country improves its chances of success in the struggle to reduce poverty when it achieves strong , sustained economic growth which creates a substantial expansion in the number of high-productivity jobs ; when the incomes such growth generates are also helped by a policy aimed at defending their purchasing power through low inflation ; and when support also exists in the form of significant programmes of well focused public transfers .
