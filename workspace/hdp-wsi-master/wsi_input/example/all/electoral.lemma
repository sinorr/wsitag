This is extremely unwise .  The US and Chinese electoral systems can not be completely similar , because our historical traditions , economic and cultural development standards , educational level and social systems differ .  
George W . Bush , who was leading by a razor-thin majority in Florida early this morning , announced on television networks that he had won 25 electoral votes in Florida , accumulating more than 270 votes - - the threshold to be crossed for the presidency .  No sooner had he made this announcement than a vote recount was declared because of too narrow a ballot margin .  Hence a dramatic change rare in US presidential elections .  
At a Democratic Party meeting held in Chicago on January 10 , President Clinton broke from his circumspect attitude toward the presidential race by stating , " Our candidate won the popular vote but the Republicans won the electoral vote only after they stopped the vote recount . "  
These energetic and keen VRAs not only help register eligible voters who may otherwise be left out of the electoral roll for one reason or another .  They are also spreading the message of civic education .  This is the perfect exercise for introducing our young people to the democratic process , and to help them develop a true sense of belonging and commitment to Hong Kong , their home , " she said .  
" Hong Kong has a comprehensive body of electoral laws which prohibit corrupt practices , and the entire electoral system is transparent .  All candidates have to declare the source and amount of donations they received , and to account for the amount spent .  Such transparency will facilitate mutual policing by candidates and public scrutiny , " he said .  
Commenting on the two electoral bills , the spokesman said : " Our objective is very clear .  We wish to ensure that our electoral systems continues to develop in an orderly and progressive manner in accordance with the blueprint set out in the Basic Law . We wish to enhance our community 's awareness of and participation in elections .  We also wish to ensure that future elections will remain open , fair , clean , honest and acceptable to the community . "  
At the Legislative Council meeting today ( May 21 ) , the Secretary for Constitutional Affairs , Mr Stephen Lam , said that the Basic Law stipulated universal suffrage as the ultimate aim for constitutional development , and that the electoral methods should be specified in the light of our actual situation and the principle of gradual and orderly progress .  
Heavy on Public Opinion : In the 1985 Taipei City Council election , his vote total was high enough to elect four city councilmen [ Taiwan uses a multiple member single vote system ] . In the 1986 Legislative Yuan election , he was elected with 140,000 votes , highest in his district . In repeated electoral victories , he has overwhelmingly won over voters .  
Sun Ta-chuan , a lecturer in the philosophy department at Soochow University , who is also of Puyuma ancestry , observes that in traditional tribal society leaders inherited their power or were selected by the nobility from within their own ranks , which is quite at odds with the current political system ; this can make it difficult for people to adapt to participating in an electoral system .  
That Liu Shao-tang 's death elicited such a huge response at a time when all of Taiwan 's media are packed with electoral news in the run-up to the March presidential ballot , is not only a measure of the widespread respect which Liu earned by his lifelong professionalism and refusal to lower standards , but also shows that Taiwan is still a place with deep feelings and concern for intellectual matters .  
For example , in Malawi a low - cost operation based on voluntary contributions and the involvement of the international community in Malawi and the region also allowed broad geographical and chronological coverage of the electoral process .  
It should maintain institutional memory and develop doctrine , standard operating procedures and operationality in this area , and have primary responsibility for substantive guidance and support of the electoral component of future peacekeeping missions .  
MEXICO Request : In late May 1994 , the Government requested technical assistance to national observers for the elections scheduled for 21 August 1994 and , prior to the elections , the preparation of an analytical report on the Mexican electoral system .  
It coordinated and monitored humanitarian assistance operations , provided technical assistance to and verified the entire electoral process , culminating in the holding of free and fair elections on 27 to 29 October 1994 .  
In 1948 , at the end of a civil war in my country which had as its main goal the defence of democratic institutions and the re-establishment of an electoral regime which assured respect for the popular vote , the victors , instead of using arms as a means to stay in power , decided to abolish the armed forces .  
As one of the 14 founder members , India looks forward to participating in all its activities , aimed at promoting and advancing democracy , improving and consolidating electoral processes , strengthening and supporting national capacity to develop the full range of democratic instruments , and promoting transparency and accountability in the context of democratic development .  
As a political non-governmental organization , we are active in observing troublesome electoral processes , campaigning for political and civil rights where necessary and supporting those causes that we consider fair in international politics .  
In cases where a peace-keeping operation has been necessary , we believe it is legitimate and useful for the United Nations to maintain a presence on the ground after the end of the operation in order to ensure that its action is followed up in such a way as to contribute to a lasting restoration of peace through measures for coordinated consolidation in the economic , social , institutional , electoral , humanitarian and human rights fields .  
Demilitarization , the control of small arms , institutional reform , improved police and judicial systems , the monitoring of human rights , electoral reform and social and economic development can be as valuable in preventing conflict as in healing the wounds after conflict has occurred .  
Annex 7 provides that the Angolan electoral process , left incomplete because of the post-electoral crisis of 1992 , must be completed through the holding of the second round of presidential elections , which are to take place once the United Nations has declared that the requisite conditions for this have been fulfilled .  
They also shared the view that steps could be taken to facilitate the early conclusion of negotiations on complex substantive issues that are yet to be considered , namely " economic and social issues and the agrarian situation " , " strengthening of civilian power and role of the army in a democratic society " and " constitutional reforms and electoral regime " .  
The revised timetable provides for completion of two main substantive issues ( economic and social issues and the agrarian situation ; and strengthening of civilian power and role of the army in a democratic society ) before the electoral campaign is fully under way .  
Let me assure you that the Government is prepared to propose the necessary transitional or definitive amendments to the electoral law and is already working on the various legal formulae which , once the armed conflict is over , would enable URNG members to be reintegrated into society on a basis of full legality and without any restriction on their civil and political rights .  
Recognizing also that there is no single political system or single model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples , and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
The progress report focused on prerequisites of learning from experience with United Nations peace-keeping operations , and on the status of a ready capacity to act for six substantive components of complex missions : information , electoral , repatriation , human rights , civilian police and military .  
In addition to its introduction and my concluding observations , the report includes seven sections , devoted respectively to military aspects ; public security aspects ; human rights , the judicial system and the Commission on the Truth ; electoral matters ; economic and social issues ; financial aspects ; and administrative aspects .  
Besides the introduction and my concluding observations , the report is divided into six sections , related to : public security ; human rights and the judicial system ; economic and social issues ; electoral matters ; technical assistance programmes ; and administrative aspects .  
ETHIOPIA Request : With the Government 's agreement , the Donor Election Unit , which had been established in February 1995 by the international donor community to monitor the electoral process leading up to the national and regional elections held on 7 May 1995 , requested UNDP to provide management and logistical support to the Unit .  
also that there is no single political system or single universal model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
also that there is no single political system or single universal model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples , and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
Reaffirms further that electoral assistance to Member States should be provided by the United Nations only at the request and with the consent of specific sovereign States , by virtue of resolutions adopted by the Security Council or the General Assembly in each case , in strict conformity with the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States , or in special circumstances such as cases of decolonization , or in the context of regional or international peace processes ;  
The presidential , legislative , regional and local elections to be held in Zaire in 1997 are an opportunity for the Belgian Government and the European Union to show their active solidarity within the framework of collective electoral assistance , which must be coordinated by the United Nations .  
El Salvador finds itself today on the road to becoming an open participatory society in full development , thanks , among other factors , to its enormous efforts in implementing an ambitious agenda of change and achieving the agreed commitments related to the transfer of land and human settlements , the strengthening of the National Civilian Police , the modernization of the judicial and electoral systems , and the ratification of international instruments on human rights . 
Among other things , a number of examples are given of the assistance provided by the United Nations system for political parties or movements , the mobilization of civil society , electoral assistance , communications media to enable them to act freely and independently , creating a political culture through observance and monitoring of human rights , improved accountability , support for transparency and quality of public sector management , democratic government structures , and strengthening the rule of law . 
Examples of this trend are the free elections that have been held in recent years elections that were open , competitive and fair ; the respect for existing legislation ; the creation of constitutional courts and the appointment of special prosecutors for human rights ; the existence of independent electoral tribunals and multi-party parliaments ; the promotion of autonomous and efficient judicial systems and the development of programmes to promote a culture of peace and democracy .  
Thirdly and finally , the international community , through UNOMIL , humanitarian cooperation , support for the needs of economic and social development and the monitoring of human rights and the electoral process , inter alia , is strengthening national and regional efforts .  
The draft resolution failed to take account of the fact that no single political system or electoral process was suited to all nations and peoples and that political systems were subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors .  
Recognizing also that there is no single political system or single universal model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples , and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
Reaffirms further that electoral assistance to Member States should be provided by the United Nations only at the request and with the consent of specific sovereign States , by virtue of resolutions adopted by the Security Council or the General Assembly in each case , in strict conformity with the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States , or in special circumstances such as cases of decolonization , or in the context of regional or international peace processes ;  
In general , desk officers and military mission officers deal with day-to-day operational and related political issues that affect the mandate and conduct of operations , as well as a broad range of other issues , which include military , logistical , administrative , humanitarian , electoral and legal issues .  
While the largest proportion of activities fall into the traditional areas of administrative reform , training and financial systems improvement , it is increasingly common to receive requests from the field in emerging areas such as transparency , accountability , judicial and legislative administration , disaster management , electoral administration and result-oriented management based on productivity improvement .  
The United Nations , which is responsible for implementing the settlement plan and interpreting its provisions , maintains that anyone who has submitted an application is an applicant and is entitled to be identified by means of a neutral and objective procedure which is " firstly , to establish the personal identity of the applicant and , secondly , to determine whether he or she qualified for inclusion in the electoral roll under one of the five eligibility criteria . 
Recent years have witnessed a wave of democratization at the national level , as an increasing number of countries have adopted multi-party systems , organized free and fair elections and begun the movement towards more open , more participatory societies , frequently with the requested electoral assistance of the United Nations .  
This is reflected , in particular , in the sharp reduction in political violence ( although the phenomenon of banditry and the abductions of election observers and officials which have punctuated the electoral campaign are still causing concern ) , the high level of public freedom , the increasingly independent functioning of the branches of Government , the strengthening of local authorities and the reduction and conversion of the armed forces .  
Recent years have witnessed a wave of democratization at the national level , as an increasing number of countries have adopted multi-party systems , organized free and fair elections and begun the movement towards more open , more participatory societies , frequently with the requested electoral assistance of the United Nations .  
While ECOWAS Foreign Ministers have identified the requisite conditions to ensure free and fair elections , we attach great importance to the full independence of the electoral Commission and to disarmament substantial enough so that the free participation of the Liberian people in the democratic process will not be constrained .  
Difficulties developed and delays again occurred in a number of areas , including the institutional consolidation of the public security sector ; the adoption of legal and constitutional reforms ; the reform of the judicial and electoral systems ; the transfer of land to former combatants ; and the transfer of rural human settlements to their current occupants .  
In recent experience , some peacekeeping operations have been mandated to include different combinations of the following tasks : monitoring of cease-fires and buffer zones , protecting humanitarian convoys , disarming and demobilizing ex-combatants , reforming military establishments , demining , establishing police forces , organizing or monitoring elections , monitoring human rights , promoting electoral and judicial reform , promoting aspects of civil administration and coordinating economic rehabilitation .  
The United Nations is the main international organization requested by Governments to undertake tasks such as facilitating dialogue between warring parties , preventing renewal of internal armed conflict , strengthening infrastructure , improving local security and facilitating electoral processes .  
A permanent and independent electoral commission responsible for the conduct of elections would be an indispensable component of a neutral political environment in which parties , candidates and the public have maximum faith in the integrity of the electoral process .  
The Special Representative believes that the speedy creation of an independent electoral commission would send an unambiguous signal to the people of Cambodia that the Government of Cambodia is committed to free and fair elections .  
It was essential to ensure full compliance with the reporting requirements contained in the Charter of the United Nations ; direct input , through the voice of petitioners , from the peoples of the Territories ; the annual multilateral review of all material presented ; consideration of the situation in the Territories directly in the Special Committee ; and reflection in appropriate decisions of the General Assembly upon the advice of the Special Committee of specific avenues for United Nations input ( such as visiting missions , electoral assistance or coordination of any kind ) .  
In addition , key issues pertaining to the holding of free and fair elections in Liberia have yet to be decided , including the process to be used for selecting a neutral and independent Electoral Commission ; the status of the Constitution and of the electoral law ; whether the elections would be full-term elections or only transitional elections ; and the scope and extent of the polling .  
In preparation for legislative elections held in June , August and September 1995 and the presidential elections of December 1995 , the technical team coordinated a large civic education programme and undertook , inter alia , the preparation of an electoral budget and coordination of financial support through a United Nations trust fund established for that purpose ; preparation of an operational and logistical plan , and assistance in its implementation ; and support in the design of a communication plan and a deployment plan for registration and voting periods .  
Assistance in the legislative process , especially with regard to the following areas : ( i ) right of everyone to take part in the government of his or her country ; ( ii ) equal access to public service ; ( iii ) criteria of democratic elections ( e.g . universal and equal suffrage ; the secrecy of the ballot ; respect for freedom of opinion , expression , information , assembly and association ) ; ( iv ) independent review of alleged irregularities ; and ( v ) objective and independent electoral administration ;  
Once these fundamental policy issues have been resolved , approximately 140 days will be required for the resolution and implementation of pending technical and support aspects , such as public information programmes , registration of voters , candidacy nomination and campaigning , staff training , data and systems verification and materials supply , to ensure that the electoral process is conducted in a fair manner .  
The nationalistic policies , economic interests and electoral considerations that were inherent in political parties , interest groups and Governments fostered attitudes of rejection and intolerance of migrant workers , refugees , asylum-seekers , minorities and indigenous populations .  Very often , the media and new technologies , such as electronic mail and the Internet , facilitated the large-scale dissemination of racist , xenophobic and neofascist practices .  
Both major parties in the Government had made unequivocal statements that the coming national and municipal elections in 1998 would be free and fair , and had asked the armed forces and members of the electoral commission to remain neutral . 
These expressions of concern notwithstanding , an active electoral campaign was conducted by all major political parties , including those that had boycotted the second round of parliamentary elections held two years ago .  
The committee is currently focusing its work on a review of Liberian electoral laws and constitutional provisions ; the establishment of an independent and impartial administrative mechanism for the management of the electoral process ; the role of the international community in the holding of elections ; and the technical , logistic and financial assistance necessary to support the electoral process .  
Besides the concluding observations , the main body of the present report is divided into six sections , on public security ; human rights and the judicial system ; economic and social issues ; electoral matters ; technical assistance programmes ; and administrative questions .  
The implementation of those recommendations , which included the creation of a national civil register responsible for issuing a single identity and voter card , the introduction of residential voting , and the introduction of proportional representation in the municipal councils , would constitute a significant advance in El Salvador 's electoral system . 
The level of electoral participation is the result of many different social and political factors , including the impact of civil institutions on the daily lives of Guatemalans , the capacity of political parties to fulfil people 's expectations , the degree of organized participation by citizens in social and political life and their level of civic education , all of which are elements which the package of peace agreements already signed seeks to strengthen .  The electoral process is marred by specific shortcomings which impede the effective enjoyment of the right to vote .  
Taking into account the new functions of the Guatemalan armed forces , as set forth in the Agreement on the Strengthening of Civilian Power and on the Role of the Armed Forces in a Democratic Society , and considering the Parties ' shared objective of promoting the broadest possible participation of citizens in the electoral process , the Commission is invited to examine the desirability of granting , in the future , members of the Guatemalan armed forces on active duty the political right of voting in Guatemalan elections .  
To that end , the Parties propose that , based on the electoral rolls , the Supreme Electoral Tribunal , in consultation with political parties , should identify the places in which voting centres are to be set up within municipalities ; such places would be those which have large numbers of residents living a long way from the municipal capital and which are also accessible to party poll-watchers and electoral observers .  
In particular , he stressed the need for fundamental political rights and freedoms to be protected during the electoral campaign , if the elections were to be recognized as free and fair .  
Where countries have developed effective temporary strategies in an attempt to achieve equality of participation , a wide range of measures has been implemented , including recruiting , financially assisting and training women candidates , amending electoral procedures , developing campaigns directed at equal participation , setting numerical goals and quotas and targeting women for appointment to public positions such as the judiciary or other professional groups that play an essential part in the everyday life of all societies .  
The professionalism of the role the army now plays in national life was made clear by its comportment during the electoral process of March 1997 : in marked contrast to the record of military interference in the history of El Salvador , the army demonstrated its respect for the democratic decision of the Salvadorian people that those elections represented .  8 .  Before the signing of the peace agreements , public security functions were carried out by bodies dependent on the armed forces .  
In a letter dated 24 July 1997 addressed to the President of the Security Council ( S / 1997 / 581 ) , the Secretary-General informed the Council of the successful completion of the electoral process in Liberia , which constituted the final element of the revised schedule on implementation of the Abuja Agreement ( S / 1995 / 742 , annex ) .  
That Constitution included clear provisions concerning collective land ownership , the management of natural resources , recognition of indigenous forms of government and administration , protection of the identity and cultural heritage of the indigenous peoples , the official status of the languages and dialects they used and the creation of special electoral districts ensuring their representation in Congress .  
In recent experience United Nations electoral assistance has been geared more to smaller missions that provide technical assistance to the electoral authorities of the Member State concerned with coordinating support provided by others or to providing a symbolic United Nations presence , compared with the large missions of prior years that organized , conducted or observed the elections .  
Acknowledging that United Nations electoral assistance has facilitated the holding of successful elections in several Member States which resulted in the orderly and non-violent assumption of office by elected officials , recognizing that elections can be free and fair only if held free of coercion and intimidation , and underlining the importance of respect for the results of elections that have been verified as free and fair ,  
Taking note of the statement by the President of the Security Council of 30 July 1997 [ 4 ] in which the Council , inter alia , welcomed the successful holding of presidential and legislative elections in Liberia on 19 July 1997 , and noted with satisfaction the declaration in the joint certification statement by the Secretary-General and the Chairman of the Economic Community of West African States that the electoral process had been free , fair and credible and that the outcome of the elections reflected the will of the Liberian people ,  
The system of financial assistance for returnees had set the stage for these changes as early as 1982 , but it was not until 1986 with the introduction of strict controls on foreigners ' entry and stay in France and widespread identity checks , that all immigrant groups were designated as potentially responsible for everything wrong with French society , an attitude which encouraged a particularly disturbing racist and xenophobic movement in France , especially at the electoral level . 
Concerned by the climate in which the electoral process has taken place , the European Union expresses its firm hope that the Haitian people will be able as soon as possible to express its will in free , honest and transparent elections , held in accordance with rules and procedures accepted by all , in which citizens have the widest possible range of options and choices .  
A credible and independent human rights commission , along with a genuinely independent national electoral commission , could make an important contribution to protecting stability and promoting the observance of human rights in Cambodia in the lead-up to what we strongly hope will be free , fair and credible elections in May next year .  
The mission , in its broadest sense , must coordinate and implement humanitarian relief , civil affairs , electoral assistance , police and judicial reorganization , human rights and economic and social reconstruction actions that must be sustained long after the guns have been silenced .  
It identified three key conditions for success : a fair and credible political framework ; an efficient and well-planned electoral operation ; and adequate support from the international community .  
As stated in his previous report , the Special Representative believes that the speedy creation of an independent electoral commission would send an unambiguous signal to the people of Cambodia that the Government of Cambodia is committed to free and fair elections .  
The net additional requirements of $ 536,400 for commercial communications were attributable to the satellite user charges from the previous mandate period ( $ 356,200 ) , recorded in the reporting period because of the late submission of invoices and the extensive use of satellite facilities by the military , civilian police and electoral observer components of the mission in November and December 1994 ( $ 626,000 ) . ( b ) Main trunking contract .  
I would just like to mention several items deserving of careful consideration at this essential stage of the preparations : the urgent installation of the independent Electoral Commission and the reconstituted Supreme Court ; the registration of voters ; and the return of refugees and I would like to stress that this is indispensable for the credibility of the entire electoral process .  
Taking note of the presidential statement of 30 July 1997 [ 1 ] in which the Security Council , inter alia , welcomed the successful holding of presidential and legislative elections in Liberia on 19 July 1997 , noted with satisfaction the declaration in the Joint Certification Statement by the Secretary-General and the Chairman of the Economic Community of West African States that the electoral process had been free , fair and credible and that the outcome of the elections reflected the will of the Liberian people ,  
The conferences , held in South Africa , focused on reorganizing the judiciary ; adopting a bill of rights ; developing affirmative action programmes ; designing a nationwide public defender service ; comparing institutional models for enforcing a constitutional guarantee of gender equality , and evaluating electoral systems .  
Recognizing also that there is no single political system or single universal model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples , and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
Further reaffirms that electoral assistance to Member States should be provided by the United Nations only at the request and with the consent of specific sovereign States , in strict conformity with the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States , or in special circumstances such as cases of decolonization , or in the context of regional or international peace processes ;  
His Government ( a democratically elected one , as the international and regional organizations that had supervised the electoral process had duly reported ) had enacted just such domestic legislation , and had met , and would continue to meet , its corresponding international obligations .  
Turning to the operative part of the draft resolution , he said that , while paragraph 1 welcomed his Governments declared commitment to civilian rule , there was no mention of the positive steps which it had taken to fulfil that commitment , which included the establishment of a national electoral commission , the registration of voters and political parties and the delimitation of constituencies .  
Recent experience has demonstrated , however , that United Nations assistance rendered in the field of electoral assistance is geared more and more to smaller missions , which give technical assistance to the electoral authorities of the Member State concerned in coordinating the electoral support provided by others , or provide a symbolic United Nations presence , rather than the large missions of prior years for which it organized and conducted ( e.g . Cambodia ) or observed ( e.g .  
Missions , at the request of Governments , to provide assistance in the fields of governance and public administration policy development , administrative restructuring , civil service reform , electoral assistance , government capacity for improved performance in the public sector , government capacity for developing infrastructure and protecting the environment , post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction of government machinery , government capacity for social development , financial management , government accounting and reporting and public-private interaction ; ( ii ) Group training .  
An election implementation plan was agreed between the OSCE Mission and my Office based on the principles that implementation of the election result are : the responsibility of the Bosnia and Herzegovina authorities ; an integral part of the electoral process and , therefore , will be firmly anchored in the rules and regulations ; certified in a two-step process ensuring that final certification is not issued before the successful installation of municipal councils has taken place .  
Following the official announcement of the results of the recently concluded elections in Liberia , I am pleased to inform you of the successful completion of the electoral process , which constituted the final element of the revised schedule of implementation of the Abuja Agreement . In support of the efforts of the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) , the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia ( UNOMIL ) played an effective and critical role in bringing about this outcome .  
Included in this latter group are the United Nations political and economic and social departments ( Department of Political Affairs , Department of Peacekeeping Operations and Department for Economic and Social Affairs ) and the World Health Organization . The political departments of the United Nations Secretariat consider the Agency 's support for the rule of law , promotion of human rights , democratization , human capacity-building and electoral assistance as strong potential areas , particularly in respect of cooperation for peacekeeping and peace-building programmes . 
For the purposes of realizing the will of the people and their right to self-determination , creating a responsible Government , preventing a monopoly of power and administrative corruption , electing representatives to the electoral bodies , ensuring free and fair periodical election of the leadership ; the principles of democracy and pluralism shall constitute the mainspring of the future political system to be formed in Afghanistan .  
The report should have contained a functional analysis of the backstopping requirements of peacekeeping operations as they relate to the implementation of their mandates ( military , civilian police , human rights monitoring , humanitarian , electoral assistance ) .  
Since my report of 20 July 1998 , the political situation has not improved ; it is still dominated by the protracted electoral and institutional crisis , which continues to erode the moral , political , economic and social fabric of the country . 
The Office of Operations leads the planning process by providing the overall framework , developing options for courses of action , leading reconnaissance missions to the field and coordinating and integrating inputs from within the Department and from other entities ( e.g . military , police , humanitarian , electoral , human rights and other aspects including logistics , support and staffing requirements ) into a comprehensive plan for approval by the Security Council .  
In 1998 , IPU published a model code of conduct for elections13 which acknowledges that a successful and informed electoral process is the joint responsibility of all involved : political parties and candidates ; supporters and voters ; police and security forces ; Governments and public officials ; media and observers .  
In response to a series of commitments which were adopted at a round table jointly organized in 1995 by the United Nations and International IDEA on the topic of international electoral observation , International IDEA has published a code of conduct for the ethical and professional observation of elections , which emphasized the standards of comprehensiveness , transparency and accuracy in observation .  
Once the focal point for electoral assistance has determined that a coordination and support mission is both desirable and feasible , an electoral assistance secretariat is established in the country to plan and manage all aspects of the international observation operation , including the provision of logistical and technical support to the Joint International Observer Group ( JIOG ) .  
Such assistance can be classified in three general categories : ( i ) those contributing to national capacity-building through the establishment of new electoral institutions or the strengthening of existing capabilities ; ( ii ) those which relate to the human rights aspects of the electoral process ; and ( iii ) those which provide specific , legal , constitutional , logistic or technical advice or various types of electoral equipment and supplies .  
Common issues mentioned in these assessments that proved problematic included electoral planning , such as unrealistic timetables , late delivery of polling materials and observers pulled out before vote counting ; insufficient concern about capacity-building , such as insufficient voter education ; and personnel and staffing issues , such as untrained or inexperienced observers .  
The archive should be organized by major substantive and support tasks , including monitoring ceasefires and buffer zones , protecting humanitarian convoys , disarming and demobilizing ex-combatants , reforming military establishments , defining and establishing police forces , organizing or monitoring elections , monitoring human rights , promoting electoral and judicial reform , promoting aspects of civil administration and coordinating economic rehabilitation .  
Though the 1998 legislative elections were generally considered free and fair , subsequent reports by MINURCA and by the Mixed and Independent Electoral Commission ( CEMI ) , which organized the elections , identified a number of shortcomings and proposed recommendations for the improvement of the electoral process .  
In this connection , MINURCA is assuring the opposition that the international electoral observers to be deployed starting next month ( see paras . 14 and 15 below ) will also pay close attention to the functioning of CEMI at the local level to ensure the impartiality of the local chairmen .  
Recognizes that the elections held on 7 March 1999 were organized and conducted in a peaceful and calm atmosphere but takes note with concern that some flaws and irregularities were observed during the electoral process , and therefore calls upon the Government of Equatorial Guinea to continue the dialogue with all political parties and to ensure the independence and effectiveness of the national electoral commission , so as to guarantee fair , transparent and democratic conditions in the future ;  
Recognizing also that there is no single political system or single universal model of democracy equally suited to all nations and their peoples and that political systems and the electoral processes which guarantee the establishment of democratic governments are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
At the country level , UNDP responded to growing demand from programme countries for capacity development in : governing institutions ( judiciaries , legislative bodies and electoral bodies ) ; decentralization and local governance ; public sector management and administration ; and civil society organizations .  
Pursuant to resolution 1201 ( 1998 ) , by which the Security Council mandated MINURCA to support the conduct of legislative elections in the Central African Republic in November and December 1998 , operational plans developed by MINURCA called for the deployment for a period of 2.5 months of an additional 21 international and 18 local staff , 94 medium and short-term electoral observers and for the provision of related additional air , transportation and communications assets .  
It is now essential that all relevant political actors in Haiti participate constructively in the electoral process so as to ensure that the upcoming elections are fair , transparent and credible .  
I urge the Council to endorse the electoral support plan submitted by MINURCA , which is based on the minimum that is required , in the difficult circumstances prevailing within the Central African Republic , to ensure an acceptable level of observation of the freedom and fairness of the election process .  
The members of the Council are prepared to support a credible , fair and transparent electoral process leading to early legislative and local elections .  
Consolidate democracy through the promotion of pluralism , the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms , maximizing the participation of citizens in decision-making and the development of competent public institutions , including an independent judiciary , responsible legislature and public service and an electoral system that ensures free and fair elections .  
The second module , which is under development , will assess specific skills and abilities within occupational groups keyed to functional requirements ( administrative , financial , logistical , electoral etc . ) .  
Important related developments during the past year are presently reviewed , encompassing national electoral processes , public security , human rights , human development , the impact of Hurricane Mitch , regional and extraregional trade and cooperation , the role of regional and hemispheric institutions and bilateral issues .  
The results of the latter meeting are expressed in the Rio Declaration , which confirms shared principles and goals regarding trade integration as well as a mutual commitment to the full and unrestricted preservation of democratic institutions and to free , just and open electoral processes , emphasizing the importance of the participation of civil society .  
Progress has been made in those areas to the extent that Governments have not shied away from addressing complex , interrelated and contentious issues encompassing the structure of the State , judicial practices , electoral systems , land tenure , the rights of women and indigenous peoples and the participation of individuals and civil society groups in the decisions affecting their lives .  
The independent expert expresses the hope that all actors will help to create conditions that will allow the electoral process to continue without incident so that free , democratic and transparent elections can be held with the broadest possible participation by the Haitian people .  
In a letter dated 24 July 1997 to the President of the Security Council ( S / 1997 / 581 ) , the Secretary-General informed the Council of the successful completion of the electoral process in Liberia , which constituted the final element of the revised schedule of implementation of the Abuja agreement , which had been signed in August 1995 .

George W . Bush , who was leading by a razor-thin majority in Florida early this morning , announced on television networks that he had won 25 electoral votes in Florida , accumulating more than 270 votes - - the threshold to be crossed for the presidency .

That Liu Shao-tang 's death elicited such a huge response at a time when all of Taiwan 's media are packed with electoral news in the run-up to the March presidential ballot , is not only a measure of the widespread respect which Liu earned by his lifelong professionalism and refusal to lower standards , but also shows that Taiwan is still a place with deep feelings and concern for intellectual matters .  
For example , in Malawi a low - cost operation based on voluntary contributions and the involvement of the international community in Malawi and the region also allowed broad geographical and chronological coverage of the electoral process .  
It should maintain institutional memory and develop doctrine , standard operating procedures and operationality in this area , and have primary responsibility for substantive guidance and support of the electoral component of future peacekeeping missions .

As a political non-governmental organization , we are active in observing troublesome electoral processes , campaigning for political and civil rights where necessary and supporting those causes that we consider fair in international politics .  
In cases where a peace-keeping operation has been necessary , we believe it is legitimate and useful for the United Nations to maintain a presence on the ground after the end of the operation in order to ensure that its action is followed up in such a way as to contribute to a lasting restoration of peace through measures for coordinated consolidation in the economic , social , institutional , electoral , humanitarian and human rights fields .

They also shared the view that steps could be taken to facilitate the early conclusion of negotiations on complex substantive issues that are yet to be considered , namely " economic and social issues and the agrarian situation " , " strengthening of civilian power and role of the army in a democratic society " and " constitutional reforms and electoral regime " .  
The revised timetable provides for completion of two main substantive issues ( economic and social issues and the agrarian situation ; and strengthening of civilian power and role of the army in a democratic society ) before the electoral campaign is fully under way .  
Let me assure you that the Government is prepared to propose the necessary transitional or definitive amendments to the electoral law and is already working on the various legal formulae which , once the armed conflict is over , would enable URNG members to be reintegrated into society on a basis of full legality and without any restriction on their civil and political rights .

Reaffirms further that electoral assistance to Member States should be provided by the United Nations only at the request and with the consent of specific sovereign States , by virtue of resolutions adopted by the Security Council or the General Assembly in each case , in strict conformity with the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States , or in special circumstances such as cases of decolonization , or in the context of regional or international peace processes ;  
The presidential , legislative , regional and local elections to be held in Zaire in 1997 are an opportunity for the Belgian Government and the European Union to show their active solidarity within the framework of collective electoral assistance , which must be coordinated by the United Nations .  
El Salvador finds itself today on the road to becoming an open participatory society in full development , thanks , among other factors , to its enormous efforts in implementing an ambitious agenda of change and achieving the agreed commitments related to the transfer of land and human settlements , the strengthening of the National Civilian Police , the modernization of the judicial and electoral systems , and the ratification of international instruments on human rights . 
Among other things , a number of examples are given of the assistance provided by the United Nations system for political parties or movements , the mobilization of civil society , electoral assistance , communications media to enable them to act freely and independently , creating a political culture through observance and monitoring of human rights , improved accountability , support for transparency and quality of public sector management , democratic government structures , and strengthening the rule of law . 
Examples of this trend are the free elections that have been held in recent years elections that were open , competitive and fair ; the respect for existing legislation ; the creation of constitutional courts and the appointment of special prosecutors for human rights ; the existence of independent electoral tribunals and multi-party parliaments ; the promotion of autonomous and efficient judicial systems and the development of programmes to promote a culture of peace and democracy .  
Thirdly and finally , the international community , through UNOMIL , humanitarian cooperation , support for the needs of economic and social development and the monitoring of human rights and the electoral process , inter alia , is strengthening national and regional efforts .  
The draft resolution failed to take account of the fact that no single political system or electoral process was suited to all nations and peoples and that political systems were subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors .  
Recognizing also that there is no single political system or single universal model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples , and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
Reaffirms further that electoral assistance to Member States should be provided by the United Nations only at the request and with the consent of specific sovereign States , by virtue of resolutions adopted by the Security Council or the General Assembly in each case , in strict conformity with the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States , or in special circumstances such as cases of decolonization , or in the context of regional or international peace processes ;

The United Nations , which is responsible for implementing the settlement plan and interpreting its provisions , maintains that anyone who has submitted an application is an applicant and is entitled to be identified by means of a neutral and objective procedure which is " firstly , to establish the personal identity of the applicant and , secondly , to determine whether he or she qualified for inclusion in the electoral roll under one of the five eligibility criteria . 
Recent years have witnessed a wave of democratization at the national level , as an increasing number of countries have adopted multi-party systems , organized free and fair elections and begun the movement towards more open , more participatory societies , frequently with the requested electoral assistance of the United Nations .  
This is reflected , in particular , in the sharp reduction in political violence ( although the phenomenon of banditry and the abductions of election observers and officials which have punctuated the electoral campaign are still causing concern ) , the high level of public freedom , the increasingly independent functioning of the branches of Government , the strengthening of local authorities and the reduction and conversion of the armed forces .  
Recent years have witnessed a wave of democratization at the national level , as an increasing number of countries have adopted multi-party systems , organized free and fair elections and begun the movement towards more open , more participatory societies , frequently with the requested electoral assistance of the United Nations .  
While ECOWAS Foreign Ministers have identified the requisite conditions to ensure free and fair elections , we attach great importance to the full independence of the electoral Commission and to disarmament substantial enough so that the free participation of the Liberian people in the democratic process will not be constrained .  
Difficulties developed and delays again occurred in a number of areas , including the institutional consolidation of the public security sector ; the adoption of legal and constitutional reforms ; the reform of the judicial and electoral systems ; the transfer of land to former combatants ; and the transfer of rural human settlements to their current occupants .  
In recent experience , some peacekeeping operations have been mandated to include different combinations of the following tasks : monitoring of cease-fires and buffer zones , protecting humanitarian convoys , disarming and demobilizing ex-combatants , reforming military establishments , demining , establishing police forces , organizing or monitoring elections , monitoring human rights , promoting electoral and judicial reform , promoting aspects of civil administration and coordinating economic rehabilitation .  
The United Nations is the main international organization requested by Governments to undertake tasks such as facilitating dialogue between warring parties , preventing renewal of internal armed conflict , strengthening infrastructure , improving local security and facilitating electoral processes .  
A permanent and independent electoral commission responsible for the conduct of elections would be an indispensable component of a neutral political environment in which parties , candidates and the public have maximum faith in the integrity of the electoral process .  
The Special Representative believes that the speedy creation of an independent electoral commission would send an unambiguous signal to the people of Cambodia that the Government of Cambodia is committed to free and fair elections .  
It was essential to ensure full compliance with the reporting requirements contained in the Charter of the United Nations ; direct input , through the voice of petitioners , from the peoples of the Territories ; the annual multilateral review of all material presented ; consideration of the situation in the Territories directly in the Special Committee ; and reflection in appropriate decisions of the General Assembly upon the advice of the Special Committee of specific avenues for United Nations input ( such as visiting missions , electoral assistance or coordination of any kind ) .  
In addition , key issues pertaining to the holding of free and fair elections in Liberia have yet to be decided , including the process to be used for selecting a neutral and independent Electoral Commission ; the status of the Constitution and of the electoral law ; whether the elections would be full-term elections or only transitional elections ; and the scope and extent of the polling .  
In preparation for legislative elections held in June , August and September 1995 and the presidential elections of December 1995 , the technical team coordinated a large civic education programme and undertook , inter alia , the preparation of an electoral budget and coordination of financial support through a United Nations trust fund established for that purpose ; preparation of an operational and logistical plan , and assistance in its implementation ; and support in the design of a communication plan and a deployment plan for registration and voting periods .  
Assistance in the legislative process , especially with regard to the following areas : ( i ) right of everyone to take part in the government of his or her country ; ( ii ) equal access to public service ; ( iii ) criteria of democratic elections ( e.g . universal and equal suffrage ; the secrecy of the ballot ; respect for freedom of opinion , expression , information , assembly and association ) ; ( iv ) independent review of alleged irregularities ; and ( v ) objective and independent electoral administration ;  
Once these fundamental policy issues have been resolved , approximately 140 days will be required for the resolution and implementation of pending technical and support aspects , such as public information programmes , registration of voters , candidacy nomination and campaigning , staff training , data and systems verification and materials supply , to ensure that the electoral process is conducted in a fair manner .  
The nationalistic policies , economic interests and electoral considerations that were inherent in political parties , interest groups and Governments fostered attitudes of rejection and intolerance of migrant workers , refugees , asylum-seekers , minorities and indigenous populations .  Very often , the media and new technologies , such as electronic mail and the Internet , facilitated the large-scale dissemination of racist , xenophobic and neofascist practices .  
Both major parties in the Government had made unequivocal statements that the coming national and municipal elections in 1998 would be free and fair , and had asked the armed forces and members of the electoral commission to remain neutral . 
These expressions of concern notwithstanding , an active electoral campaign was conducted by all major political parties , including those that had boycotted the second round of parliamentary elections held two years ago .  
The committee is currently focusing its work on a review of Liberian electoral laws and constitutional provisions ; the establishment of an independent and impartial administrative mechanism for the management of the electoral process ; the role of the international community in the holding of elections ; and the technical , logistic and financial assistance necessary to support the electoral process .  
Besides the concluding observations , the main body of the present report is divided into six sections , on public security ; human rights and the judicial system ; economic and social issues ; electoral matters ; technical assistance programmes ; and administrative questions .  
The implementation of those recommendations , which included the creation of a national civil register responsible for issuing a single identity and voter card , the introduction of residential voting , and the introduction of proportional representation in the municipal councils , would constitute a significant advance in El Salvador 's electoral system . 
The level of electoral participation is the result of many different social and political factors , including the impact of civil institutions on the daily lives of Guatemalans , the capacity of political parties to fulfil people 's expectations , the degree of organized participation by citizens in social and political life and their level of civic education , all of which are elements which the package of peace agreements already signed seeks to strengthen .  The electoral process is marred by specific shortcomings which impede the effective enjoyment of the right to vote .  
Taking into account the new functions of the Guatemalan armed forces , as set forth in the Agreement on the Strengthening of Civilian Power and on the Role of the Armed Forces in a Democratic Society , and considering the Parties ' shared objective of promoting the broadest possible participation of citizens in the electoral process , the Commission is invited to examine the desirability of granting , in the future , members of the Guatemalan armed forces on active duty the political right of voting in Guatemalan elections .  
To that end , the Parties propose that , based on the electoral rolls , the Supreme Electoral Tribunal , in consultation with political parties , should identify the places in which voting centres are to be set up within municipalities ; such places would be those which have large numbers of residents living a long way from the municipal capital and which are also accessible to party poll-watchers and electoral observers .  
In particular , he stressed the need for fundamental political rights and freedoms to be protected during the electoral campaign , if the elections were to be recognized as free and fair .  
Where countries have developed effective temporary strategies in an attempt to achieve equality of participation , a wide range of measures has been implemented , including recruiting , financially assisting and training women candidates , amending electoral procedures , developing campaigns directed at equal participation , setting numerical goals and quotas and targeting women for appointment to public positions such as the judiciary or other professional groups that play an essential part in the everyday life of all societies .  
The professionalism of the role the army now plays in national life was made clear by its comportment during the electoral process of March 1997 : in marked contrast to the record of military interference in the history of El Salvador , the army demonstrated its respect for the democratic decision of the Salvadorian people that those elections represented .  8 .  Before the signing of the peace agreements , public security functions were carried out by bodies dependent on the armed forces .  
In a letter dated 24 July 1997 addressed to the President of the Security Council ( S / 1997 / 581 ) , the Secretary-General informed the Council of the successful completion of the electoral process in Liberia , which constituted the final element of the revised schedule on implementation of the Abuja Agreement ( S / 1995 / 742 , annex ) .  
That Constitution included clear provisions concerning collective land ownership , the management of natural resources , recognition of indigenous forms of government and administration , protection of the identity and cultural heritage of the indigenous peoples , the official status of the languages and dialects they used and the creation of special electoral districts ensuring their representation in Congress .  
In recent experience United Nations electoral assistance has been geared more to smaller missions that provide technical assistance to the electoral authorities of the Member State concerned with coordinating support provided by others or to providing a symbolic United Nations presence , compared with the large missions of prior years that organized , conducted or observed the elections .  
Acknowledging that United Nations electoral assistance has facilitated the holding of successful elections in several Member States which resulted in the orderly and non-violent assumption of office by elected officials , recognizing that elections can be free and fair only if held free of coercion and intimidation , and underlining the importance of respect for the results of elections that have been verified as free and fair ,  
Taking note of the statement by the President of the Security Council of 30 July 1997 [ 4 ] in which the Council , inter alia , welcomed the successful holding of presidential and legislative elections in Liberia on 19 July 1997 , and noted with satisfaction the declaration in the joint certification statement by the Secretary-General and the Chairman of the Economic Community of West African States that the electoral process had been free , fair and credible and that the outcome of the elections reflected the will of the Liberian people ,  
The system of financial assistance for returnees had set the stage for these changes as early as 1982 , but it was not until 1986 with the introduction of strict controls on foreigners ' entry and stay in France and widespread identity checks , that all immigrant groups were designated as potentially responsible for everything wrong with French society , an attitude which encouraged a particularly disturbing racist and xenophobic movement in France , especially at the electoral level . 
Concerned by the climate in which the electoral process has taken place , the European Union expresses its firm hope that the Haitian people will be able as soon as possible to express its will in free , honest and transparent elections , held in accordance with rules and procedures accepted by all , in which citizens have the widest possible range of options and choices .  
A credible and independent human rights commission , along with a genuinely independent national electoral commission , could make an important contribution to protecting stability and promoting the observance of human rights in Cambodia in the lead-up to what we strongly hope will be free , fair and credible elections in May next year .  
The mission , in its broadest sense , must coordinate and implement humanitarian relief , civil affairs , electoral assistance , police and judicial reorganization , human rights and economic and social reconstruction actions that must be sustained long after the guns have been silenced .  
It identified three key conditions for success : a fair and credible political framework ; an efficient and well-planned electoral operation ; and adequate support from the international community .  
As stated in his previous report , the Special Representative believes that the speedy creation of an independent electoral commission would send an unambiguous signal to the people of Cambodia that the Government of Cambodia is committed to free and fair elections .  
The net additional requirements of $ 536,400 for commercial communications were attributable to the satellite user charges from the previous mandate period ( $ 356,200 ) , recorded in the reporting period because of the late submission of invoices and the extensive use of satellite facilities by the military , civilian police and electoral observer components of the mission in November and December 1994 ( $ 626,000 ) . ( b ) Main trunking contract .  
I would just like to mention several items deserving of careful consideration at this essential stage of the preparations : the urgent installation of the independent Electoral Commission and the reconstituted Supreme Court ; the registration of voters ; and the return of refugees and I would like to stress that this is indispensable for the credibility of the entire electoral process .  
Taking note of the presidential statement of 30 July 1997 [ 1 ] in which the Security Council , inter alia , welcomed the successful holding of presidential and legislative elections in Liberia on 19 July 1997 , noted with satisfaction the declaration in the Joint Certification Statement by the Secretary-General and the Chairman of the Economic Community of West African States that the electoral process had been free , fair and credible and that the outcome of the elections reflected the will of the Liberian people ,  
The conferences , held in South Africa , focused on reorganizing the judiciary ; adopting a bill of rights ; developing affirmative action programmes ; designing a nationwide public defender service ; comparing institutional models for enforcing a constitutional guarantee of gender equality , and evaluating electoral systems .  
Recognizing also that there is no single political system or single universal model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples , and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
Further reaffirms that electoral assistance to Member States should be provided by the United Nations only at the request and with the consent of specific sovereign States , in strict conformity with the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States , or in special circumstances such as cases of decolonization , or in the context of regional or international peace processes ;  
His Government ( a democratically elected one , as the international and regional organizations that had supervised the electoral process had duly reported ) had enacted just such domestic legislation , and had met , and would continue to meet , its corresponding international obligations .  
Turning to the operative part of the draft resolution , he said that , while paragraph 1 welcomed his Governments declared commitment to civilian rule , there was no mention of the positive steps which it had taken to fulfil that commitment , which included the establishment of a national electoral commission , the registration of voters and political parties and the delimitation of constituencies .  
Recent experience has demonstrated , however , that United Nations assistance rendered in the field of electoral assistance is geared more and more to smaller missions , which give technical assistance to the electoral authorities of the Member State concerned in coordinating the electoral support provided by others , or provide a symbolic United Nations presence , rather than the large missions of prior years for which it organized and conducted ( e.g . Cambodia ) or observed ( e.g .  
Missions , at the request of Governments , to provide assistance in the fields of governance and public administration policy development , administrative restructuring , civil service reform , electoral assistance , government capacity for improved performance in the public sector , government capacity for developing infrastructure and protecting the environment , post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction of government machinery , government capacity for social development , financial management , government accounting and reporting and public-private interaction ; ( ii ) Group training .  
An election implementation plan was agreed between the OSCE Mission and my Office based on the principles that implementation of the election result are : the responsibility of the Bosnia and Herzegovina authorities ; an integral part of the electoral process and , therefore , will be firmly anchored in the rules and regulations ; certified in a two-step process ensuring that final certification is not issued before the successful installation of municipal councils has taken place .  
Following the official announcement of the results of the recently concluded elections in Liberia , I am pleased to inform you of the successful completion of the electoral process , which constituted the final element of the revised schedule of implementation of the Abuja Agreement . In support of the efforts of the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) , the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia ( UNOMIL ) played an effective and critical role in bringing about this outcome .  
Included in this latter group are the United Nations political and economic and social departments ( Department of Political Affairs , Department of Peacekeeping Operations and Department for Economic and Social Affairs ) and the World Health Organization . The political departments of the United Nations Secretariat consider the Agency 's support for the rule of law , promotion of human rights , democratization , human capacity-building and electoral assistance as strong potential areas , particularly in respect of cooperation for peacekeeping and peace-building programmes . 
For the purposes of realizing the will of the people and their right to self-determination , creating a responsible Government , preventing a monopoly of power and administrative corruption , electing representatives to the electoral bodies , ensuring free and fair periodical election of the leadership ; the principles of democracy and pluralism shall constitute the mainspring of the future political system to be formed in Afghanistan .  
The report should have contained a functional analysis of the backstopping requirements of peacekeeping operations as they relate to the implementation of their mandates ( military , civilian police , human rights monitoring , humanitarian , electoral assistance ) .  
Since my report of 20 July 1998 , the political situation has not improved ; it is still dominated by the protracted electoral and institutional crisis , which continues to erode the moral , political , economic and social fabric of the country . 
The Office of Operations leads the planning process by providing the overall framework , developing options for courses of action , leading reconnaissance missions to the field and coordinating and integrating inputs from within the Department and from other entities ( e.g . military , police , humanitarian , electoral , human rights and other aspects including logistics , support and staffing requirements ) into a comprehensive plan for approval by the Security Council .  
In 1998 , IPU published a model code of conduct for elections13 which acknowledges that a successful and informed electoral process is the joint responsibility of all involved : political parties and candidates ; supporters and voters ; police and security forces ; Governments and public officials ; media and observers .  
In response to a series of commitments which were adopted at a round table jointly organized in 1995 by the United Nations and International IDEA on the topic of international electoral observation , International IDEA has published a code of conduct for the ethical and professional observation of elections , which emphasized the standards of comprehensiveness , transparency and accuracy in observation .  
Once the focal point for electoral assistance has determined that a coordination and support mission is both desirable and feasible , an electoral assistance secretariat is established in the country to plan and manage all aspects of the international observation operation , including the provision of logistical and technical support to the Joint International Observer Group ( JIOG ) .  
Such assistance can be classified in three general categories : ( i ) those contributing to national capacity-building through the establishment of new electoral institutions or the strengthening of existing capabilities ; ( ii ) those which relate to the human rights aspects of the electoral process ; and ( iii ) those which provide specific , legal , constitutional , logistic or technical advice or various types of electoral equipment and supplies .  
Common issues mentioned in these assessments that proved problematic included electoral planning , such as unrealistic timetables , late delivery of polling materials and observers pulled out before vote counting ; insufficient concern about capacity-building , such as insufficient voter education ; and personnel and staffing issues , such as untrained or inexperienced observers .  
The archive should be organized by major substantive and support tasks , including monitoring ceasefires and buffer zones , protecting humanitarian convoys , disarming and demobilizing ex-combatants , reforming military establishments , defining and establishing police forces , organizing or monitoring elections , monitoring human rights , promoting electoral and judicial reform , promoting aspects of civil administration and coordinating economic rehabilitation .  
Though the 1998 legislative elections were generally considered free and fair , subsequent reports by MINURCA and by the Mixed and Independent Electoral Commission ( CEMI ) , which organized the elections , identified a number of shortcomings and proposed recommendations for the improvement of the electoral process .  
In this connection , MINURCA is assuring the opposition that the international electoral observers to be deployed starting next month ( see paras . 14 and 15 below ) will also pay close attention to the functioning of CEMI at the local level to ensure the impartiality of the local chairmen .  
Recognizes that the elections held on 7 March 1999 were organized and conducted in a peaceful and calm atmosphere but takes note with concern that some flaws and irregularities were observed during the electoral process , and therefore calls upon the Government of Equatorial Guinea to continue the dialogue with all political parties and to ensure the independence and effectiveness of the national electoral commission , so as to guarantee fair , transparent and democratic conditions in the future ;  
Recognizing also that there is no single political system or single universal model of democracy equally suited to all nations and their peoples and that political systems and the electoral processes which guarantee the establishment of democratic governments are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
At the country level , UNDP responded to growing demand from programme countries for capacity development in : governing institutions ( judiciaries , legislative bodies and electoral bodies ) ; decentralization and local governance ; public sector management and administration ; and civil society organizations .  
Pursuant to resolution 1201 ( 1998 ) , by which the Security Council mandated MINURCA to support the conduct of legislative elections in the Central African Republic in November and December 1998 , operational plans developed by MINURCA called for the deployment for a period of 2.5 months of an additional 21 international and 18 local staff , 94 medium and short-term electoral observers and for the provision of related additional air , transportation and communications assets .  
It is now essential that all relevant political actors in Haiti participate constructively in the electoral process so as to ensure that the upcoming elections are fair , transparent and credible .  
I urge the Council to endorse the electoral support plan submitted by MINURCA , which is based on the minimum that is required , in the difficult circumstances prevailing within the Central African Republic , to ensure an acceptable level of observation of the freedom and fairness of the election process .  
The members of the Council are prepared to support a credible , fair and transparent electoral process leading to early legislative and local elections .

The second module , which is under development , will assess specific skills and abilities within occupational groups keyed to functional requirements ( administrative , financial , logistical , electoral etc . ) .  
Important related developments during the past year are presently reviewed , encompassing national electoral processes , public security , human rights , human development , the impact of Hurricane Mitch , regional and extraregional trade and cooperation , the role of regional and hemispheric institutions and bilateral issues .  
The results of the latter meeting are expressed in the Rio Declaration , which confirms shared principles and goals regarding trade integration as well as a mutual commitment to the full and unrestricted preservation of democratic institutions and to free , just and open electoral processes , emphasizing the importance of the participation of civil society .  
Progress has been made in those areas to the extent that Governments have not shied away from addressing complex , interrelated and contentious issues encompassing the structure of the State , judicial practices , electoral systems , land tenure , the rights of women and indigenous peoples and the participation of individuals and civil society groups in the decisions affecting their lives .  
The independent expert expresses the hope that all actors will help to create conditions that will allow the electoral process to continue without incident so that free , democratic and transparent elections can be held with the broadest possible participation by the Haitian people .  
In a letter dated 24 July 1997 to the President of the Security Council ( S / 1997 / 581 ) , the Secretary-General informed the Council of the successful completion of the electoral process in Liberia , which constituted the final element of the revised schedule of implementation of the Abuja agreement , which had been signed in August 1995 .  
In order to broaden their electoral base and thus their impact on the population , militant Hindu groups were deliberately attacking the Christian minority and its institutions in the education , health and social sectors because of their influence on the Indians , especially those who were the most disadvantaged or living in remote areas of the country .  
Underscores that , as pointed out by the Commission to Follow Up the Implementation of the Peace Agreements , key reforms remain outstanding , including the fiscal , judicial , military and electoral reforms , and , therefore , stresses the critical importance of continued compliance with the peace agreements in 2000 ;  
It also has an idea of the roots of the problem and has made attempts to address the three key areas of access to justice through changes in the legal and judicial system ; promotion of the democratic process by introducing electoral and other reforms ; and strengthening local communities by trying to initiate dialogue and attempting economic and political empowerment .

Progress continues to be made in restoring basic public and social services and the authorities have expressed their expectation that the successful conclusion of the electoral process and the emergence of a new democratic government will lead to the disbursement of the funds pledged for Guinea-Bissau 's reconstruction efforts at the Round-table conference convened by UNDP in Geneva on 4 and 5 May 1999 .  
Expresses its appreciation for the activities carried out by the United Nations system , as well as the observations and recommendations contained in the report , with respect to building a political culture through human rights observance , mobilization of civil society , electoral assistance , free and independent media , enhancing the rule of law and improving accountability , transparency and quality of public sector management and democratic structures of government ;

A number of basic legislative reforms had prepared the way for those elections , including a constitutional reform envisaging a multi-party system within the context of a balanced , tolerant and open society , a reform of the electoral code stipulating that the opposition should hold at least one fifth of the seats in the Chamber of Deputies and municipal councils , and a set of regulations bringing the Tunisian prison system into conformity with international standards .  
With the strategic objective of achieving equal and lasting access for women to power structures , specific laws have been introduced in the national legal bodies , including the electoral code and the laws governing political parties and municipalities .

As the UNDP Resident Representative in Malabo had informed the Minister in a letter dated 4 February 2000 , technical and financial assistance in connection with the elections was made conditional on a mission to evaluate the conditions in which the electoral process would take place as well as the existence of prior agreement on United Nations involvement throughout the electoral process and the unrestricted participation of candidates of all political parties .  
Declares that full popular participation is only feasible if societies have democratic political and electoral systems which guarantee to all their citizens the possibility both to take part in the government of their country , directly or through freely chosen representatives , and to have equal access to public service , without discrimination of any kind as to race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status ;

According to the Mission , although the calculations had been made taking into account the absolute majority of the total number of valid votes , in conformity with the electoral law , a second round of voting should have been held in eight cases in which the candidates had been declared elected by CEP after the first round .  
The Constitutional Framework defines the following basic elements of the election system : single constituency ( that is , Kosovo constitutes one electoral unit , as opposed to multiple districts ) ; proportional representation ; ballot listing parties only ( closed lists ) ; and a cut-off date for voter eligibility of 1 January 1998 ( that is , the same date as for the 2000 municipal elections ) .  
Similar provisions protecting religious freedom and prohibiting any discrimination against citizens whether or not they are believers are contained in criminal law , civil law , legislation governing regional autonomy for national minorities and military service , compulsory education legislation , the electoral law relating to the Peoples Congress and the law establishing village committees .
