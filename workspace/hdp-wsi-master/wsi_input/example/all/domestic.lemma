However , China is still much engaged in her own domestic development , and has limited national strength .  For this reason we are selecting those key areas or key links that have favorable prospects , where the degree of industrial linkage will be significant , and which can drive the entire mechanism for critical breakthroughs , and through these we will vigorously strive to realize a leap in high-tech development .  
Insufficient domestic funds have been made up by utilizing foreign capital ; this has increased the state tax revenue and foreign exchange earnings , promoted economic restructuring and the optimization of the industrial structure , accelerated the blending of China 's economy with the world economy , and created a large number of job opportunities .  Products turned out by foreign-funded enterprises have greatly enriched the material lives of our people .  
For the last two years , aimed at the changed international and domestic economic situation and the domestic deflation trend that has appeared , the Chinese Government has sized up the time , adjusting its policy promptly , making the key decision to expand domestic demand , and taking a series of macroeconomic regulation and control steps , the main substance of which is pursuing an active fiscal policy . 
The Central Economic Work Conference held in November 1999 proposed a series of policy steps to promote economic development such as continuing to pursue an active fiscal policy and bringing into better play the role of monetary policy , making decisions such as expanding domestic demand , sharply adjusting the economic structure , and promoting industrial optimization and upgrading .  
The current reform of breakthrough significance is the new setup that coordinates and unifies the separate internal and external trade systems for agricultural produce , that is , achieving integration of domestic and foreign trade in this produce in the form of joint management or joint operations , and adopting the new form of agency services in foreign trade .  
Facing the new situations in domestic China and overseas and the new challenges of the new century and new millennium , it is a must to further define clearly the thinking about developing the economy , adjust in a timely manner the economic structure , and uphold all along the thinking of science and technology being the primary productive force , so as to bring about sustained , rapid , and healthy development of our national economy .  
As permitted entry into the market expands , and tariffs are reduced and nontariff measures abolished , foreign products , services , and investment may enter our market on a larger scale ; as a result , our domestic enterprises will face more intense competition , and in particular , enterprises with high production costs , low level of technology , and backward management will face still more severe challenges .  
In 1999 the average charge per kilowatt of electricity in the rural areas fell by 0.1 yuan , and as a result the peasants paid a total of 23-billion yuan less for their electricity ; many peasants who could not afford electricity in the past have now happily installed color TV and VCD players , and sales of domestic electrical appliances have hotted up in some rural areas .  
At the same time , spurred by market forces and supported by bank loans , a number of new-style domestic electrical appliances , computers , mobile phones and so on , with high science and technology content , low energy consumption , and a variety of functions rapidly sprang up , thus further improving market supply .  The quality of China 's economic growth has gradually improved amid both protection and pressure .  
The rate of decline of the price level , which has been in negative growth for more than 20 successive months , has gradually lessened as domestic demand is stimulated , and the categories of commodities whose prices are rising is now increasing .  
Dai Xianglong said : Implementing the strategy of developing the western regions is an important plan for restructuring the economy and promoting the coordinated development of regional economies .  It is an important measure for increasing domestic demand and promoting the sustained , rapid and coordinated development of the national economy .  It is also an important opportunity for the restructuring of bank credits and promoting the development of banking .  
Some domestic non-governmental scientific and technological enterprises were also quite dynamic .  " We do not set employment quotas .  No matter how many they are , all the talents will be employed , as long as they are outstanding and are needed by our corporation , " said a pertinent responsible person of Shenzhen Huawei Technology Corporation .  
Faced with an international and domestic situation that is undergoing profound changes and a glorious and arduous mission , the deputies will be thoroughly studying major issues of overall and strategic significance in reform , opening up and socialist modernization and will be reviewing important policies and arrangements for work in the coming year .  
Xiang noted that in light of the impact of the Asian financial crisis and domestic contradictions in scant effective demand in 1998 , the CPC Central Committee and the State Council made a resolute strategic decision to implement a proactive fiscal policy ; unceasingly stepped up policy efforts to expand the scope of the fiscal policy role ;  
Traditional industries are still the principal bodies in Liaoning , which is an old industrial base , and to a great extent , state-owned industries manifest the model of speed and efficiency .  The state 's efforts to stimulate domestic demand , and gradually put the proactive fiscal policy into place , have produced a certain effect of stimulating the market for Liaoning industries .  
He said that making great development in the Western Region is an important operation to expand domestic demands and promote sustained , rapid , and healthy development of national economy as well as an important deployment for strategically readjusting economic structure and promoting coordinated development of regional economy .  
Wu Yi also expressed the hope that Hainan will adhere to the principle of being driven and boosted by the policy designed for it , by the application of science and technology , by introducing foreign equipment , technology , and capital , and by associating with domestic enterprises , in order to further build up the special economic zone . 
Facing the contradiction that has appeared , between periodic and structural surplus versus a domestic market potential that is a long way from being realized , and facing the contradiction that while market demand for a large quantity of commodities is insufficient , we still rely on imports for some special products , especially key technical equipment , we must be determined to solve some outstanding problems such as irrational economic structure .  
the building of socialist spiritual civilization and of democracy and legal system was further intensified ; and social stability was maintained .  These achievements are the results of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core taking charge of the overall situation and providing correct leadership , and the results of all levels throughout the country implementing the central policy decision on expanding domestic demand and the series of guidelines and policies , and working hard with concerted efforts .  
With regard to this change , Zhang Hongwei , who is here for the Third Session of the Ninth National Commission of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference [ CPPCC ] , says the following based on his experience : Confronted with the trend of global economic integration , our country should , from now on , encourage robust domestic businesses to make investments and establish plants abroad and explore international markets so as to gain an edge in the midst of increasingly sharp international competition .  
Guo Zhenqian said the Financial and Economic Committee held that the 2000 central and local government budget arrangements have implemented the requirement for continued enforcement of a positive financial policy ; realized the spirit of readjusting structure , expanding domestic demand , ensuring main areas , promoting development , and maintaining stability ;  
After last year 's central budget was approved , in the light of changes in the domestic and international situations , the party central committee and State Council decided to step up implementation of a positive financial policy .  
The Finance and Economic Committee is of the opinion that the central and local budgets for 2000 are in line with the requirement of continuing to implement a positive financial policy , and manifest the spirit of adjusting the economic structure , increasing domestic demand , assuring key expenditures , boosting development , and maintaining stability .  
Third , the work of economic and social development in 2000 should comprehensively implement all policies and measures set forth by the central leadership ; correctly handle the relationship between reform , development , and stability ; give prominence to the proper handling of reforms and development in state-owned enterprises , the economic restructuring , scientific and technological progress , and expansion of domestic demand ;  
promote the national economy 's sustained , high-speed , and healthy development .  The expansion of domestic demand should be consistently combined with the expansion of exports ; the keeping of a rather quick economic growth rate should be combined with the strategic readjustment of the economic structure ;  
The content of the proposals is mainly : Maintaining sustained rapid and healthy national economic growth , expanding domestic demand , promoting strategic economic restructuring , continuing to push ahead with reform and strengthening management , speeding up the development of science and technology and education , opening wider to the outside world , intensifying the building of a social security system , stepping up environmental protection , and strengthening the building of spiritual civilization and an honest and clean government .  
1 .  The fifth natural paragraph of General Program shall be amended as : " Our country shall remain at the primary stage of socialism for a long time to come ( at present ) and be faced with a main contradiction between people 's growing material and cultural needs and backward social production .  Owing to domestic factors and international influence , the struggle waged by our country 's people against hostile forces or hostile elements at home and abroad shall be a long-term one .  
The motions handled since the Second Session of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee , which are rich in content , have mainly included those aimed at maintaining sustained , rapid , and healthy national economic growth ; strengthening agriculture and doing a good job in rural work ; continually and energetically pressing ahead with the state-owned enterprise reform ; guarding against and alleviating the financial crisis ; expanding domestic demand ; continually implementing the principle of opening up to the outside world and vigorously opening up the international market ;  
Both domestic and foreign hostile forces do not want to see the development of a strong , prosperous , and stable socialist China . They hope for chaos in China . They are constantly trying to " westernize " and " divide " China so as to achieve change amid chaos and to fish in troubled waters .  
The deputies and committee members were of the view : Although currently the overall situation is marked by social stability and sustained economic growth , we have been facing in-depth contradictions and problems accumulated over the years and new challenges arising from phased changes in economic development , such as effective demand in the domestic market has been insufficient , contradictions resulting from the unreasonable economic structure have become increasingly prominent , the employment pressure has increased , and increase in peasants ' incomes have slowed down .  
correctly handle relationships among reform , development , and stability ; place emphasis on the reform and development of state enterprises , economic restructuring , scientific and technological advancement , and the expansion of domestic demand ; and promote sustained rapid and healthy national economic growth .  
Zhu Lilan said , the future development of the high-tech zones will be linked to state economic restructuring , the expansion of domestic demand , and the development of west China , and will be aimed at the requirements of the state 's medium and long-term development strategy ; we will make all-round plans and rational distribution and concentrate forces on cultivating projects with their own intellectual property rights .  
The decision is of great significance to expand domestic demand and bring about sustained growth of national economy , to promote coordinated economic development in all regions and eventually achieve a common prosperity , and to strengthen ethnic unity , maintain social stability and fortify border defense .  
These countries stressed that the United States does not have the authority to criticize the human rights situation of other countries , and this kind of application of the domestic law of one nation to the legal system of other nations is not only no in accordance with international law , but is not helpful to realizing mutual respect and peaceful coexistence among nations .  
A responsible person of an authoritative state organ pointed out the other day : If the work of changing debt into equity is successfully conducted , it can provide a healthy financial foundation for state banks and state enterprises in China and can help prepare them for meeting competitions from both domestic and overseas markets .  However , if the work of changing debt into equity turns out to be a failure , we will be unable to attain the desired goal of this policy ;  
The DPRK 's active efforts to push its multilateral diplomacy , increase exchanges with other countries of the world , create a peaceful and stable environment on the Korean peninsula , launch foreign trade and economic cooperation , and speed up domestic economic construction are beneficial .  
Since the two countries formed diplomatic ties 36 years ago , friendly relations of cooperation between the two have maintained development on a healthy and stable track through the ups and downs of global situations and their domestic conditions .  
Article 20 Conservation zones for surface sources of domestic potable water that cut across provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal boundaries shall be delimited through consultation among the provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments concerned .  
In delimiting other conservation zones for surface sources of domestic potable water , the city and county people 's governments concerned shall consult with one another and then propose a delimitation plan to be submitted to the provincial , autonomous regional , or municipal people 's government for approval .  
Those who violate the provision in Article 23 , Section 2 of these Detailed Rules and Regulations by discharging pollutants in excess of the pollutant discharge standards set by the state or the locality in Class Two conservation zones for surface sources of domestic potable water shall be ordered by a people 's government at or above the county level to make improvement within a time limit and be liable to a fine below 100,000 yuan ;  
Those who violate the provisions in Article 23 , Section 3 of these Detailed Rules and Regulations by setting up a wharf for loading and unloading garbage , oils , and other toxic and harmful matter in Class Two conservation zones for surface sources of domestic potable water shall be ordered by the environmental protection department of a people 's government at or above the county level to demolish the wharf within a time limit and shall be liable to a fine below 100,000 yuan .  
Deputy Li Changchun said : The policy decision on western development reflects Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's thinking of " two overall situations , " and is of extremely important significance to expanding domestic demand , precipitating the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy , promoting the coordinated economic development of various regions to ultimately achieve common prosperity , intensifying national unity , maintaining social stability , and solidifying national defense .  
The strategic adjustment of the economic structure will give rise to huge investment and consumption demand .  This will not only provide a strong driving force for our nation 's economic growth , but will also provide broad market space for the development of domestic and foreign trade and economic exchanges .  
In our country , now tourism has been moving onto the path of comprehensive development with three major market sectors , namely , tourism for people entering the Chinese mainland , domestic tourism , and tourism for domestic people traveling abroad , and now tourism is a large-scale industry with a huge market and great output value .  Tourism is playing a more and more important role in the national economy , and is producing positive influence for the enhancement of national quality and the development of the socialist spiritual civilization .  
To meet the needs in speeding up the strategic adjustments of the economic structure , expanding domestic demand , promoting economic growth and social development , the party Central Committee and the State Council now took the tourist industry as a new growth point of the national economy , made great efforts to foster and support it , and set forth new requirements for the tourist industry under the new situation .  
Under the new situation , all localities and departments concerned should act according to the requirements of the party Central Committee and the State Council , go all out to foster the new economic growth point - - the tourist industry , and ensure that it will achieve greater results in expanding domestic demand , increasing employment , promoting opening-up , stimulating local economic growth and social development , and will continue to play a comprehensive role in economic restructuring and in the development of other related industries .  
The central leadership made the major policy decision on the great development of China 's west .  The national economy is undergoing strategic restructuring .  The state set forth a series of policies for expanding domestic demand and promoting economic growth .  
The conferences conscientiously reviewed and summed up the work practice and main experience of the people of our country in prevailing over difficulties and overcoming risks under a complicated domestic and international environment and in continuing to advance the cause of reform , opening , and socialist modernization construction , and the two conferences also planned and assigned important work tasks for the country for the last year of this century .  
it is necessary to do a good job of effectively carrying out nationality , religious , national defense , diplomatic , and Taiwan affairs work , to resolutely fight sabotage activities carried out by hostile forces at home and abroad , and to combat various law-violating and criminal activities , so as to maintain social and political stability , the unity of the motherland , and national security and to create a good international and domestic environment for reform and development .  
In the face of new changes taking place in the domestic and international situation and new development in ideological education for young people , we feel deeply that Comrade Jiang Zemin 's speech has a clear objective , that it targets at the current problems , and that it is of great practical meaning , and it has made us realize even more the urgency and difficult nature of young people 's ideological education .  
To improve its monetary policy-related work , the committee has , since 1999 , held meetings of economic and financial experts at regular intervals .  The purpose is to widely solicit opinions about the monetary policy from the academic community , study major issues on international and domestic economic and financial policies , and acquire suggestions from all sectors of society in an effort to improve its work related to the monetary policy .  
On the basis of its comprehensive analysis of the current international and domestic situation , the party central leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core requires that the party 's ideological and political work be done intensively and effectively , and takes this as an urgent strategic task related to the general situation of socialist reform and construction in our country for the whole party and the entire people of the whole nation .  
On the one hand , after China joins the WTO , import tariffs will be cut by a wide margin and this will help domestic ship owners , shipyards , and designing units directly use advanced , reliable , and fairly-priced , and serviceable complete sets of foreign ship equipment and spare parts with low prices .  
The people in the western region began to examine their past , and quite a few western provinces and autonomous regions have changed their old practice of standing still and refusing to make progress .  They have set up project banks to solicit businesses , established a " single-stop " service structure , and provided fine environment to attract domestic and foreign investors , so as to greet the upsurge of the grand western development in a brand new , open attitude .  
All countries should have the right to act in line with their native national conditions to choose their respective political systems and development models .  No nation or group of states has the right to force its values and social system onto others , even less so to exploit the human rights matter or a so-called " humanitarian crisis " as an excuse to deliberately interfere in the domestic affairs of a sovereign country .  
On the basis of its geopolitics and its domestic and foreign " realistic " situation , Russia has gradually formed its own unique " practical containment " nuclear strategy : to prevent the outbreak of a nuclear war and a large-scale conventional war by means of nuclear deterrence and to first use nuclear weapons in a regional war , local war or armed conflict to attain the goal of safeguarding national security and maintaining the status of a big country .  
Capital flow will have a greater influence and impact on a country 's economy , particularly the great circulation and speculation of short-term capital .  Without sound market operating mechanism , rational interest mechanism , and strict regulatory system , it will be extremely easy for the domestic economy to be controlled by the international market if we abolish the restrictions on capital outflow and inflow too early .  
It is an immediate and urgent task for our country 's inspection and quarantine departments to make rational use of technical means , effectively safeguard the interests of the state and domestic industries , actively break down the technical barriers set by developed country and help domestic enterprises adapt themselves unceasingly to WTO regulations and the trend of international technological development and open up the international market .  
According to the latest statistics made by the People 's Bank of China , in the first quarter of this year , China 's banking and financial operations were normal and stable and showed a trend of positive development .  Continual increases in money supply and total credit met the need in expanding domestic demand , promoting production and the growth of consumption , and conformed in the main to the economic development .  The deposits of enterprises increased by a great extent , loans extended by financial institutions were expedited , and foreign exchange reserves increased steadily .  
Analyzing the distribution of increased loans , we can see that those loans have not only satisfied the need of state key construction projects , infrastructure construction and the reasonable funds requirement of large and medium sized enterprises , but also supported the development of medium and small enterprises and non-public sectors of the economy as well as the personal consumption needs .  Those loans have played an important role in expanding domestic consumption and promoting economic development .  
Chen Jinhua added that the extensive development of the western region is of great significance for expanding domestic demand , boosting sustained national economic growth , promoting the coordinated development of various regional economies , and strengthening national unity .  
However , the United States ignored facts and again put forward an anti-China motion at the meeting of the UN Commission for Human Rights to meet the needs of its domestic political and party struggle , in a vain attempt to make use of the so-called human rights issue to interfere in China 's internal affairs and vilify China 's international image .  
The overall concept and content of human rights are indivisible and unchangeable .  The firm stride of the Chinese people walking toward domestic prosperity is unstoppable .  
At the UN human rights meetings , the United States provoked confrontation and disputes on many occasions out of certain domestic political needs and also its stubborn mentality of " moral imperialism " and the so-called international strategy of national egoism .  
Equity capital should primarily be raised from the domestic and international capital markets , and oriented toward the public , the corporate investors , and the special investment funds as well .  
In deciding on a strategic goal , we should try to meet our national security needs and comply with at once the needs of our national economic development and electronic information industry development and the needs of increasingly fierce competition on the domestic and international markets .  
Zhang Lichang , secretary of the municipal party committee , said that leading cadres at all levels must stand at the high plain of historical development to fully understand the urgency of implementing the important concept of " three represents " in close connection with the profound changes in the domestic and international situation and with the actual conditions of Tianjin 's work , further emancipate people 's minds , further break new ground and make new progress , grasp opportunities , and develop by leaps and bounds .  
and facilitating the internationalization of the market , allowing Sino-foreign joint-venture enterprises and foreign-funded enterprises to seek listings on the domestic stock exchanges while encouraging qualified domestic enterprises to raise funds through initial public offerings on the overseas stock exchanges , and also allowing foreign capital to purchase stock ownership in enterprises in some competitive industries in China so that China 's capital market will be fully opened to foreign investors step by step .  
Ever since the 1990 ' s , China has been developing its maritime resources .  The output of maritime industries has been growing 30 percent annually on the average , and this year 's output will account for 5 percent of the nation 's gross domestic product .  But this figure is still below the level of the world 's maritime economy , which accounts for 7 percent of the world 's total economic aggregates .  
[ Reporter ] At present , our economic development is in a very crucial period .  As the national economy has undergone profound changes and is transforming from the economy of shortage into an economy marked by the buyer 's market , China is confronted with the dilemma of a structure-caused surplus on the one hand and a domestic market with untapped potentials on the other .  
This is not only beneficial to stimulating trade and international resources , but is also helpful in alleviating the contradiction of domestic oversupply .  It is beneficial toward developing an economy of scale and will help to effectively attract advanced foreign technology and management experience .  Moreover , direct overseas investment will be beneficial in terms of employee training and introduction .  
They also pointed out : Economic globalization has impacted the industries and domestic markets of developing countries that are in a " vulnerable positions " on differing degrees , and have greatly increased the risks of economic fluctuations and of triggering a financial crisis in a country .  Economic globalization has continuously widened the gap between the rich and the poor around the globe , and the economic sovereignty and independence of many countries have been tested .  
Accordingly , we should cultivate and develop domestic money markets by accelerating reform of the domestic investment and financing system , as well as creating a fair competition mechanism for domestic and foreign capital , making full use of the potential of the high domestic savings rate , being truly rational and effectively taking advantage of " two markets and two sources of funding " , thus avoiding over-dependence on outside sources of funding .  This is the main approach to guard against and dispel international balance of payment risks .  
In his important speech at the central ideological and political work meeting , Comrade Jiang Zemin made a brilliant analysis and profound exposition of the important position , main tasks , guiding ideology , and basic requirements of the party 's ideological and political work in the new period , and major issues that need handling in doing the work , from the height of both international and domestic overall situations .  
The arduousness of ideological and political work is determined by the fact that international and domestic factors are complex and people 's thinking is lively , complex , varied , and constantly changeable from person to person , from matter to matter , and from time to time .  
Li Ruihuan said that China and Russia are facing huge domestic tasks in developing their economy and improving living standards , and they hold identical or similar views on many major international issues ; their two economies are strongly complementary , and there are broad prospects for developing bilateral friendly cooperation .  
Competition of this kind is a means to stimulate consumption as well as a necessary market mechanism to save efficient enterprises and eliminate the poor ones .  The reason why China 's home electrical appliance enterprises , such as color televisions , refrigerators , and washing machine enterprises , have been able to grab an overwhelmingly large domestic market share and in turn enter international markets is just the fierce price competitions a few years ago .  
Currently we regulate and control the money supply mainly by controlling the total credit of state-owned commercial banks and we have not yet adopted indirect regulation and control means in real terms in this regard .  After China enters the WTO , changes in money supply and swings in interests in international markets will have a direct impact on China 's domestic financial market and money supply and they will make it more difficult to regulate and control money supply .  Consequently , China 's existing macroscopic financial regulation and control will face challenges .  
Moreover , our country 's financial supervisory departments have not yet indirectly controlled and regulated domestic financial supervision in real terms and established an effective supervisory system .  
In order to increase domestic demand and stimulate economic growth , the CPC Central Committee and the State Council pursued a proactive fiscal policy for three consecutive years , thus creating a fine macroeconomic environment for the process of reforming state enterprises and lifting them out of difficulty .  
Looking at the changes in market prices , the main impact came from the big rise in international oil prices and domestic policy-style price adjustments , and the real impact from being drawn forward by expanded market demand was still rather weak .  
Moreover , under the situation that relevant laws , regulations , and policies are not very perfect , opening China 's education markets will give rise to contradictions and problems in terms of education sovereignty , direction of running schools , education concepts , national cultural traditions , and management , and vehemently impact the relatively weak domestic educational industry , such as the production of educational instrument , studying appliances , books , software , toys , and so on .  
Since 1997 , with reference to those issues like the Asian financial crisis , insufficient effective domestic demands , and so on , active financial policies and firm and steady monetary policies were implemented .  Through issuing national debts , expanding investments , promoting consumption , and increasing exports , the deflation development tendency has been effectively stopped .  
During the period of the " Ninth 5-Year " Plan , the historical opportunity of expanding domestic demands and implementing active financial policies was seized .  Through issuing national debt and expanding investments , we have concentrated efforts to build a batch of major projects and fulfilled some big projects which we had always wanted to fulfill but failed .  The agricultural , forestry , and water conservancy construction has noticeably quickened .  
The Changzheng rockets independently developed by China have attained the advanced level in the world in the aspects of technical functions and practicability .  Apart from meeting the demands of domestic clients , it has also entered the international commercial market for rocket launching and attained remarkable social and economic effectiveness .  
In modern history , almost all debates on major issues concerning the country 's development orientation occurred against a background of domestic chaos or external threats or when the nation was facing profound crises .  In such circumstances , people did not have the objective environment for discussing such issues calmly and patiently .  As a result , people could not avoid reaching conclusions leading to rash actions for quick successes and instant benefits at the expense of long-term interests .  
However , the party central leadership and the State Council displayed its strategic insight , grasped the trend in the development and changes of the domestic and foreign economic situation , resolutely readjusted the orientation of macroeconomic control , and made a timely decision on shifting the primary task in macroeconomic control from curbing inflation to expanding domestic demand and overcoming deflation .  
The making of such a change was an important and timely strategic decision made by the party central leading body and the State Council according to its correct analysis of the domestic and international situation and development tendencies , with principal contradictions being grasped accurately .  
For the purpose of curbing deflation and expanding domestic demand , the implementation of a positive financial policy was consistently combined with the implementation of a moderate and stable monetary policy .  While efforts were made to promote economic growth , attention was also paid to keeping the smooth and stable operation of the economy .  
The fundamental approach to dealing with all our existing problems , including such economic construction problems as insufficient domestic demand , an irrational industrial structure , and uneven development across the regions and such political problems as the unification of the motherland , lies in accelerated development .  
Our comprehensive national capability is now of a substantial size .  Our gross domestic product is expected to reach 8,600-billion yuan for 2000 , with the overall economic volume being the seventh largest in the world ; foreign exchange reserves total over $ 160-billion ;  
Early in the War to Resist the United States and Help Korea , suddenly arriving new armaments were strange to many officers and soldiers because officers and soldiers of our armed forces had rather low scientific and educational levels and had all along used rather crude armaments during long years of domestic war .  Thus , in the second campaign , over 2,000 captured automobiles were destroyed by bombings executed by US armed forces because basically no one was able to drive an automobile to a place under cover .  
People have paid increasingly greater attention to such a harsh reality : With the process of economic globalization gathering pace and the scope of opening to the outside world expanding , national boundaries have been broken by fierce market competition , and the two markets , domestic and international , are gradually integrated .  
our domestic market has huge potential ; the socialist market economic system has taken shape ; the pattern of opening up in all directions is basically established , and all these factors have laid the sound foundation for accelerating development .  
Under the " Ninth Five-year Plan " in particular , despite the complicated domestic and international situations , China 's national economy still sustained rapid and healthy development ; the GDP grew at an average rate of 8 percent a year , and it is estimated that the year 2000 ' s GDP will top more than 8.7-trillion yuan , or more than $ 1-trillion at today 's exchange rate .  
In short , the opportunities globalization provides are objective opportunities , and we must seize these opportunities by participating in the globalization process , especially by joining the WTO , to fully utilize the international and domestic markets and resources , further perfect the socialist market economic system , accelerate the change in the pattern of economic growth and the adjustment of the economic structure , and continuously increase our international competitiveness .  
At the Party Central Committee 's conference on ideological and political work , Comrade Jiang Zemin noted that , " to do the ideological and political work well in the new period , we must profoundly analyze both the objective environment and the characteristics of the thinking of the larger number of cadres and the masses in the new situation from international , domestic , historical and realistic perspectives .  We must correctly examine and solve significant problems in both theory and reality that are influential to the thinking of cadres and the masses .  
After acceding to the WTO , China will engage in international economic and trade cooperation under the multilateral , stable , and unconditional most favored nation treatment provided by all WTO member countries .  It will enjoy the benefits of market access in other countries and regions , and international discriminatory trade restrictions will be eliminated in a step-by-step fashion .  This will create a beneficial international economic environment for developing China 's domestic economy and foreign economic relations and trade .  
From an overall perspective , China faces a good domestic and international environment for the development of foreign economic relations and trade next year ; global trade is expected to maintain a certain level of growth , and China 's domestic economy will continue to maintain fairly rapid growth .  
In recent years , China has faced complex domestic and international economic conditions .  In spite of this , China 's economy has continued the trend of sustained , rapid , and healthy growth .  
In recent years , the Central Committee has addressed the problems of overproduction and constant lowering of prices in China . In order to curb the trend of deflation , the Central Committee authoritatively made major policy decisions that included increasing domestic demand , the implementing positive fiscal policy , and stable and healthy currency policy studies .  They decided to issue more national bonds and increase infrastructure construction .  
Based on the overall strategic plan for national economic and social development for the new period , in the next five to 10 years the tourist industry should play a more vigorous role in promoting reform and opening-up , implementing the policy of expanding domestic demand , accelerating economic restructuring , and improving the people 's living standards .  
When moving into the new century , we have all reasons to believe that under the guidance of the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and under the strong leadership of the party central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , we will certainly be able to surmount all challenges and risks from either domestic or foreign factors , and the banner of socialism will flutter high on the vast land of China for ever .  
Similar to the criminal syndicates outside of Mainland China , domestic criminal and vicious groups have tried one-thousand and one ways to place themselves under a " protective umbrella . "  They have tried by hook or by crook to infiltrate into party and government organizations to seek political protection even to the point of directly seizing political power .  This is an extremely dangerous signal .  It is terribly harmful .  
Recently , a leading Taiwan official openly claimed that cross-strait transport links are " special international routes " and " the formulation that cross-strait links are domestic routes is absolutely unacceptable , " adding that this has involved the serious issue of so-called " national prestige . "  
Since Iraq recovered its domestic and some of its international air routes , more than 40 foreign planes have flown to Baghdad carrying ranking government officials and humanitarian materials , including even some US political figures , and the " no-fly zone " set up by the United States and Britain in fact exists only in name ; the United States has felt all the more that it " has no face at all " and seeks to demonstrate its powerful military strength and Gulf presence by bombing Iraq .  
Not only has it been innovative in adopting new ideological concepts and modes of thinking in carrying out its domestic construction , it has also changed the isolationism of its past foreign policy , enthusiastically taking the initiative in developing relations with various countries .  
In recent years , given the complicated circumstances where international struggles changed tremendously and domestic reforms constantly intensified , and in the face of severe economic , political and natural tests , the united front promoted a united and stable political situation and also created a vigorous and vital democratic atmosphere .  It has relied most on Deng Xiaoping Theory , and united front theory for the new period , in particular .  
We must uphold the policy of expanding domestic demand , continue to implement a proactive fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy , use various macro-control means in an integrated manner , and strengthen and develop the excellent economic growth situation .  
Deputy Ren Shimao , Secretary of the Huangshi municipal party committee , noted : those enterprises that intend to go abroad must upgrade their business management concepts , which include : taking the initiative in striking out on the international market , being prepared for surviving and growing amid fair competition in the international and domestic markets , attaching great importance to information collection both at home and abroad , and respecting others ' intellectual property rights while safeguarding ours . 
In conclusion , Committee Member Song Linfei stressed that , besides system innovation and efforts by enterprises , speeding up the urbanization process , bringing into full play the synergy of factors , strengthening the role of agricultural industrialization in promoting urbanization , and forming strong regional economic centers and growth points are also important strategic measures that should be taken in order to raise the international competitiveness of our domestic economy and cope with economic globalization .  
They briefed each other on their respective domestic situations and had an extensive exchange of views on further developing the relations of friendly cooperation between the two parties and the two countries of China and DPRK , on regional and international relations , and on other issues of common concern .  
Therefore , our military 's attitude toward the recent international focus of topics on Aegis frigates is of a very low key , thinking the heated debate of this topic will not help Taiwan obtain the Aegis frigates .  Furthermore , the Ministry of National Defense indirectly expressed its hope that the domestic military media will lighten the report on this issue .  
Facing the complex and complicated international and domestic environments , the vast number of officers and soldiers in the whole army have always affirmed their faith in Marxism , their conviction in socialism , their confidence in the reform and opening up and the modernization drive , and their trust in the party and the government .  They have further strengthened the concept of absolute leadership of the party over the army and more consciously maintained uniformity with the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core .  
During the period of the 10th Five-Year Plan , we should work closely around the goal of expanding domestic demand and adopt practical and effective macroeconomic fiscal policy and monetary policy to stimulate domestic market demand for investment and consumption in order to promote economic growth and upgrade the industrial structure .  
At the same time , because various non-tariff measures will be prohibited , our country can not employ traditional protective measures to protect domestic markets for agricultural products .  We can only learn and explore " the green box policy " with which we are unfamiliar , and , in certain regards , do not have the proper conditions to employ .  Thus , we will be in a unfavorable position to employ trade protection for our agricultural products .  
After our entry into WTO , domestic agricultural markets will certainly come into contact with the international market .  Faced with the unified , large international market which has over one-hundred years of history and which enjoys increasingly sound and healthy systems and operational mechanisms , such short-comings as the split between trade , industry and agriculture , disconnects between production and marketing , and enclosed , excessive and disorderly regional competition in our domestic agricultural market which has been divided by departments and administrative regions will be fully exposed .  
The overall quality of the main bodies of our rural markets does not measure up to that in developed western countries .  Many peasants and farm enterprises not only do not understand international agricultural trade , but also have little knowledge about the domestic market situations involving agricultural products and agricultural key elements .  It will be hard for them to participate in a timely and effective way in vigorous international market competition after our entry in the WTO .  
At this time , we must do an outstanding job on the following key links : first , we must entirely eliminate market barriers to realize self-motivated commodity trading and free commodity circulation and to ensure timely and rapid transportation of domestic agricultural products to the international market .  
He said that , in line with the international trend and existing domestic precedent , using high-tech principles to mix electronic sound with natural sound could unite the opera house and concert hall into one .  That would mean building only an opera house and a Beijing Opera playhouse , or one cultural square with two structures , which would save much investment .  
He noted that Taiwan has its fixed territory and stable government and can exercise its domestic power and international functions in a normal way .  " I am positive that based on typical and customary definitions of the international law , Taiwan qualifies to be a state , " he said .  
The source said that " a sense of crisis " was especially stressed at the Central Work Conference held earlier this year .  Analysis by the central authorities shows that the current domestic and international situation is intense .  
We are convinced that the Chinese Government can certainly and properly solve this matter according to the norm of international law and based on protecting state sovereignty and best interests , win extensive sympathy and support from world people , and defend a stable international and domestic environment needed for carrying out reform , opening up and economic construction .  
Jin Chanrong said : Currently , the political and diplomatic channels remain the main channels for solving the plane collision incident .  The denunciations made by the Chinese Communist side against the US side 's violation of international law and the mainland 's domestic laws were mainly aimed at supporting its own position , not aimed at taking any legal action .  
Once a vessel , either domestic or foreign , enters the waters covered by the harbor radar , it must declare its name , number , and tonnage to the control center and have them registered .  The radar monitor screen at the control center will clearly display the course , speed , position , and relative orientation of all vessels entering and leaving the harbor , enabling precise pilotage for them .  
Wang has conducted surveys of some joint venture enterprises in the coastal region of southern China , an area which is seen by many domestic and foreign companies as an excellent processing base , and as long as the design and standards for electronic products are provided , there are various ready-made associated facilities there , from raw materials and parts / components to assembly , etc .  
Wang Zhile surveyed some joint venture enterprises in southern China 's coastal area , which is regarded by many domestic and foreign corporations as the best processing base .  One only has to provide the designs and standards for electronic products , because all kinds of necessary factories , from raw materials , spare parts , to assembly , are already there .  
Wang Zhaoguo emphatically pointed out : Facing the very complicated current international situation and formidable domestic construction tasks , comrades of the united front must have a clear understanding of the situation , firm up their confidence , keep their heads cool , and adhere to the socialist road with Chinese characteristics .  
The committee members held that the economic situation in the first quarter of this year was rather stable , and the gross domestic product increased by 8.1 percent according to comparable prices over the same period of the previous year .  The growth rate was kept at the same level as that of the same period last year .  A good tendency to grow steadily was maintained .  
In the wake of expanded market access , tariff reduction , and elimination of non-tariff measures , foreign products , services , and investment will enter the Chinese markets en masse , and the domestic enterprises will face even more intense competition .  The township enterprises , in particular , are marked by the inherent poor quality among many of them , as demonstrated by , one , some enterprises ' extensive management mode .  Their environment is filthy , chaotic , and inferior ;  
People have noticed that after this incident occurred , political leaders in the United States showed a truculent and unreasonable attitude .  They were forced to express their regret to the Chinese side only after facing tremendous domestic and international pressure .  
The recently published " Blue Paper on Chinese Economic Forecasting , " which was put together by several well-known economists , predicts that China 's GDP will grow about 7.8 percent this year , barring a major deterioration in the international economic environment and provided that the Chinese government continues to base macroeconomic regulation and control on an active fiscal policy , properly coordinates the various macroeconomic regulatory and control measures , and further stimulates domestic demand .  
Xiang Huaicheng said : In order to encourage enterprises at home and abroad to participate in developing and building China 's western region , the Chinese Government has adopted some preferential policies in the tax revenue sector : The income taxes of domestic and foreign-investment enterprises engaged in industries that are encouraged to develop in the western region by the state will be reduced at a rate of 15 percent within a certain period ;  
Among the prohibitive clauses , the revised law has added the stipulations of prohibiting the married people from cohabiting with the persons other than their spouses and prohibiting domestic violence .  This has enhanced , in legislation , the dynamics of safeguarding monogamy and protecting the personal rights of family members .  This has also provided a basis in basic law for stemming unlawful behaviors of this kind through other legal means .  
Dai Xianglong , governor of the People 's Bank of China who is attending the Fortune Global Forum 2001 in Hong Kong , said today that when facing the slowdown of the world economic growth , China will continue to carry out its positive financial policy and moderate and prudent monetary policy , extensively open domestic markets , continue to increase its foreign exchange reserve , and continue to maintain the stability of the Renminbi exchange rates .  
In order to consolidate the good momentum of a turnaround in the economy this year and comprehensively size up the situation , China will continue to practice an active fiscal policy : First , we will issue 150-billion yuan worth of long-term construction bonds , with the focus on investment in sectors with the nature of " public items " such as infrastructure , environmental protection , and science and education ; we will increase effective domestic demand and also promote economic restructuring , innovation in science and technology , and sustainable development .  
When giving a briefing about Cambodian 's domestic situation , Hun Sen said : Under the leadership of King Sihanouk , Cambodia terminated the civil war and the consequent domestic turmoil which lasted many years , realized national reconciliation , and moved onto the path of national reconstruction with the cooperation of all political parties inside the parliament .  
As market competition gets increasingly sharp , state-owned enterprises , especially state-owned large companies and enterprise groups must strive to become international advanced enterprises , have an accurate grasp of the changes in domestic and international markets and the development direction of leading technology , find out the gap with international advanced enterprises , formulate a scientific and rational development strategy and a technological innovation plan , and clearly define what they endeavor to catch up with and surpass and where they should develop themselves .  
Right now , a considerable number of domestic enterprises are relatively low in standard .  Some of our enterprises carry out extensive management , while others are backward in technology and equipment .  Still others are weak in carrying out technical innovations .  
The new edition of " Military Doctrine " approved by Putin , which opposes NATO 's eastward expansion , has for the first time put forward the viewpoint that Russia 's national security is faced with " the danger of foreign invasion and domestic trouble and the aggravation of outside threat will constitute a military threat " to Russia .  
In recent years , your distinguished government has devoted itself to maintaining domestic political stability , vitalizing the national economy and promoting social progress , and has achieved positive results .  
We should closely associate with the domestic and international situation , military construction and the ideological reality of every individual person .  We should inspect ourselves in accordance with the requirements of the " three represents " , profoundly consider and effectively understand the essence and internal relations of the " three represents " .  We must thoroughly understand the historical background and the era-oriented significance of the " three represents " .  
Thus it is very natural for the Chinese people bullied and humiliated by superpowers from Western countries and domestic reactionary forces over the past 100-plus years ? to look forward to the socialist ideal - expect their country to be prosperous , rich and strong , but without the phenomena of a huge gap between the rich and the poor and the weak being bullied by the strong .  
US domestic and foreign policies will definitely have a tremendous effect on the world because of the United States ' superpower status in the world .  In particular , the readjustment of US military strategy will not be limited to US security only .  We can see that the political scheme and economic needs from that readjustment will have a major impact on the international political structure and strategic environment of the entire 21st century .  
It is for this reason that Comrades Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin , respectively the core of the first three generations of the leadership group of the Party Central Committee , published at crucial moments in the revolution and construction important speeches on " the current situation and the task , " comprehensively and correctly analyzed the domestic and international situation at that time and educated the Party , the military and the people .  
Particular efforts should be devoted to meticulously studying Chairman Jiang 's expositions on how we should understand the historical progress of development of socialist society , how we should understand historical progress of the development of capitalist society , how we should understand the influence on people 's thinking exerted by our practice of socialist reform and how we should understand the impact of the current international environment and international political struggles .  These expositions should be regarded as the guiding principle and fundamental basis for observing and understanding the international and domestic situation .  
Faced with complicated and dynamic international situations and domestic situations which are rapidly changing , some particularly significant unexpected issues over the past years , the Party Central Committee , with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , took a broad and long-term view of issues , devised strategies in a confident manner , and handled expected and sudden issues in a confident and calm manner , which embodied extraordinary leadership skills and the ability to handle complicated situations .  
At the time when the US economy is in recession and the depreciation of Japanese yen and Korean won has reduced the competitive edges of China 's exports , China 's economic officials and scholars maintain that devaluation of renminbi to stimulate exports and the economy is not likely in the foreseeable future , and that further expanding domestic demand and increasing investment and consumption remain to be China 's only correct policy measure for the present to cope with global economic slowdown .  
Some economists of China hold the view that the adverse influence of the decrease in exports on China 's economy has begun to show , but as long as we expand domestic total demand and implement the proactive financial policy and the steady currency policy , we will be able to sustain the stable growth , and there will be no need to adopt the policy of stimulating exports and the economy by appropriately devaluing renminbi .  
The Chinese Government will continue to carry out its vigorous financial policy and its steady currency policy in 2001 , and will steadily promote economic structural adjustment and its western development strategy , so the domestic economy will maintain steady and continuous growth .  
The meeting will center on the two major issues of preparations for the 16th CPC Congress and the international and domestic economic situations : First , the CPC Central Political Bureau will set out requirements on fostering senior leading cadres , so as to provide a basis for examining the qualifications of 16th CPC Central Committee members .  
Since this is the first year of the Tenth Five-year Plan and a crucial moment in China 's forthcoming WTO entry , assessments of this year 's implementation of the Tenth Five-year Plan and the international and domestic political , economic , and social environments in the first half of the year will be made at the Beidaihe meeting .  
Especially since the beginning of the 1990 ' s , with the continuous progress of the domestic and international situation and the magnificent cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , the central leadership collective of the party with Jiang Zemin as the core has adhered to the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts , and made new explorations in practice and a new summarization in theory of many major economic , political , cultural , military , and diplomatic issues , thus enriching and developing Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
We should understand the political value of the important thinking of the " three represents , " not only in light of the international environment faced by our country but also in light of the domestic tasks to be completed , particularly social issues .  
A division of Jinan Military Area Command regarded strengthening the leadership over ideological and political work as an important responsibility of party committees .  In light of the rapid development in the international and domestic situations as well as with frequent occurrence of crucial issues , this division promptly analyzed the ideological trend of the military , and adhered to the system according to which leading cadres give reports on the situation , answer questions that officers and soldiers are generally concerned about and use decisions made by the party Central Committee to unite thinking .  
Second , in order to expand domestic demand , should give 900-million farmers priority in benefiting from infrastructure investment that the state should be making in the countryside , including increasing road networks , water supply networks , electric supply networks , communications networks and radio and television networks between cities and the countryside , as well as inputs for the fundamental construction of farms , water conservancy and the ecological environment in the countryside , absorbing as many temporary farmers as possible and creating more employment opportunities for them .  
We should strive for diversification of property rights through multiple forms , such as standard public listing of companies , mutual purchase of shares by legal persons , domestic natural person investment , foreign investment , conversion of bank credits rights to equity , market share subscription , stock right transaction , and the holding of shares by employees of a company , and gradually establish and improve a standard system of corporate governance .  
We created a revolutionary path of encircling the cities from the rural areas and seizing state power by armed force .  With the people 's army as the backbone , we relied on the people and armed them .  We persisted in educating the officers and men in the party 's theory and program and defeated the better-equipped ferocious domestic and foreign enemies in the prolonged revolutionary wars .  
During the Ninth FYP , faced with the dual pressure of the Asian financial crisis and insufficient effective domestic demand , China further expanded the fields and scale of utilization of foreign investment while practicing a proactive fiscal policy and making efforts to increase domestic demand , and such utilization played an important stimulating role .  
Qiu Xiaohua was of the view that this year the theme of China 's economy is steady growth .  He predicted that steady growth in China 's domestic demand will be maintained in the near future and growths in both government and private investment will see a good development trend .  He added that , because of the government 's policy of encouraging utilization of foreign capital , it is expected that growth in foreign capital utilization also will be quite satisfactory .  
In the current trend of staff reduction in the domestic electronic sector , all factors and all personnel from the grass-roots level upward at home and abroad , who generated poor economic benefits , were strictly examined by enterprise owners .  
It is necessary to carry forward the fine study style of linking theory with practice .  The study should be closely linked with the fighting course of the party , with the profound changes in the domestic and international situation and in our country 's society , with the new things and new issues that we are facing in the work of party building .  The study of the speech should be combined with summing up work experience , solving problems , and promoting routine work .  
They included college students of the 56 ethnic groups , young pioneers wearing red ties , and outstanding athletes who won remarkable results in domestic and international sports events .  
He called on quality inspection departments to maintain a strict standard - - they should make sure not to allow fake and shoddy products of factories and enterprises to enter the domestic market , and at the same time they should make full use of inspection and quarantine means to block harmful overseas products from entering the domestic market and domestic fake and shoddy products from entering the international market .  
The latest issue of the Hong Kong journal Economic Reporter carries an article by Yuan Gangming , Director of the Macroeconomic Research Office of the Institute of Economics in the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences expressing the belief that strong domestic demand during the first half of the year supported China 's continued economic upswing , while the slowdown in exports threatened the macroeconomic upswing , estimating that policy options for encouraging exports in the second half of the year will encounter difficulties , and therefore proposing that China seek accelerated growth led by domestic demand .  
The article expresses the belief that China will join the WTO before the end of the year , the openness of the domestic market will be increased , and the traditional means used to control import growth will be reduced , so there may be a rather significant growth in imports , while net exports will decline further , perhaps to the point where the trade surplus becomes a trade deficit , which would have a fairly serious adverse effect on macroeconomic stability .  
The foreign policy must serve the needs of domestic development : making the country strong and prosperous , developing the economy , and improving the living standard of the people .  
At present , both China and Russia are shouldering the heavy tasks of developing the domestic economy , maintaining national unity , defending independence and sovereignty , and safeguarding their respective proper positions and legitimate rights in the international community .  
After Comrade Jiang Zemin examined the current domestic and foreign situations and the mission of our Party , and after he analyzed how to persist in keeping the Party 's nature one as the vanguard of the working class in the new historical conditions so as to safeguard our Party 's advanced nature , he put forward this extremely profound explanation , making clear the orientation of Party construction in the new period .  
First of all , with regard to the " theory of the China threat " spread by certain people in the international and domestic arenas , the two parties stated that they have no territorial demands on each other and they will act in accordance with the principle of international law that territory and national borders are inviolable , strictly observe the national border between them , and build this border into a border of everlasting peace and friendship for all generations .  
There is an absolute relationship between escalating domestic unemployment rates and industries relocating operations overseas ; since the economic advisory committee wants to solve the problem of unemployment , but instead focuses on discussing opening up the " three links " and the problem of relaxing the " no haste , be patient " policy , it can not escape being contradictory .  
As result of the democratic reform and socialist transformation as well as the ongoing reforms and opening up , Tibet has liberated and developed its social productivity in an unprecedented scale .  Last year , the region 's gross domestic product was more than 50 times that of the period before the democratic reform in 1959 .  
On the one hand , we should seize the present favorable opportunities to speed up the technical transformation of our traditional industries , the renewal of our products , and the upgrading of our industries , through digesting and introducing advanced technologies from foreign countries .  On the other hand , we must also base our efforts on our existing domestic resources ;  
He briefed Jiang Zemin about Moldova 's domestic situation , and said that since the general elections earlier this year , Moldova has won the best opportune moment for the nation 's economic and social development .  The government of Moldova has determination to exert all efforts to regenerate the national economy .  
The US believes that , in the aftermath of the Cold War , and particularly since entering the new century , there are still the following eight destabilizing factors in Asia : Border conflicts , religious contradictions , unstable domestic political situations , social and regional turmoil , territorial and sovereignty disputes , ethnic separatism , terrorist operations , and population problems .  
On the " Falungong " issue , Yang Jiechi said , based on its unspeakable aims , " Falungong " has come up with a whole series of absurd theories such as " the earth will be destroyed many times , " practiced mental control of its followers , and proclaimed that there is no need for sick people to seek medical treatment ; over 1,600 practitioners have died as a result , causing many domestic tragedies .  
The after-effects of the financial crisis still exist in certain countries in varying degrees , resulting in political turmoil and conspicuous ethnic , religious , and other social contradictions , seriously affecting the confidence of domestic and foreign investors .  
However , on the whole , the slowdown in global economic growth will not have a serious impact on China 's economy : Firstly , China has a huge domestic market ; public investment and private consumption take up most of the total supply and demand ; and economic growth in real terms is based on domestic demand .  
An informed person in Beijing said that because of weak foreign demand , the State Council has decided to continue the policy of expanding domestic demand in the second half of the year .  The Ministry of Finance will apply to the National People 's Congress next month for an additional issue of 50-billion yuan of constructive treasury bonds , and plans to distribute them to commercial banks in late October after the approval .  
He pointed out : With the economic slowdown in the developed countries of the United States and Japan , the principal driving force behind China 's economic growth ( 8.1 percent ) in the first half of the year mainly came from domestic demand .  The task of expanding domestic demand is still very urgent and must not be relaxed at all .  
China uses its military power to ensure a safe and secure domestic and foreign environment for our national economic construction and reform and opening up , to protect our national interest , national dignity and international prestige .  These all fall into the category of a self-protection strategy .  
Proceeding from the profound changes in the domestic and international situation faced by our party and from major historical tasks shouldered by our party , the speech systematically and penetratingly expounded the scientific connotation and the spiritual essence of the important idea of " three represents . "  
Proceeding from the intense changes in the domestic and international situation facing the party , and from the major historic task shouldered by the party , he comprehensively and profoundly expounded the scientific meaning and spiritual essence of the important thinking of the " three represents . "  
To meet the needs of China 's imminent entry into the World Trade Organization [ WTO ] , authorities in charge of industry and commerce administration are stepping up the reform of the enterprise registration system , said Wang Zhongfu , director of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce , at the ongoing national forum of industry and commerce bureau directors in Beijing . He said that work is under way to gradually standardize the registration procedure for foreign and domestic enterprises , including private businesses , and to form a unified system for market access .  
Officials of the senior presidential office and the Executive Yuan admitted frankly that direct shipping between the two sides of the strait constitutes the most difficult part in the current plan to comprehensively open up cross-strait economic and trade exchanges , but the initial plan will still designate six domestic ports as the cargo handling ports for cross-strait shipping .  
4 .  The Government should assess the feasibilities of establishing an offshore capital market .  According to international regulation , Taiwan should be prepared to establish an offshore capital market that operates independently from the domestic market .  Taiwan should attract overseas businesses , including the Taiwan businesses now operating on the Mainland , to become listed businesses or to issue securities in US dollar in this capital market .  
The fact that after being elected prime minister Koizumi insisted on stating that he would pay respects at the shrine , heedless of domestic opposition and external protests , shows not only his individual political attitude but is also an expression of the swelling growth of rightist forces in society , and people should be particularly concerned about this .  
Given this , in order to divert public attention from domestic economic issues , allow himself a breathing spell , and win more time for working out new economic policies , Junichiro Koizumi deemed it necessary to create some political , diplomatic , and military news , and this is nothing but an old trick favored by some Japanese politicians .  
With the fall of the Socialist Party , the LDP lost its main opposition , and the restricting forces against the LDP were weakened substantially .  Consequently , its domestic and foreign policies , with heavy conservative overtones , can be " carried out without hindrance . "  In foreign policy , in particular , its US policy , and policies toward Asia and China , have shown an increasingly sharp contrast between close and distant relationships .  
Any historical assessment of Japan 's war of aggression has been subjected to rigorous historical examination by every successive postwar Japanese government , but their annual statements marking the " Day the War Ended " ( they dare not call it the " Day of Surrender " ) have all been disappointing .  Disregarding strong domestic and foreign opposition , Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi insisted on paying his respects at Yasukuni Shrine , where a large group of war criminals is enshrined .  
As for which direction Japan is likely to move under Junichiro Koizumi 's leadership , we may view things from the following two aspects : First , insofar as domestic reform is concerned , Japan is expected to meet strong resistance and a host of difficulties , first and foremost , from Junichiro Koizumi 's Liberal Democratic Party , and thus , whether Japan 's reform can succeed and meet the Japanese people 's expectations is bound to have a direct bearing on the Junichiro Koizumi Administration ;  
Generally speaking , fluctuations in the exchange rate for the RMB are primarily driven by the following factors : domestic economic growth trends , situation of China 's international balance of payments , changes in interest rates inside and outside of China , the degree of liberalization of capital markets and social stability .  
After China 's entry to the WTO , she will have to act according to the relevant regulations , and with the basic premise of protecting the stability of the renminbi , use a phased liberalization of Chinese domestic capital markets .  This is because the protection of the exchange rate 's fundamental stability is beneficial to the long-term stability of Chinese economic growth .  
Some people close to the issue feel that international and domestic experiences all indicate that social stability is the fundamental guarantee of stable and rapid economic growth , and is also the foundation for a stable exchange rate for a currency .  
As Bush said that he regarded China as a " strategic competitor " during his election campaign , Henry Kissinger pointed out : Bush 's viewpoint is just an " immature expression aimed at pleasing the conservatives and the hard-liners in the Republican Party .

Article 23 shall be revised as : " Any exterior design for which a patent right may be granted shall not be identical with or similar to any exterior design that has , before the date of application , been publicly reported in a domestic or foreign publication or been publicly used in the country and shall not interfere with any legitimate rights obtained earlier by another person . "  
An expert says that this achievement has filled a vacuum in domestic synchronous satellite technology for real-time tracking of transportation carriers such as cars , trains , and ships , to bring China up to the advanced international level .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out : Both the international situation and the domestic situation are changing very rapidly and drastically , and our tasks are very arduous and complex .  To do a good job in reform and development and in ensuring stability , the leading cadres must possess a Marxist political sensitivity , know how to discover problems from a high political vantage point and solve them , and adhere to principle , take a systematic approach , and enhance their foresight and creativity in work .  
Commenting on the issues of direct cross-strait postal , commercial , and transport links [ hereafter termed as the " three links " ] during a meeting with a Taiwan Lien-Ho Pao delegation in Beijing in late August , Qian Qichen , vice premier of the State Council , pointed out : So long as Taiwan authorities acknowledge that cross-strait exchanges of air and shipping services will be conducted within the domestic flight and shipping routes of a single country , relevant concrete problems can be easily resolved .  
To resolve the " three-link " issues , if both sides jointly recognize that cross-strait exchanges of air and shipping services will be conducted within the domestic flight and shipping routes of a single country , both sides could simplify relevant provisions as much as possible .  Both sides definitely could refer and use the provisions governing direct experimental shipping between Fuzhou and Kaohsiung and between Xiamen and Kaohsiung . Thus , a lot of troubles can be avoided and sensitive issues can be easily resolved .  
Given that domestic political factors , especially the attitude of the US Congress , are exerting a growing influence on Sino-US relations , bilateral relations will be faced more stern challenges , and all kinds of unpredictable complications will force the leaders on both sides to keep adjusting their respective stands .  Whoever can come up with more specific policies and measures that can exert pressure on the other side will have the upperhand in this intangible trial of strength .  
At the same time , the acceleration in the process of China 's reform , opening up , and modernization will provide good business development opportunities to foreign investors mainly in the following aspects .  First , China 's continued efforts to implement the principle and policy of expanding its domestic demand , and to accelerate strategic economic restructuring , will provide extensive space for foreign investments in agriculture , water conservancy , energy , transportation , communications , raw and semi-finished materials , environmental protection , high technology , major equipment , and other fields .  
Analysts estimate that , by 2010 , China 's domestic output value will double with respect to its current base , and this will require the increased and more skillful introduction of foreign capital , advanced technology , and management experience , as well as vigorous development of economic and trade relations and the continued opening up of domestic markets .  
We should adapt ourselves to the new situation of developing socialist market economy and to the development of international and domestic markets under the new conditions of deepening reform and opening up wider , consider the reality of the western region , strive to explore new concepts , new mechanisms and new methods , base ourselves on the present , aim at the future , do what we are capable of step by step , and ensure an orderly , rapid and highly efficient proceeding of the large-scale development of the western region .  
This year is the year in which the state-owned enterprises will be engaged in the decisive battle for extricating themselves from predicament .  Along with the continuous implementation of a series of policies and measures promulgated by the central authorities to expand domestic demand and spur economic growth , various localities have increased the intensity of state enterprise reform and the work of extricating them from the difficulties , so that the state-owned enterprises are distinctly quickening their pace of turning around their economic performance and advancing toward the set goal .  
In addition to the macroeconomic situation and relevant policies , the main factors bearing on the trend of the automobile market in the second half of the year are as follows : First , the state is determined to screen and rectify various consumption-restricting policies , which will be conductive to stimulating domestic automobile consumption .  
Reportedly , the main orientation of the structural adjustments in the period of the Tenth Five-Year Plan will be as follows : Being oriented to the market , relying on scientific and technological progress and technical innovations , promoting the optimization and upgrading of the industrial structure , and striving to expand domestic demand .  
According to the " China-US Trade Agreement " China has always offered unconditional MFN treatment to the United States . But the US long-standing practice of an annual review of China 's MFN status in accordance with its domestic laws constituted a major impediment to the healthy and steady development of Sino-US economic relations and trade .  
It was precisely at this extraordinary time and in a domestic and foreign environment of unprecedented complexity that , by relying on the concerted efforts of the entire people to overcome various difficulties , we still accomplished the " 9th Five-Year " plan successfully , ensuring the sustained , rapid , and sound development of the national economy and comprehensively accomplishing the second strategic step in the drive to modernization .  
Hit by the double whammy of the impact of the Asian financial crisis externally and its serious impact on exports , and the structural surpluses and anemic domestic demand internally , the Party Central Committee readjusted its macro-regulatory policy priorities in a timely manner , implementing aggressive fiscal policies and using various economic levers in an integrated fashion to expand domestic demand and curb the deflationary trend and promote the various reforms in a stable manner , which played a decisive role in overcoming the difficulties occasioned by the financial crisis and stimulating the economic recovery .  
It will inspire them to strive hard at their respective work posts and create topnotch achievements in the world .  Third , with respect to basic research , we should not only enhance international exchanges and aim at the advanced international level , but also pay attention to our domestic industries and continue to broaden our vista .  
Although Japan lags behind the United States in information technology , it is not right to underestimate the potentials for Sino-Japanese cooperation in this field , because Japan is second only to the United States in the " comprehensive information capacity index , " while Japan also has many strong points in information technology ; for instance , the modem mobile phone that can be connected to the Internet , optical fiber telecommunications equipment , information domestic television , and all kinds of major electrical elements and parts .  
On the basis of summing up the experience of the Ninth Five-Year Plan and soberly analyzing the domestic and international situation at the turn of the century , the fifth plenum put forward the following major objectives for economic and social development during the 10th Five-Year Plan after carefully analyzing the situation : Maintain a relatively rapid speed of economic development , make progress in strategic economic restructuring and considerably improve the quality and efficiency of economic growth , in a bid to lay a solid foundation for doubling the GDP in 2010 compared with that of 2000 ;  
However , such a contrast does reflect , to a certain extent , a phenomenon , that is , unlike large-scale prominent enterprises in the overseas , some domestic enterprises fail to understand the historic opportunity arising from the development of the vast western region .  They lack the sense of urgency in grasping the opportunity .  It can not even be ruled out that some enterprises regard the party Central Committee 's strategic policy decision on the development of the western region as a political slogan .  
Now we are beginning to carry out the third-step strategy , that is , by the middle of the 21st century , China 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita will reach the level of moderately developed countries , and we will basically realize modernization and build a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized socialist country .  
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , in terms of the fundamental implementation of goals for the reform and development of the banking industry , it is estimated that during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , combined domestic and foreign financial loans increased by a total of 5.8 trillion yuan , for an average annual increase of 13.9 percent ;  
We must unswervingly focus on economic development by grasping opportunities and accelerating development .  This is a scientific decision made by the CPC Central Committee after making a correct judgment of international and domestic situation .  Facts related to China 's social development and national defense construction have proved that only when we have developed our economy , can we enhance our overall national strength and can the modernization of our armed forces have solid material foundation and strong personnel support .  
During his brief stay in the United States , Xiang Huaicheng also held talks with Summers and US National Economic Adviser Sperling [ si po lin ] .  The two sides exchanged views on international and domestic issues of common concern .  On 27 October , representatives of the Chinese Finance Ministry and the US Treasury Department will also hold a Sino-US financial dialogue and the first vice-ministerial-level session of the Sino-US Joint Economic Committee here to exchange views on such issues as capital markets , financial monitoring , corporate reorganization , and disclosure of accounting information .  
Both sides looked forward to the strengthening of cooperation in this regard .  They also noted that the APEC recently agreed to set up a working group that would conduct a survey of the domestic legal and regulatory frameworks for fighting financial crime in various economies .  
Wei Jianxing reiterated that the CPC is willing to develop fresh inter-party exchange and cooperation with the MPRP on the principle of independence and self-determination , total equality , mutual respect , and mutual noninterference in domestic affairs , so as to make new contributions to developing Sino-Mongolian good neighborly and friendly cooperative relations .  
According to a financial official , the total quantity control of the no haste , be patient policy absolutely will have no precise restriction on figures , but will take foreign investment demand , the amount of domestic funds , and the rate of economic growth as indexes .  
pay close attention to the tests facing party building under complicated domestic and foreign situations , carry out in-depth study of outstanding problems existing within the party , and earnestly solve them according to the important ideas of the " three represents [ representing the demands for the development of advanced social productive forces , representing the direction of the advanced culture in China , and representing the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people ] " ;  
Jiang Zemin said : Since the formation of the new Cambodian government , the two major ruling parties have , proceeding from the fundamental national and ethnic interests , cooperated unifiedly and worked hard to consolidate national reconciliation , developed the economy , actively developed foreign relations , and made tremendous achievements in domestic and foreign affairs work .  
Comrade Deng Xiaoping , chief architect of our country 's socialist reform and opening up , led all party comrades in emancipating their minds , seeking truth from facts , observing the characteristics of the times and the current international situation in an all-round way , summing up foreign and domestic socialist construction as well as historical and immediate experiences , and conducting difficult explorations , thus making important achievements in the theory and practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Dr . Zhao Jianglin pointed out : Judging from the present situation , the principal factors affecting the economic development in the ASEAN countries is the failure to set up a regional market so that they are unable to compete with the EU and other rivals .  In the future , the economies in the ASEAN countries will be regulated by stimulating domestic demand and enhancing efficiency .  
In accordance with the demands of economic development , we have upheld the guideline of expanding domestic demand , continued to implement an active fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy , vigorously pushed economic restructuring , strengthened the agricultural foundation , intensified the work of extricating state enterprises from difficulties , instituted the strategy of major development of west China , and adopted various means to expand exports .  
Uphold the guideline of expanding domestic demand , continue to practice an active fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy , and make comprehensive use of various means of macroeconomic regulation and control , to consolidate and develop the good momentum of economic growth .  
All these fully indicate the outstanding ability and leadership art of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core in controlling the overall economic situation under complex international and domestic situations .  These also suggest that the central authorities ' major decisions , principles , and policies on economic work are absolutely correct .  
The party 's third generation of leadership collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core upholds the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory and the party 's basic line ; despite varied and complicated international and domestic conditions , meets grim challenges of various types , including economic , political , and natural ; and firmly grasps the key theme of great unity and great union to further strengthen and develop the broadest patriotic united front .  
Three days after the tragedy , Beijing has learned from domestic and foreign media that Dongguan people had strong dissatisfaction at the casualty tolls - - eight persons dead and 32 injured - - published by local government .  The Beijing high echelon has also learned from a reliable source that the death toll was more than eight and , therefore , believed that Dongguan is concealing the truth .  
In the near term , the continuous practice of the proactive financial policies and moderate monetary policies is the concrete measure for carrying out the policy of expanding domestic demand , which is needed to ensure the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
In recent years foreign investment by developed countries has tended to be concentrated in a number of sectors which require small investment , yield high profit , and are regionally concentrated ; this not only runs counter to the goal of the host countries in making efforts to develop hi-tech industry , but is also extremely prone to result in foreigners controlling the pattern of industry and domestic market , and this directly endangers the economic lifelines of the developing countries .  
The local departments in charge of economic and trade matters must tightly seize this advantageous time of economic growth and the opportunity of the country 's impending WTO accession to vigorously forge ahead , actively make breakthroughs , and work hard to open up new prospects in domestic and foreign trade .  
The election this year was held at a time when the US economy is prospering for the ninth successive year , the social environment is relatively stable , and the United States has maintained its strong international status .  According to convention , this domestic and foreign situation should benefit the ruling Democratic Party instead of the opposition Republican Party .  
The DPP 's numerous domestic policy changes , which are rife with contradictions , have accelerated foreign migration of industries and capital and caused severe depression in the stock market , depreciation of the Taiwan dollar , and considerable shrinkage of people 's assets .  
After an arduous struggle , Texas Governor George W . Bush finally becomes the new US president in the new millennium and new century .  Bush 's campaign road was rough and rugged , and his road to the White House will not be smooth .  According to an analysis , the new Bush administration faces four stern challenges : How to suit the domestic situation of balance of power between the left and the right and appropriately take a centrist road ;  
We must adhere to the principle of expanding domestic demand , continue to implement a proactive financial policy and a moderate monetary policy , comprehensively use all means of macroeconomic regulation and control to consolidate and develop the good situation of economic growth and promote the sustained , rapid and healthy development of the national economy and comprehensive social progress , and strive to make a good start in fulfilling the Tenth Five-year Plan .  
American media started to call Clinton a " lame duck " before the curtain was raised on the election campaign in the first half of this year , meaning that as he was soon to leave office , domestic attention switched the new master of the White House who would replace him , while international opinion would gradually take an attitude of observation , so it would be hard to him to have much impact on domestic and foreign affairs in the future .  
Zeng Peiyan said : In 1998 , the CPC Central Committee decided to implement a proactive fiscal policy in order to overcome the adverse impact of the Asian financial crisis , expand domestic demand , and maintain sustained , rapid , and healthy national development .  
China 's grain production capacity has rapidly advanced in recent years but the cost has increased progressively at an average annual rate of 10 percent and the structural imbalance between supply and demand has manifested itself increasingly and had a negative effect on increasing peasants ' income and on state finances .  Except for rice , domestic grain prices generally have been 20 percent higher than prices on the world grain market during this period .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents " was precisely put forward from the high ground of the future and destiny of the party and state on the basis of a sober understanding and accurate grasp of the domestic and international situation , the historical tasks shouldered by the party and the reality of party building , as well as on the basis of a thorough analysis and profound summary of the positive and negative experiences of the building of proletarian political parties , especially the building of our own party .  
The introduction of these policies and measures is conducive to increasing fund input for the western development , improving the environment for investment in the western region , opening the western region still wider to both foreign and domestic investors , and giving greater support to the development of science , technology , education , and the training of talented personnel in the western region .  It will certainly produce an important effect in pushing forward the implementation of the large-scale western development strategy in a positive and orderly way .  
Zeng : To put the large-scale western development into effect , we should be adapted to the trend of economic globalization and China 's upcoming accession to the WTO , seize the opportunity of opening up still wider to foreign and domestic investors , enlarge the spheres of investment by foreign businessmen , broaden the channel of using foreign capital , make positive use of foreign loans , vigorously develop foreign economic relations and trade , and expand economic and technological exchange and cooperation with various countries in the world including the neighboring countries .  
To put the large-scale western development into effect , we should also adapt our work to the requirements of instituting and perfecting a nationwide unified market system , seize the opportunity of opening to the domestic sectors , break down regional barriers , smash departmental and industrial monopoly , further open the markets , and encourage and support enterprises in the eastern and central regions to make investment and operate business in the western region .  
In 1998 , in order to counter the adverse effects of the Asian financial crisis and continue the national economy 's sustained , rapid , and healthy development , the Party Central Committee decided to implement a policy to expand domestic demand by issuing more treasury bonds to finance long-term construction projects and strengthen infrastructure constructions .  
At the NPC Standing Committee 's request , the arrangements and utilization of long-term treasury construction bonds have focused on expanding domestic demand to spur economic growth , promote structural readjustments , and lay a solid foundation of the country 's long-term development .  Projects already underway were given priority , and preferences were given to the central and western regions , especially the west .  
The party at large must center on this topic , conduct investigations and studies , reach a consensus , and respond by taking into full account changes in the international and domestic situations , growth of our country 's productive forces and profound transformations of the economic system , calls for the development of the material and cultural life of the masses , and major changes in the contingent of party members and cadres .  
Although the overall international situation tends to be eased up , the forces of hegemony and power politics still exist .  They rely on their economic and scientific and technological edge to interfere in the domestic affairs of other countries and attempt to control the world , thereby threatening world and regional peace and stability .  
Many of the existing favored treatment measures in tariff reduction and waivers can be studied and readjusted ; by this means we can not only expand the tariff base and ensure that revenue will not be reduced as the tariff rate falls but , as the total value of imports rises , tariff revenue will show a big increase , and in particular , it can protect the healthy development of domestic industries in an environment of equal competition and avoid conflicting with the demands of the WTO rules .  
At the meeting , Zhu Rongji pointed out : In the past five years , the people of all nationalities throughout the country were united in brave advancement under the leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core to make great achievements in all areas , fulfill the Ninth Five-Year Plan as scheduled , and successfully achieve the second-step strategic objective of modernization in the face of complex international and domestic situations .  
The Chinese and Korean party and state leaders briefed the other side on their domestic situation in a cordial and friendly atmosphere , and exchanged views on the further development of bilateral relations as well as major international issues of common interest . 
Since the beginning of winter , there have been six major snowfalls in the eastern and central parts of Inner Mongolia . The low temperatures and accumulated snow throughout an extensive scope have become disastrous to 1.6 million people in 31 banners and counties of five leagues in the autonomous region , and a large number of domestic animals have frozen to death .  
All this will definitely provide various business opportunities for Hong Kong . For example , Hong Kong may raise and provide funds , financial services , and other relevant professional service for the development projects in the western part of China , and may directly launch investment projects there as well .  The local advantages in the interior areas may be used in cooperative production , and the products may be exported and directly shipped to domestic markets in other areas .  
Through competition between the same trades at home and abroad , our investment climate will improve further and our domestic markets will completely be open to the outside world .  The government on the mainland is sparing no efforts to create conditions for encouraging investment in the central and western regions .  Under these new circumstances , Hong Kong businessmen in the mainland will face issues such as how to expand and upgrade themselves , how to shift their orientation to high technology and additional high value , and how to carry out a new regional distribution program .  
It has been learned that at an informal discussion meeting of a domestic databank on Wednesday , which has not been made public , McVadon specially clarified the main purpose of his speech delivered on Monday . He said he did not mean Taiwan need not deploy the TMD , and he thought because Taiwan is close to the mainland , the early warning time is short , and even if Taiwan has a complete missile defense system , it still can not intercept so many short-range missiles from the other side of the Taiwan Strait .  
Since the beginning of 2000 , the volume of contracted foreign investment has rapidly recovered and begun to climb up , driven by the effect of the pending WTO accession and a major turnaround in China 's domestic economy .  However , the volume of actual foreign investment continued to drop , due to the delayed effect from the drop of contracted foreign investment in the previous year .  By the end of November , the amount of foreign investment in real terms was 2.29 percent lower than the same period of the previous year .  
Zhu Mingxian said : At the critical period of China 's economic structural adjustment , it is imperative to firmly seize the quality work as the main direction of attack , which is of extremely important significance to expanding domestic demands and practicing the proactive financial policy .  
President Chen pointed out that as a state leader , he deeply understands the implications of cross-Strait relations on domestic politics , foreign relations , economy and trade , national defense and other sectors .  He described this as " a slight move in one part may affect the situation as a whole . "  He also recognized the popular wish for a " stable and peaceful situation in the Taiwan Strait . "  
Shi Fenghai pointed out : It is expected that foreign capital will be concentrated first in high-profit business fields and areas - - international and domestic long-distance calls , IP telephony , Beijing , Shanghai , Guangzhou , and other important eastern areas will become the key business fields and areas which foreign capital will enter .  
China must go further to expand domestic demand , promote sustained and stable economic development , and can not depend for a long time on methods of borrowing money from national financial organs .  It must expand the vigor of non-government investment , and make up an investment system and mechanism for the entire society that is driven by finance and investment , and in which non-government investment actively participates .  
The improvement of the state 's macroeconomic environment mainly included the adoption of a proactive financial policy and moderate monetary policy , the expansion of domestic demands , and the promotion of economic growth by means of investment , consumption , and export , which have played an excellent role in improving the external environment for enterprises ' production and operation .  
We must be sincerely patient , painstaking , and fair and reasonable in our education and guidance of the majority of " Falungong " practitioners , helping them to further understand the essence of and grave threat represented by Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " organization and walk away from the preposterous world he has fabricated so they have concern for the development of the international and domestic situation , the future fate of the Party and the country , and the great enterprise of reforms and opening up and the drive to socialist modernization .  
Presently , excessive export of capital is still unsuited for China , being a developing country .  Allowing domestic residents to invest in B shares with their legally owned foreign currencies , therefore , is a new subject stemming from the changes in the macroeconomic situation .  
Although it is impossible to make a concrete judgment before the detailed rules for the implementation of the policy are promulgated , yet the fact that foreign and domestic investors compete with one another to trade B shares in the same markets and their profits and losses are inevitably reflected in the balance of international payments in foreign exchange shows that , after all , extremely important progress has been made even though we can not say that the free convertibility of renminbi is right under our noses . 
Those attending today 's forum unanimously held : Putting forward this important thinking is of profound theoretical and practical significance , and it is a scientific thesis reached on the basis of summing up foreign and domestic experiences in governing countries as well as an enrichment and development of the Marxist theory of states ; it is also an important overall strategy for running the country put forward at a time when our country is entering a new stage of economic and social development .  
After listening to what others said , Jiang Zemin pointed out that since the beginning of the new century , profound changes have been taking place in the international situation , and the domestic tasks in reform and construction are also quite heavy and formidable .  He said that we have rare opportunities and favorable conditions for speeding up development , but we also face new situations , new contradictions , and new difficulties , and we may encounter all kinds of risks as we move ahead .  
The development environment over the next five years suggests that the 10th Five-Year Plan will be implemented against a backdrop that is entirely different from the backdrop to all previous five-year plans - - one that is characterized by China 's impending accession to the World Trade Organization , the growing trend toward economic globalization , the close integration of domestic and foreign markets , a world swept up in a knowledge-based economy and a new technological revolution , and the launching of the strategy of developing western China on a massive scale .  
To lay a solid foundation for achieving a gross domestic product in 2010 that is double the 2000 figure , the document is expected to call for maintaining a fairly rapid pace of national economic development , achieving remarkable results in the strategic realignment of the economic structure , and achieving marked improvements in the quality of economic growth and economic returns .  
Zhu Rongji said in his report : The main objectives of economic and social development in the next five years are as follows - - maintain a rather fast growth rate in the national economy , achieve marked results in the strategic adjustment of the economic structure , substantially enhance the quality and efficiency of the economic growth , lay a solid foundation for doubling the 2000 gross domestic product in 2010 ;  
This is because we have initially established the socialist market economy structure , and accumulated more experience in macroeconomic management and in regulation and control ; and we have overcome difficulties caused by insufficient effective domestic demand through implementing the guideline of expanding domestic demand and practicing an active fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy .  
At the turn of the century , China 's economy is facing a great deal of opportunities and challenges against the domestic and international background : After more than 20 years of reform and opening up , the domestic market has shaken off the longstanding condition of short supply , the structure of a market economy has been established in a preliminary form , and a fundamental change has occurred in foreign economic relations ;  
CPPCC member and Shanghai Fuxing High Tech ( Group ) Inc . CEO Guo Guangchang said that when China joins the WTO , the dynamics of financial opening to foreign counties will increase further , presenting our domestic economic and fiscal reform with new opportunities and challenges .  Opening up a non-government owned and operated bank market and preparing to establish non-government owned and operated banks is essential , and in every aspect of this the prerequisites have already matured .  
Delegate Jiang Demin believes that " We must improve the economic value for intellectuals .  Although domestic treatment still can not compare with that of foreign countries , we can adopt some special , favorable policies to permit talent returned from overseas to draw a certain percentage of sharing in the profits from their technologies , and permit them to hold multiple positions and salaries . "  
The ' outline ' of the " 10th Five-Year Plan " is predicated on the overall situation , long-term and fundamental needs and on the basis of analyzing domestic and foreign environmental factors and making scientific determinations , the plan takes a fresh look at the direction , goals , and path of our nation 's social and economic development in the new century - - our nation has begun to move towards the strategic goal of the third step .  
Nine hundred million of the total of over 1.2 billion people are in the rural areas .  The key to expanding domestic demand lies in developing the rural market , trying by every possible means to increase the peasants ' income , and turning the potential purchasing power in rural areas into actual purchasing power .  
In the 1980 ' s we started relatively early in opening up the trades of electric appliance and information industry equipment to the outside world .  While a number of enterprises have crumpled , after 10 and more years of efforts , some domestic enterprises have become well developed in the course of competition , typical among them are Haier , TCL , Changhong , Kangjia , Chunlan , Lianxiang , Changcheng and Huawei , which not only have won back a considerable share of the domestic market , but are advancing toward the world also .  
In the vast central and west region , the natural and human resources are abundant , the operational costs are cheap , the domestic markets are huge , and the scientific and technological development and manufacturing industry have also had considerable foundations .  
All the armed forces stood up to the rigorous tests of complicated international and domestic situations as well as military and political struggles , always kept a high degree of stability , centralization , and unification , and accomplished with flying colors such tasks as conducting major military exercises , fighting floods and dealing with emergencies , holding a military review in celebration of the 50th founding anniversary of the PRC , and assuming the defense responsibilities in Hong Kong and Macao , making important contributions to defending and building the motherland .  
It is necessary to promote development through opening up , to always persist in implement the strategy of opening to the outside world to bring along economic development , and to raise the level of our work in using resources at home and from abroad and both the international and domestic markets .  We should cater to the domestic market and seize business opportunities ; we should advance both east and west and make it possible for the eastern and western regions complement each other with their own advantages .  
Competition in the aspect of agricultural development comes more often from the foreign market than from the domestic market .  As far as hundreds of millions of peasants are concerned , it is rather difficult to increase their incomes by simply relying on growing crops .  Having insufficient stamina , township enterprises , which flourished some years ago , find it hard to become a major channel for increasing peasants ' incomes in a short period of time .  
deepen reforms , expand opening-up , strive to make the two fundamental changes , take the initiative in advancing in the front of institutional and technological innovations , actively make use of both domestic and overseas resources , open up both domestic and international markets , gather momentum and vigor of sustained development ;  
We should adhere to the policy of expanding domestic demand and continue to follow a proactive fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy so as to promote the steady growth of effective demand and the adjustment of economic structure .  We should strengthen the foundation position of agriculture , increase peasants ' income , and consolidate and expand results in helping state-owned enterprises carry out reform and eliminate deficits .  
In accordance with the domestic and international situation our nation is facing , the outline of the Tenth Five-Year Plan sets forth the main objectives , guiding principles , and major tasks for economic and social development in our country , points out the orientation for our further advances , and gives expression to the fundamental interests and common wishes of the entire people of all ethnic groups throughout the country .  
The key to conforming to the general trend of readjusting the world 's economic structure and striving to hold a still more advantageous position in the international and domestic division of labor lies in building up an industrial pattern with optimum structure and high competitive power .  
Legqog excitedly said : Tibet has developed fastest in the past seven years .  Its annual gross domestic product ( GDP ) has topped 10 billion yuan , and its economic-growth rate has surpassed the country 's average for seven years in succession , reaching 12.9 percent ; Tibet has basically fulfilled the 2000 objectives and tasks set for it at the Third Central Forum on Tibet 's Work .  
Since the second half of 1998 , under the leadership of the party central committee and the State Council , the State Development Planning Commission started to organize personnel to make preliminary preparations and conduct investigation and study for the formulation of the 10th Five-Year Plan , which included more than 140 special subjects totaling as many as five million words and covered such contents as the basic judgment on the domestic and international environments , the principal development targets , the basic strategic choices , the main considerations about policies , and so on .  
It is necessary to further improve the investment environment , formulate policies that will encourage investment in geographic survey , prospecting and developing mineral resources in the western areas , guiding domestic and foreign investors to making investment in the western areas , and promoting the sustained , high-speed , and healthy development of mining industries in the western areas .  
from investment to consumption and to other fields , a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy have been implemented flexibly , the policy of expanding domestic demand has been resolutely pursued , and measures for macroeconomic regulation and control have been highly effective .  
Further expanding domestic demand will make it possible for us to have the initiative in our hands in developing the economy and maintaining sustained and steady economic growth , and this is also a strategic move in smoothly carry out the 10th Five-Year Plan and fulfilling the third-step development objective .  
In the second quarter of 1997 , domestic exports classified to the four major industries of textiles ; wearing apparel ; machinery , equipment , apparatus , parts and components ; and consumer electrical and electronic products together accounted for 69% of Hong Kong 's total domestic exports of manufactured goods , according to statistics released today ( Friday ) by the Census and Statistics Department .  
In the second quarter of 1997 , domestic exports classified to the consumer electrical and electronic products industry decreased by 8% over a year earlier to $ 5.9 billion ; and those to the wearing apparel industry decreased by 6% to $ 8.8 billion .  
" Yet the decline in July was smaller than the average decrease of 3.4% recorded in the first half of this year , " he said , adding that retained imports continued to rise in July for the tenth consecutive month , underpinned by the sustained strength of domestic demand . 
Proceeding from their actual situation at home and in light of their needs and possibilities , the developing countries should work out effective domestic policies and actively conduct economic restructuring in response to shifting economic and technological trends in the world .

For value of airborne domestic exports , decreases were recorded for electrical machinery , apparatus and appliances , and electrical parts thereof ( by $ 3.3 billion or 34.7% ) ; and professional , scientific and controlling instruments and apparatus ( by $ 1.4 billion or 62.4% ) in the first half of 2002 .  
In the second quarter of 2002 , the value of domestic exports classified to the four major industries of textiles ; wearing apparel ; machinery , equipment , apparatus , parts and components ; and consumer electrical and electronic products together accounted for 76% of Hong Kong 's total domestic exports of manufactured goods , according to statistics released today ( August 15 ) by the Census and Statistics Department .  
Comparing June 2002 with a year earlier , the volume of domestic exports of scientific , medical , optical , measuring , and controlling instruments and apparatus ; and metal manufactures decreased substantially , by 56.9% and 26.1% respectively .  
This was mainly attributable to an accelerated drop in the price deflators for private consumption expenditure and for gross domestic fixed capital formation , as well as a renewed fall in the price deflator for government consumption expenditure .  
The meeting , to be held on September 5 and 6 , will focus on ways to strengthen global economic growth , combating terrorist financing and money laundering , advancing fiscal and financial reforms , and improving the allocation of domestic savings for economic development .  
Comparing July 2002 with a year earlier , the volume of domestic exports of scientific , medical , optical , measuring , and controlling instruments and apparatus ; and metal manufactures decreased substantially , by 56.0% and 34.2% respectively .  
Despite the financial crisis which forced Asian governments and businesses to strengthen their systems and to re-climb the ladder to growth , Mr Leung said no Asian country was more robust than China with a continuing economic growth consistently at seven to eight per cent a year , a stable currency , a booming manufacturing base and a blossoming domestic market . 
Topics involved include merchandise retained imports , trade in services , gross domestic product by economic activity at constant prices , international investment position , education , health and stock transactions .  
In the third quarter of 2002 , the value of domestic exports classified to the four major industries of textiles ; wearing apparel ; machinery , equipment , apparatus , parts and components ; and consumer electrical and electronic products together accounted for 80% of Hong Kong 's total domestic exports of manufactured goods , according to statistics released today ( November 14 ) by the Census and Statistics Department .  
Human rights in Hong Kong are founded on the rule of law , an independent judiciary , the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance ( Cap . 383 ) which incorporated provisions of the ICCPR as applied to Hong Kong in our domestic law and empowered the court to grant remedies for contravention of the Ordinance and a sound and comprehensive legal aid system that assures the individuals of access to the courts to seek redress and reparation for alleged violations of human rights .  
Within the GDP deflator , the domestic demand deflator had an enlarged year-on-year decline of 4.4% in the third quarter of 2002 .  This was attributable to a larger fall in the price deflators for private consumption expenditure , for gross domestic fixed capital formation , and for government consumption expenditure .  
Within the total exports of goods , the forecast increase in real terms in re-exports is raised to 9% from 7% , but the forecast decline in real terms in domestic exports is lowered to 9% from 8% , with the latter adjustment reflecting an accentuated structural shift away from domestic exports to re-exports and offshore trade . 
Overall investment spending in the economy , as represented by gross domestic fixed capital formation , is now expected to decline by 4.1% in real terms in 2002 , up from the earlier forecast of a 4.8% fall .  
For value of airborne domestic exports , decreases were registered for electrical machinery , apparatus and appliances , and electrical parts thereof ( by $ 3.3 billion or 21.8% ) ; and professional , scientific and controlling instruments and apparatus ( by $ 2.5 billion or 68.3% ) in 2002 .  
In 2002 , the value of domestic exports classified to the four major industries of textiles ; wearing apparel ; machinery , equipment , apparatus , parts and components ; and consumer electrical and electronic products together accounted for 78% of Hong Kong 's total domestic exports of manufactured goods , according to statistics released today ( February 11 ) by the Census and Statistics Department .  
Along with the significant downward adjustment in various local economic indicators since the last adjustment to the minimum allowable age for foreign domestic helpers in 1999 , the minimum allowable wage for foreign domestic helpers will be reduced by $ 400 per month for employment contracts signed on or after April 1 this year . 
Comparing January 2003 with a year earlier , decreases were recorded in the volume of domestic exports of all principal commodity groups , with particularly large declines recorded for scientific , medical , optical , measuring , and controlling instruments and apparatus ; and metal manufactures .  
In early 2002 , Government pledged to promote the development of the local community economy ( LCE ) with a view to stimulating domestic consumption and creating job opportunities .  Through the concerted efforts of the community , we have already implemented a number of LCE initiatives proposed by the community , including a gala point , a temporary bazaar , a computer festival , arts corners , promenades , alfresco dining and recreational fishing in mariculture areas .  
Comparing February 2003 with a year earlier , decreases were recorded in the volume of domestic exports of most principal commodity groups , with particularly large declines recorded for scientific , medical , optical , measuring , and controlling instruments and apparatus ; and electronic components .  
Comparing the first quarter of 2003 with the same period in 2002 , decreases were registered in the value of domestic exports of electrical machinery , apparatus and appliances , and electrical parts thereof ( by $ 1.6 billion or 38.5% ) ; photographic apparatus , equipment and supplies , optical goods , watches and clocks ( by $ 442 million or 55.5% ) ; professional , scientific and controlling instruments and apparatus ( by $ 419 million or 56.8% ) ; and office machines and automatic data processing machines ( by $ 253 million or 17.8% ) .  
In the first quarter of 2003 , the value of domestic exports classified to the four major industries of wearing apparel ; textiles ; machinery , equipment , apparatus , parts and components ; and consumer electrical and electronic products together accounted for 75% of Hong Kong 's total domestic exports of manufactured goods , according to statistics released today ( May 12 ) by the Census and Statistics Department .  
Comparing March 2003 with a year earlier , decreases were recorded in the volume of domestic exports of most principal commodity groups , with particularly large declines recorded for " scientific , medical , optical , measuring , and controlling instruments and apparatus " and " electronic components " .  
Overall investment spending , as represented by gross domestic fixed capital formation ( GDFCF ) , had a modest growth of 3.9% in real terms in the first quarter of 2003 over a year earlier , after a 0.7% decline in the fourth quarter of 2002 . 
The strong current account surplus reflected both an improvement in competitiveness , resulting from the depreciation of the real effective exchange rate , and weak domestic demand .  
An environmentalist is reported to have stated that the underground drainage system in the area around Dundas Street in Mongkok has been misconnected , causing the inflow of sewage from commercial and domestic buildings into the stormwater drainage system and threatening the health of the residents in the vicinity .  As such sewage may not have undergone any treatment before it is directly discharged into the Victoria Harbour , the marine environment may be polluted .  
The presence of domestic sewage and trade effluent in the communal drains there is probably caused by illegal expedient connections between individual private buildings and the communal drainage system , or by the direct discharge of wastewater into the drains at roadsides or back lanes .  
Some public housing tenants have recently expressed certain demands in connection with the judicial review .  Since their demands are closely linked to the Authority 's decision to appeal , the Authority therefore decided this morning that upon conclusion of the legal proceedings and clear judgment from the court on the proper interpretation and implementation of the relevant legal provisions , it would proceed to review its domestic rent policy and identify a satisfactory arrangement for rent adjustment immediately in accordance with the law . "  
For value of airborne domestic exports , decreases were registered for " electrical machinery , apparatus and appliances , and electrical parts thereof " ( by $ 2.8 billion or 45.3% ) , " professional , scientific and controlling instruments and apparatus " ( by $ 464 million or 55.4% ) and " miscellaneous manufactured articles consisting mainly of jewellery , goldsmiths ' and silversmiths ' wares " ( by $ 345 million or 9.7% ) in the first half of 2003 .  
In the second quarter of 2003 , the value of domestic exports classified to the four major industries of textiles ; wearing apparel ; machinery , equipment , apparatus , parts and components ; and consumer electrical and electronic products together accounted for 75% of Hong Kong 's total domestic exports of manufactured goods , according to statistics released today ( August 11 ) by the Census and Statistics Department .

They hope to meet domestic needs and also to sell their products abroad . One of the important factors deciding the quality of electric wire and cables is the copper " wick . " High quality electric wire and cables call for pure and highly malleable copper rod .  
Since the oil shock , the price of textile raw materials has skyrocketed , and meanwhile the people 's living standards were rising , resulting in higher labor costs . The developed countries protected their domestic textile industries with import quotas . Moreover , the ROC had been concentrating on the low-priced market . As such less-developed areas as the Philippines , India and Mainland China took advantage of very low labor costs and local resources , the competition grew .  
The Epidemic Disease Control panel supported continued cooperation with foreign organizations to develop a vaccine for hepatitis B . The overseas scholars set up a continuation committee to carry on this and related work . The Food Technology panel : Increase cooperative planning between domestic growers , producers , and exporters , increase the quality of products ; reduce overhead ; produce new processed foods to open new markets .  
One of the first national measures promulgated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs was in May 1981 . This legislation sought to contain the violation of trademarks and the false marks of " made in . . . " trend in domestic manufacturing of counterfeit goods . Conditions of this measure included : All products manufactured in the country had to have a label stating made in the Republic of China as well as proper evidence of registration from importing countries for OEM items .  
As the economy industrialized , however , domestic makers began to supply spare parts and accessories and maintenance services , gradually developing the ability to make simple goods , until today where the product range extends from machines that make instant noodles to those that manufacture concrete and chemical products .  
The 1987 Taiwan economic construction plan approved by the Executive Yuan , which foresees the attainment of an eight percent growth rate , includes many policies and measures , among which particularly to be stressed is that , besides maintaining an appropriate increase in exports , domestic demand must also be expanded , including raising the private willingness to invest and expanding public investment , thereby making domestic demand and export trade the two main forces for economic growth .  
As to how to clean up the Tamsui River system , Premier Yu stated that his preliminary view is that the main sources of pollution of the Tamsui River system are pollution caused by urban domestic sewage , industrial waste water , and refuse dumped along the river banks .  
The method of controlling urban domestic sewage is to construct a modernized sewerage system that would collect sewage from buildings , transport it through sewage lines , treat it in treatment plants , and discharge it in a suitably selected location and which would prevent sewage that has not been treated appropriately from flowing into the river .  
The late President Chiang Ching-kuo , who boldly strove to promote democratic , constitutional government and march down the road of liberalization , left unfulfilled aspirations behind . At a time when our nation faces dramatic changes in its economic and political situations , how will President Lee fuse the conservative and reform forces , adapt to domestic and foreign trends , and lead the nation along the road to advancement ? The question is not a small one .  
To maintain economic growth , Taiwan must spur its domestic demand , although a large increase over a short time will not be easy . In addition , the growing incidence of demonstrations brought on by the democracy movement , the spread of influence by interest groups on the legislative process , and the growth of environmental consciousness mean that business must pay higher social costs , higher costs which will slow down Taiwan 's economic growth .  
As for the international situation , the United States had already issued forth an official government report , and was prepared to cast aside Taiwan . As for the domestic situation , Taiwan had met up against a dire shortage of raw materials and inflation . Also , the Chinese Communists had their eyes set on Kinmen and Matsu , and were making strategic preparations to attack .  
The government hopes that overseas experts and consultants can work together with domestic construction firms and academic institutions from the viewpoints of urban planning , financing , and urban management in exploring the comprehensive utilization of space in the area and in determining urban design control , development methods for public and private lands , development organizations , implementation schedules , and the like in order to promote the comprehensive development of the entire area .  
On the surface , this second plenum is a routine meeting . However , given the rapidly changing domestic and international situation , the changes in ranking personnel in party and government , and the approaching challenge of the year-end elections , as well as the sudden bursting forth of the democracy movement in mainland China , the convening of the plenum has its timeliness and significance . "  
Besides military work , the large capital investment and cultivation of talent can provide enormous resources for the future development of a complete air industry and for raising the level of domestic industry in general .  
Big stock players , wealthy businessmen , and the owners of construction firms - - the " highrisk groups " that are prime targets for criminal attacks - - have become apprehensive and fearful , hiring security teams to protect their homes and bodyguards when they go out and even giving up their imported limos for inconspicuous domestic sedans .  
Looking at it from the point of view of the domestic and external economic situations , the outlook is not very rosy . Because just now the world economy is performing poorly , market expansion is extremely tough . At the same time there is inflationary pressure in Taiwan , so that the government can not devalue the NT dollar to enhance export competitiveness , nor can it adopt a loose money supply policy to free up capital for enterprises .  
The US stands in sharp contrast to Japan , respecting the individual , pursuing happiness , favoring direct expression . Because of its vast size , attention is focussed on domestic matters , and there is a common lack of understanding of the outside world .  
On the tangible side , we must begin by changing modern domestic architecture . Builders should adopt the spirit of the traditional courtyard house and design residential developments that meet the needs of small families yet reflect the spirit of the extended family home .  
Currently , the editors at Sinorama have set their three main directions as " the domestic pulse , " " traditional culture , " and " overseas reports , " in order to serve as a link for the aspirations of Chinese home and abroad and to truly become a comprehensive and international publication which " has its footing in Taiwan , is concerned about the mainland , and has its eyes open to the world . "  
" In the past . everybody assumed that all a high-tech company needed was technology to be successful . Later it was discovered that management skills are also required , " points out Hong . According to their studies of domestic and foreign experiences , the cause of failure of many companies is by no means that the product is poor , but that management is unsatisfactory .  
The Taiwan Straits may seem calm , but there is an unseen and turbulent undercurrent . The naval vessels that cruise these rough waters are in the front line in more than one sense . Externally , they face mainland forces that are ten times numerically superior to our own , and the threat from nearly one hundred submarines , as well as the worsening problems of smuggling and illegal entry . On the domestic front the navy is going through a transition period , with aging vessels being decommissioned and manpower reduced .  
It is as though our image of a Korea with high foreign debts , political turmoil and wife-beating machismo has not changed for over ten years , " says Jing Ker-yi , Korea expert at the Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research . " At present Korea has incredibly overtaken us in a number of industries . This includes their high-profile automobiles and domestic appliances . It 's not very easy for people to realize , but they have made startling achievements in petrochemicals , steel , upper and mid-stream primary products and components .  
According to Council for Economic Planning and Development member Wu Chia-hsing , the main reason for Korea going into the red has been fulfilment of the government 's election pledges . With the construction of two million houses in the public sector domestic demand has diverted glass , concrete and steel from exports and even led to their being imported from overseas .  
Chen Er-nan , a planner / designer at Hong Jian Industries , which accounts for half of the domestic market in man-made polyesters , says that natural silk is colder to the touch , that it is more rough and textured when rubbed , and that real silk lets air pass through , making it more comfortable to wear . Fake silk is warmer , and tends to be more smooth and shiny .  
We discovered that with the prosperity of the domestic economy , the music population has grown quickly , " states Cheng . These romantic little pieces at the juncture of classical and pop are just right for winning those consumers who have a bit of musical cultivation , but have n't the patience to listen to extended , serious classical pieces .  
" The system of agents has long been in place abroad , and is the long-term trend , " explains Luc Kwanten . For people overseas who have the publishing rights , dealing with a single agent saves a great deal of trouble over negotiating with individual publishers whose operating situations are unclear . For the domestic publishing industry , going through an agency saves even more in expenses than setting up your own publishing rights department or hiring specially trained negotiators . "  
Complementary factors home and abroad : Although the scale and professionalism of overseas markets are key factors in enticing animators to go abroad to develop , if you look carefully at this trend , the larger domestic and external environments are also complementary . "  
Of course , given the current technological level of domestic manufacturing , it is still difficult to undertake joint R &amp; D or sales exchanges with major American or European corporations . In order to transfer some of the more advanced technologies , it is necessary that they first be digested by ITRI before they can be given over to local operations .  
On the other hand , our word " alliances , " although it is very trendy , has from start to finish remained an ideal on the level of discussion only , whereas Japan 's arbitration councils are formal organizations which can be flexibly divided and united as needs dictate . Moreover , cases of successful American strategic alliances that have divided and united as they need , have mostly been between medium - and large-scale enterprises and are thus not suitable models for our domestic medium - and small-scale businesses .  
The domestic environmental protection industry still is quite a bit behind international standards , and the gap is unbridgeable in incinerator beds and in prevention of air pollution from emissions . Thus this set of domestic bidding restrictions includes a proviso : The domestic firm that wins the bid must cooperate with an original manufacturer from the United States or Europe to import the technology and undertake joint responsibility for the projects .  
In 1982 , domestic production had fallen to unacceptably low levels and the government had to change its economic strategy to one of developing agriculture and light industry , while emphasizing exporting for foreign exchange . Individual entrepreneurs were allowed to organize factories along the lines of cooperative production , and some family-style small businesses were also freed from restrictions , providing the Chinese with a lifeline .  
Cheng Shu-min , manager of program planning at Chinese Television System , also says that when you look at examples from overseas , audiences tend to identify with their native culture and we have yet to see terrestrial television stations closing down due to competition from satellite . Yet the rise of new electronic media technology has still made the networks aware of a change in the domestic market , a change which has seen a breaking up of the tripartite world of the three television channels and a movement towards audience fragmentation . "  
As well as this , in recent years Taiwan 's financial strength has grown and the New Taiwan Dollar has appreciated significantly . This has led the ITRI to begin introducing technology from abroad , becoming a technological bridge between foreign high technology and domestic businesses and shortening the length of time spent on research and development .  
Among the 34 special government projects commissioned last year , a total of 274 domestic and foreign patents have been won . That is on average a patent coming out every 1.3 days .  
Professor Hsia Liang-chou of the Pingtung Polytechnic Institute , who has studied animal welfare in depth , explains that animal welfare is concerned not only for wild animals ; the hope is that people will understand that it is not true that any animal " can be used for medical experiments in laboratories , so it 's all right to butcher them any way one pleases ; " and that one should also consider the feelings , moods , and physical responses of the domestic fowl and animals which supply human beings with rich protein .  
As Legislator Cheng Chien-jen observes , " the fates of the overseas Chinese and the Republic of China have been closely linked since the Revolution , through the founding of the Republic , the Northern Expedition , the War of Resistance against Japan and the ' Period of Mobilization for Suppressing the Communist Rebellion , ' right up to the present day . " But changing times and the rapid evolution in the domestic and international environment have brought a qualitative and quantitative change in the relationship between Chinese people and their motherland .  
As far back as the time of the prehistoric matriarchal society , the primitive people living in the Yellow River valley had begun to keep dogs . Dogs were the first domestic animals to be reared by humans , and were not only intimately involved in people 's daily lives on a prac tical level , but were also an indispensable part of life on the spiritual plane .  
Chung Chin explains that she used data for 1991 because it made calculations relatively simple . In 1991 the PRC was strongly encouraging foreign firms to go all out to export goods and earn foreign exchange , and Taiwan firms were given little access to the domestic market . Therefore using total Taiwanese investment in the economic formula to calculate the contribution made to mainland Chinese exports would give a close approximation to the actual figure .  
Taiwan firms are now defined as " special domestic investors " by the PRC , and they enjoy somewhat greater privileges and incentives than foreign firms . However , as the mainland makes the transition to a less protected market , it may be hard for Taiwan firms to hold on to the advantages that come with being one of the " local boys . " In the future they will have to compete with non-Chinese companies from the same starting point .  
Meanwhile , China 's painters , living amidst domestic turmoil and foreign invasion , felt the pressure of disappearing traditions . Forced to absorb the creative techniques and methods of the West , China 's painters devoted their efforts to the reform of traditional painting , seeking an East-West fusion of technique . The content of their paintings abounded in themes of ethnic consciousness . Western painting thus followed completely different courses of development in China and Taiwan .  
Within these 20 years , there have been fundamental changes in the international and domestic situations . For example , the Soviet Union has collapsed and the Cold War is over . Within Taiwan , there has been political liberalization , economic transformagion from developing country to newly industrialized country status , and social pluralization . The authoritarian and rigid education methods of the past can not produce the leaders that society and the country will need in the future .  
They have had nowhere to turn because traditionally " the law ends at the family threshold . " There was a widespread social taboo on even discussing the issue . But after the case broke of a woman , Teng Ju-wen , who murdered her abusive husband , women 's groups went into action and began researching legislation designed to reduce domestic violence . Yet success has not always come easy , and there have been many setbacks .  
And it was n't until very recently , when the problem of strays became very serious , that environmental agencies began strengthening their dog catching functions . With domestic dog lovers raising angry cries , conservation groups here are saying that dog-catching as it is now practiced is cruel , and they have invited foreign animal protection groups to teach sanitation personnel " how to catch dogs humanely . "  
A food supply is the most basic of human needs , and farm produce is the last bastion of protectionism in the ROC ; it is also the segment most prone to sensitive price fluctuations . This situation is not unique to Taiwan , but is common throughout the world . Fortunately , except for agricultural produce , most household items , domestic appliances , cosmetics and so on were thrown open to free competition earlier , and so have already entered an era of more stable prices in line with those in advanced countries worldwide .  
Meanwhile the domestic tenders , which were intended to support the ROC 's own civil engineering sector , also provoked a fierce conflict between the forces of the big established operators and those of new players , and suspicions of collusion or excessive price cutting in their tenders have not been laid to rest to this day .  
After the plan for the offshore shipping center was brought before the public , the PRC government , which up until then had been constantly calling for direct cross-strait shipping to be established , based on the definition of a " domestic shipping line , " reversed its attitude 180 degrees . Since the regulation was passed over one year ago , not even one commercial ship has succeeded in crossing the strait .  
The recovery in exports indicates that the threat of domestic deindustrialization has for the most part abated , and economic restructuring has been effective . The rise of the petrochemical , computer , and electronics industries suggests that Taiwan has already staked out a place for itself in the future world economy . As far as the stock market is concerned , the increase in exports means more capital at home , becoming a powerful force reinvigorating the bourse .  
One senior reporter could not help but tremble when he heard this remark , because it hit home . He has grave doubts about the current domestic situation where " everything is political and the economy is at the service of politics . " In addition the influence of gangsters and big corporations is pervasive , and illegal activities thrive while those who obey the law are overly restricted . The competitive advantage that Taiwan ought to enjoy is sacrificed in the resulting confusion .  
Another reason for the PRC 's low-key attitude is that the current model for direct shipping does not have the " domestic " shipping label which PRC officials regard as ideal , meaning that the flagging issue has not been completely resolved . Further , the PRC 's Taiwan policy-making bodies and its Ministry of Transportation and Communications , which is responsible for handling this issue , are at odds with one another .  
Her main hope now is revise the laws to meet the demands of the times , so that executive agencies can be more efficient . Film is another industry " guided " by the GIO . Though not as complex as the broadcast industry , it has its headaches as well , especially the poor economic returns on domestic films .  
With the opening of the domestic telecommunications market , TransAsia Telecommunications won the right to operate a cellular telephone business in southern Taiwan . The company established its headquarters in Kaohsiung but could n't find a marketing manager . Eventually , the company had to go through a head hunter which found them Sean Hsieh in Taipei . Hsieh had worked as a sales strategist at an advertising firm and as a marketing strategist at a producer of physical education products before he was hired to be TransAsia 's marketing manager .  
Oblivious to the traffic thundering across the Yungfu and Chungcheng bridges , which connect the south side of Taipei City with Taipei County , the ducks forage among the cattails and turn up algae , quite in keeping with their nature . There is none of the jostling and bickering of domestic ducks raised in pens . Against the distant roar of the traffic , the birds ' occasional calls from the sandbars lend a strange serenity to the scene , imparting a sense of harmony and grace rarely seen in this bustling metropolis .  
Judge Tsai decided that while medical service is not a product per se , it is intimately connected to public health and safety . The stated intent of the law she applied is to " protect consumer rights and interests , promote consumer safety , and raise the quality of life for domestic consumers . " On this basis , the judge decided that the law also applied to medical care .  
In the case of travel , people are not satisfied with what domestic trips have to offer and are going abroad , increasing the amount of money Taiwanese spend on overseas travel . In 1996 , 5.71 million Taiwanese traveled abroad spending a total of US $ 8.15 billion , an amount equal to 46% of what Taiwan earned from trade in that year .  
There is little realism in Chinese lion statuary . Apart from anthropomorphic facial expressions , often in the form of a broad , all-too-human grin , stone lions ' poses and movements are often modeled on those of familiar domestic dogs and cats .  
It hopes to raise its political status at a global level and at the Asia-Pacific regional level through the development of a high-technology operational capability . It also aims to increase its capability to deal with domestic and border area instability . Besides these , however , and of more immediate interest to Taiwan , another of the main goals behind mainland China 's new strategy is to maintain a reliable military threat to cope with Taiwan and its so-called " separatist tendencies . "  
Lee could hardly have told us much of anything new in his memoirs , for he had already devoted a tremendous effort during 30 years in office to the task of recounting the events that preceded the founding of the republic . Furthermore , Singapore has been deeply influenced by its long years under British rule . The Singaporean government maintains copious records concerning all its domestic and foreign affairs . Political statements over the years have drawn upon a large body of diplomatic documents , parliamentary reports , private letters , and government proclamations .  
In addition , the domestic cable television market has increased its openness to foreign investment , and foreigners can directly or indirectly own up to 50% of the stock . The central government has also authorized local governments to manage local cable television operations , stipulating that operators grade their programs and sign formal contracts with subscribers to ensure the rights of consumers .  
But most worrying are the fish farms spread all over Taiwan 's coastal regions . In some places , abalone pools have been dug into the marine erosion terraces , while in others illegal and excessive pumping of groundwater for aquaculture , along with extraction for domestic , industrial and agricultural use , has caused serious land subsidence in areas covering almost 1,000 square kilometers .  
Ho Chun-jui continues : " There are other aspects as well , such as smashing ' the virgin complex , ' resisting domestic violence , and gay activism . Everywhere you can see that gender self-awareness does n't have to be taught , that it is flowing through society . A future in which everyone is conscious of gender issues is not only inevitable , it is to be looked forward to . "  
In fact , American China policy has maintained a general direction based on three main national interests : democracy and human rights , economics and trade , and security and military strategy . The periodic swinging results from a tug of war between two groups of US domestic forces , one more accomodating toward Beijing such as the mainstream China scholars , the other more critical , such as the media . Nevertheless , Taipei seeks simultaneous improvement of relations with both Washington and Beijing .  
Thanks to this explanation and analysis , readers can understand everything from the works of Shakespeare to the lives of Taiwan 's aborigines , from the views of the Dalai Lama , to those of the overseas Chinese singing star Lee-hom Wang . There is international news and also domestic news . Some of it 's serious , and some of it 's trendy . These English-instruction magazines attest to the fact that Taiwanese appetites for information are getting larger and increasingly varied !  
Minister without portfolio Yang Shih-chien , who handles domestic technology policy , explains : " Innovation is everything in high-technology . A brilliant , ground-breaking idea can open up a whole new field of industry . But innovation requires huge quantities of financial and human resources dedicated to R &amp; D , with laboratories pursuing technological breakthroughs around the clock , and with professional investment managers able to turn innovative ideas into products and profits . "  
The domestic financial crisis which afflicted Taiwan from the middle of last year until early this year , exposed several legally dubious forms of high-risk transaction , including excess loans , and high rates of stock collateral for company directors . Recently , the former president of the Control Yuan , Wang Tso-yung , publicly labeled the Taiwan stockmarket a " cannibal market . " The challenges of a financial economy have clearly only just begun to emerge , and economic policy will probably now confront more difficulties and resistance than ever .  
Increasingly complex parent-child rela-tions , a rising divorce rate , and seemingly insoluble marital problems are causing people to feel more and more that " the family is sick . " That 's bad enough , but the succession of child abuse , domestic violence , incest , and other cases which have been appearing in the news one after another are causing people to fear that " the family may be harmful ! "  
After returning to Taiwan , Chen worked diligently to bring the theory and methods she learned into this country . Working with a social service agency , she handled individual cases of domestic violence . She has come away feeling somewhat powerless and disappointed .  
I think that Lee Teng-hui has shown in this book that he has lived up to this ideal . In its ideological consistency , in its lucidity of thought , With the People Always in My Heart is a world-class piece of literature . As a politician responsible for protecting domestic industry , preserving the welfare of a nation 's citizens , and maintaining international economic and trade relations , Lee has had an extremely busy career , yet he is still able to conduct himself with dignity and aplomb .  
In the center of one of the exhibition rooms , the NPM has laid out a realistic picture of the life of the literati , based on a portrayal in an anonymous Song painting . The main character sits alone in front of a painted screen depicting wild and domestic fowl . To one side , a servant pours tea from a white porcelain pot ; on a table are two or three dishes of fruit and snacks . In front of the scholar stands a basket of classically arranged flowers .  
In Wang 's view , before Lee Teng-hui took over , the KMT was preoccupied with both the external threat and the many demands of domestic reconstruction , and while it held back the reins of power from local Taiwanese and was slow about democratization , it none the less managed , through caution and deliberation , to secure Taiwan 's existence and develop the economy . Therefore , says Wang , " it deserved 80 out of 100 for its performance in government . "  
A : Of all the wealthy and powerful countries in the world today , there is not one that does not employ overseas investment to maximize the efficiency of factors of production and to develop overseas markets . In so doing , they achieve the dual goals of improving the domestic industrial structure and raising their international economic position .  
The main points include : mutual respect and mutual love , positive use of language and prohibition of domestic violence , equal contributions to the family by the husband and wife , prohibition of seeing the children as instruments for the realization of the parents ' own ambitions , acceptance of the monogamous marriage system , cultivation of concern and caring in the course of ordinary married life , filial respect for one 's own parents and for the parents of the partner , and cultivation of artistic interests outside of one 's profession .  
Chen Ai-ni , an expert on gender and marriage , says that emphasizing human rights in marriage is not meant to put one 's spouse " on warning " or to make divorce more fair . Rather it is to preserve marriage and secure the foundations of happiness between husband and wife . Chen believes that it can effectively deter physical and psychological domestic violence , which would be the first step in " happiness engineering . "  
While the advantages of the PRC are undeniably clear-the market is huge , labor costs are low , and firms can easily move into both the domestic and international markets-this swarming of Taiwanese investors , each seemingly determined to outdo the ones before in size , has generated its own ill-effects which are now gradually coming to the surface .  
Since the beginning of this year the government has held a series of national conferences on economic development , administrative reform , industrial development , and science and technology . It has also adopted a dizzying array of measures designed to stimulate the economy , including plans to spur domestic demand , bolster the property market , create job opportunities , and promote mergers between financial institutions .  
The PRC is reported to be the main cause of the diplomatic rupture . Macedonia has been beset in recent years by both internal and external threats . Fighting connected with the separatist movement in neighboring Kosovo has generated a mass exodus of refugees into Macedonia , while the Macedonian government has been unable to quell a domestic rebellion by ethnic Albanians .  
The rapid expansion of China 's economy over the last few years has been a powerful lure to Taiwanese industry , and local businesses have flocked to China . This situation is widely held to be responsible for the problems of capital flight , sluggish domestic investment , the hollowing out of Taiwan 's manufacturing base and rising unemployment .  
In the domestic market , most goods can already be imported freely , although the automotive sector is still protected by regional import quotas and will be affected by the opening of Taiwan 's market to vehicles from the US , Japan and Korea . Other local industries that will need to improve their competitiveness in response to WTO entry are electrical appliances , heavy electrical engineering , papermaking and foodstuffs .  
Joining the WTO may be an inevitable trend , but at a time when all countries are eager to conquer new territories overseas and put up a protective umbrella for their weaker domestic industries , perhaps Taiwan too should be giving more balanced attention to the future of different sectors of society .  
The author makes the optimistic as well as bold prediction that good management of Internet cafes can bring about unprecedented social and economic benefit in areas ranging from improving parent-children relations to stimulating the domestic software industry , and expanding the Internet infrastructure .  
It is a pity that , although Taiwan has attained democracy , it has yet to rationalize its public sector . Instead it is increasingly a " street vendor " culture , with fractious grassroots movements here and there , or just plain vulgar . This points to the necessity of us following the path of advanced nations and upgrading our domestic services . Taiwan must create a quality environment in which people want to live .  
Ku enthusiastically consults with people from all areas , and has done his utmost to assist domestic research in fields related to welding . Ku also contributes by " resuscitating " expensive machinery damaged by human errors or natural disasters , thus helping industry and educational institutions reduce the massive financial losses that can result from such events . While his work has guaranteed that machinery works , he has helped even more people by passing the torch of his knowledge on to his students .  
It 's just that in comparison with the enormously powerful TNCs , domestic companies are still the runts of the litter , and only venture into relatively mature directions in their R &amp; D . Because it is impossible to alter this " hand-me-down-ism " in the short run , it is in Taiwan 's interest that foreign R &amp; D pace-setters are here , because future international industrial trends will be clearer , and local R &amp; D centers can avoid unnecessary detours .  
Regrettably , even as the country was getting tough on domestic quarantine , in mid-May a doctor from Mackay Memorial Hospital caused an international incident when he showed SARS symptoms while in Japan . Assuming that he only had the flu , he took some cold medicine and finished his travel itinerary , only later discovering that one of the patients he treated in hospital later died as a probable SARS victim .  
In any case , the domestic tourist economy is rapidly gaining ground after its precipitous fall and entrepreneurs feel like they have jumped from the cold pool at a hot springs straight into the hot pool , going from one extreme to the other . Aside from SARS receding into the background and the approach of the summer holiday season , a new-found unity among tourism entrepreneurs has been a key element in the rapid resurgence of the industry .  
Eight of the ten largest tourist agencies in Japan manage domestic tourism and depend solely on this market . Japan has managed the tourism industry with amazing skill . This is especially true for the hot springs areas popular with the silver-haired generation , where nature is combined with human artifice , places that can truly be described as " products of culture , " like the famous Hakone and Izu hot springs areas .  
Originally established 45 years ago as a tourism-development taskforce , these days the TAT operates 17 overseas offices and has an annual budget of THB3 to 3.5 billion . Thailand 's numbers of both domestic and foreign tourists have been growing steadily for years , and we expect the number of visitors to top the 10-million mark next year .  
A survey conducted in Kaohsiung County showed a clear rising trend in the number of domestic violence cases reported by foreign brides . Before 1998 the number of such reports was in the single digits . After 1998 there was a yearly increase such that by the end of April , 2001 , there was a monthly average of seven reports .  
" These women and children have no support at all from friends or the bride 's family . When they run into problems they are lost , " says Sister Therese Tang , executive director of the Good Shepherd Sisters Social Welfare Services Foundation . The language barrier often means they have no clue about how to seek help , to the point where they even accept violence as a natural part of their daily life , as their unalterable fate . This is the reason foreign brides suffer a high level of domestic violence .  
Take for example the laws on domestic violence . Every locality has established a commission and a center for prevention of domestic violence , but these typically lack adequate staffing . For example , there are only two social workers assigned to handling domestic violence cases for all the married women in Hsinchu County , so you can guess what the quality of services there is like .  
Having tried all kinds of domestic and foreign railway lunches , Taiwan Railway Culture Association administrative director Hsieh Ming-hsun says that of all the foreign railway lunches available , he considers Japan 's to be the best . They 're also often tied in with the special features of the local area-for example , seaside stations offer seafood lunches . Also , the lunch boxes come in all sorts of different designs , from cane baskets to ceramic boxes . When he visited Japan , he brought back several extraordinary lunch boxes as souvenirs .  
Aside from the massive popularity of the Nostalgia Lunches , domestic convenience store chains are also paying attention to this virgin market . Starting a couple of years ago , one after another they started offering different kinds of local packed lunches , starting a " biandang war , " - one would offer theirs for NT $ 40 , so a competitor would drop theirs to NT39 , all promoting their lower prices .  
He says that at present , unclear policies and sporadic services result in serious problems such foreign wives failing to adjust well to their surroundings , domestic violence , children doing poorly in school , and bogus marriages that are actually a cover for prostitution . According to Lin , the government urgently needs to address the growing social problems and costs arising from transnational marriages .  
If the curse of the hardy , abundant , and inexpensive tilapia in the domestic market is its " poor man 's fish " image , the greatest obstacle to foreign sales is the intractable problem of drug residues . This is especially true for the EU market , with its stricter testing standards .  
The first example is the Procomp case , involving intricate and complicated capital flows . After two weeks of investigation , preliminary findings have been made public . In addition , four accountants who had contracts to audit Procomp were severely punished with a two-year suspension of business . Because the accountants were from two major domestic accounting firms , this action was a serious warning for the accounting industry and embodied the hope that the age-old abuses of purposeful undervaluation , placing too much trust in the client and not pro-actively verifying accounts could be rooted out .  
Then the Hsinchu Science-Based Industrial Park came along some years later , attracting domestic and overseas tenants with its autonomous management , customs-bonded operations , and " deep processing " ( i.e . processing that yields a significant level of value-added content ) . This was the key to Taiwan 's successful transition to a new type of industry .  
Hsu tells an anecdote : more than ten years ago , local inventor Huang Ying-chun devised an air-cushioned shoe . Unfortunately , due to the fact that at the time accessing relevant information was problematic , he did not scrutinize foreign patents and applied only for a domestic patent , with the result that this patent was later challenged and overturned by Nike .

The Commission also regards the achievement of a safe and healthy environment , through strong and effective international and domestic environmental protection efforts , as an essential component of sustainable development .  
During the 1980s , most developing countries faced mounting domestic and external financial imbalances that resulted in unsustainable fiscal deficits and reduced public and private financial flows .

The goal of such projects is to strengthen the capacity of such organizations to fulfil their legitimate and important role in generating a vigilant , continuous , informed and effective domestic demand for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Instead of coordinating their macroeconomic policies , however , the industrialized countries had sought to resolve their domestic problems in a purely national or restricted multilateral context .  
The total stock of external debt in the least developed countries represented nearly three quarters of their combined gross domestic product .

It was noted that the Moroccan Constitution established the equality of all citizens before the law and the rights of foreigners in Morocco , that Morocco had recently set up an advisory council for human rights composed of representatives of all parties concerned , and that bilateral and multilateral conventions ratified in the manner prescribed by the Constitution were incorporated in domestic law and their provisions could be invoked before Moroccan courts .  
This is why we hope that the United Nations , through the recently established United Nations Mission in Guatemala ( MINUGUA ) , will continue to contribute , directly or indirectly , to securing a prompt conclusion to negotiations aimed at bringing a speedy and definitive end to the domestic armed conflict that has plagued Guatemala during more than 30 years of struggle which is as tragic as it is pointless .  
With regard to the exhaustion of domestic remedies , it is stated that the alleged victims made reference to the alleged tortures when they were brought before Judge I . M . C . It is reported that once J . E . removed his shoe in front of the judge in order to show the black points left by the instruments utilized when administering electric shocks . 
Article 22 , paragraph 5 ( b ) , of the Convention precludes the Committee from considering any communication from an individual , unless it has ascertained that the individual has exhausted all available domestic remedies ; this rule does not apply if it is established that the application of domestic remedies has been or would be unreasonable prolonged or would be unlikely to bring effective relief .  
The opposition to a strong and dynamic United Nations is political and profoundly ideological , and is largely concentrated in a few States whose establishments prefer not to strengthen a forum in which their domestic and global policies can be challenged or trimmed .  But the United Nations exists for all humankind , not just a handful of Member States representing a small minority of the world 's population . . . .  
In our domestic policy we have had two main priorities : to develop and consolidate the legal and institutional framework of a State of law and the smooth functioning of institutions appropriate to a modern democratic society on the one hand , and , on the other , to ensure economic restructuring and the transition to a market economy .  
The Islamic Republic of Mauritania which , since 1984 , has been engaged in a determined battle that aims at restructuring the Mauritanian economy despite difficult domestic , regional and international conditions , has made tangible progress towards restoring the macroeconomic balance and reducing its foreign debt , a fact that is attested to by international financial institutions . 
While we seek to put in place all the necessary measures to ensure the efficient and effective management of our domestic affairs , we strongly urge multilateral institutions to include in these models for development a component that provides skills training and , in particular , training in the use of technologies to enable young people to find productive employment in the private sector and to facilitate the process towards equitable social and economic development .  
Any discriminatory trading practice , any imposition of unilateral economic measures or extraterritorial application of domestic laws hampers this process and is unacceptable and incompatible with the standards of international law and the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations .  
The United Nations agencies involved in the entire range of processes covered under this omnibus goal should ensure that their activities are carried out in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations , in particular the sovereign equality and political independence of States , territorial integrity , and non-intervention in matters that are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State .  
Ghana has reduced the direct intervention of the Government in the economy and increased reliance on the market by decontrolling interest rates as a means of raising the rates on savings deposits and loans , reducing subsidies aimed at the promotion of specific sectors or enterprises , privatizing banks and reducing restrictions on financial activities , developing the domestic capital market and easing restrictions on foreign investments in the domestic banking system and capital market .  
The economic importance of this illicit trafficking , which continues at an increasing pace , is reflected in the following data : in 1993 tobacco smuggling represented , in conservative terms , nearly 20 per cent of the colony 's gross domestic product , and in 1995 the value of drugs brought into Spain from Gibraltar without being seized exceeded 200-billion pesetas , which is equivalent to $ 1.6-billion .  
Such regional cooperative mechanisms could be facilitated through public / private partnerships and provide support to Governments , industry , non-governmental educational institutions and other domestic and international organizations , and by strengthening global professional networks ;  
The programme covered areas where the secretariat had established operational capacities and addressed such specific areas as export diversification and trade development , customs and trade facilitation , trade statistics , debt management , external financial flows and investments , domestic financial markets , insurance and transport , as well as the regulatory framework affecting those areas and the business environment in general .  
Emphasis should be placed on improving basic data in those series necessary for compiling the major aggregates of the 1993 SNA for the total economy , including estimates of value added by kind of activity and final expenditures on gross domestic product ( GDP ) at current and constant prices ; gross national income ; gross disposable income ; savings ; and net lending .

In chapter 2 and elsewhere in Agenda 21 , it was also agreed that sustainable development would require domestic reforms and international assistance in such areas as economic development , improved market access and commodity prices , environmental management , technology transfer , financing ( debt relief , foreign investment , official development assistance ) and institutional capacity-building .  
Our efforts have helped develop a text that , in its final version , makes no mention of Chapter VII of the Charter , addresses requests to States that are not binding in nature and specifies that any detentions will be effected in accordance with their national law which , in our view , means that only those States that have domestic legislation enabling them to act along the requested lines will be able to do so , as the resolution can not serve by itself alone as a legal basis for arresting anyone . 
With regard to the possibility that special laws or exclusive jurisdictions could be invoked to uphold impunity in respect of human rights violations , a careful study has begun of Guatemalan domestic legislation , with special reference to the military criminal justice system and the identification of cases in which the functioning of this special system could promote impunity .  
The reasons for this vary and include a lack of political commitment ; an unresponsive legal system ; attitudinal obstacles to the incorporation of international standards when these are believed to be in conflict with religious , cultural or customary practices ; the absence of effective domestic groups that can lobby for change effectively and without fear of intimidation ; and an absence of effective enforcement mechanisms even where legislation exists .  
According to the World Industry Council for the Environment ( WICE ) , 39 / inbound foreign capital only accounts for some 3-4 per cent of total domestic capital formation in developing countries , the vast majority coming from domestic savings .  
In 1993 , the total stock of external debt ( measured at current prices and exchange rates ) rose by 5 per cent - much less than gross domestic product ( GDP ) - to $ 1,630-billion , with much of this attributable to growth of debt stocks in Asia as well as to valuation effects .  
Use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external financial resources , through various innovative schemes ( such as co-financing and joint ventures , underwriting of country risks , and venture capital funds ) in order to mobilize more efficiently new financial flows for sustainable development from all potential sources .  
The Working Group recognized that joint studies on some form of international cooperation , keeping in mind the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities , could help overcome concerns about international competitiveness as a result of unilateral implementation of domestic policy reforms aimed at promoting sustainable development .  
Among such new approaches are the use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external financial resources , including foreign direct investment ; improved coordination and cooperation among national institutions in recipient and donor countries , on the basis of national sustainable development strategies ; partnership arrangements ; and networking between scientific institutes active in the field of sustainable development in various countries and regions .  
OECD has developed a typology for examining the use of trade measures for environmental purposes , based on their linkage to national and international environmental law , including multilateral environmental agreements ; and the geographical scope of the environmental problem ( domestic , transboundary , global ) .  
The Constitution of El Salvador , amended pursuant to the peace agreements , gives the President of the Republic the power to use the armed forces for the maintenance of domestic peace , tranquillity , order and public safety " in exceptional cases , where the normal means [ for that purpose ] have been exhausted " .  
It should be noted that although this measure is , in theory , based on the Constitution , the spirit of the peace agreements requires that it be subject to legal rules which establish expressly and restrictively the requirements and conditions which must be met before domestic peace , tranquillity , order or public safety can be considered to be endangered , in exceptional cases , and before the normal means for their preservation can be considered to have been exhausted .  
Industrialization , which was essential for diversifying the production base and generating employment opportunities , especially for a rapidly growing urban population , required adopting measures to create an environment conducive to private investment , both domestic and foreign ;  
Apart from the moderating effect of the unsynchronized pattern of the recession in the major industrial countries , the region 's ability to withstand the adverse impact of the recession can be attributed to the growing strength of domestic markets , intraregional trade and investment links , and the competitiveness of exports from the region , which are now well diversified into a variety of manufactures . 
The momentum of policy reforms that place a strong emphasis on deregulation , liberalization and outward orientation will be maintained or accelerated throughout the region , providing a congenial environment for a sustained increase in domestic saving and investment . 
The structural reforms undertaken in the banking sector centred on privatizing State-owned banks , reducing barriers to entry for both domestic and foreign private banks , liberalizing the types of activities that banks could undertake and , concomitantly , improving the prudential regulation of financial institutions .  
However , the principle that harm which does not entail economic loss should be compensated is not a new absolute in law , as can be seen in the universal acceptance , in domestic and international law , of compensation for moral injury , which is as difficult to evaluate in monetary terms as ecological harm .  
The use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external financial resources , through various innovative schemes ( such as co-financing and joint ventures , underwriting country risks , and venture capital funds ) in order to more efficiently mobilize new financial flows for sustainable development from all potential sources .  
The resources requested under this heading would provide for the replacement of damaged and defective piping and valves throughout the complex ; replacement of bathroom fixtures as required , of domestic hot-water coils , plumbing gratings and traps ; replacement of heating and cooling coils ; and the repair and maintenance of conveyors in the Secretariat Building , electric / pneumatic doors , dumb waiters , overhead roll-up doors , river-water intake equipment and sump pits ;  
The main reasons included a shortage of resources , both domestic and external , the lack of an appropriate macroeconomic framework in several countries and , in some cases , various crises - political and / or natural - that interrupted economic activity .  
In the context of the new demands on operational activities , the capacity for policy connections between the different strands of political , economic , social and environmental factors has become important .  The United Nations system 's effort at capacity-building is now undertaken mainly by individual organizations in relation to their respective mandates and focused primarily on their domestic counterparts .  
Its main functions include : ( a ) processing the dissemination of human rights as an effective means of guaranteeing their observance and consolidating the democratic system , ( b ) cooperating with relevant institutions to promote the teaching of human rights at the primary , secondary and university levels and in non-formal education and ( c ) promoting the alignment of domestic legislation with international agreements and treaties on human rights .  
In the first year of the Tribunal 's existence , the President of the Tribunal drew the attention of the Secretary-General to the necessity for Member States not only to designate , in their domestic legal systems , a body responsible for dealing with any request from the Tribunal , but also to adopt the legislative or regulatory provisions required to give effect to the Tribunal 's statute .  
Undertakes studies on the level of national savings , development of stable and transparent domestic financial resources , monetary systems , foreign capital flows and the financial aspects of social policies ;  
There have also been infamous cases in which State intelligence authorities or security forces , opposition groups , armed domestic resistance movements or criminal organizations hire mercenaries to engage in illegal actions such as forming paramilitary forces for purposes of repression , organizing death squads or providing military protection for illicit drug trafficking , smuggling or arms trafficking .

The United Nations system 's effort at capacity-building is now undertaken mainly by individual organizations in relation to their respective mandates and focused primarily on their domestic counterparts .  
It aims at training senior managers of Chinese military enterprises for conversion to production of civilian goods for the domestic and world markets , and facilitating joint ventures by bringing together major domestic and international investors from the private sector in the most attractive and committed Chinese enterprises .  
For most developing economies in Asia , success in maintaining their growth rates lies in continuing their high levels of domestic savings , in broadly based human capital development , in improving the competitiveness of domestic markets , in their openness to foreign capital and technology , and in improved macroeconomic management .  
However , in an increasing number of developing countries , with the accumulation of physical and human capital , technology and management know-how , the domestic base for more sophisticated services is being developed . 
In this context , special emphasis should be placed on ensuring that international financial institutions make the most effective use of existing financing facilities and establish additional ones , attracting capital investments in conditions of respect for the domestic legislation of each country and using efficient energy technologies mainly to support the execution of the projects that are necessary for our region in this sector .  
They range from alleged threats to the national security of the sender State and the alleged violation of agreed international norms and instruments by the target State , to expressions of dislike for specific domestic or foreign policies of the target State or more generally for the political and socio-economic system of the target State .  
Other obstacles to the development of businesses owned by women include an adverse economic and regulatory environment , inadequate physical infrastructure and marketing , poor access to new technology , and a lack of vocational and managerial training .  Rigid social and cultural norms and lack of sharing of domestic responsibilities exacerbate the problems women face when operating businesses .  
Thus , contemporary United States domestic law on federal , state and local levels provides strong protections against racial discrimination in all fields of public endeavour and in many areas of private life .  
Securing the potential benefits of globalization by enhancing competitiveness through promoting price stability ( low inflation ) ; avoiding artificial distortions to the prices of domestic resources ( land , labour , capital ) ; reducing trade taxes and import duties , which adversely affect export competitiveness ; and removing implicit and explicit barriers to foreign direct investment ;

The first question raises macroeconomic issues concerning domestic saving and the net transfer of foreign saving to developing countries ; the second question raises microeconomic issues concerning the role of government and the financial sector in intermediating between savers and investors .  
The net transfer of resources - the difference between gross domestic investment and gross domestic saving - has not been more than plus or minus 1 per cent of the GDP of the developing countries since 1980 , a year of unusually high oil prices when oil exporters placed substantial surplus resources in other countries . 
NULLWhatever the level of domestic savings and however large or small the net transfer of foreign savings , there is legitimate concern to ensure that those savings are allocated to investment in developing countries in a manner that is efficient and desirable in the social , political and developmental senses .  
NULLFor most of the post-war era , it has been taken for granted that the domestic savings of developing countries need to be supplemented with foreign savings to boost investment adequately and that it is not practical to expect private international financing to do the job : some projects that are developmentally important are just not bankable or practical areas for direct foreign investment .  
Successful countries have been those that have been capable of attracting a high level of external capital inflows while , through active macroeconomic policies , avoiding the over-heating of domestic demand , excessive exchange rate appreciation and volatile interest rates .  
NULLThe Working Group also concluded that foreign direct investment was attracted most strongly to those countries that had adopted measures to strengthen their domestic technological capability and created an overall policy framework conducive to innovation , investment in infrastructure , intellectual property protection , human capital formation and a stable macroeconomic and regulatory environment .  
In most developing countries , the process of technological capability-building might be hampered by , inter alia , declining rates of investment , misallocation of resources , external imbalances , lack of diverse and sophisticated skills , weak linkages between domestic research and development institutes and enterprises as well as unfavourable external factors .  
While historic factors such as the low level of African incomes and inadequate domestic technical expertise and capacity explain a part of this situation , it is also the general perception that inappropriate macroeconomic policies , combined with an antiquated and ineffective legal , regulatory and prudential framework , have been the main impediments .  
Uganda intended to continue to work with its bilateral and multilateral development partners on innovative ways of mobilizing private productive capital and , to that end , had taken a number of domestic administrative and policy measures .  
Even the most rigorous and effective programmes of domestic economic stabilization and structural adjustment would leave those countries with serious obstacles to moving to a sustained and sustainable development path .  
Besides , foreign markets have been lost , the domestic market has contracted , capital and other foreign financial transactions have been interrupted , the economy has been decapitalized and the country is devoid of resources for simple reproduction , let alone for development investment .  
In addition , foreign markets have been lost , the domestic market has contracted , capital and other foreign financial transactions have been interrupted , the economy has been decapitalized and the country is devoid of resources for simple production , let alone for development investment .  
Expressing also its concern that serious external and domestic financial constraints have been experienced by developing countries that have continued to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion ,  
Within the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) , the remote sensing program of the Foreign Agricultural Service ( FAS ) continued to be a critical element in the analysis of domestic and foreign agricultural production , supply , and demand - - providing timely , accurate , and unbiased estimates of global area , yield , and production .  
From the point of view of internal law , the court 's statute should be established on the basis of balanced principles and rules that would ensure the requisite harmonization with domestic substantive norms and penal procedures , in particular those pertaining to detention , imprisonment , transfer of the accused , pre-trial release , trials , evidence and sentencing .  
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
Mindful of the urgent need for African countries to increase and mobilize internal resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development through , inter alia , policies for the promotion of domestic savings , improved and accessible banking facilities and further improvements in traditional practices of capital formation at local levels ,  
Governments bore the primary responsibility for formulating appropriate strategies , policies , programmes and actions to combat poverty ; the effort required sound macroeconomic policies , structural changes and the mobilization of domestic resources , inter alia , through more equitable tax regimes and a reduction in military expenditures .  
that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access ;  
the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access ,  
of the urgent need for African countries to increase and mobilize internal resources for the implementation of the New Agenda through , inter alia , policies for the promotion of domestic savings , improved and accessible banking facilities and further improvements in traditional practices of capital formation at local levels , as well as to continue creating an enabling environment for domestic and foreign investment ,  
Also requests the Secretary-General to include in his report to the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole estimates of the projected resource requirements from all sources , public and private , domestic and international , needed for the full implementation of the New Agenda , the amount expected to be mobilized and proposals to address any resource gaps , taking into account the specific economic and development situations of African countries ;  
In accordance with the fundamental principle that the least developed countries are primarily responsible for formulating and implementing growth and development policies , the Government of Myanmar had introduced far-reaching economic reforms , replacing the centrally planned socialist system with a market-oriented economic system , and a series of follow-up economic measures including reversal of price controls and subsidies , liberalization of domestic and foreign trade , reduction in the general level of taxation and opening up of border trade with neighbouring countries . 
when ratifying a convention , a State declared under the terms of its reservation that it was bound by the instrument only in so far as it was not contrary to domestic legislation , then in real terms it had not accepted any international obligation , and the appearance of its name on the list of signatories was irrelevant .  
In August 1985 , a major shift took place in our economic policy that included , among other measures , a reform and simplification of the taxation system , a drastic reduction in the fiscal deficit , price deregulation , a reordering of the public enterprise sector and a greater openness to private investment , both foreign and domestic .  
It also involves injecting new capital from the private sector , either domestic or foreign , into national public enterprises through an innovative , efficient capitalization and administration plan , in collaboration with strategic private partners .  
Significant political and economic changes are taking place all over the world , characterized by , among other things , a growing concern for democratization and good governance , by the increasing resort to privatization and greater reliance on market forces , by an enhanced awareness of the need to mobilize domestic resources and reduce fiscal deficits , by growing participation of non-governmental and community-based organizations in development processes and by greater recognition of the need to ensure that development is not only sustainable but also environmentally sound .  
Though a service designed for a different society and limited to the specific areas assigned by the colonial administration , Malta 's public service gave its contribution to the development of the new State by providing continuity in certain vital domestic sectors and in the setting up of new services , including that of foreign affairs .  
At the same time , it is necessary to recognize what the Secretary General 's report points out : that the challenges which Governments worldwide face in establishing a framework of public administration and a financial system for sustainable economic development are not just domestic influences , but are also unpredictable external factors .  
After having solved a prolonged domestic conflict by political means , we Salvadorans have many challenges before us which can be summed up in a few words : the achievement of a lasting , stable and modern democracy based on the rule of law that will enable us to achieve social peace and the building of a new El Salvador .  
With regard to the matter of the extraterritoriality of national laws , a most sensitive issue for peoples and Governments the world over , the Rio Group summit meeting expressed its rejection of any attempt to use a country 's domestic legislation to impose unilateral sanctions of an extraterritorial character , as this contravenes the standards governing coexistence between States , disregards the fundamental principle of respect for sovereignty and is a clear violation of international law .  
The special significance of this historic event is that , based on the successes achieved over the last 10 years of renewal , reform and national revival , the Congress decided to lead the country into a new phase of industrialization and modernization , with a view to doubling by the year 2000 the 1990 per-capita gross domestic product and essentially transforming Viet Nam into an industrialized country in the next 20 to 25 years .  
If the developed countries are demanding protection for their sensitive domestic industries , then similar demands by developing countries with respect to their domestic industry should not be viewed as a request that is unreasonable or inconsistent with current international trends .  
At the same time , it was able to ensure political stability , improve security and engineer a rapid economic recovery , as reflected by a strong gross domestic product growth of 7.6 per cent , an inflation rate kept at 3.5 per cent and a stable exchange rate of the national currency throughout 1995 .  
These figures , combined with a liberal investment law and a low gross domestic product of $ 287 per capita , are providing strong incentives for foreign direct investment , in particular now that Cambodia enjoys most-favoured-nation status with the United States , the European Union and other important countries in the world .  
While we are aware that the matter of economic and individual personal development is first and foremost a national responsibility , we are deeply conscious that our limited domestic resources constitute a severe constraint upon us in our quest to fulfil this obligation .  
An institute for social work has been established within the University of Malta to provide for the training of social workers in the preventive , rehabilitative and reintegrative social work connected with the family , youth , the elderly , the disabled , abusers of drugs and alcohol and victims of domestic violence .  
At the domestic level , the national Government , owing to radical economic reforms , has made progress in the far-reaching process of bilateral cooperation with countries committed to the peaceful use of nuclear energy .  
We commend the commitments made at national level to the implementation of relevant recommendations through , inter alia , the effective mobilization and efficient utilization of domestic resources and through increased allocation of resources to the social sector .  
We also fully agree with the idea that pursuing and deepening economic reforms and improving the physical and institutional infrastructure for the purpose of attracting further domestic and foreign direct investment are crucial .  
Until these two challenges in particular are addressed , Africa 's capacity to mobilize resources at the domestic level will continue to be stunted , and its reliance on fickle and declining official development assistance and inflows of external resources will be unavoidable .  
Any discriminatory trade practice , imposition of unilateral economic measures or extraterritorial application of domestic law obstructs that process and is unacceptable and incompatible with the norms of international law and the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter .  
Almost five years ago , on 1 December 1991 , in a national referendum , the people of Ukraine confirmed its sovereign will and determination to build its own independent State with a predictable domestic and foreign policy to integrate our nation into the European family of free democracies .  
Among the critical ones are ensuring the peaceful nature of political reforms ; establishing and consolidating domestic democratic institutions and standards ; restructuring ; and ensuring a social orientation that promotes economic transformation and is consolidated by a system of measures and safeguards to preserve social justice and protect society .  
Furthermore , and still within the same context of prevention , the countries whose institutions and infrastructures have been devastated by long-standing domestic warfare now need increased assistance from the international community to help them rebuild their economies and improve the living conditions of their peoples , because without ongoing economic and social development , internal tensions will always continue to threaten the stability of these countries .  
Secondly , I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to remind the international community that my country is suffering from an inhuman , illegal and unjust economic blockade imposed by the neighbouring States under a pretext involving my country 's domestic policies a question that has already become nugatory .  
While others were progressing , we were stagnating , locked in a cruel domestic struggle that included elements imported from the cold war , which arbitrarily kept in check for 40 years our political , social and economic evolution .  
The Working Group entrusted with this issue should also strive to reach an understanding on the possibility of harmonizing legal norms and existing national administrative procedures in the area of domestic control of weapons and in the import and export of arms , in order to establish a common and effective international arms control system that would make it impossible for arms to be diverted through clandestine or illicit channels .  
Requests improved annual reporting on financial flows , including allocations / expenditures , based on consistent criteria and related to the costed elements of the Programme of Action , including a clear account of levels and trends of funding by source ( bilateral , multilateral ( both core and non-core ) and private funds , domestic allocations and the like ) ;  
Additional financial resources obtained through established means - including increased and dependable official development assistance ( ODA ) , better mobilization of domestic resources and greater foreign direct investment - are called for .  
The favourable risk assessment was based on the generally sound macroeconomic policies and continued economic liberalization pursued by most Governments as well as the high rates of domestic investment and savings .  
As far as expert and technical advisory services are concerned , organizations within the United Nations system participate in the development of domestic or regional satellite communication systems for various purposes such as improving distance education , increasing public awareness in environmental protection and supplementing early warning systems for food security .  
The outlook for natural gas consumption in developing countries is for continued steady growth , given that many of these countries have indigenous gas resources that can be developed or expanded for domestic use , and considering their high electricity demand growth and the economic and environmental benefits of additional gas use ( see figure X ) . 
In view of those difficulties , the Government was developing a policy that combined campaigns to eradicate stereotypes in several areas , ranging from the sharing of domestic responsibilities to the role of the media , with the establishment of affirmative action programmes in the public and private sectors .  
9 One respondent concurred with the proposal for annual instead of quarterly statistical reporting on international trade in narcotic drugs but added that quarterly reconciliation at the domestic level would have to be maintained .  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Recognizes the urgent need for the international community to assist developing countries , in particular the poorest and heavily indebted countries , in mobilizing the resources needed for their development efforts , and also recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries could contribute towards releasing domestic resources and sustaining their development efforts , in particular those for social development ;  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access ,  
While some delegations believed that financial liberalization had led to an increase of speculative capital movements , others saw inadequate economic policies and poor fundamentals as the main culprit , in particular excessive creation of domestic credit , loose fiscal policies and insufficient domestic savings .  
Developing economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investments , and seeking innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for adequate shelter and sustainable human settlements development programmes , while ensuring effective utilization of those resources ;  
Assisting countries , particularly developing countries , in implementing effective and equitable pricing mechanisms for adequate shelter and sustainable human settlements , infrastructure and services in order to induce greater flows of private , domestic and global funds , while ensuring transparent and targeted subsidies for people living in poverty ;  
A limited number of industrialized countries can both meet their domestic needs for scientific and technical information and be active partners in international efforts .  
The United States has set itself up as an international judge , invoking its own fanciful interpretation of the relevant provisions of those international treaties , the articles of which possess , all in equal measure , the same importance and legally binding force for those States which , in the first place , through the act of constitutional ratification , transformed those treaties into sources of their domestic legislation and into international obligations , apart from the ethical aspect of their application at the international level . 
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
The domestic factors include : civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some LDCs and the resulting social and economic burdens , political instability , macroeconomic imbalances , manifested in large fiscal and balance-of-payments deficits , in many cases the unfavourable short-term impact of macroeconomic policy adjustments on specific areas , in particular the most disadvantaged and vulnerable sections of the population , and poor performance of the productive sectors including lack of adequate physical infrastructure .  
Requests improved annual reporting on financial flows including allocations / expenditures based on consistent criteria , relating to the costed elements of the Programme of Action , including a clear account of levels and trends of funding by source ( bilateral , multilateral ( both core and non-core ) , private , domestic allocations , etc . ) ;

Mindful of the urgent need for African countries to increase and mobilize internal resources for the implementation of the New Agenda through , inter alia , policies for the promotion of domestic savings , improved and accessible banking facilities and further improvements in traditional practices of capital formation at local levels , as well as to continue creating an enabling environment for domestic and foreign investment ,  
Also requests the Secretary-General to include in his report to the Ad Hoc Committee estimates of the projected resource requirements from all sources , public and private , domestic and international , needed for the full implementation of the New Agenda , the amount expected to be mobilized and proposals for filling any resource gaps , taking into account the specific economic and development situation of African countries ;  
During the 1980s , improvement efforts of all types in developing countries were disrupted by economic crises , most notably external debt crises and rising debt burdens , depressed commodity prices , slow growth of output and inadequate mobilization of domestic resources .  
During the 1990s , dramatic political and economic shifts had been occurring throughout the world , marked by increasing tendencies towards democratization , greater reliance on market forces , greater emphasis on mobilizing domestic resources and reducing fiscal deficits , increasing privatization , growing participation of non-governmental and community-based organizations in development processes , and heightened recognition of the need to assure environmentally sound and sustainable development .  
In its representation , Latvia pointed to its over-assessment , dating back to 1991 , the current economic situation of the country , with falling real gross domestic product and a recent banking crisis , and severe restrictions on the budget of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , given other pressing humanitarian and social needs .  
When an aerospace object is located in the territorial airspace of another State , it may be subject to international air law as well as to relevant domestic air law by reason of national security or aerial safety as long as it has characteristics both of an aeroplane which is subject to air law and a space object which is subject to space law . 
In that resolution , the Assembly dealt with the matter from a criminological perspective , inviting Member States to adopt specific measures to make the crime prevention and criminal justice system more responsive to domestic violence , for example , by enacting criminal law and procedure and improving the situation and the fair treatment of the female victim .  
The participants in the workshop made the following recommendations , applicable to countries in central and eastern Europe : criminal law and procedure should be reviewed to determine any discriminatory provisions and effects ; consideration should be given to making rape in marriage a criminal offence ; criminal justice practitioners should be sensitized to the dynamics of domestic violence ; the police should be given specific and intensive training in crisis intervention and in the collection of evidence in domestic disputes .  
The Council recognized that it continued to be a widespread international activity frequently involving highly organized international syndicates that trafficked in human cargo without regard to the dangerous and inhumane conditions to which they were subjected , and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards .  
In spite of some encouraging individual examples of the growth of official development assistance ( ODA ) , as well as of some promising approaches towards mobilizing domestic and international resources for sustainable development identified and explored by the Commission through its Ad Hoc Inter-sessional Working Group on Finance , the overall picture in regard to the implementation of all the recommendations and commitments related to finance as contained in Agenda 21 remains an area of concern .  
A number of countries reported that cases against law enforcement officials charged with crimes connected with the infliction , instigation or toleration of any act of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment were heard by regular domestic criminal courts .  
36 Panama reported on legislative amendments to its Penal Code , dealing , inter alia , with the criminalization and penalization of physical or psychological aggression , violence and intimidation , corruption of minors and indecent assault , incest and the commission or knowledge of an act of domestic violence by a public or private official , as well as the failure to inform the proper authorities of such an act .  
The information received suggests that differences in the judicial traditions , systems and practices of the responding States did not prevent an increased number of countries from including in their domestic legislation , substantial and procedural provisions designed to improve the position of victims in civil , criminal and administrative proceedings .  
It also asked Governments and agencies of the United Nations system to promote programmes for guiding management and corrective actions to control pollution in the larger coastal urban settlements , specifically in the treatment of sewage and waste disposal , both domestic and industrial , as well as to control pollution in river systems caused by mining industries .  
Accordingly , most of the countries of the region maintained , and seemed to be consolidating , a pattern of economic performance characterized by moderate growth rates accompanied by moderate and diminishing inflation , large current account deficits covered by external capital , and low domestic savings rates .  
In particular , the net inflow of external financial resources and the greater or lesser uncertainty prevailing in domestic markets as a result of foreign or domestic events were decisive factors in the policies applied in response to the crisis .  
On the one hand , Argentina , Mexico and , to some extent , Uruguay had to manage their economic policies in a climate marked by a sharp contraction of external financing , in which they faced severe slumps in domestic demand , with adverse effects on output and fiscal revenues .  
In contrast to this median situation , at one extreme were countries with fast-growing domestic demand and good access to foreign currency , which expanded both their output and their external purchases , or countries which experienced real appreciation of their currencies . 
In chapter II of its report , the Board places particular emphasis on the sharp and controversial increase in the use of methylphenidate , better known under its trade name Ritalin , in the treatment of attention deficit disorder ; the abuse of synthetic drugs , in particular " ecstasy " and " ice " ; the diversion of psychotropic substances , in particular benzodiazepines , from domestic and international distribution channels ; and the illicit traffic and diversion of acetic anhydride to clandestine drug laboratories .  
Although it is difficult to make precise statements about the contribution of the various components of domestic demand to overall growth ( because of the often large statistical discrepancies in the national accounts ) , it does appear that fixed investment is now playing an increasingly important role in the economic recovery of eastern Europe .  
Barring adverse weather conditions , the progress made in enhancing political and social stability in some countries and the benefits accruing from the impact of domestic economic-policy reforms , coupled with favourable developments in the international economic environment , lead to estimates of regional growth in output of 2.9 per cent in 1996 , as against 2.3 per cent in 1995 .  
Since private capital flows are becoming a major source of financing for developing countries , African countries that seem to be involved in a process of adjusting their financial structures and liberalizing their economies are likely to attract foreign resources , both for portfolio , and more particularly , direct investment .  Creation of domestic capital markets , as complementary measures to the process of economic liberalization and privatization , is essential if the countries need to broaden and improve the savings / investment process .  
But the most important prerequisites for the successful mobilization of foreign and domestic resources are confidence in the financial system and appropriate macroeconomic policies , a well-established and clear legal and regulatory framework , a transparent and non-distortionary taxation system , a stable domestic financial system , and adequate infrastructure .  
Stabilization of prices and exchange rates would ensure positive rates of return on domestic assets , while a more aggressive drive by the formal financial institutions through intensive branch expansion , the broadening of the menu of saving instruments and the forging of strong linkages with the informal financial institutions , would have a positive impact on the volume of resources mobilized .  
In addition , their capacity to take advantage of the expansionary cycles of international and regional trade and to withstand adverse conditions and financial instability must be increased through the diversification of products and markets , the search for foreign investment and partnerships , the use of domestic stabilization mechanisms and better linkages between exports and other productive activities .  
To promote awareness in Africa and in the international community of the nature of the critical economic and social situation in Africa , and of the domestic and international efforts required for recovery and development , through wide dissemination of the periodical African Recovery to the general public and to target groups such as parliamentarians , non-governmental organizations , trade unions and academic institutions , as well as through outreach to the African and international mass media ;  
Strengthened by a five-year mandate , the new Government has moved quickly to address the fundamental problems impeding development , such as weak governmental institutions , economic inefficiency and corruption , and has laid out economic policies which seek to stimulate growth and reduce inflation by encouraging domestic investment and job-creating programmes .  
A significant enhancement and strengthening of international cooperation in the field of human rights leading to increased effectiveness of international machinery , improved respect of human rights at the national level , through , inter alia , universal ratification of basic international human rights treaties and the incorporation of those standards into the domestic legislation of States ;  
Performance generally reflected strong growth in tourism and in offshore financial services , as well as increased domestic investment , with the gross domestic product recorded at US $ 90.2-million .  
Generally , many of the developing economies have carried out sustained domestic policy reforms and have sought to liberalize their trade policies by reducing direct State intervention in foreign trade transactions , removing controls on exports and creating predictable and transparent import policies .  
To prevent physical and sexual abuse , the prospective workers must be thoroughly informed of the dangers inherent in domestic work and should be trained in effective ways of responding to and removing themselves from abusive situations .  
The major features of the strategy are to support private sector farming activities through improved legal , regulatory and institutional frameworks , to enhance the efficiency of traditional and domestic market-oriented agriculture , to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of intensive and export-oriented agriculture and to improve access to regional and international markets .  
While it is the primary responsibility of African States to bear the bulk of their development burden by tapping as a matter of priority their own financial resources , the rigid international economic environment , the domestic economic hardship and the lukewarm disposition of some creditors to adopt radical measures have constituted obstacles to the mobilization of financial resources and to the development of Africa .  
Measures to enhance socio-political stability and good governance and to secure sound macroeconomic policies that will be conducive to private foreign and domestic investment should be strongly encouraged .  
With regard to the external debt , it is also relevant to point out the Declaration of the Support Group for Nicaragua of 16 April 1996 , which considers that , within the framework of a sound and responsible macroeconomic policy that encourages domestic savings , resources released as a result of a comprehensive approach to the debt problem should be used to support productive and social development .  Alleviation of the external debt burden would thus help to eliminate widespread poverty among the Nicaraguan population .  
In developing countries , however , the current flows of private investment are highly concentrated among a few countries with export potential while serious shortages of funds are experienced in countries where forestry is oriented towards domestic markets .  
NFP links together strategic and operational planning and it is specifically designed to increase effectiveness and efficiency in sustainable forestry development at the country level , potentially leading to increased commitments by potential sources of both domestic and external funds .  
The defence motion was based on three arguments : the alleged unlawful establishment of the Tribunal ; alleged unjustified primacy over competent domestic courts ; and an alleged lack of subject matter jurisdiction under articles 2 , 3 and 5 of the statute .  
On the other hand , indirect effects , which are , largely , the induced effects of the former , represent mainly the negative impact on domestic variables and may include disrupted production owing to the absence or higher cost of sanctioned supplies , suspended financial inputs and services , foregone profit tax or tariff revenues , lost jobs and the need to increase social benefits .  
There have been financial losses of some $ 890-million owing to the non-implementation of letters of credit in , for example , the importation of ready-made clothing and shoes , milk and other baby food , electric and other domestic appliances , spare parts , home and office furniture , and other essential goods imported from abroad to meet the consumption needs of the local market ;  
Mobilization of substantial new and additional resources from all sources , domestic and international , public and private , and from traditional and new sources would also be instrumental .  
As an expression of their firm political will to employ all legal means to prevent , combat and eliminate terrorism , shall promote strict and timely compliance with applicable extradition treaties or , if appropriate , shall deliver the alleged perpetrators of terrorist acts to their competent authorities for prosecution , in accordance with their domestic laws , if sufficient legal grounds for doing so exist .  
To prevent physical and sexual abuse , the prospective workers must be thoroughly informed of the dangers inherent in domestic work and should be trained in effective ways of responding to and removing themselves from abusive situations .  
Educating people about how to save water , setting high efficiency standards for domestic appliances and charging realistic water rates were the main mechanisms involved , and were mirrored by federal legislation that established water as an economic commodity rather than a free good .  
Regarding organized crime , a number of specific measures had been taken that responded to part II of Congress resolution 1 , 1 / dealing with action against transnational and organized crime , particularly at the regional level , by updating domestic legislation in the area of money laundering , extradition and mutual assistance ; establishing separate units to deal with organized crime and improving legislation on environmental protection .  
The Government 's development efforts in the last three months have centred on encouraging passage by Parliament of two key laws related to the structural adjustment programme - civil service reform and modernization of public enterprises , maintaining the macroeconomic balance necessary to attract private investment and reactivating externally financed public investment to improve the country 's infrastructure and provide a much-needed stimulus to domestic demand .  
These measures are : ( a ) the establishment of a permanent international criminal court with universal jurisdiction over mass violations of human rights and humanitarian law ; such an international criminal court would have to be bestowed with an adequate mandate and sufficient means to enable it to conduct thorough investigations and enforce the implementation of its decisions ; and ( b ) the adoption of a convention , similar to the Convention against Torture , which would provide domestic courts with international jurisdiction over persons suspected of having committed mass violations of the right to life .  
Additional financial resources are called for , whether obtained through established means including increased and dependable official development assistance , better mobilization of domestic resources and greater direct foreign investment , or through innovative means .  
It must be pointed out here that children and adolescents are targeted by this education-for-health programme as recipients and agents who can pass on the benefits , and health topics are increasingly incorporated in primary and secondary curricula as well as in cultural activities in schools and universities ( hygiene , nutrition , accident prevention , living with domestic animals , prevention of transmissible diseases , contraception , sexually transmitted diseases , AIDS . . . ) . 
This strategy outlines Panama 's policy on maritime matters , with regard to its legal , scientific , economic and environmental aspects , and indicates the principles and purposes that guide the Panamanian State in its efforts to integrate itself in regional and international maritime activities in accordance with domestic legislation and international law .  
The proposal was made by the Commission in its report on its forty-seventh session in 1995 , 1 / in which the Commission notes that the topic could be considered as part of its long-term programme of work and could , inter alia , cover the content and scope of the rule of exhaustion of local remedies , the rule of nationality of claims as applied to both natural and juristic persons , problems of stateless persons and dual nationals , and the effect of dispute settlement clauses on domestic remedies and on the exercise of diplomatic protection .  
Those international conventions constitute internal law as of the time they are sanctioned , are applicable ex officio by the courts and by all public services and have increased validity pursuant to paragraph 1 of article 28 of the Constitution , which stipulates that : " The generally acknowledged rules of international law , as well as international conventions as of the time they are sanctioned by law and become operative according to the conditions therein , shall be an integral part of domestic Greek law and shall prevail over any contrary provisions of the law .  
Tied to this factor , the modern domestic private sector is still embryonic and indigenous entrepreneurial capacity is scarce , lacking capital and managerial expertise and experience .  
Employers found guilty of abusing domestic workers were liable to heavy sentences , including jail terms and corporal punishment , and were permanently barred from employing foreign domestic workers in the future .  
The problem of communicating how information should be used involved three challenges : how to measure the uncertainty underlying estimates of economic aggregates , such as gross domestic product ( GDP ) ; how to communicate that degree of uncertainty to users ; and how to communicate the conceptual relevance of alternative statistical measures , such as matching available price measures to administrative and policy uses , to different users .  
The reform and structural adjustment programmes to which African countries are committed have all been multidimensional in nature , including measures for domestic economic and commercial liberalization aimed at improving financial management , expanding the tax base and enhancing efficiency and transparency in the fiscal system .  
But it should be noted that , while innovation and competitiveness are activities of enterprises , success in innovation depends on a wide range of external factors , including the domestic institutional and social environments , national macroeconomic policies , incentive structures , the availability of skills , the local supply base , and the level of investment and linkages .  
What is particularly lacking in terms of raising domestic competition and increasing the competitiveness of economies in transition is a sufficient number of privately owned medium-sized enterprises capable of growing and competing not only in domestic markets but also in foreign markets .  
Subsequently , as the industrial base of the country in the industry concerned is developed and capabilities are acquired , the domestic sector may be exposed to import competition through gradual trade liberalization .  
Natural resource endowments , the level of development of the industrial base and of the physical and communications network , the size of the domestic market and the degree of integration of the domestic economy , the technological capacity and availability of adequate human capital in terms of skills , and the proximity to major production and consumption poles are elements in which developing countries also exhibit differences among themselves .  
For these countries , the main issue is how to speed up the creation of supply capacity through the mobilization of adequate resources , both domestic and foreign , for the development of productive capacity ( physical , human and institutional ) , a necessary first step towards building up export capabilities .  
Such work may also require international support for related activities at the national level , including technical cooperation activities to strengthen national policy and institutional instruments , and the domestic capabilities needed for this purpose , in the specific areas concerned . 
Training camps for foreign Muslim extremists , originally intended for the organization of violent actions outside the Sudan , were now being used , owing to the weakening of the State and to international pressure , for domestic repression alien to local Islamic traditions .  
Engage in systematic exchange of information and consider effective implementation of relevant international conventions , including the harmonization of their domestic legislation with those conventions , and conclusion of mutual judicial assistance and extradition agreements on a bilateral or regional basis and other measures for the purpose of combating offences referred to in article 2 of this Convention ;  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Portugal 's domestic legislation provided for the criminal responsibility of legal persons , including that of the State , and there were merits in developing the concept of international criminal responsibility , but the draft articles did not include specific consequences attached to a crime as opposed to a mere wrongful act .  
Notes that while sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country to promote macroeconomic stability are essential elements for determining the volume and structure of private capital flows , international macroeconomic policies play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness , and should contribute to creating a favourable international economic environment ;  
Any preventive and remedial action undertaken , including information and awareness campaigns , as well as education , in particular compulsory education , and vocational training programmes , to address the situation of child labour both in the formal and informal sector , including as domestic servants , in agriculture or within private family activities ;  
Phase 1 contains basic gross domestic product ( GDP ) at current and constant prices , broken down by final expenditure and kind of economic activity .  
Noting that the unfavourable situation of the Comoros , which is on the list of least developed countries , is aggravated by several important factors , including its physical distance from its trading partners , the scarcity of natural resources , the diminutive size of the domestic market , the fall in prices of its export products and the poverty of its soil ,  
In developing countries the current flows of private investment are highly concentrated on a few countries with export potential , while serious shortages of funds are experienced in countries where forestry is oriented towards domestic markets .  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
Also stresses that implementation of sound domestic monetary , fiscal and structural policies over the medium term , including ensuring of sound banking systems , is required to promote financial and exchange rate stability ;  
Moreover , it wished to point out that the fifth preambular paragraph seriously misquoted the Declaration and Programme of Action of the World Conference on Human Rights ; that , contrary to the statement in operative paragraph 3 , nothing in the international human rights instruments precluded the adoption of sanctions under domestic law ; that paragraph 4 wrongly implied that the right to self-determination included a right to trade and economic relations ; and that paragraph 5 incorrectly involved the Commission on Human Rights in issues of trade and economics .  
Stresses the urgent need to continue trade liberalization in developed and developing countries , including liberalization through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries , and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Recognizing that investment in human capital and domestic and international policies supportive of economic and social development are essential prerequisites for the eradication of poverty ,  
Noting also that the future course of net transfer of resources to developing countries depends on a growth-oriented and supportive international economic environment and on sound domestic economic policies ,  
These included macroeconomic stability , high rates of domestic saving , maintenance of sound financial intermediaries , high priority given to human resource development ( especially to high _ quality primary and secondary education ) , competitive exchange rates , export orientation , a supportive environment which rewarded entrepreneurship and allowed open and constructive dialogue between government and the private sector regarding objectives and policies , and governance which balanced the promotion of social cohesion and consensus with that of competition between individuals and companies .  
In view of the acute external financial constraints and low levels of domestic savings in most African countries , there was a pressing need to improve their capacity to attract foreign investment , in the process drawing investors ' attention to the considerable opportunities existing in all major economic sectors , namely natural resources , agro-industry , other manufacturing , tourism , other services , and infrastructure .  
The representative of the Republic of Korea identified the following crucial components of the East Asian development experience : political and economic stability , which could only be fully ensured by sound domestic governance ; an export orientation with export promotion ; capital accumulation financed both domestically and from abroad ; the upgrading and importation of new technology and the development of overseas marketing skills ; balanced enterprise development ; and human resource development , at the level of both skilled workers and advanced education .  
In spite of all these setbacks , African countries had pressed ahead with efforts to facilitate the effective development and utilization of human resources , harness their vast natural resources , mobilize both domestic and foreign financial resources for development and strengthen regional and subregional cooperation and integration .  
Take steps to prevent and counteract , through appropriate domestic measures , the financing of terrorists and terrorist organizations , whether such financing is direct or indirect through organizations which also have or claim to have charitable , social or cultural goals , or which are also engaged in unlawful activities such as illicit arms trafficking , drug dealing and racketeering  
When an aerospace object is located in the territorial airspace of another State , it may be subject to international air law as well as to relevant domestic air law by reason of national security or aerial safety as long as it has characteristics both of an aeroplane which is subject to air law and a space object which is subject to space law . 
Recognizing that investment in human capital and domestic and international policies supportive of economic and social development are essential prerequisites for the eradication of poverty ,  
While recognizing the discretionary powers of the courts and tribunals in imposing the penalties prescribed by domestic law for acts of racial discrimination , the Committee had often pointed out that the lightness of the penalties imposed in such cases , some of which had affected the fundamental right to life and physical integrity , was not commensurate with the seriousness of the offences .  
" Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Notes that while sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country to promote macroeconomic stability are essential elements for determining the volume and structure of private capital flows , international macroeconomic policies play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness , and should contribute to creating a favourable international economic environment ;  
Noting also that the unfavourable situation of the Comoros , which is on the list of least developed countries , is aggravated by several important factors , including its physical distance from its trading partners , the scarcity of natural resources , the diminutive size of the domestic market , the fall in prices of its export products and the poverty of its soil ,  
\ x { f448 } RK ( Slovenia ) said that the Code of crimes against the peace and security of mankind would complement the functioning of the future international criminal court and also serve domestic legal systems by unifying the criminal law and practice concerning the crimes which were considered to be the most serious crimes under international law .  
The Panel recognized that in developing countries domestic resources for the financing , management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forest are scarce and international financial sources remain vital .  
The Panel recognized that there is a need to promote new and innovative forms of finance and [ combine ] [ complement ] [ facilitate ] all forms of finance , at the public , private , international , domestic and local levels and to combine them with existing ones , as well as to ensure the predictability and continuity of flow of financial resources .  
Invited [ [ UNDP and the World Bank to take the lead ] [ the Bretton Woods institutions ] , together with other ] relevant international organizations , to further explore [ innovative ways to use existing financial mechanisms more effectively and ] [ possibilities ] to generate additional forest-specific public and private financial resources at [ the domestic as well as at ] the international level .  
Today , we have a stable national currency , a minimum rate of inflation , greater economic potential , and a gross domestic product with an annual growth rate of 14 per cent .  
While expressing its full support for UNDCP , his delegation was greatly concerned by the attitude taken towards that body by some donor countries , and stressed that countries with a high level of domestic consumption of illicit drugs should continue to bear a fair share of the increasing financial burden of UNDCP .  
Stresses the need for all countries to develop economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
In a judgement rendered on 21 April 1982 , the Supreme Court of Justice , ruling on appeal , declared void a provision on bank employees ' labour contracts which gave married male employees the unreserved right to a domestic subsidy , while allowing the subsidy to married female employees only under severely restricted conditions . 
He stated that the relegation of women to a domestic role , attributable to cultural factors , their lack of political involvement , the reduced pay they received when on maternity leave , the violence within the family that affected two out of every three women , the discrimination practised by families in respect of education and the sexual attacks by soldiers and policemen already reported in 1994 , continued unabated in 1995 .  
In its representation , Latvia pointed to its over-assessment , dating back to 1991 , the current economic situation of the country , with falling real gross domestic product and a recent banking crisis , and severe restrictions on the budget of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , given other pressing humanitarian and social needs .  
Sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; these countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
Those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
Besides promoting a dynamic and competitive domestic economy , based on comparative advantages , and providing physical and institutional infrastructures , domestic sectoral policies should also seek to integrate the protection and conservation of the environment and the achievement of social development objectives into sectoral development plans .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
It was noted , for example , that , if the courts applied their broad " domestic " notion of public policy to the recognition of foreign judicial decisions , very few foreign decisions would ever be recognized since most foreign proceedings would , in one or the other aspect , depart from procedures which , internally , constituted matters governed by imperative rules .  
At the same time , the reform process must assign special importance to measures and mechanisms designed to accelerate economic and social development , especially in Africa , by supporting domestic efforts at economic restructuring , diversification of raw materials and increased food security being carried out by the countries of the region . 
The political exploitation of this international problem , through hurling unfounded allegations in order to advance certain ulterior motives or cover up deficiencies in domestic or external policy , is no less dangerous than terrorism itself .  
But the main specific feature is that all these Republics are in the process of building a State , and therefore give the highest priority to the issues of peace , security and stability in their domestic and foreign policies , because only with these basic conditions is sustainable economic and social development possible .  
They include poverty and growing economic imbalances in and between countries ; rising unemployment and underemployment in many parts of the world ; environmental degradation ; war and civil strife ; intensified domestic and international conflicts for political , religious or ethnic reasons ; disparities in economic development and income levels ; globalization ; labour market demands ; and increased international trade and investment .  
The peri-urban poor live in the most hazardous environment where their health is at risk from exposure to toxic chemicals and pathogens from domestic solid wastes and human faecal wastes .  
The Agreements contain not only such provisions as the parties considered to be necessary for ending the legal situation of domestic armed conflict and remedying its effects , but also a much longer set of provisions which set out a State plan which encapsulates many of the recommendations contained in the reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights , and in particular several relating to the structural changes needed to ensure the effective exercise of human rights .  
Violence against women , especially domestic violence , appears to be pervasive , and systematic and serious efforts are required to address this problem , at the legislative level and through practical measures such as a comprehensive awareness-raising and education campaign for the public in general , and in particular for law enforcement agencies such as the police , lawyers and judges .  
In situations where the constraints on domestic resources are most severe , owing to weak economic performance , inadequate infrastructure , and the shortage of trained personnel , it is expected that most of the needed resources will be supplied through external population assistance .  
The Committee was also concerned that the country had not made much real progress in implementing the Convention and that , despite its efforts , it had yet to respond effectively to problems such as domestic violence , prostitution , early pregnancy , female illiteracy , discrimination in the workplace in terms of how much women were paid , the high percentage of women receiving less than the minimum wage , the elimination of stereotypes , and the changes that needed to be made in the country 's legal system , which reinforced existing stereotypes .  
Recognizing that investment in human capital and domestic and international policies supportive of economic and social development are essential prerequisites for the eradication of poverty ,  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Noting also that the future course of net transfer of resources to developing countries depends on a growth-oriented and supportive international economic environment and on sound domestic economic policies ,  
Stresses the urgent need to continue trade liberalization in developed and developing countries , including liberalization through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Stresses the need for all countries to develop economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
It was stated that paragraph ( 1 ) essentially contained a provision on the allocation of liability to the domestic certification authority in the event that the foreign certificate was found to be defective , a liability to be derived from draft article H . Paragraph ( 2 ) , in turn , was not concerned with liability issues , but with the legal effects that might be produced directly by a foreign certificate , for example where that foreign certificate would be relied upon in the context of a dispute before the courts of the enacting State . 
However , the concern was voiced that , when read in conjunction with draft article B , which required such prior approval for certification authorities established in the enacting State , paragraph ( 1 ) might be read as allowing the recognition of certificates issued by foreign certification authorities which had not been authorized to operate under domestic rules , while denying legal effectiveness to certificates issued by domestic certification authorities that had not received the required authorization in the enacting State .  
That new capital is envisaged to come from a redirection of private capital from mature markets to markets with new absorptive capacity created for sustainable development ; from the removal of existing subsidies ; from domestic savings ; from debt-relief ; and from public monies , including increased ODA . Efforts should be made to provide the necessary flexibility to allow those reallocations to take place naturally in response to incentives . 
The Committee shall not declare a communication admissible unless it has ascertained that all available [ legal ] domestic remedies have been exhausted [ in accordance with generally recognized rules of international law ] ; [ this shall not apply where the Committee considers the application of the remedies to be [ unreasonably prolonged ] [ unreasonable ] or unlikely to bring effective relief ] [ unless the claimant demonstrates that such remedies are ineffective or that the application of the remedies has been unduly prolonged ] ; 
Recalling also and concurring with the conclusions of and recommendations made by recent international conferences on the human rights of women and girl children , in particular with respect to the violation of those rights through sexual and economic exploitation for the profit of recruiters , traffickers and crime syndicates , as well as other illegal activities related to trafficking , such as forced domestic labour , false marriages , child marriages , clandestine employment and false adoption ,  
The Panel recognized that in developing countries , domestic resources for financing the management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forest are scarce and international financial sources remain vital .  
It reiterated the need for external support through ODA and the provision of new and additional financial resources , and emphasized the need to mobilize new , innovative and additional forms of finance at the public , private , international , domestic and local levels .  
Efforts in developing countries to secure additional financial resources and technology at domestic level need to be strengthened , and should be supplemented from international sources .  
Since supply capacities would play a crucial role in determining the extent to which developing countries ( and especially least developed countries ) could seize the opportunities arising from the Uruguay Round Agreements , the report identified some of the measures required for improving the domestic supply response .  
The extent and shape of the international presence in Haiti following the withdrawal of UNSMIH will necessarily be based on the careful consideration of such factors as the degree of professionalization of the HNP ; the security situation as it relates to the ability of the HNP to carry out its mandate ; the state of the Haitian economy ; the commitment of the Government to promoting national reconciliation ; domestic political support for continued international presence ; and the financial and other constraints facing the United Nations .  
As a result of the transition to a market economy , the Russian Federation has experienced a sharp deterioration of all major economic and social indicators since 1990 , including a decrease in real gross domestic product ( GDP ) of roughly 38 per cent from 1990 to 1995 .  
One reason is the objective differences in the curricula offered by different countries / institutions , while another is the resistance of health professional associations to opening the domestic markets to students who have studied abroad , especially when there is no shortage of medical personnel trained in local schools .  
Decides to renew , for a three-year period , the mandate of the Working Group composed of five independent experts entrusted with the task of investigating cases of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily , provided that no final decision has been taken in such cases by domestic courts in conformity with domestic law , with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with the relevant international instruments accepted by the States concerned ;  
During the last two years only , the inspections have led to the unmasking of : a complete biological weapons development and production programme ; highly sophisticated and advanced work on the extremely lethal chemical warfare nerve agent VX ; and the multifaceted domestic development and production of Scud-type missile engines under Iraq 's project 1728 .  
The elements of macroeconomic balance and stability , such as inflation , fiscal deficits and current account deficits ( which reflect the gap between domestic savings and investment ) are widely acknowledged to affect foreign trade and external financial inflows through their effects on interest rates , exchange rates , rates of return on investments and credit ratings , among others .  Sources : ESCAP , 1995 ESCAP Population Data Sheet ( Bangkok , 1995 ) ; United Nations , World Population Prospects : The 1994 Revision ( United Nations publication , Sales No .  
In particular , such provisions could invite States , in accordance with or subject to their domestic laws or pursuant to bilateral or multilateral agreements or arrangements : ( a ) to take all appropriate measures to prevent preparation in their respective territories for the commission of those offences outside their territories ; ( b ) to exchange information in accordance with their national law ; and ( c ) to coordinate administrative and other measures to be taken , as appropriate , to prevent the commission of offences set forth in the convention .  
Decides to renew , for a three-year period , the mandate of the Working Group composed of five independent experts entrusted with the task of investigating cases of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily , provided that no final decision has been taken in such cases by domestic courts in conformity with domestic law , with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with the relevant international instruments accepted by the States concerned ;  
Serve as a mobilizer of ideas and a catalyst for action to identify and promote new policy options at the national , subregional and regional levels for the removal of constraints on the economic and social development efforts of these countries , with emphasis on the adoption of measures for increased mobilization of domestic and foreign resources , trade and private sector development , public sector reform , and provision of economic advice , on request , to Governments with limited internal capacity .  
In many countries , particularly those of the British Commonwealth , as well as others , exclusive use and occupancy of land from time immemorial gives rise to aboriginal title , a title that is good against all but the sovereign , that is , the Government of the State . 15 / Where aboriginal title is recognized , indigenous peoples have at least some legal right that can be asserted in the domestic legal system . 
Thus , both international war and internal armed conflicts , just as states of tension or domestic disturbances caused by political , economic , social or cultural factors , when accompanied by clashes , acts of violence , vandalism , inter _ ethnic confrontations , terrorist attacks , etc . and provided they represent an actual or at any rate imminent threat to the community as a whole , constitute a public danger or public emergency in the meaning conferred on those terms by the international instruments referred to above .  
This is why both the domestic law of States ( whatever its theoretical foundations ) and international law accept that in such circumstances the competent authorities may suspend the exercise of certain rights for the sole and unique purpose of restoring normality and guaranteeing the exercise of the most fundamental human rights .  
In situations where the constraints on domestic resources are most severe owing to weak economic performance , inadequate infrastructure and the shortage of trained personnel , it is expected that most of the needed resources will be supplied through external population assistance .  
To realize the concrete and achievable goals set out by the International Conference on Population and Development , the mobilization of resources , both domestic and external , must be placed high on the global development agenda and the implications of increasing financial resources to the level of $ 17-billion by the year 2000 , as called for in the Programme of Action , must be faced squarely .  
In order to avoid military courts , in those countries where they have not yet been abolished , helping to perpetuate impunity by virtue of a lack of independence resulting from the chain of command to which all or some of their members are subject , their jurisdiction must be limited solely to specifically military offences committed by military personnel , excluding human rights violations constituting serious crimes under international law , which come under the jurisdiction of the ordinary domestic courts or , where necessary , an international court .  
Thus promotion of exports of health services required the designing of strategies to improve domestic capacity , create export potential without adversely affecting national health services , identify excess supply of health services and potential markets for such services and overcome internal and external barriers .  
They included : the particularly high proportion of women living in poverty in southern Italy ; the need to ensure greater participation by women in policy-making ; the excessive glorification of women 's role in domestic life ; the inadequate emphasis on article 4 of the Convention and the absence of quantitative goals for women 's participation in political and public life ; and the need to address questions relating to violence against women from a broader societal prospective which would reject traditional patriarchal attitudes .  
An essential component of an enabling environment for development is sound national macroeconomic policies and the creation of favourable conditions for investment and increased domestic savings , including through the creation of a sound banking system .  
These include weak domestic employment capacity , uneven sectoral growth , weak intersectoral articulation , severe marketing bottlenecks , poorly coordinated and fragmented new investments in both public and private ventures and structural imbalances among macroeconomic aggregates .  
These should provide in particular protection of contractual agreements and an even playing field between domestic and foreign investors ( therefore preventing discrimination against foreign investors ) , and policy formulation should be consistent and well planned so that partial reversals or inconsistent legislation are not implemented later .  
These include the existence of a properly functioning banking system with the ability to mobilize an adequate level of domestic savings ; a legal system that protects private property ; the existence of company laws that allow multiple ownership as a precondition for share ownership by the public ; and the freedom of foreign investors to own domestic assets in clearly specified sectors of the economy .  
The idea was also raised that building up a domestic institutional investor base could help provide additional local private demand for marketable securities .  
Since 1990 , however , a number of major international and humanitarian crises , a global economic downturn , and domestic preoccupations and budgetary pressures in a number of the donor countries have dominated aid policies .  
In normal circumstances , growing developing countries should see their external debt rising , reflecting foreign borrowing to supplement domestic resources for investment .  
It could be argued that a staged approach for the penetration of foreign markets , starting from domestic markets and moving to regional ones which displayed similar sociocultural characteristics , could be a viable option .  
The Special Rapporteur affirmed that , owing to their double marginalization as women and as migrants , women migrant workers might easily find themselves in situations in which they were vulnerable to violence and abuse , especially since women migrant workers dominated the informal labour market of most countries , working as domestic , industrial or agricultural labourers , or within the service industry . 
ECA has collaborated with OAU in various meetings and seminars organized in the following areas : domestic mobilization of financial resources for the development of Africa ; the role of African workers and trade unions in subregional and regional economic integration ; the mobilization of resources and public awareness for refugees in Africa ; trade policies and World Trade Organization negotiations ; future relations between the African , Caribbean and Pacific Group of States and the European Union ; and globalization , development and international labour standards .  
There has been a sizeable expansion of private flows of financial resources from developed to a limited number of developing countries and , in a number of countries , efforts have been made in support of domestic resource mobilization , including the increasing use of economic instruments to promote sustainable development .  
At the national level , there are three major types of private actors involved in capital market operations : security exchanges ( the parallel and the over-the-counter markets ) ; domestic custody , settlement and clearing institutions ; and listed companies and brokers .  
With investment in the last decade having risen faster than both trade and gross domestic product , and with continued impetus from expected further liberalization of portfolio and long-term capital flows in the future , the promotion of South-South cooperation desired by developing countries may include greater emphasis on the role of investment within the context of an integrated intra-South production framework . 
The financial sector , however , continues to be viewed as deserving of special consideration because of its central role in the national economy and the far-reaching damage that financial disruption , caused for instance by imprudent lending or unanticipated changes in prices , can produce in the domestic economy .  
The Commission encourages countries to continue to pursue coherent and coordinated policies including the creation of a possible domestic legal framework and a stable economic environment , to attract foreign direct investment in order to benefit from its contribution to development . performance and the unexploited opportunities available . 
Sound domestic macroeconomic policies in each country for promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; those countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development .

The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
In order to encourage domestic investment and to attract foreign direct investment , it is essential to have in place a stable , supportive , effective and transparent legal framework .  
In Mozambique a major part of this initiative has involved a radio drama series in which Mozambican actors act out a lively series of plots conveying messages such as the importance of staying in school , how to deal with sexual harassment , AIDS-awareness , and covering delicate issues such as female genital mutilation , early marriages , and the domestic workload of girls .  
While such savings now represented a greater proportion of the gross domestic product of developing countries than they had a decade earlier , savings rates in Africa and Latin America remained comparatively low , owing to low absolute levels of per capita income in Africa , the low rates of growth in income , continuing high levels of unemployment in both regions and patterns of income distribution .  
In close cooperation with the World Bank , the European Commission , the United States Treasury and the United States Agency for International Development , my office is focusing on getting the privatization process started , modernizing the framework for domestic and foreign investment , reforming the social security system as a prerequisite for easing the excessive burden of contributions , and approximating basic commercial laws to the standards of the European Union . 
Further , implementation strategies advocated were not adopted at the country level , the nascent African private sector was not fully prepared to assume the new responsibilities in the industrial investment process and financial support , including term lending , from both domestic and foreign sources was not readily available for industrial projects .  
Those organizations had been in general agreement that an accurate and transparent impact assessment , based on a common approach to or understanding of the issues involved , was essential both to design the appropriate domestic policy response and to seek adequate external assistance .  
While there was no simple solution to pursuing development goals in an increasingly competitive and globalized world and even though economic growth was not automatic , notable strides had been made by those who embraced credible macro-economic settings ; those who addressed the social dimension of development in tandem with the pursuit of economic growth ; those who fostered domestic private sector development ; and those who pursued representative , open and accountable governance .  
The Commission encourages countries to continue to pursue coherent and coordinated policies , including the creation of a possible domestic legal framework and a stable economic environment , to attract foreign direct investment in order to benefit from its contribution to development .  
The objective in this thematic area is to provide the poor populations in urban and rural areas , especially women , with the capabilities needed to increase their profit from participation in the market , thus improving their standards of living and raising their share of contribution to the gross domestic products of their countries .  
While making steady advances in economic and social development , China was also undertaking tremendous efforts in drug control through strengthened law enforcement and control of domestic narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances , and chemicals used in the manufacture of illicit drugs .  
The number of such associations is constantly rising , and their diverse objectives include childcare , encouraging the work and education of women , raising women 's awareness of educational , health , social and legal matters and providing vocational training for women in skills such as dressmaking , printing and domestic food preparation .  
Reiterates the need to continue trade liberalization in areas of export interest to developing countries , including through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Calls upon all countries to develop economic policies that promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
Noting that the globalization of financial markets can generate new risks of instability , including interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations , which have the potential to aggravate the volatility of short-term capital flows and to adversely affect the international financial system , requiring all countries to pursue sound economic policies and to recognize the external economic impact of their domestic policies ,  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
Also recognizes the importance of ensuring transparency and accountability at the national level to achieve policy credibility and confidence-building as well as sound regulatory and supervisory arrangements so as to strengthen the domestic financial system , and further recognizes the importance of a stable international economic environment and stability in the international monetary system ;  
Reiterates the importance of trade liberalization in developed and developing countries and the need to continue liberalization , particularly in areas of interest to developing countries , through , inter alia , a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access , and recognizing the need for African countries to use both human and financial resources more effectively in the process of industrialization ,  
This has not been effective , however , in raising growth the extra liquidity created by low interest rates has not been channelled into real domestic economic activities , but has sought higher yields in other countries .  
The Commission encouraged the Secretariat to devise ways to address the continuing and significant increase in the importance being attributed by Governments , by domestic and international business communities and by multilateral and bilateral aid agencies to improving the legal framework for international trade and investment .  
In specific terms our countries , despite various structural reforms , have been unable to attract in sufficient quantities the necessary capital inflows for investment , and are confronted at the same time with domestic supply-side constraints which limit our export potential , an unsustainable debt which swallows a great part of our national income , and declining levels of official development assistance , among others .  
There can be no universal environmental preservation without a genuine change in the unsustainable consumption patterns that bring about the increasing deterioration of the global environment , without adequate financial assistance for development in percentages proportional to gross domestic product , and without adequate facilities to access modern technologies .  
The efforts at domestic stabilization through reorganization of the State and the reconciliation of opinions and the return to work of the civilian population are accompanied by other efforts aimed at achieving peace and regional stability in order to create economic and political conditions conducive to productive national and foreign investment .  
In our ceaseless struggle as a small nation to achieve people-centred development goals , the present Government , within the international constraints of sustainable development and environmental protection , will continue its endeavours to increase domestic efficiency and international competitiveness in agriculture , production , manufacturing and export , as well as to strengthen the institutions of local entrepreneurship , with a view to ensuring political stability and fostering equitable economic growth .  
It is with that concern in mind that for more than a year the Government of Burundi has been engaged in a peace process based on an extensive consultation of our people through domestic debate and on the peace conferences held abroad , so that all the people of Burundi , without exception , could be involved in inclusive political negotiations open to all parties concerned in the conflict in Burundi . 
On the question of health , the Government has undertaken to rationalize the current programmes carried on under the auspices of the Ministry of Public Health and Population and to replace the traditional vertical approach with a more effective , regionally integrated strategy based on providing a minimum service , estimated to cost 2 per cent of gross domestic product a year .  
The sanctions imposed on Iraq and the foreign interference in its domestic affairs have given rise to clandestine excavations that have enabled their organizers to appropriate and sell cultural property and rare art objects of inestimable value , as well as manuscripts and antique books .  
In only a few developing countries , mostly in East and South-East Asia and Latin America , have domestic companies joined the integrated networks of transnational corporations and , in some cases , forged strategic alliances to exploit dynamic trade and investment interlinkages .  
Large capital inflows can also result in speculative bubbles in certain economic sectors or the stock market or in an over-expansion of domestic credit if prudential regulation is inadequate or not enforced .  
Sustained capital inflows and long-term growth , however , also require continuous upgrading of domestic technological and productive capabilities , for comparative advantage shifts within and between countries and can not be maintained based simply on static comparative advantage and outward-oriented liberalization policies .  
Empirical evidence suggests that the countries that have been successful in sustaining capital inflows and long-term growth are those that have systematically upgraded their human capital and infrastructure and have promoted the continuous diversification or deepening of their domestic productive base .  
Economic , social and political stability , including stable macroeconomic policies , have been a major factor in encouraging domestic savings and investment and attracting FDI in the more successful developing countries .  
For their part , most small island developing States face the reality of constrained domestic savings and public revenue potential due to a number of factors , notably the small size of their economies and the imperative of granting tax holidays and exemption from import and export duties to foreign investors in order to attract and retain foreign capital , which accounts for significant proportions of investments in major sectors , such as tourism , textiles and in some cases mining .  
Reducing the worst inequities will depend on ( i ) international and national action to reverse the stagnant or negative economic growth patterns currently experienced in the lowest income countries ; and ( ii ) domestic policies ( in all countries ) which enable all sectors of society to benefit from growth .  
The Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines expressed concern with regard to several important socio-economic issues , including youth unemployment , the high rate of female migration , decreased export earnings in the agricultural sector , the high rate of pregnancy among pre-teenagers and adolescents , traditional socio-cultural attitudes reflecting stereotyped gender roles and the prevalence of domestic violence .  
Recognizing that , in general , large external capital movements are likely to be the market response to changes in expectations about domestic economic performance , the 1995 meeting of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) Interim Committee enhanced the IMF ability to monitor the economic policies of member countries and increase the transparency of national policies through improved and more timely provision of data .  
At its third session , the Commission proposed ways to enhance the effectiveness of ODA through the elaboration of national sustainable development strategies , with the participation of all interested parties ; the use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external resources , through such schemes as co-financing , joint ventures , underwriting of country risks and venture capital funds ; and the promotion of public and political support in donor countries for raising ODA levels .  
Since supply capacities would play a crucial role in determining the extent to which developing countries ( and especially least developed countries ) could seize the opportunities arising from the Uruguay Round Agreements , the report identified some of the measures required for improving the domestic supply response .  
States parties shall not be required by this Convention to provide any information which they are not permitted to communicate pursuant to domestic legislation or which would jeopardize the security of the State concerned or the physical protection of nuclear material , nuclear fuel , radioactive products or waste , radioactive substances , nuclear installations , nuclear devices or their components or objects of which they are components .  
The Committee noted with satisfaction several measures taken between the third and fourth periodic reports , such as credit assistance to women , legislation prohibiting sexual harassment , raising the minimum wage for domestic workers and increasing maternity and paternity benefits for employed persons .  
In this connection , the Mission underscored the importance of excluding from the extinction of liability those human rights violations which had occurred outside the strict framework of the internal armed conflict , and the major responsibility of the judicial authorities for complying with the spirit of the law by disallowing an extinction of criminal liability for those crimes which , under domestic law or the international treaties ratified by Guatemala , are imprescriptible or are not subject to such an extinction .  
Noting also that the unfavourable situation of the Comoros , which is on the list of least developed countries , is aggravated by several important factors , including its physical distance from its trading partners , the scarcity of natural resources , the diminutive size of the domestic market , the fall in prices of its export products and the poverty of its soil ,  
As of January 1997 , it became a constant feature of government policy to declare war and a general mobilization against its domestic and external enemies , without making a distinction between those Sudanese citizens who join the armed forces fighting against the Government which are assumed or are known actively to oppose the Government of the Sudan and those who happen to be in the conflict areas , once again regardless of their race , religion , language , ethnic or social origin and status .  
First , once they are fully implemented , the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture , market access reforms in manufactured and industrial products , and the phasing out of the Multifibre Agreement in textiles trade are projected to raise global income substantially ( estimates range from an increase of US $ 40-billion to one of US $ 215-billion relative to the 1992 base period gross domestic product of approximately US $ 23-trillion ) .  
In the same resolution , the Council recognized the importance of enhancing international cooperation in the enforcement of domestic and international environmental criminal laws , of promoting operational activities in that area , and of protecting the environment not only at the national level but also at the international level .  
Panama continued that the foregoing provisions would not apply where the domestic legislation of the State did not provide for due process of law with regard to the protection of the right or rights which had allegedly been violated ; the alleged victim of a violation had not been allowed access to domestic remedies , or had been impeded in exhausting such remedies ; there had been unreasonable delay in a decision with regard to domestic remedies .  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
Also stresses that implementation of sound domestic monetary , fiscal and structural policies over the medium term , including ensuring sound banking systems , is required to promote financial and exchange rate stability ;  
Indeed , FDI could negatively impact the development process , for example through TNC entry that inhibited the growth of domestic firms , through the repatriation of capital that aggravated balance-of-payments difficulties , or through social and environmental effects that impeded further economic development .  
Policies for promoting domestic resources mobilization should include macroeconomic and structural reforms , public expenditure reforms , the promotion of environmental taxes and charges , a review of existing subsidy policies , and financial sector development to promote personal saving and access to credit , taking into account the characteristics and capabilities of individual countries .  
The representative of the Netherlands felt that a provision for resource mobilization as proposed by the representative of South Africa should not include a reference to the single general domestic legislation clause , because it would be redundant and might set a bad precedent for the inclusion of similar restrictions in other provisions contained in the consolidated text .  
The Commission will review progress made in the implementation and follow-up of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , and will consider at each of its sessions issues relating to the enabling environment for social development , the special situation of Africa and the least developed countries , the enhancement of social development goals in structural adjustment programmes , the mobilization of domestic and international resources for social development , and the framework for international , regional and subregional cooperation for social development .  
Reiterates the importance of trade liberalization in developed and developing countries and the need to continue liberalization , particularly in areas of interest to developing countries , through , inter alia , a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
His Government ( a democratically elected one , as the international and regional organizations that had supervised the electoral process had duly reported ) had enacted just such domestic legislation , and had met , and would continue to meet , its corresponding international obligations .  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access , and recognizing the need for African countries to use both human and financial resources more effectively in the process of industrialization ,  
While in the majority of African countries manufacturing output stagnated , strong performance was recorded for the northern and eastern subregions , with growth rates of 4.2 per cent and 5.3 per cent , respectively , sustained by strong domestic demand as well as buoyant inflows of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) .  
Among the inhibiting domestic structures and growth-constraining factors in Africa are the internal social disarticulation at almost all levels of production ; weak and undiversified production base ; economic delusion and fragmented domestic factor and product markets ; low level of endogenous human resource development and capacity utilization ; and weak physical , institutional and technical capacities .  
The creation of wider markets through regional and subregional economic integration remains a fundamental prerequisite for a viable economic diversification strategy in Africa , if only to make up for the small size of domestic markets and to encourage the restructuring of national production systems to take advantage of complementarities in resource endowments and economies of scale .  
With the decline in the external resource inflows to Africa and with little or no prospects for any major improvements in accessing external savings , particularly in the form of official development assistance ( ODA ) , African Governments are now fully aware that effective mobilization of both domestic and external resources is crucial for long-term sustained development .  
While the mobilization of external resources should target and tap into the growing non-debt-creating arrangements and particularly direct foreign investment ( FDI ) , the domestic counterpart should seek to exploit the rich potential within both the urban and rural milieus .  
Although the measures introduced in 1995 to restore internal and external balance to the Hungarian economy have made considerable progress in this direction , their impact on domestic demand and especially on household consumption has been more severe and more long-lasting than expected .  Economic growth in Slovenia also continued to slow down in 1996 , despite earlier forecasts of an acceleration .  
Nevertheless , a number of countries ( Czech Republic , Hungary , Poland , Slovenia and Croatia ) have achieved significant success in lowering and controlling their inflation rates ; but one consequence of this success is that they have been attracting large and rapid inflows of foreign capital which threaten to destabilize domestic monetary control and to push up the exchange rate , thereby further weakening the competitiveness of the tradeables sector .  
A recent study1 has stressed that a current account deficit of more than 5 per cent is likely to become a problem only when a range of conditions apply : when the export sector is small , debt service is large , domestic savings are low , and the financial sector is weak and dominated by banks subject to weak regulation .  
It is against this background that developing and transitional economy countries must grapple with the problem of maximizing the mobilization of financial resources from both domestic and foreign sources while at the same time ensuring that those resources are used in the most efficient and productive way so as to benefit all classes of the population , including the poor , and that public financial operations are reliably accounted for so as to inspire confidence among both citizens and foreign donors and investors .  
In 1995 , the gross domestic product stood at US $ 96 million , while per capita it increased to $ 6,415 .  4 .  The performance of the Turks and Caicos economy in 1995 was characterized by continued rapid growth in tourism , a steady rise in offshore financial services business and an increase in fishing activities , combined with lower inflation rates and a slight reduction in the unemployment rate .  
Further , a stable and transparent legal framework that provides for respect for and enforcement of property rights , the rule of law and the tackling of corruption , as well as transparent , efficient and accountable public administration , are conducive to domestic and foreign investment and capital inflows .  
Investment ( domestic and foreign ) , capital inflows and access to foreign exchange are facilitated by a low and predictable rate of inflation , a sustainable fiscal deficit and a realistic exchange rate .  
The Council may urge that structural reforms aimed at establishing a competitive domestic financial system , privatization and / or restructuring of public enterprises continue to be implemented in order to enhance the efficient allocation of resources and support private sector development ; such reforms are also expected to boost domestic savings and investment and thereby contribute to higher economic growth .  
Sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; these countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
Those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
Besides promoting a dynamic and competitive domestic economy , based on comparative advantages , and providing physical and institutional infrastructures , domestic sectoral policies should also seek to integrate the protection and conservation of the environment and the achievement of social development objectives into sectoral development plans .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
In this regard , the Netherlands stated that institutional and human capacity , a reliable regulatory and a supportive legal system , as well as stable and sound macroeconomic policies , were among the central building blocks to attract domestic and international capital to finance development .  
Thus promotion of exports of health services required the designing of strategies to improve domestic capacity , create export potential without adversely affecting national health services , identify excess supply of health services and potential markets for such services and overcome internal and external barriers . on service providers . 
The Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines expressed concern with regard to several important socio-economic issues , including youth unemployment , the high rate of female migration , decreased export earnings in the agricultural sector , the high rate of pregnancy among pre-teenagers and adolescents , traditional socio-cultural attitudes reflecting stereotyped gender roles and the prevalence of domestic violence .  
The Committee noted with satisfaction several measures taken between the third and fourth periodic reports , such as the provision of credit assistance to women , legislation prohibiting sexual harassment , raising the minimum wage for domestic workers and increasing maternity and paternity benefits for employed persons .  
Noting that Canada faced new domestic and global socio-economic challenges , the representative emphasized that Canada had taken decisive steps to provide women with an effective legal framework against discrimination . 
There has been a sizeable expansion of private flows of financial resources from developed to a limited number of developing countries and , in a number of countries , efforts have been made in support of domestic resource mobilization , including the increasing use of economic instruments to promote sustainable development .  
Except for two years since Rio , Zambia has been unable to register positive growth in its gross domestic product , despite my Government \ x { e5b8 } very determined effort to put in place comprehensive reform measures in the private and public sectors .  
In his paper , Mr . Alfredsson suggested that better use should be made of international and bilateral technical cooperation programmes with a view to enhancing respect for minority rights at the domestic level ; that the Working Group should show , using concrete examples , that dialogue and technical cooperation could be effective mechanisms for conflict prevention and resolution ; that the Working Group might encourage research on topics of particular relevance to its mandate and ensure that the guidelines on State reporting addressed minority concerns .  
In principle , there is general agreement that an accurate and transparent impact assessment , based on a common approach to or understanding of the issues involved , is essential both to design the appropriate domestic policy response and to seek adequate external assistance in coping with the side effects of sanctions .  
Anti-dumping proceedings have been criticized on grounds of inadequate examinations as to whether imported and domestic products fall , in fact , within the same quality segment , lax determinations of causality between dumping and injury , neglect of consumer interests and the legal possibility to file new complaints whenever earlier complaints regarding the same import product have been unsuccessful . \ x { ffff } seq level0 \ * arabic \ x { ffff } 15 \ x { ffff } . 
Over the preceding 10 years , the international community had established legal standards and created an institutional framework for regional and international cooperation in the struggle against illegal drugs , which would be greatly reinforced by universal ratification of the international treaties , the adaptation of domestic legislation and the implementation of the relevant programmes .  
For the first time , more than half the gross domestic product had been generated by the private sector , and more favourable conditions for national and foreign investors had been created through the ongoing privatization process , the completion of the first phase of financial stabilization , the gradual liberalization of domestic and foreign trade and the introduction of a new national currency .  
The explanation for that situation lay in the accumulation of such factors as poor physical infrastructure , a generally unskilled labour force , high levels of indebtedness , high inflation and small domestic markets , problems which the African countries must face up to by seeking to establish sound macroeconomic equilibrium and suitable infrastructure , and by investing in social programmes to promote the integration of their people in the global system .  
Each developing country should adopt macroeconomic policies conducive to domestic savings and investment , which had more impact on growth than external contributions , and should stress human resources development , education and health at the social level and respect for the rule of law at the political level .  
The efforts of developing countries to mobilize domestic resources should be supported by external resources commensurate with their needs ; accordingly , the depletion of financial assistance agreed and committed by the developed countries , particularly official development assistance , was cause for concern .  
Despite the decisive role of domestic policy in respect of the influx of private capital , it was essential to take measures at the international level to ensure the effectiveness of domestic reforms ; in that respect it should be recalled that , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 50 / 91 , cooperation and coordination must be broadened among interested countries and the Bretton Woods institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries .  
Assumptions related to gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth , demographic growth , energy prices , structural changes in energy demand and supply , and policy choices differed considerably among Parties , reflecting the different national circumstances , and the time span of the projections .  Economic growth was considered to be a driving force for several Parties , but in some of them ( e.g .  
In the absence of ratification making it possible to apply a universal jurisdiction clause to the country where a violation was committed , States may take practical measures in their domestic legislation to establish extraterritorial jurisdiction over serious crimes under international law committed outside their territory , which by their nature fall within the scope not only of domestic criminal law but also of an international punitive system which disregards the concept of frontiers .  
Those principles and norms , as set out in the Charter of the United Nations , elaborated in a number of international legal instruments and backed by declarations adopted by international conferences , proscribe the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State and the imposition of coercive economic measures as instruments of intervention in matters that are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State , without prejudice , however , to the application of preventive or enforcement measures under Chapter VII of the Charter .  
In order to be operational , however , such a global model should comprise large-scale national models that should be designed to cover domestic economy , external sector and supply-side response to external shocks such as coercive economic measures .  
Specific procedural and legal problems include identification of , and communication with , the proper domestic authorities whose consent is required before boarding a foreign ship , the inability to exercise jurisdiction over domestic vessels or nationals outside territorial waters , and the inability to exercise jurisdiction over stateless vessels .  
But for many developing country enterprises , quite the opposite may also be true : exposed to international competition , or to domestic competition from firms established with the help of FDI , they may be unable to compete .  
One result is that growing attention is being paid at the national level to the need to combine increased contestability with competition policies aimed at preventing market concentration and abuse of dominant positions , and / or with policies directly aimed at improving the competitiveness of domestic enterprises .  
Governments in all countries that have successfully closed the gap on the leading industrial economies have pursued policies aimed at directing the form and focus of competition , be it between domestic firms or from the international market-place , to achieve specific development goals .  
The ability of the domestic industries of weak economies to respond to competition is impeded by inefficiencies which are due to inappropriate technology , obsolete equipment , inadequate infrastructure and support services , and previously excessive levels of protection .  Although in due course import liberalization will have dynamic positive effects on growth and employment , in the short run there is a risk of the failure of inefficient domestic firms , with the attendant social costs if workers lose their jobs and can not shift immediately to produce static efficiency gains from more productive employment elsewhere .  
At the domestic level , we must promote higher standards of national government by strengthening our regulatory and supervisory frameworks , improving corporate governance , increasing transparency and lessening government interference in market decisions .  
They should pursue sound macroeconomic policies , strive to increase domestic savings and investment , strengthen institutional , legal , regulatory and supervisory capacities and improve economic management in the public and private sectors .  
In accordance with that objective , Mexican diplomatic and consular offices have a set of legal powers under both domestic and international law for carrying out their protective functions .  
Thanks to the prudent policy pursued by the Government and the National Bank , its domestic public debt was low and its gross foreign debt among the lowest in Central Europe .  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
It was of great importance that the concluding observations be widely published and made accessible by the States parties concerned in domestic languages and distributed to the relevant national authorities .  
In 1989 , in cooperation with the World Bank , Jordan had elaborated a comprehensive economic reform programme designed to curb inflation , reduce the growing external debt and stop the decline in the gross domestic product .  
At the national level , over the past 10 years , his Government had substantially increased domestic resources for development financing , but it continued to need external resources , both private and official , in order to sustain current growth rates .  
Its objective is twofold : ( a ) to assess how to enhance national capacities to manage private capital , both domestic and foreign , in least developed countries and ( b ) to search for feasible ways and means of facilitating private investment in support of SHD .  
Liberalization needed to be combined with sound and coherent domestic economic policies , the creation of effective judicial systems , the promotion of the rule of law and respect for the regulatory responsibility of Governments .  
A well developed financial sector is critical in stimulating private domestic savings and investment in Africa to achieve sustained economic growth and development .  
According to a survey commissioned by the Office for Rural Development in 1993 , rural women employed in agricultural activities worked an average of 12 hours and 58 minutes a day , of which a mere 4 hours were devoted to household management and domestic work .  
The second stage would focus on major structural transformations of the national economy by promoting domestic production , thereby creating further opportunities for private business and favourable conditions for sustainable economic growth .  
The Czech Republic is convinced that the necessary prerequisite for an effective anti-drug action , on the domestic and international level , is the political will of each State concerned .  
A stable macroeconomic environment when accompanied by low inflation , competitive exchange rates , manageable public debt , democratic institutions and principles of good governance was conducive to increased domestic and foreign investment .  
Following UNCTAD advisory missions to strengthen the capacity of the domestic insurance sector , a set of legal , institutional , managerial and procedural measures for follow-up has been outlined .  
Additional constraints included the small size of their domestic markets , the vulnerability of their economies to external shocks owing to excessive dependence on a narrow range of exports and the difficulty of gaining access to international capital markets .

The Rio Group noted with satisfaction that the approach to international cooperation had been balanced , realistic , innovative and global , and that the extraterritorial application of domestic laws and recourse to sanctions against States had been rejected .  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Countries at level 1 are characterized by compiling gross domestic product at current and constant prices , broken down by kind of economic activity and final expenditure .  
Until the current crisis , the high level of global financial integration had allowed economies in transition to obtain the foreign direct investment they required owing to their insufficient domestic savings .  
The Meeting recognized the potential of the manual to contribute to changing cultural , social and legal attitudes towards and perceptions of domestic violence and its victims , which might improve their treatment by the criminal justice system .  
In the case of contractual preferential rules of origin , considerable political resistance to harmonization can be expected , as such rules are the outcome of intensive negotiations that reflect the vested interests of domestic industries .  
The Honduran approach to the problem of social insecurity is based on the belief that the primary cause is the insufficient and unreliable national supply of food , either home-produced or imported , for domestic consumption .  
Globally , ODA has fallen to just 0.25 per cent of gross domestic product in 1996 the lowest level since foreign aid was institutionalized with the Marshall Plan about 50 years ago .  
The gap between the official and unofficial exchange rates continued to widen , discouraging domestic production and leading to a situation whereby foreign currency is used side by side with the national one , in both official and private transactions .  
He noted that despite global economic and financial turmoil in several regions in the world , foreign direct investment ( FDI ) had continued to grow in 1997 and early 1998 , surpassing the growth of other aggregates such as GDP , exports and domestic investment .  
The rise in social spending has encouraged public investment , which increased in 1997 to a level equivalent to 4 per cent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) , which in turn had a positive multiplier effect on other economic activities and on total employment .  
The Angolan economy continued to show signs of deep stagnation : foreign receipts from oil have been declining , public budget allocations have been revised downward and public domestic debt has increased .  
In order to encourage domestic investment and to attract foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , it was essential to have in place a stable , supportive , effective and transparent legal framework .  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
It was also apparent that prudential norms and strong supervisory capacity were required as much for facilitating efficient international intermediation of volatile capital flows as they were for an efficient domestic financial system .  
Institutional constraints normally linked to weak capital markets and inadequate regulations should be addressed in order to strengthen the confidence of investors , both domestic and foreign , and decrease the volatility of financial flows .  
Institutional constraints normally linked to weak capital markets and inadequate regulations should be addressed in order to strengthen the confidence of investors , domestic and foreign , and decrease the volatility of financial flows .  
Their gross domestic product ( GDP ) had been over 5 per cent , inflation had stood at a 50-year low and a larger proportion of the increased capital flows into the region had been made up of foreign direct investment .  
An enabling external financial environment to support domestic measures could require , inter alia , adequate and transparent supervision of volatile , short-term capital flows .  
The Committee noted that the improved economic performance of LDCs in recent years was mainly attributable to their own sound macroeconomic policy reforms , undertaken under most difficult domestic and external conditions .

Other training and reference materials in the pipeline are : a training manual for primary and secondary school teachers ; a training manual for national and local NGOs ; a handbook for parliamentarians ; a trainers guide for military peacekeepers , a training manual for the treatment of victims of domestic violence for the police ; and a handbook on human rights and constitutions .  
Such a situation would create additional pressure on developing countries , including small island developing States , to meet their growing domestic demand for fish as food on the one hand a problem likely to be aggravated by declining productivity of coastal fisheries due to coral reef degradation , as previously discussed and to increase their share of international markets on the other .  
Another alternative would be to consider the guidelines purely as providing non _ binding standards and criteria at the international level rather than legal rules , but which , once incorporated in domestic law , would be enforceable at the domestic level . 
To ensure the universality of the revised guidelines , the expert considers it necessary to conduct an in-depth comparative study of the relevant international , regional and domestic norms of States Members of the United Nations in order to reveal patterns and trends in the application of the right to restitution , compensation and rehabilitation in cases of human rights violations .  
Each State Party may consider ensuring that the onus of proof is reversed regarding the lawful origin of alleged proceeds of crime or other property liable to confiscation , to the extent that such action is consistent with the principles of its domestic law and with the nature of the judicial and other proceedings .  
For the purpose of cooperation under this article , the offences covered by this Convention shall not be considered fiscal offences or political offences105 or regarded as politically motivated , without prejudice to the constitutional limitations and the fundamental domestic law of the States Parties .  
Although the need to strengthen international economic cooperation based on the principles of international law and recognized norms had been reiterated in most intergovernmental fora , there was increasing recourse to unilateral coercive economic measures and the enactment of domestic laws with extraterritorial effects .  
In terms of national strategies , many countries had undertaken policies aimed at strengthening fiscal performance , increasing domestic savings , strengthening financial sectors by improved regulation and monitoring and greater capital requirements , and increasing macroeconomic stability .  
The financing of development was a much bigger concern than the establishment of a new international financial system or the strengthening of the existing one , for it touched on the core requirement of development , namely , financing and encompassed a host of interrelated issues , including the mobilization of domestic resources ; development cooperation and official development assistance ; and the resources generated from trade and other export services . 
The view was also expressed that international human rights instruments limited the scope of national jurisdiction by guaranteeing uniform standards of protection , whereas diplomatic protection functioned exclusively in relations between States and after domestic remedies had been exhausted .  
Second , financial aspects , recognizing that it is very difficult to rely on mobilizing domestic financial resources in very poor and populous countries where natural resources are degraded , and international cooperation will need to play a very key role .  
The Committee also recommended that efforts be intensified in order to establish a vigorous plan of increased mobilization of resources directed at the eradication of poverty , economic development , substantial reduction of debt , institution of partnership innovations , market access and trade opportunities , mobilization of domestic resources and allocation of additional resources .  
The 1952 Convention establishes a formal regulatory system which can permit the arrest of a ship to secure the satisfaction of any judgment that may eventually be pronounced because the holder of a maritime lien can not , sometimes in a matter of hours , fulfil the standard procedural requirements ( likelihood of the claim alleged , valid title , precise value of the claim and risks of delay ) under formal national or domestic regulations for his application to proceed ;  
Urges all States to enact and enforce legislation protecting girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , female genital mutilation , rape , domestic violence , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;  
Recognizes also the importance of appropriate policy responses to the challenges of globalization at the national level , in particular by pursuing sound and stable domestic policies , including , inter alia , sound macroeconomic and social policies , so as to realize the objective of the eradication of poverty ;  
No exceptional circumstance , of whatever kind , whether a state of war or threat of war , domestic political instability or any other exceptional situation may be invoked to justify infringement of these intangible rights : the right to life , the right to physical integrity , the right not to be subjected to torture or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , the right to a fair trial , the right to freedom of thought , conscience and religion , and so forth .  
Based on past experience and the changes brought about by the rapid globalization of the economy , there had been a growing convergence of policies that encouraged investment in human resources and government responsibility in creating a dynamic domestic framework in which the private sector could play its role as the driving force of industrial development .  
Obviously , however , development of the private sector was impossible without support at the public level , which should include , inter alia , demonopolization , the introduction of tax incentives , a sound legal environment and the promotion of domestic and foreign investment .  
In some countries , practical guidance provided to domestic contracting authorities advises them to consider carefully whether and under what circumstances such guarantees are required , which specific risks or loss they should cover and which type of guarantee is best suited in each case .  The ability of the project company to raise finance for the project may be jeopardized by bond requirements set at an excessive level .  
Mr . Petrella ( Argentina ) , referring to the current international economic crisis , said that the countries most affected by the crisis should understand that the promotion of growth and stability was contingent on the existence of open markets that would allow increased exports , sustained flows of investment capital , the promotion of domestic savings and the continuation of structural reforms .  
To complain about the policies and actions of individual officials and governmental bodies with regard to violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms , by petition or other appropriate means , to competent domestic judicial , administrative or legislative authorities or any other competent authority provided for by the legal system of the State , which should render their decision on the complaint without undue delay ;  
The Special Rapporteur is encouraged to note that the Government sought outside , non-governmental expertise to : ( i ) develop a coherent policy and strategy for domestic violence ; ( ii ) propose a set of legal measures ; and ( iii ) implement a framework for training local staff .  
The Special Rapporteur is encouraged to note the passage of the Domestic Violence Act of 1995 , which includes provision for : a new single protection order ; a broadening of the definition of domestic violence to include psychological abuse ; increased penalties for breaches of protection orders ; free legal aid with respect to protection orders ; and new guidelines to ensure the arrest of violent abusers and the automatic revocation of firearms licences .  
One of the main reasons for growing domestic violence , both in overt and covert forms , is in the lack of a legal and moral environment for effectively opposing it .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature and are punished by penalties consistent with their grave nature .  
Each State Party shall ensure that , subject to relevant domestic legislation of the State Party , the said legal entity may incur criminal , civil or administrative liability and is subject to effective measures taken as a result of such liability .  
They recognized that unusual and massive movements of populations , particularly in the aftermath of armed conflict in certain countries of the subregion , constituted a grave threat to domestic peace , and urged each Government to manage migratory flows more effectively and efficiently and to better control their borders .  
They also have the right freely to apply their systems of political , social , economic , cultural and religious organization and voluntarily to observe customary practices for the regulation of their domestic coexistence , provided that none of them runs counter to the fundamental rights established in this Constitution .  
In order to prepare for the high-level consideration of the topic of financing for development , it was important to focus on a number of key elements : States should begin with the mobilization of domestic resources , review the allocation of national expenditures and their fiscal priorities , look into the private sector and review their legal and administrative structures for rapid growth .  
Ms . Cardoze ( Panama ) , speaking on behalf of the Rio Group , said that the consequences for the Rio Group region of the global financial crisis which had begun during the previous year had included a decrease of two percentage points in the growth rate of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) , a decline in imports and exports , particularly of raw materials and semi-manufactured products , an increase in the current account deficit and , in some cases , a decrease in international reserves .  
To reduce the armaments of others whilst keeping one 's own intact , to reduce the obsolete while developing the state _ of _ the _ art , or even to sacrifice the security of others for one 's own security and to require other countries to scrupulously abide by treaties while giving oneself freedom of action by placing domestic laws above international law : such double standards make a mockery of international disarmament efforts and run counter to the fundamental purposes and objectives of disarmament .  
Each State Party may consider ensuring that the onus of proof is reversed regarding the lawful origin of alleged proceeds of crime or other property liable to confiscation , to the extent that such action is consistent with the principles of its domestic law and with the nature of the judicial and other proceedings .  
For the purpose of cooperation under this article , the offences covered by this Convention shall not be considered fiscal offences or political offences119 or regarded as politically motivated , without prejudice to the constitutional limitations and the fundamental domestic law of the States Parties .  
Aside from the mobilization of domestic and international financial resources , effective implementation must be based on comprehensive strategic thinking , including a clear identification of capacities and constraints at national and international levels .  
While a critical analysis of the contribution of the 20 / 20 initiative to the promotion of basic social services was urged , interested parties also underscored that the initiative leads to the combination of efforts of both donors and recipients of aid in a most visible way , matching domestic funds with an equal amount of foreign financial resources .  
Recent cases of international capital flight from developing countries , which have created tremendous strains and increased poverty , have been attributed in part to shortcomings in domestic policies and institutions , for example , but they can also be seen as symptomatic of an international financial system which fails to differentiate satisfactorily the performance of individual developing countries .  
Crucial requirements are well known and include improving the access to and quality of primary , secondary , technical and vocational education ; improving marketing arrangements for primary commodities ; land reform ; mobilization of domestic saving for infrastructure including small scale , local public works and for private investment ; and attracting foreign direct investment under conditions that ensure benefits to the receiving countries .  
For example , in advanced economies , average proportional revenue collections have not fallen at all so far ; in fact , the average proportion of gross domestic product ( GDP ) of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) countries collected as revenue continued to edge up during the 1990s . 
The main economic determinants are : the size of domestic market ; spatial distribution of natural and created resource endowments ; input prices , quality and productivity of labour ; international transport and communications costs .  
Indeed , in the future , investors will look more carefully at macro - and microeconomic policies [ 24 ] , most particularly at : high economic growth rate , the degree of exchange rate stability , level of foreign exchange reserves , general macroeconomic stability , health of domestic banking system , quality of stock market regulatory framework , quality of domestic accounting / disclosure standards and degree of investors rights protection .  
Instead of improving on the relatively weak performance in 1997 , gross domestic product ( GDP ) in Eastern Europe rose on average by just 2 per cent , less than half the rate implied by the official forecasts and nearly a percentage point lower than in 1997 ( see table 2 ) .  
For many transition economies , the scale of restructuring required by the shift from central planning to competitive markets is so large that the domestic economic , political and social institutions , which are also in a state of transition , are unable to cope with the adjustment costs , which in turn may generate large-scale resistance to reform ( the study of Romania in the current Survey provides a telling example of this ) .  
Sudden inflows and equally sudden outflows of foreign capital create considerable difficulties for the management of domestic monetary policy ; 27 the resulting uncertainty and higher risks implied by financial volatility lead to caution on the part of Governments ( which tend to set interest rates higher than they might otherwise have been ) and of private business ( faced with increased costs of capital and increased uncertainty over future demand ) .  
Gravely concerned at the increasing activities of transnational criminal organizations and others that profit from international trafficking in women and children without regard to dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards ,  
To enact and , where necessary , reinforce or amend penal , civil , labour and administrative sanctions in domestic legislation to punish and redress the wrongs done to women and girls subjected to any form of violence , whether in the home , the workplace , the community or society , in custody or in situations of armed conflict , and to ensure that they conform with relevant international human rights instruments and humanitarian law ;  
Without prejudice to articles ( 14 and 19 ) of this Convention , ensure that administrative , regulatory , law enforcement and other authorities dedicated to combating money-laundering ( including , where appropriate under domestic law , judicial authorities ) have the ability to cooperate and exchange information at the national and international levels [ within the conditions prescribed by its domestic legislation1 ] .  
Gravely concerned at the increasing activities of transnational criminal organizations and others that profit from international trafficking in women and children without regard to dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards ,  
To enact and , where necessary , reinforce or amend penal , civil , labour and administrative sanctions in domestic legislation to punish and redress the wrongs done to women and girls subjected to any form of violence , whether in the home , the workplace , the community or society , in custody or in situations of armed conflict , and to ensure that they conform with relevant international human rights instruments and humanitarian law ;  
The delegation of Kuwait is of the view that both options of paragraph 2 ( c ) are appropriate because the question of the legal rules governing evidence presented before the court and the element of intent should be reserved for domestic laws , and such laws state that the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty .  
This will lead to the design of policy packages aimed at increasing physical and human capacities , taking into account the administrative requirements of such packages , sustainability concerns related to expanded production , the social and human context of polices related to international trade , and complementary measures .  The generation and optimal use of domestic finance for commodity-based development will also be part of these packages .  
Under the overall objective of assisting developing countries to address emerging challenges and persistent problems , the objective of this project is to strengthen the capacity of research institutions in developing countries to conduct development policy analysis , particularly in the examination of changes in domestic economic conditions and of regional and international developments that have a bearing on them .  
Joining forces was perceived to imply not only developing innovative measures for international cooperation , but also strengthening domestic legal and criminal justice systems by adopting appropriate legislative and administrative measures and upgrading the skills of criminal justice personnel .  
Without prejudice to articles [ 14 and 19 ] of this Convention , ensure that administrative , regulatory , law enforcement and other authorities dedicated to combating money-laundering ( including , where appropriate under domestic law , judicial authorities ) have the ability to cooperate and exchange information at the national and international levels [ within the conditions prescribed by its domestic legislation20 ] .  
Many participants informed the Commission about their national laws and practical initiatives aimed at preventing crime , such as programmes to prevent domestic violence and sexual and violent crimes , as well as organized and transnational crime , and corruption .  
The Committee is concerned that there is currently before Congress a bill to decriminalize domestic violence at both the civil and criminal level , passing responsibility for dealing with these human rights violations to an administrative court .  
In his seventh report , in response to various suggestions for dealing with the question of liability by giving greater weight to domestic or private law remedies , Barboza proposed that civil liability should be primary and State liability should be residual . 82 In this regard , State liability would only replace civil liability if the private person who is liable can not fully compensate the harm or if that person can not be identified or located . 
In fulfilling its role as a catalyst of change , EBRD encourages co-financing and foreign direct investment from the private and public sectors , helps to mobilize domestic capital and provides technical cooperation in relevant areas .  
The courts in a number of civil law States had ruled that any such agreement must be subject to domestic administrative law , and one of the practical consequences of that ruling was that Governments were unwilling to agree to submit disputes to arbitration , since the law itself provided specific remedies , penalties and rights .  
As a State Party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child , Malaysia was committed to improving the situation of children at the domestic level , and for that purpose had promulgated laws and formulated programmes , such as the seventh Malaysia plan , designed to further improve the education system , inculcate good values among children and parents and create a society in which care and love for children were given strong emphasis .  
For the purposes of extradition under this article , the offences established in articles 3 ( [ Criminalization of ] participation in an [ organized criminal group ] ) , 4 ( Money-laundering ) , and 4 ter ( Measures against corruption ) of this Convention shall not be considered fiscal offences or political offences or regarded as politically motivated , without prejudice to the constitutional principles and basic concepts of the domestic legal systems of States Parties .  
Without prejudice to articles [ 14 and 19 ] of this Convention , ensure that administrative , regulatory , law enforcement and other authorities dedicated to combating money-laundering ( including , where appropriate under domestic law , judicial authorities ) have the ability to cooperate and exchange information at the national and international levels [ within the conditions prescribed by its domestic legislation60 ] .  
For the purpose of cooperation under this article , the offences covered by this Convention shall not be considered fiscal offences or political offences131 or regarded as politically motivated , without prejudice to the constitutional limitations and the fundamental domestic law of the States Parties .  
Internal enabling environment : policy framework incentives for domestic private savings , equitable tax systems ( development and enforcement of ) , macroeconomic policies , disincentives to corruption ; good governance ; transparency ; effective regulatory and supervisory framework for the financial sector ; banking infrastructure , pension funds ; corporate governance ; internationally accepted accounting standards , and a sound legal system ( land and property rights ) ;  
Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) : need to spread FDI more widely and to diversify private capital flows in order to reduce country / sector concentration , strengthened contribution of FDI for domestic capacity-building and national development goals , role of South-South flows , reasons for marginalization of countries with a sound investment environment ;  
Use of ODA for reinforcing developing countries potential for better access to global markets , and poverty eradication , leveraging larger levels of domestic or foreign private capital ;  
There is also a steady increase in the number of developing country member States reporting that suitable domestic conditions exist for the management and operationalization of TCDC programmes , namely , an effective domestic focal point mechanism ; elucidation of a clear national policy for TCDC ; and an established approach to funding TCDC activities .  
In many countries , particularly those of the British Commonwealth , exclusive use and occupancy of land from time immemorial gives rise to aboriginal title , a title that is good against all but the Sovereign , that is , the Government of the State . 22 / Where aboriginal title is recognized , indigenous peoples have at least some legal right that can be asserted in the domestic legal system .  
There is also a steady increase in the number of developing country member States reporting that suitable domestic conditions exist for the management and operationalization of TCDC programmes , namely , an effective domestic focal point mechanism ; elucidation of a clear national policy for TCDC ; and an established approach to funding TCDC activities .  
Integrate inland water transport within intermodal transport systems to provide door-to-door services for the movement of domestic and international traffic , thereby responding to market demand for convenient and competitive service while optimizing the economic , financial , environmental and social benefits that can be derived from each mode in the entire transport chain ;  
The Ministers stressed the critical role of capital markets in raising the level of domestic savings , attracting foreign private investment , and stemming and reversing capital flight .  
It was disturbing that the gap between the poor and the rich in the world was increasing while official development assistance ( ODA ) measured as a percentage of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) of the developed countries had just reached its lowest level in 50 years .  
In the view of several Ministers , efforts were necessary to stabilize State revenue by means of a fair system of taxation and efficient tax administration , and to mobilize more domestic capital through an effective private sector financial system subject to adequate bank supervision .  
Progress in domestic economic reforms , though varying from country to country , and the improved international environment , notably less unfavourable commodity prices and more stable global financial markets , have been instrumental in improving the outlook .  
There are various reasons for this : the lagged growth cycle in many emerging market economies ; the former high levels of interest rates in some of these countries , especially in real terms ; the greater , though still limited , degree of independence gained for monetary policy in the many countries that have embraced floating exchange-rate regimes ; and the improved international and domestic financial conditions in many countries . 
Whatever the reasoning followed , the dominant viewpoint - as reflected , in general , in the specialized literature and in State administrative decisions , as well as in the decisions of the domestic courts - asserts that treaties involving indigenous peoples are basically a domestic issue , to be construed , eventually implemented and adjudicated via existing internal mechanisms , such as the courts and federal ( and even local ) authorities .  
However , to legitimize beyond any doubt the ways and means used to take issues that originally belonged to the realm of international law away from it and to justify making them subject solely to domestic legislation unilaterally passed by the States and adjudicated by domestic non-indigenous courts , States should produce unassailable proof that the indigenous peoples in question have expressly and of their own free will renounced their sovereign attributes .  
Jurists ( with their conceptual elaborations ) , domestic laws ( with their imperativeness both in the metropolis and in the colonies ) , the judiciary ( subject to the rule of [ non-indigenous ] law ) , one-sided international law ( its enforcement assured by military means ) and international tribunals ( on the basis of existing international law ) were all present to validate juridically the organized plunder at the various stages of the colonial enterprise .  
Particularly in the light of the present poor short-term prospects for the world economy , it is of interest to explore whether the use of international measures , rather than reliance purely on domestic action , might have achieved a more positive outcome for the countries concerned and , at the same time , might have boosted global economic growth . 
It is now increasingly recognized that the response to crises has to address the domestic social consequences of any economic measures that are adopted and should not be restricted to restoring macroeconomic stability and international financial confidence .  
Other women-based policies since put in place deal with the elimination of female genital mutilation ; adolescent health ; legal reforms to eliminate domestic violence and to raise the minimum age for marriage to 18 years ; and the development of a strategic framework for the implementation of adolescent reproductive health , among others .  
The country 's narrow economic base , with tourism and fisheries contributing about 40 per cent of the gross domestic product , leaves the country excessively vulnerable to external shocks .  
The Directors stressed that the successful implementation of the financial programme , including the clearance of external and domestic arrears , would hinge crucially on a sustained increase in budget revenue and the timely implementation of agreed measures .  
As mentioned above , in most situations of realizing human rights in a particular country , there is so much waste and inefficient use of domestic resources that substantial progress can be made in improving the realization of most human rights even within the existing resources , which can be augmented by international cooperation for which a call has been given explicitly in the Declaration on the Right to Development .  
With this in mind , educational and training activities should be strengthened and supported by bilateral and multilateral programmes adapted to domestic needs , which should also consider the strenghthening of such as the regional training centres for space science and technology education established with the assistance of the United Nations .  
In short , what we should seek is the virtuous integration of developing countries into a more receptive global system , one which will help them to grow in a steady and socially harmonious way , increasing domestic savings and productivity , diversifying their supply capability , capturing an increasing share of the value-added chain , and incorporating technology .  There can be no denying that a new order of sorts is gradually taking shape .  
Special attention needs to be given to improving the understanding of the interdependence of foreign direct investment , domestic investment , technological change and technology flows , the policies and practices of multinational firms and the evolution of corporate governance .  
Despite the declining share of income from the agricultural sector in their gross domestic product ( GDP ) , the sector remained essential for rural development , employment creation , food security and foreign exchange earnings in many developing countries , in particular the least developed countries ( LDCs ) .  
For developing countries to achieve the best results from domestic and international agricultural liberalization , for example , they needed to have a stable macroeconomic environment and a basic level of infrastructure ( e.g . transport , storage , communications and finance ) in place .  
Regarding market price support measures , for instance , in several developing countries the total current AMS , the difference between the administered price and the nominally fixed external reference price ( ERP ) , in domestic currency terms had exceeded its bound level as a result of the high rate of inflation experienced by them in the years since the base period ( 1986-1988 ) .  
Others claimed that non-trade concerns of developing countries should be distinguished form those of developed countries , whose interests seemed to be focused on a justification of their continuing use of massive subsidies to the domestic agricultural sector .  
The increased political and financial support to UPE is a promising sign of greater international and domestic attention to creating a basis for effective recognition of the right to education .  
A large number of non-governmental organizations - international , foreign and domestic - work in Uganda in areas related to the right to education ( such as social development , literacy , special education , gender , human rights ) but few explicitly address that right , thus exacerbating the paucity of conceptual and analytical work necessary for its promotion and protection .  
While the previous decades left a negative heritage , as is summarized below , the political and financial commitment to investment in education that led to UPE in 1997 promises to remedy the inherited dissociation between political and economic governance and open the way towards defining the right to education within Ugandas specific international and domestic environment .  
However , the results in the field fell far short of the continents hopes and aspirations : for instance , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) of sub-Saharan Africa had been decreasing at a rate of 0.8 per cent each year for the past 20 years and both official development assistance and private capital flows to African countries had proved extremely disappointing .  
This constitutes an adverse structural shift in the economy , though one which still could be reversed through sustained export growth driven by a combination of domestic and foreign investment and further industrial and agricultural production diversification .  
Effective integration into international capital markets requires a deepening of domestic capital markets by increasing domestic savings and developing a strong domestic institutional investor base on the one hand , and by strengthening the prudential supervision of financial markets , together with sound and efficient banking systems , on the other .  
Resulting exchange rate appreciation and abrupt compensatory movements in fiscal and monetary policies that accentuate the cyclical movements of foreign capital can entail high development costs , especially if domestic financial systems are weak and not well regulated and supervised .  
There needs to be a deepening of domestic capital markets , within an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework and with the development of a strong domestic institutional investor base .  
An indigenous representative from Manipur in India said that recent developments in India indicated that existing domestic and international mechanisms to promote and protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous peoples , including children , and to conserve vital wetlands and sensitive eco-zones of spiritual value had failed to fulfil their objectives , despite strong efforts by the indigenous peoples in Manipur to protect their human rights .  
Although this represents a slight increase over the previous year , FDI continues to be hampered by some characteristics shared by most of the LDCs , such as adverse climatic conditions , small domestic markets , export vulnerability , limited transport and communications infrastructure , insufficient domestic investment and lack of a skilled labour force , as well as lack of information on profitable business opportunities ( box 2 ) .  
Additionally , we would like to reiterate our suggestion contained in the previous written submission that the Working Group on Communications at its first meeting would be requested to ensure that 1503 submissions meet the following preconditions : ( a ) domestic remedies have been exhausted ; ( b ) the matter under consideration is demonstrably a gross and reliably attested violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms ; ( c ) the submissions are clearly devoid of politicization .  
Except for Angola , Burundi , the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Djibouti , Haiti , Rwanda and Sierra Leone , all of the least developed countries for which data are available recorded , on average , positive growth in real gross domestic product ( GDP ) in the period 19901997 , although there were wide variations in country performance in annual growth rates over the period .  
The sustainability of the recent growth performance of the least developed countries would also depend on increasing the level of gross domestic saving and gross domestic investment , the supply of critical skills and consolidation of political and macroeconomic stability .  
A joint study was entitled Strengthening the participation of developing countries in world trade and the multilateral trading system was carried out in 1996 , which included sections on improving market access in commercial services and improving the domestic supply response .  
Misalignments of exchange rates and trade imbalances owing to domestic economic policies that were introduced without concern for their impact on the global economy are generally acknowledged to be a major source of protectionist pressures which manifest themselves both in unilateral national measures and in tensions threatening the rules of the multilateral trade regime .  
In this regard , attention was drawn to the relevant international conventions to which Kuwait had acceded ; 8 the inclusion in its bilateral agreements in the field of civil aviation of provisions relating to the safety of aviation ; its support for international and regional efforts to counter terrorism ; and its adoption of a series of practical and executive measures to protect its domestic security .  
Through renewed support for IDDA , efforts must be intensified to reduce the gap between those with knowledge and skills and those without , as well as to facilitate foreign and domestic private sector investment in the value chain of primary products and other manufacturing activities in order to address the emerging problems of the technology gap , urban unemployment and rural poverty .  
The critical issue to be put on the development agenda for Africa is why macroeconomic reforms in Africa have not generated the expected microeconomic responses and have not promoted significant changes in technological capability , improvements in factory-wide skill levels , higher productivity , better manufactured export performance and greater value added in the domestic economies .  These are the elements that determine a countrys or regions successful integration into the global economy .  
Singapore drew attention to a recent penal provision enhancing penalties for offences committed against foreign domestic workers by employers or members of the household of employers . 16 The Philippines indicated that its comprehensive legislation on migrant workers , including protective provisions for such workers and penalties for abuses , such as illegal recruitment , and providing for information dissemination and shared information systems for governmental agencies , was being accessed . 
Growth slowed in the majority of African countries and , at 2.6 per cent in 1998 , average gross domestic product for all of Africa fell far short of the eight per cent annual growth rate envisioned by the World Bank as the level capable of significantly reducing poverty levels on the continent .  
The dynamic of todays world is an unavoidable challenge demanding not only domestic democratic cooperation , but also negotiations that will raise countries to a level of development at which they can work with other regional and multilateral partners .  
They also stressed the importance of sound domestic policies , private capital flows and appropriate functioning of markets , as well as a favourable and open international economic environment , to overcome this crisis and reverse the marginalization of some developing countries , in particular the least developed ones .  
The annual summary of the economic and social situation in Africa submitted this year to the Economic and Social Council put the figure for gross domestic product growth in 1998 at 3.3 per cent , up from 2.9 per cent in 1997 , the highest growth rate of any region in the world ; it reported that the 33 African least developed countries increased their growth rate from 2.4 per cent in 1997 to 4.1 per cent in 1998 . 
For the purpose of investigating the crimes [ covered by this Convention ] [ established in articles . . . of this Convention ] , if permitted by the basic principles of domestic legal systems , States Parties shall take appropriate measures , when necessary , to permit their competent authorities to use special investigative techniques such as controlled delivery and electronic surveillance within their own territories .  
A favourable and enabling investment climate which mobilizes FDI and domestic savings and channels them into productive investments also requires that the suppliers of capital have reliable , transparent and comparable financial information .  
This approach can now be embedded into substantially improved policy conditions and a strengthened policy framework resulting from structural adjustment , trade and investment liberalization : exchange rates are now aligned with markets , quantitative import restrictions widely removed , investment policies largely liberalized , and domestic policies considerably strengthened .  Economic integration can build on this progress and deepen the process further .  
C In cooperation with other international and regional institutions , undertake technical assistance programmes on capital market development and other specific actions to strengthen the domestic financial infrastructure , with a view to assisting developing countries to mobilize stable sources of finance ;  
Three in particular stand out : the return to stability and growth has not been the result of a unique formula ; the severe economic and social consequences of the crisis have highlighted the need to strengthen institutional structures at the international and national levels ; and corrective domestic policies have to be complemented by resolute international support measures .  
To deal with the volatility of capital flows , developing countries needed to deepen domestic capital markets , institute an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework and develop a strong domestic institutional investor base .  
Each State Party shall , within its possibilities and under the conditions prescribed by its domestic law , take the necessary measures to allow for the appropriate use of special investigative techniques , in particular controlled delivery , electronic or other forms of surveillance , and undercover operations ( by its competent authorities in its territory ) for the purpose of effectively combating organized crime . 
Gravely concerned by the increasing activities of transnational organized criminal groups and others that profit from smuggling of and trafficking in human beings , especially women and children , without regard to dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards ;  
They were : the timely adjustment of domestic policies in developing countries ; the opening up of developed countries commodity markets and the provision of timely , relevant and affordable information and technology by those countries to commodity-dependent developing countries ; and a global effort to reduce trade and non-trade barriers in order to make the playing field level for all parties .  
Without prejudice to articles [ 14 and 19 ] of this Convention , ensure that administrative , regulatory , law enforcement and other authorities dedicated to combating money-laundering ( including , where appropriate under domestic law , judicial authorities ) have the ability to cooperate and exchange information at the national and international levels [ within the conditions prescribed by its domestic legislation15 ] .  
Recognizing the continuing efforts of debtor countries , despite the great social cost involved , to pursue economic reform , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes aimed at achieving stability , raising domestic savings and investments , reducing inflation , improving economic efficiency and addressing the social aspects of development , including the eradication of poverty as well as the development of social safety nets for the vulnerable and poorer strata of their populations ,  
Also stresses the importance of additional debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Globalisation through free trade and open investment regimes can improve the overall performance of developing countries economies provided domestic policies are enhanced by strengthening competition on domestic markets , by opening up new market opportunities abroad for developing countries exports and by increasing the financial resources available for investment in physical capital and intangible assets , including indispensable public goods . 
The progressive integration of developing countries into the multilateral trading system will depend not only on the success of their domestic reforms and on the competitiveness of their economies , but also on the capacity of this system to appropriately address and take into account the specific economic and social capacities and constraints of these countries and , in particular , of the least developed among them .  
Stability and efficiency of the national as well as regional financial markets , increased domestic savings and optimal allocation of resources are a sound basis for sustainable economic growth .  
the promotion of effective prudential supervision as well as the promotion of norms on capital flow transparency so as to consolidate domestic financial sectors in developing countries and to prevent global systemic crises ;  
Analytical work should be carried out on the establishment of a legal and regulatory framework conducive to the development of the private sector and favourable to FDI and to domestic investment and the development of local expertise as well as regional networks .  
Norwegian support of private sector development in developing countries was aimed at increasing income for individuals , providing jobs for poor groups , and raising tax revenues so as to create the necessary economic base for a rise in domestic investment .  
The representative of the Republic of Korea said that the development of LDCs had been constrained by shortcomings in the physical infrastructure and human resource development , low levels of domestic resources , and poor performance in the agricultural sector .  
The risks involved for lenders included ( a ) the difficulty in forecasting traffic and determining what amount of tolls users would be prepared to pay ; ( b ) the fact that users usually paid in domestic currency , so that foreign investors faced a currency mismatch between their investment and their cash-flow return ; and ( c ) the risk that municipalities would change the tolls to please their constituency , in particular before elections .  
In the light of the poor prospects for the internal mobilization of adequate development resources , through domestic savings and the production of adequate exportable surpluses , official development assistance ( ODA ) flows continue to be of critical importance in sustaining growth and development in LDCs .  
Secondly , debtor Governments and international institutions could agree on a multi-year fiscal scenario that addressed , inter alia , macroeconomic stability consistent with non-inflationary financing ; domestic rates of taxation consistent with rapid growth ; and adequate financing for core public goods , including education , public health and basic infrastructure .  
Along with domestic efforts , the international environment must also be improved , as it could have a direct impact on developing countries , which were fragile and especially vulnerable to external blows .  
Core elements of a new poverty eradication strategy should include a broadly based understanding of the mechanisms of sustainable poverty reduction ; the selection of those public interventions that would have the largest impact on the poor and reduce their vulnerability by reducing income volatility resulting from global and domestic shocks and natural disasters ; and the establishment of outcome indicators .  
Further urges all States to enact and enforce legislation to protect girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , female genital mutilation , rape , domestic violence , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;  
In the light of the poor prospects for the internal mobilization of adequate development resources , through domestic savings and the production of adequate exportable surpluses , official development assistance ( ODA ) flows continue to be of critical importance in sustaining growth and development in LDCs .  
The settlement of the Saharan problem would be beneficial not only to the fraternal Saharan and Moroccan peoples but also to all the peoples of the region wishing to live in the Maghreb , to the attainment of domestic peace , to a unified , stable and prosperous Maghreb truly able to solve the countless complex problems arising in a world embarked on globalization .  
Further recognizing the continuing need for the international community to extend technical and other support , including , inter alia , enhanced official development assistance , investment guarantees , debt-for-industrial-development swaps and enhanced market access to enable the continent to leverage domestic and international resources and investment to take advantage of the increasing role of the private sector ,  
Recognizes the importance of adopting appropriate policy responses to the challenges of globalization at the national level , in particular by pursuing sound and stable domestic policies , including sound macroeconomic and social policies , in order to realize the objective of eradicating poverty ;  
Each State Party , in accordance with its domestic legal principles , shall take the necessary measures to enable a legal entity located in its territory or organized under its laws to be held liable when a person responsible for the management or control of that legal entity has , in that capacity , committed an offence set forth in article 2 .  Such liability may be criminal , civil or administrative .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
In order to cope with global challenges , there was a need for a range of measures , such as international cooperation and partnership to reform the international financial architecture , including early warning systems and the introduction of responsible domestic policies , good corporate governance and efficient and transparent financial sectors . 
Besides sound macroeconomic fundamentals , a strong domestic financial and banking system with adequate supervisory and regulatory mechanisms , transparency and good governance were extremely important in order to guard against vulnerability to shifts in market sentiment and to contagion effects from policy weaknesses in other countries . 
Among the obstacles faced by developing countries were the current lack of infrastructure in the domestic and global economies and the instability of capital markets , the fall in the price of raw materials , debt burdens , lack of investment , uncontrolled exchange rates and social resistance .  
Without prejudice to articles [ 14 and 19 ] of this Convention , ensure that administrative , regulatory , law enforcement and other authorities dedicated to combating money-laundering ( including , where appropriate under domestic law , judicial authorities ) have the ability to cooperate and exchange information at the national and international levels [ within the conditions prescribed by its domestic legislation57 ] .  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including adequate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
Considering the content of the subject matter , the emergence of extreme poverty was examined from various angles taking into account both the domestic and international dimensions of the problem and the economic , political and social factors contributing to it .  
Expansionary fiscal and monetary policies large government deficits to stimulate aggregate demand , or low interest rates to encourage domestic investment can no longer be used because of an overwhelming fear that such measures could lead to speculative capital flight and a run on the national currency .  
Several developed countries , too , have operated domestic &amp; lt ; set aside = programmes to reduce productive capacity for particular farm products in market surplus ; while in cases of chronic overcapacity , developed country Governments , have on occasion , encouraged the major firms involved to reach informal arrangements to reduce capacity .  
Further urges all States to enact and enforce legislation to protect girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , female genital mutilation , rape , domestic violence , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;  
Some are prohibited ( for exports and for domestic , rather than imported , inputs ) ; others are actionable ( they can be punished subject to proof of injury ) ; and three are permissible ( all heavily utilized in the North Atlantic ) .  
Under this criterion , the contracting authority may take into account the potential for social and economic development offered by the bidders , including benefits to underprivileged groups of persons and businesses , domestic investment or other business activity , the encouragement of employment , the reservation of certain production for domestic suppliers , the transfer of technology and the development of managerial , scientific and operational skills ;  
The EU stresses its concern at the use of diamonds , gold and other resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to fund military operations in the region , and calls on all the parties to ensure that all commercial dealings of this nature are legal under the relevant domestic and international law , transparent , consistent with States ' arrangements with the international financing institutions , and benefit the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and not private individuals .  
Notes the importance of providing adequate resources for debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
The Forum underscored the need for implementation of strategies in terms of investment , mobilization of domestic and international resources and in the case of developing countries , with special attention to least developed countries and developing countries with low forest cover appropriate financial mechanisms and / or measures including support through official development assistance ( ODA ) .  
Public official shall be understood by reference to the definition of public official in the domestic law of the State in which the person in question performs that function and as applied in its criminal law and shall include , but not be limited to , any judicial official , juror or lay judge , police official , border control or customs official , investigator , prosecutor or other official with law enforcement responsibilities in the State concerned .  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including appropriate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
Adequate and timely information on the macroeconomic situation in different parts of the world was essential for early warning efforts , and sound macroeconomic policies to strengthen institutional capacity and regulatory frameworks , as well as domestic banking systems , were also essential .  
Mr . Robertson ( New Zealand ) said that his delegation was committed to joining in the efforts to address the issues raised in the wake of the recent international financial crisis , namely , how to address stability in financial markets , how to find appropriate domestic and international policies to meet developmental challenges and how to secure greater coherence in the international financial and development system .  
Export subsidies should be outlawed , domestic producer subsidies reduced , access under tariff quotas increased , tariff escalation on processed agricultural products removed , and the level and the dispersion of bound tariffs on agricultural imports reduced .  
Each State Party , in accordance with its domestic legal principles , shall take the necessary measures to enable a legal entity located in its territory or organized under its laws to be held liable when a person responsible for the management or control of that legal entity has , in that capacity , committed an offence set forth in article 2 .  Such liability may be criminal , civil or administrative .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Recognizing the continuing efforts of debtor countries , despite the great social cost involved , to pursue economic reform , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes aimed at achieving stability , raising domestic savings and investments , reducing inflation , improving economic efficiency and addressing the social aspects of development , including the eradication of poverty as well as the development of social safety nets for the vulnerable and poorer strata of their populations ,  
Also stresses the importance of additional debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Notes the importance of providing adequate resources for debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
In the strict sense outlined above , the rule of law does not exist as a crime control mechanism at the international level . 3 There is no international legislation that creates conventional offences and criminal procedures applicable to individuals in the same sense as domestic criminal laws do .  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including adequate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
Stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , inter alia , through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including appropriate institutional arrangements in the countries of both origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
Further recognizing the continuing need for the international community to extend technical and other support , including , inter alia , enhanced official development assistance , investment guarantees , debt-for-industrial-development swaps and enhanced market access to enable the continent to leverage domestic and international resources and investment to take advantage of the increasing role of the private sector ,  
Other delegations expressed concern that dealing with possession was beyond the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee or that simple possession offences might not be treated as criminal offences ( as opposed to administrative or regulatory offences ) in domestic law .  
The total cost of crime to communities ( in terms of criminal justice , lost property , shattered lives and private security ) , measured as a proportion of gross domestic product , is several times greater in developing countries than in developed countries .  
. . .  For the purpose of cooperation among States Parties to this Protocol , including , in particular , cooperation under article 9 of this Protocol , offences established in accordance with article 5 , paragraph 1 , of this Protocol shall not be considered fiscal offences or regarded as politically motivated , without prejudice to the constitutional limitations and the fundamental domestic laws of the States Parties . 16 .

Without prejudice to articles [ 14 and 19 ] of this Convention , ensure that administrative , regulatory , law enforcement and other authorities dedicated to combating money-laundering ( including , where appropriate under domestic law , judicial authorities ) have the ability to cooperate and exchange information at the national and international levels [ within the conditions prescribed by its domestic legislation57 ] .  
The rationale behind the permanent International Criminal Court agreed to in Rome , designed to be complementary to the domestic legal systems of States parties , is to ensure that individual perpetrators do not escape criminal justice where the State is unwilling or unable to prosecute .  
Commission resolution 1997 / 50 spells out the revised mandate of the Group , which is to investigate cases of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily , provided that no final decision has been taken in such cases by local courts in conformity with domestic law , with the standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with the relevant international instruments accepted by the States concerned .  
Internal enabling environment : policy framework incentives for domestic private savings , equitable tax systems ( development and enforcement of ) , macroeconomic policies , disincentives to corruption ; good governance ; transparency ; effective regulatory and supervisory framework for the financial sector ; banking infrastructure , pension funds ; corporate governance ; internationally accepted accounting standards , and a sound legal system ( land and property rights ) ;  
Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) : need to spread FDI more widely and to diversify private capital flows in order to reduce country sector concentration , strengthened contribution of FDI for domestic capacity-building and national development goals , role of South-South flows , reasons for marginalization of countries with a sound investment environment ;  
Use of ODA for reinforcing developing countries potential for better access to global markets , and poverty eradication , leveraging larger levels of domestic or foreign private capital ;  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature and are punished by penalties consistent with their grave nature .

At the domestic level , there is a particular responsibility to maintain a constant balance between fiscal austerity measures and the need to find the resources required to fund social policies , while not ignoring other issues , especially the lack of fiscal discipline and macroeconomic stability , inadequate social policies and difficulties in broadening the participation of the various sectors of society .  
In order to meet the requirements of domestic resource mobilization to strengthen the fragile economies in Africa and reduce poverty there , current levels of external funding sources , such as official development assistance and foreign direct investment , need to be increased .  
Fifty per cent of Latin American and Caribbean women have suffered some kind of domestic violence ; fewer than 50 per cent of births in the Central American and Andean area countries are attended by trained personnel ; maternal mortality rates remain high within the region , pointing to marked social , economic and gender inequalities that persist within the region .  
We urge all domestic , regional and international institutions to factor international environmental concerns into mainstream decision-making regarding agriculture and industrial production , trade , economics , transportation and all other economic , social and developmental fields .  
The draft resolution would also reiterate its invitation to Governments to submit comments and observations on the draft articles on the prevention of transboundary damage from hazardous activities under the topic of international liability for injurious consequences arising out of acts not prohibited by international law , and on national legislation , decisions of domestic courts and State practice relevant to diplomatic protection .  
Island States must elaborate suitable national and regional sustainable development strategies and create domestic political , economic , social , environmental and legal conditions that promote the implementation of these strategies .  
Protect the health of women workers in all sectors , including agricultural and domestic household workers , through effective environmental and occupational health policies for gender-sensitive work environments , free from sexual harassment and discrimination , which are safe and ergonomically designed to prevent occupational hazards ;  
Innovative and new approaches for financing development of sustainable energy , including renewable sources of energy is required and essential while continuing to pursue efforts to increase official development assistance , ensure continued replenishment of the Global Environmental Facility and encourage domestic and foreign private investments .  
For many developing countries , human , technical and financial resources are still not adequate , imposing severe restraints on their domestic capacity to meet the requirements of developing and using sustainable energy systems .  
Developing the capacity to export is particularly crucial in light of the fast expansion of international trade and the limited size of the domestic market of many developing countries .  
The Committee recommends that the State party accord equal treatment to both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights in terms of their domestic legal status and that if measures are taken to incorporate civil and political rights treaty obligations consideration be given to similar measures in relation to economic , social and cultural rights .  
Many participants informed the Commission about their national laws and practical initiatives aimed at preventing crime , such as programmes to prevent domestic violence and sexual and violent crimes , as well as organized and transnational crime , and corruption .  
Joining forces was perceived to imply not only developing innovative measures for international cooperation , but also strengthening domestic legal and criminal justice systems by adopting appropriate legislative and administrative measures and upgrading the skills of criminal justice personnel .  
The services provided are the usual postal services for private or official delegation mailings , including parcel post , air mail , registered and insured mail , international and domestic money orders , information about postage rates and regulations concerning entry or dispatch of parcels to and from various countries .  
Calls upon all countries to develop economic policies that promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
These divergencies in terms and underlying concepts demonstrate the need for a consistent and comprehensive advocacy for the human rights approach to education so as to integrate human rights into the existing domestic educational policies and laws as well as into international strategies and monitoring mechanisms .  
AAPSO remains concerned about the impunity of international financial institutions , which are not held accountable for the negative impact of their policies on domestic economic and social conditions .  
The Special Rapporteur attended the seventh session of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice on 22 and 23 April 1998 and made a statement on 22 April 1998 , in which he said that crime prevention and bribery in international commercial transactions required the cooperation not only of the international community but the political will of Governments to organize their domestic systems of justice to meet the challenges . 
Where backward linkages between tourism and other sectors of the economy are weak or absent , income and employment multipliers from tourism are lower because the potential stimulus to indirect spending is dissipated by increased imports rather than domestic production , as happens with many small island developing States .  
The low gross domestic product ( GDP ) , which was essentially equivalent to that of 1958 , although the population had tripled in size since that time , the annual demographic growth rate having risen from 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent ;  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening institutional capacities and regulatory frameworks , especially the regulatory and supervisory systems of the domestic financial and banking sectors ;  
Emphasizes that the opening of the capital account must be carried out in an orderly , gradual and well-sequenced manner , keeping its pace in line with the strengthening of the ability of countries to sustain its consequences , underscores the crucial importance in this regard of solid domestic financial systems and of an effective prudential framework , and invites the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank and relevant international regulatory bodies to contribute to this process ;  
Emphasizing the necessity for the developing countries , in particular African countries and least developed countries , for a domestic industrial transformation of their commodity production with a view to enhancing productivity and stabilizing and increasing their export earnings , thus promoting the sustainable economic growth of developing countries in their integration into the global economy ,  
Pollution of marine and coastal areas from land-based sources of pollution is a major issue for small island developing States ; the pollution is largely from domestic sewage , industrial effluents and agricultural run-off ; in a few larger islands ( for example , Jamaica and some Melanesian countries ) , pollution from mining effluent is also a cause for concern ;  
Enhancing the capability of small island developing States to ( i ) assess and monitor fish catch and the processing and marketing of fish by foreign and domestic fishing companies ; ( ii ) develop a legal framework for sustainable fisheries activities ; and ( iii ) develop management plans and policies for assessing , monitoring and exploiting both the living and non-living resources in the EEZ ;  
In the same resolution , the Council recognized the importance of enhancing international cooperation in the enforcement of domestic and international environmental criminal laws , of promoting operational activities in that area and of protecting the environment not only at the national level but also at the international level .  
The discussion contained in this section is illustrative of different options that have been used in domestic legislative measures to set up a regulatory framework for privately financed infrastructure projects , but the Guide does not thereby advocate the establishment of any particular model or administrative structure .  
Noting that the ongoing international financial crisis is adding further burdens to the external debt problems of many developing countries and that a number of developing countries have continued to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion , despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Each State Party may consider ensuring that the onus of proof is reversed regarding the lawful origin of alleged proceeds of crime or other property liable to confiscation , to the extent that such action is consistent with the principles of its domestic law and with the nature of the judicial and other proceedings .  
For the purpose of cooperation under this article , the offences covered by this Convention shall not be considered fiscal offences or political offences 102 ] or regarded as politically motivated , without prejudice to the constitutional limitations and the fundamental domestic law of the States Parties .  
Reaffirms the necessity for humanitarian personnel and United Nations personnel to be properly informed , inter alia , by their sponsoring organizations of the scope of their activities and the standards that they are required to meet , including those contained in relevant domestic and international law , and suitably trained so as to enhance their security and effectiveness in accomplishing their functions ;  
With regard to the laws against discrimination , the Minister stated that it was critical that refugees be specifically regulated under domestic law rather than treated as ordinary aliens , and that , whilst general discrimination was largely addressed , particular forms of discrimination should be rendered unlawful i.e.racist and xenophobic offences as well as discrimination in employment and the supply of goods and services ;  
Encourages Governments to take effective and expeditious measures , particularly the enactment or amendment , if necessary , of domestic legislation to provide appropriate penalties , such as substantial imprisonment , fines and forfeiture , in order to combat all aspects of organized criminal activities related to trafficking at the international level in women and children ;  
The need for carrying out adjustment measures in some small island developing States , such as Cook Islands , Fiji , Papua New Guinea , Solomon Islands and Vanuatu , to correct economic imbalances rooted in the past , combined with the recent economic and financial crisis in Asia , have had both direct and indirect economic impacts affecting domestic output , prices of export commodities and export earnings , incomes from tourism and foreign investments .  
Those materials included international human rights instruments , memorandum and election reports issued by the Special Representative , relevant domestic laws , training curricula , and free and fair elections posters developed by the office .  
The current conflict in the Congo has led to a deepening humanitarian crisis , exacerbated the plight of refugees and internally displaced persons , impeded the delivery of critical food and medical assistance , and in general hampered international and domestic efforts towards development and democracy .  
They were : the timely adjustment of domestic policies in developing countries ; the opening up of developed countries commodity markets and the provision of timely , relevant and affordable information and technology by those countries to commodity-dependent developing countries ; and a global effort to reduce trade and non-trade barriers in order to make the playing field level for all parties .  
To deal with the volatility of capital flows , developing countries needed to deepen domestic capital markets , institute an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework and develop a strong domestic institutional investor base .  
Recognizes the importance of the adoption of appropriate policy responses to the challenges of globalization at the national level , in particular by pursuing sound and stable domestic policies , including , inter alia , sound macroeconomic and social policies , in order to realize the objective of the eradication of poverty ;  
The discussion contained in this section is illustrative of different options that have been used in domestic legislative measures to set up a regulatory framework for privately financed infrastructure projects , but the Guide does not thereby advocate the establishment of any particular model or administrative structure .  
The representative of New Zealand indicated that her delegation could accept the inclusion of the right to self-determination in the draft declaration subject to it being consistent with the domestic understanding of the relationship between the Maori and the Crown and with respect for the territorial integrity of democratic States and their constitutional frameworks , where those met current international human rights standards .  
Furthermore , the least developed suffered from declining official development assistance , heavy indebtedness , falling export earnings owing to low commodity prices , virtually no foreign direct investment , and the effects of the structural adjustment imposed on them by IMF , which was why they had major difficulties in mobilizing domestic resources .  
The drop in aid contributions , especially the continuing decline in the share of net official development assistance in the gross domestic product of donor countries , had led to increased reliance on private loans on the international capital market .  
The Convention requires that bribery of foreign public officials be punishable by effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties comparable with those applicable to bribery of domestic officials .  
On the domestic front , he pursued a comprehensive patriotic policy that was consolidated over the years by deeprooted national unity and by social , cultural and economic achievements exceeding the bounds of imagination .  
We say that the reasoning is unfair , being based on our high per capita gross domestic product , without taking into account either our ability to pay or the seriously disproportionate distribution of national income between capital , labour and taxation .  
Efforts are being made at the national level , yet , paradoxically , official development assistance is still decreasing , and the commitment made by rich countries to commit 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product is far from being fulfilled .  
By cutting deep into all sectors of society , it undermines vital economic growth , perhaps reducing future national gross domestic product size in the region by a third over the next 20 years .  
This concern was also raised by the Government of South Africa who reported that the extensive and highly exploitative system of domestic workers provides hidden opportunities for sex services , either forced or paid .  
A favourable and enabling investment climate which mobilizes FDI and domestic savings and channels them into productive investments also requires that the suppliers of capital have reliable , transparent and comparable financial information .  
At the national level , UNCTAD could contribute to sound domestic macroeconomic and financial policies , administrative reforms and continuing efforts to promote a stable and transparent national legal and regulatory framework favourable to development .  
It is important that the global public is concerned about the economic , social and environmental consequences of foreign and domestic investment .  
For many developing countries , in particular countries that are unable to attract sufficient external private capital resources , it is essential that Governments undertake greater efforts to promote the mobilization of domestic sources of capital .  
Other delegations expressed concern that dealing with possession was beyond the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee or that simple possession offences might not be treated as criminal offences ( as opposed to administrative or regulatory offences ) in domestic law .  
Other delegations expressed concern that dealing with possession was beyond the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee or that simple possession offences might not be treated as criminal offences ( as opposed to administrative or regulatory offences ) in domestic law .  
Undertaking studies on the level of national savings , the development of stable and transparent domestic financial resources , monetary systems , foreign capital flows and the financial aspects of social policies ;  
Export subsidies should be outlawed , domestic producer subsidies reduced , access under tariff quotas increased , tariff escalation on processed agricultural products removed , and the level and dispersion of bound tariffs on agricultural imports reduced .  
Several delegations expressed the view that , for such negotiations to be successful , developed countries must find the political will to overcome narrow domestic interests and deal with the concerns of developing countries in an equitable manner .  
To promote the mobilization of domestic financial resources and to establish the basis for an enabling environment through , inter alia , a sound macroeconomic framework , a dynamic private sector , improved governance , and participatory development ;  
In only a few developing countries , mostly in Asia and Latin America , have domestic companies joined the integrated networks of transnational corporations and , in some cases , forged strategic alliances to exploit dynamic trade and investment interlinkages .  
Had these assets been freely available , they might have made a major contribution to the economic and social development process and it is possible that they might have increased more than twofold by contributing to gross domestic product .  
The larger fiscal deficit partially offset the fall in private domestic demand , while monetary policy makers maintained an austere stance until midway through the year .  
In this regard , the collective Presidency is required to ensure the full implementation of the Accords , showing real political will at the domestic level while seeking complementary solutions at the regional level .  
Reference should be made , for instance , to how the legal and institutional frameworks are geared to supporting or hindering private domestic and foreign investments .  
Furthermore , the threat may not be determined on the basis of ulterior political motives there must be genuine international concern behind the sanctions , not the foreign or domestic policy considerations of a single State or group of States .  
The common requirement that all existing domestic remedies must be exhausted before citing a State party before an international forum may result in injustice where no timeframe is set for hearing complaints of violation of human rights ;  
The underlying weakness of the social services in a number of LDCs is that they were established or instituted on the availability of external loans and grants rather than on the basis of strong , vibrant and growing domestic production and economic base .  
In the light of low and unstable export earnings , limited access to private financial flows , small domestic savings and the serious debt problems experienced by these countries , ODA remains a critical source of their development finance .  
First , rapidly rising income would allow domestic savings to rise , thereby increasing the amount of total investable resources ; and secondly , sustained growth would attract private capital as a substitute for official financing .  
Given the limited size of the domestic market and the unstable conditions of the international market , the major difficulty faced by Viet Nams agricultural sector is to find markets for its increased production .  
The Conference needs to focus on finding solutions to the inherent problem of weak productive capacities in LDCs through improved domestic policy frameworks , human capital development , traderelated capacity building and improved physical infrastructure .  
It was therefore urgent that LDCs and the international community be encouraged to foster private entrepreneurship , create a domestic environment conducive to foreign investment and expand trade internally , regionally and to the world at large .  
The development of a strong domestic construction services sector should be supported by instruments of industrial policy , human resource development and macroeconomic policies , and by removing unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles internally .  
There is very limited scope , in the foreseeable future , to meet these multiple development finance requirements with domestic resources because of sluggish growth or economic stagnation , widespread poverty and a weak domestic corporate sector .  
The development of a strong domestic construction services sector should be supported by instruments of industrial policy , human resource development and macroeconomic policies , and by removing unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles internally .  
One of the main problems faced by local firms in the domestic market is securing effective and substantive participation in projects funded by multilateral funding agencies since they have found it difficult to meet the prequalification requirements .  
There are positive signs for increasing the stability of capital markets , with the emergence of mutual funds , provident funds , the use of fund managers and the concomitant decline in reliance on individual domestic investors and foreign investors .  
Even for the larger developing countries , ODA continues to have major qualitative significance ; due to their low economic development and limited domestic resources , ODA is still irreplaceable for them .  
The need to adapt the provisions of domestic and international legal instruments to the specific requirements of electronic commerce has been emerging for some 15 years both at the national level and at the international level .  
They emphasized that domestic factors , especially consistent reform policies designed to achieve broadly based economic and social progress , are of prime importance for the transition process and the process of economic development in general .  
It was emphasized that efforts should be made by developed countries to meet as soon as possible the objective to raise the level of official development assistance ( ODA ) to 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product ( GDP ) .  
Enabling domestic environments : governance issues ; sound macroeconomic policies , including fiscal and private savings policies ; special needs of Africa , the least developed countries , small island developing States , landlocked and transit developing countries and other developing countries as well as countries with economies in transition with special difficulties in attracting financing for development .  
Societies in which citizens can openly air their grievances ; choose their governments in free , open elections ; have a say , through elected local bodies , in aspects of governance that touch their daily lives the most ; and get redress when they need it from an independent judiciary that upholds the rule of law , are far less likely to erupt into domestic conflict than those under totalitarian or military rule .  
The comprehensive agenda of the Committee , spanning the domestic , regional and global dimensions of economic , social and cultural rights , bodes well for the future , as does the immense interest shown for bridging the gap between the rhetoric on economic , social and cultural rights and the operative priorities at all levels . 
Content : Structural features of and trends in the financial system ; the role of capital flow vulnerability of developing countries in recent financial crises ; implications of external debt for the formulation of domestic and foreign economic policies ; the World Banks Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) and Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers ( PRSP ) initiatives ; the debate on the international financial architecture ; the coherence between the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank and the World Trade Organization ; and domestic and foreign sources of financing for development .  
Experts indicated that margin of preference in international tendering allocated to local firms should be sufficient to allow their effective participation , and that criteria established for participation in multilaterally financed projects should not be so stringent as to exclude domestic construction firms in developing countries .  
The unhealthy tendency to overstate alleged violations of civil and political rights with a view to satisfying special interest groups or domestic constituencies had become a characteristic of the Third Committees country-specific draft resolutions .  
The reasons were weak economic governance , lack of response to stabilization measures , weak institutional and physical infrastructure , small domestic markets and limited access to regional and global markets , and also the absence of a critical mass of small - and medium-sized enterprises .  
While international efforts could create conducive conditions for economic development , the primary responsibility for a nations development lay with its Government and people , and discussions on financing growth the development should focus on how to help LDCs mobilize domestic financial resources and attract external resources .  
In order to extricate the continent from its deep-rooted socioeconomic problems , domestic policy reforms had to be accompanied by concerted action at the global level , including measures designed to achieve an expeditious resolution of the debt crisis , enhanced productive capacity , improved and expanded market access , increased official development assistance and a more generous transfer of technology .  
The representative of Ethiopia , speaking on behalf of the African Group , stressed the complex and daunting development challenges facing the LDCs and argued that the resolution of such challenges required a multi-dimensional approach encompassing increased development aid and outright debt cancellation , enhanced productive capacity and reduced supply constraints , improved market access , and a mutually supportive domestic and international policy environment .  
It was therefore urgent that LDCs and the international community be encouraged to foster private entrepreneurship , create a domestic environment conducive to foreign investment and expand trade internally , regionally and to the world at large .  
That report concluded that for African countries to be able to attain the target of reducing poverty by half by 2015 , set by the World Social Summit in Copenhagen , an average annual gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth rate of around 7 per cent and an investment rate of around 33 per cent of GDP were required .  
It believed that the existing legal regime was adequate to govern the exploration and uses of outer space , and that it would be practical for Member States , after having reviewed their domestic laws on outer space , to adhere to and apply the international legal instruments governing outer space .  
We emphasize the importance of more stable and predictable financing for social and economic development and stress the important role that official development assistance can still play , in this respect , for the majority of developing countries , particularly least developed countries and other countries with limited potential for domestic savings or export earnings .  
The Committee is concerned , further , that domestic law is not yet fully compatible with the provisions and principles of the Convention , that the process of drafting and adopting new legislation is slow and that , in addition , some customary practices which are prejudicial to childrens rights may still be applied instead of modern domestic legal provisions .  
The Committee recommends that the State party conduct a comprehensive review of the Basic Law and domestic laws , including administrative regulations and legal procedural rules , to ensure that they conform to international human rights standards , including the Convention , that they are sufficiently clear and precise , are published , and are accessible to the public .  
Both the new State and entity Governments have ambitious plans to further the reforms cutting tax rates and widening the tax base , improving collection of customs and excise payments and pushing forward with privatization to attract both domestic and foreign investors and to balance official budgets .  
It was generally agreed that it is important for countries to establish an enabling environment at both the international and domestic levels in order to promote sustainable development , including economic growth , social development and environmental protection .  
Elements of such an environment were considered to include sound macroeconomic policies , accountable and transparent governance , a sound domestic legal and regulatory framework , incentives for investment , the involvement of civil society in public decision-making and the strengthening of civil , political , economic and financial institutions .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention , are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Each State Party , in accordance with its domestic legal principles , shall take the necessary measures to enable a legal entity located in its territory or organized under its laws to be held liable when a person responsible for the management or control of that legal entity has , in that capacity , committed an offence referred to in article 2 .  
States Parties shall further cooperate in the prevention of the offences set forth in article 2 by exchanging accurate and verified information in accordance with their national law , and by coordinating administrative and other measures , consistent with their respective domestic legal and administrative systems , taken as appropriate to prevent the commission of offences as set forth in article 2 , in particular by : ( a ) . . .  
By 2005 , most Member States that have not already done so will have developed , adopted and implemented the necessary domestic legal and administrative measures , which will create an infrastructure for preventing and controlling illicit transnational traffic in firearms and related items .  
The development and implementation of effective measures at the national level is essential to enable each State to combat domestic money-laundering activities , to avoid becoming a haven for money-laundering by foreign organized criminal groups and to cooperate effectively with other States in the international effort to combat money-laundering .  
Implementation of the objective will result in more effective tools to combat domestic and transnational aspects of money-laundering , with a consequent reduction of the ability of organized criminal groups to derive benefits from their proceeds and to dedicate illicit resources to further criminal activities .  
The view was expressed that the interaction and potential conflicts between the proposed system of international interests in mobile equipment and existing domestic legal regimes would require careful analysis .  
While domestic public investments have a positive role to play , in view of scarcities of domestic resources in LDCs , it will also be important to mobilize external capital , including official development assistance and foreign direct investment .  
However , there is very limited scope , in the foreseeable future , to meet the multiple development finance requirements of LDCs with domestic resources because of sluggish growth or economic stagnation , widespread poverty and a weak domestic corporate sector .  
Underlines that unilateral coercive measures are one of the major obstacles to the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development and , in this regard , calls upon all States to avoid the unilateral imposition of economic coercive measures and the extraterritorial application of domestic laws which run counter to the principles of free trade and hamper the development of developing countries , as recognized by the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on the Right to Development in its report ( E / CN . 4 / 1998 / 29 ) ;  
Commission resolution 1997 / 50 spells out its revised mandate , which is to investigate cases of detention imposed arbitrarily , provided that no final decision has been taken in such cases by local courts in conformity with domestic law , with the relevant standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with the relevant international instruments accepted by the States concerned .  
Another pillar of an enabling domestic environment is a sound macroeconomic framework , including , for example , sound budget priorities for health , education and agriculture / food security , and transparent and accountable public expenditure management and an efficient tax system .  
Ending corruption is fundamental for mobilizing domestic resources , and increased direct and indirect measures are required , including increased transparency , in both government and private sector activities .  Fighting corruption is one of the main priorities of the development agenda and this has been a strong message from a wide spectrum of countries .

Trade is the most important mechanism for most if not all small island developing States to expand domestic savings and finance their various development processes especially because they seriously lack comparative advantages and economies of scale , being vulnerable and dependent on a small number of export commodities , predominantly agriculture , light manufacturing and underdeveloped service-based sectors , to drive much-needed foreign exchange earnings , employment and development . 
All countries must realize that the mobilization of domestic resources for development calls for a supportive environment in which sound macroeconomic policies are applied ( stabilization of public finance , control of inflation , use of effective and efficient mechanisms for the distribution of public expenditure ) and favourable conditions in which the private sector can grow .

The establishment of key national laboratories , persisting in the principle of choosing the best to fit the need , is equipping a number of top-ranking domestic laboratories able to participate in competition at international forefronts to become basic research " national teams " able to represent the nation 's equipment levels , research levels , academic levels and management levels .  
However , China is still much engaged in her own domestic development , and has limited national strength .  For this reason we are selecting those key areas or key links that have favorable prospects , where the degree of industrial linkage will be significant , and which can drive the entire mechanism for critical breakthroughs , and through these we will vigorously strive to realize a leap in high-tech development .  
Insufficient domestic funds have been made up by utilizing foreign capital ; this has increased the state tax revenue and foreign exchange earnings , promoted economic restructuring and the optimization of the industrial structure , accelerated the blending of China 's economy with the world economy , and created a large number of job opportunities .  Products turned out by foreign-funded enterprises have greatly enriched the material lives of our people .  
For the last two years , aimed at the changed international and domestic economic situation and the domestic deflation trend that has appeared , the Chinese Government has sized up the time , adjusting its policy promptly , making the key decision to expand domestic demand , and taking a series of macroeconomic regulation and control steps , the main substance of which is pursuing an active fiscal policy . 
The Central Economic Work Conference held in November 1999 proposed a series of policy steps to promote economic development such as continuing to pursue an active fiscal policy and bringing into better play the role of monetary policy , making decisions such as expanding domestic demand , sharply adjusting the economic structure , and promoting industrial optimization and upgrading .  
The current reform of breakthrough significance is the new setup that coordinates and unifies the separate internal and external trade systems for agricultural produce , that is , achieving integration of domestic and foreign trade in this produce in the form of joint management or joint operations , and adopting the new form of agency services in foreign trade .  
Facing the new situations in domestic China and overseas and the new challenges of the new century and new millennium , it is a must to further define clearly the thinking about developing the economy , adjust in a timely manner the economic structure , and uphold all along the thinking of science and technology being the primary productive force , so as to bring about sustained , rapid , and healthy development of our national economy .  
As permitted entry into the market expands , and tariffs are reduced and nontariff measures abolished , foreign products , services , and investment may enter our market on a larger scale ; as a result , our domestic enterprises will face more intense competition , and in particular , enterprises with high production costs , low level of technology , and backward management will face still more severe challenges .  
In 1999 the average charge per kilowatt of electricity in the rural areas fell by 0.1 yuan , and as a result the peasants paid a total of 23-billion yuan less for their electricity ; many peasants who could not afford electricity in the past have now happily installed color TV and VCD players , and sales of domestic electrical appliances have hotted up in some rural areas .  
At the same time , spurred by market forces and supported by bank loans , a number of new-style domestic electrical appliances , computers , mobile phones and so on , with high science and technology content , low energy consumption , and a variety of functions rapidly sprang up , thus further improving market supply .  The quality of China 's economic growth has gradually improved amid both protection and pressure .  
The rate of decline of the price level , which has been in negative growth for more than 20 successive months , has gradually lessened as domestic demand is stimulated , and the categories of commodities whose prices are rising is now increasing .  
Dai Xianglong said : Implementing the strategy of developing the western regions is an important plan for restructuring the economy and promoting the coordinated development of regional economies .  It is an important measure for increasing domestic demand and promoting the sustained , rapid and coordinated development of the national economy .  It is also an important opportunity for the restructuring of bank credits and promoting the development of banking .  
Some domestic non-governmental scientific and technological enterprises were also quite dynamic .  " We do not set employment quotas .  No matter how many they are , all the talents will be employed , as long as they are outstanding and are needed by our corporation , " said a pertinent responsible person of Shenzhen Huawei Technology Corporation .  
Faced with an international and domestic situation that is undergoing profound changes and a glorious and arduous mission , the deputies will be thoroughly studying major issues of overall and strategic significance in reform , opening up and socialist modernization and will be reviewing important policies and arrangements for work in the coming year .  
Xiang noted that in light of the impact of the Asian financial crisis and domestic contradictions in scant effective demand in 1998 , the CPC Central Committee and the State Council made a resolute strategic decision to implement a proactive fiscal policy ; unceasingly stepped up policy efforts to expand the scope of the fiscal policy role ;  
Traditional industries are still the principal bodies in Liaoning , which is an old industrial base , and to a great extent , state-owned industries manifest the model of speed and efficiency .  The state 's efforts to stimulate domestic demand , and gradually put the proactive fiscal policy into place , have produced a certain effect of stimulating the market for Liaoning industries .  
He said that making great development in the Western Region is an important operation to expand domestic demands and promote sustained , rapid , and healthy development of national economy as well as an important deployment for strategically readjusting economic structure and promoting coordinated development of regional economy .  
Wu Yi also expressed the hope that Hainan will adhere to the principle of being driven and boosted by the policy designed for it , by the application of science and technology , by introducing foreign equipment , technology , and capital , and by associating with domestic enterprises , in order to further build up the special economic zone . 
Facing the contradiction that has appeared , between periodic and structural surplus versus a domestic market potential that is a long way from being realized , and facing the contradiction that while market demand for a large quantity of commodities is insufficient , we still rely on imports for some special products , especially key technical equipment , we must be determined to solve some outstanding problems such as irrational economic structure .  
the building of socialist spiritual civilization and of democracy and legal system was further intensified ; and social stability was maintained .  These achievements are the results of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core taking charge of the overall situation and providing correct leadership , and the results of all levels throughout the country implementing the central policy decision on expanding domestic demand and the series of guidelines and policies , and working hard with concerted efforts .  
With regard to this change , Zhang Hongwei , who is here for the Third Session of the Ninth National Commission of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference [ CPPCC ] , says the following based on his experience : Confronted with the trend of global economic integration , our country should , from now on , encourage robust domestic businesses to make investments and establish plants abroad and explore international markets so as to gain an edge in the midst of increasingly sharp international competition .  
Guo Zhenqian said the Financial and Economic Committee held that the 2000 central and local government budget arrangements have implemented the requirement for continued enforcement of a positive financial policy ; realized the spirit of readjusting structure , expanding domestic demand , ensuring main areas , promoting development , and maintaining stability ;  
After last year 's central budget was approved , in the light of changes in the domestic and international situations , the party central committee and State Council decided to step up implementation of a positive financial policy .  
The Finance and Economic Committee is of the opinion that the central and local budgets for 2000 are in line with the requirement of continuing to implement a positive financial policy , and manifest the spirit of adjusting the economic structure , increasing domestic demand , assuring key expenditures , boosting development , and maintaining stability .  
Third , the work of economic and social development in 2000 should comprehensively implement all policies and measures set forth by the central leadership ; correctly handle the relationship between reform , development , and stability ; give prominence to the proper handling of reforms and development in state-owned enterprises , the economic restructuring , scientific and technological progress , and expansion of domestic demand ;  
promote the national economy 's sustained , high-speed , and healthy development .  The expansion of domestic demand should be consistently combined with the expansion of exports ; the keeping of a rather quick economic growth rate should be combined with the strategic readjustment of the economic structure ;  
The content of the proposals is mainly : Maintaining sustained rapid and healthy national economic growth , expanding domestic demand , promoting strategic economic restructuring , continuing to push ahead with reform and strengthening management , speeding up the development of science and technology and education , opening wider to the outside world , intensifying the building of a social security system , stepping up environmental protection , and strengthening the building of spiritual civilization and an honest and clean government .  
1 .  The fifth natural paragraph of General Program shall be amended as : " Our country shall remain at the primary stage of socialism for a long time to come ( at present ) and be faced with a main contradiction between people 's growing material and cultural needs and backward social production .  Owing to domestic factors and international influence , the struggle waged by our country 's people against hostile forces or hostile elements at home and abroad shall be a long-term one .  
The motions handled since the Second Session of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee , which are rich in content , have mainly included those aimed at maintaining sustained , rapid , and healthy national economic growth ; strengthening agriculture and doing a good job in rural work ; continually and energetically pressing ahead with the state-owned enterprise reform ; guarding against and alleviating the financial crisis ; expanding domestic demand ; continually implementing the principle of opening up to the outside world and vigorously opening up the international market ;  
Both domestic and foreign hostile forces do not want to see the development of a strong , prosperous , and stable socialist China . They hope for chaos in China . They are constantly trying to " westernize " and " divide " China so as to achieve change amid chaos and to fish in troubled waters .  
The deputies and committee members were of the view : Although currently the overall situation is marked by social stability and sustained economic growth , we have been facing in-depth contradictions and problems accumulated over the years and new challenges arising from phased changes in economic development , such as effective demand in the domestic market has been insufficient , contradictions resulting from the unreasonable economic structure have become increasingly prominent , the employment pressure has increased , and increase in peasants ' incomes have slowed down .  
correctly handle relationships among reform , development , and stability ; place emphasis on the reform and development of state enterprises , economic restructuring , scientific and technological advancement , and the expansion of domestic demand ; and promote sustained rapid and healthy national economic growth .  
Zhu Lilan said , the future development of the high-tech zones will be linked to state economic restructuring , the expansion of domestic demand , and the development of west China , and will be aimed at the requirements of the state 's medium and long-term development strategy ; we will make all-round plans and rational distribution and concentrate forces on cultivating projects with their own intellectual property rights .  
The decision is of great significance to expand domestic demand and bring about sustained growth of national economy , to promote coordinated economic development in all regions and eventually achieve a common prosperity , and to strengthen ethnic unity , maintain social stability and fortify border defense .  
These countries stressed that the United States does not have the authority to criticize the human rights situation of other countries , and this kind of application of the domestic law of one nation to the legal system of other nations is not only no in accordance with international law , but is not helpful to realizing mutual respect and peaceful coexistence among nations .  
A responsible person of an authoritative state organ pointed out the other day : If the work of changing debt into equity is successfully conducted , it can provide a healthy financial foundation for state banks and state enterprises in China and can help prepare them for meeting competitions from both domestic and overseas markets .  However , if the work of changing debt into equity turns out to be a failure , we will be unable to attain the desired goal of this policy ;  
The DPRK 's active efforts to push its multilateral diplomacy , increase exchanges with other countries of the world , create a peaceful and stable environment on the Korean peninsula , launch foreign trade and economic cooperation , and speed up domestic economic construction are beneficial .  
Since the two countries formed diplomatic ties 36 years ago , friendly relations of cooperation between the two have maintained development on a healthy and stable track through the ups and downs of global situations and their domestic conditions .  
Article 20 Conservation zones for surface sources of domestic potable water that cut across provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal boundaries shall be delimited through consultation among the provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments concerned .  
In delimiting other conservation zones for surface sources of domestic potable water , the city and county people 's governments concerned shall consult with one another and then propose a delimitation plan to be submitted to the provincial , autonomous regional , or municipal people 's government for approval .  
Those who violate the provision in Article 23 , Section 2 of these Detailed Rules and Regulations by discharging pollutants in excess of the pollutant discharge standards set by the state or the locality in Class Two conservation zones for surface sources of domestic potable water shall be ordered by a people 's government at or above the county level to make improvement within a time limit and be liable to a fine below 100,000 yuan ;  
Those who violate the provisions in Article 23 , Section 3 of these Detailed Rules and Regulations by setting up a wharf for loading and unloading garbage , oils , and other toxic and harmful matter in Class Two conservation zones for surface sources of domestic potable water shall be ordered by the environmental protection department of a people 's government at or above the county level to demolish the wharf within a time limit and shall be liable to a fine below 100,000 yuan .  
Deputy Li Changchun said : The policy decision on western development reflects Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's thinking of " two overall situations , " and is of extremely important significance to expanding domestic demand , precipitating the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy , promoting the coordinated economic development of various regions to ultimately achieve common prosperity , intensifying national unity , maintaining social stability , and solidifying national defense .  
The strategic adjustment of the economic structure will give rise to huge investment and consumption demand .  This will not only provide a strong driving force for our nation 's economic growth , but will also provide broad market space for the development of domestic and foreign trade and economic exchanges .  
In our country , now tourism has been moving onto the path of comprehensive development with three major market sectors , namely , tourism for people entering the Chinese mainland , domestic tourism , and tourism for domestic people traveling abroad , and now tourism is a large-scale industry with a huge market and great output value .  Tourism is playing a more and more important role in the national economy , and is producing positive influence for the enhancement of national quality and the development of the socialist spiritual civilization .  
To meet the needs in speeding up the strategic adjustments of the economic structure , expanding domestic demand , promoting economic growth and social development , the party Central Committee and the State Council now took the tourist industry as a new growth point of the national economy , made great efforts to foster and support it , and set forth new requirements for the tourist industry under the new situation .  
Under the new situation , all localities and departments concerned should act according to the requirements of the party Central Committee and the State Council , go all out to foster the new economic growth point - - the tourist industry , and ensure that it will achieve greater results in expanding domestic demand , increasing employment , promoting opening-up , stimulating local economic growth and social development , and will continue to play a comprehensive role in economic restructuring and in the development of other related industries .  
The central leadership made the major policy decision on the great development of China 's west .  The national economy is undergoing strategic restructuring .  The state set forth a series of policies for expanding domestic demand and promoting economic growth .  
The conferences conscientiously reviewed and summed up the work practice and main experience of the people of our country in prevailing over difficulties and overcoming risks under a complicated domestic and international environment and in continuing to advance the cause of reform , opening , and socialist modernization construction , and the two conferences also planned and assigned important work tasks for the country for the last year of this century .  
it is necessary to do a good job of effectively carrying out nationality , religious , national defense , diplomatic , and Taiwan affairs work , to resolutely fight sabotage activities carried out by hostile forces at home and abroad , and to combat various law-violating and criminal activities , so as to maintain social and political stability , the unity of the motherland , and national security and to create a good international and domestic environment for reform and development .  
In the face of new changes taking place in the domestic and international situation and new development in ideological education for young people , we feel deeply that Comrade Jiang Zemin 's speech has a clear objective , that it targets at the current problems , and that it is of great practical meaning , and it has made us realize even more the urgency and difficult nature of young people 's ideological education .  
To improve its monetary policy-related work , the committee has , since 1999 , held meetings of economic and financial experts at regular intervals .  The purpose is to widely solicit opinions about the monetary policy from the academic community , study major issues on international and domestic economic and financial policies , and acquire suggestions from all sectors of society in an effort to improve its work related to the monetary policy .  
On the basis of its comprehensive analysis of the current international and domestic situation , the party central leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core requires that the party 's ideological and political work be done intensively and effectively , and takes this as an urgent strategic task related to the general situation of socialist reform and construction in our country for the whole party and the entire people of the whole nation .  
On the one hand , after China joins the WTO , import tariffs will be cut by a wide margin and this will help domestic ship owners , shipyards , and designing units directly use advanced , reliable , and fairly-priced , and serviceable complete sets of foreign ship equipment and spare parts with low prices .  
The people in the western region began to examine their past , and quite a few western provinces and autonomous regions have changed their old practice of standing still and refusing to make progress .  They have set up project banks to solicit businesses , established a " single-stop " service structure , and provided fine environment to attract domestic and foreign investors , so as to greet the upsurge of the grand western development in a brand new , open attitude .  
All countries should have the right to act in line with their native national conditions to choose their respective political systems and development models .  No nation or group of states has the right to force its values and social system onto others , even less so to exploit the human rights matter or a so-called " humanitarian crisis " as an excuse to deliberately interfere in the domestic affairs of a sovereign country .  
On the basis of its geopolitics and its domestic and foreign " realistic " situation , Russia has gradually formed its own unique " practical containment " nuclear strategy : to prevent the outbreak of a nuclear war and a large-scale conventional war by means of nuclear deterrence and to first use nuclear weapons in a regional war , local war or armed conflict to attain the goal of safeguarding national security and maintaining the status of a big country .  
Capital flow will have a greater influence and impact on a country 's economy , particularly the great circulation and speculation of short-term capital .  Without sound market operating mechanism , rational interest mechanism , and strict regulatory system , it will be extremely easy for the domestic economy to be controlled by the international market if we abolish the restrictions on capital outflow and inflow too early .  
It is an immediate and urgent task for our country 's inspection and quarantine departments to make rational use of technical means , effectively safeguard the interests of the state and domestic industries , actively break down the technical barriers set by developed country and help domestic enterprises adapt themselves unceasingly to WTO regulations and the trend of international technological development and open up the international market .  
According to the latest statistics made by the People 's Bank of China , in the first quarter of this year , China 's banking and financial operations were normal and stable and showed a trend of positive development .  Continual increases in money supply and total credit met the need in expanding domestic demand , promoting production and the growth of consumption , and conformed in the main to the economic development .  The deposits of enterprises increased by a great extent , loans extended by financial institutions were expedited , and foreign exchange reserves increased steadily .  
Analyzing the distribution of increased loans , we can see that those loans have not only satisfied the need of state key construction projects , infrastructure construction and the reasonable funds requirement of large and medium sized enterprises , but also supported the development of medium and small enterprises and non-public sectors of the economy as well as the personal consumption needs .  Those loans have played an important role in expanding domestic consumption and promoting economic development .  
Chen Jinhua added that the extensive development of the western region is of great significance for expanding domestic demand , boosting sustained national economic growth , promoting the coordinated development of various regional economies , and strengthening national unity .  
However , the United States ignored facts and again put forward an anti-China motion at the meeting of the UN Commission for Human Rights to meet the needs of its domestic political and party struggle , in a vain attempt to make use of the so-called human rights issue to interfere in China 's internal affairs and vilify China 's international image .  
The overall concept and content of human rights are indivisible and unchangeable .  The firm stride of the Chinese people walking toward domestic prosperity is unstoppable .  
At the UN human rights meetings , the United States provoked confrontation and disputes on many occasions out of certain domestic political needs and also its stubborn mentality of " moral imperialism " and the so-called international strategy of national egoism .  
Equity capital should primarily be raised from the domestic and international capital markets , and oriented toward the public , the corporate investors , and the special investment funds as well .  
In deciding on a strategic goal , we should try to meet our national security needs and comply with at once the needs of our national economic development and electronic information industry development and the needs of increasingly fierce competition on the domestic and international markets .  
Zhang Lichang , secretary of the municipal party committee , said that leading cadres at all levels must stand at the high plain of historical development to fully understand the urgency of implementing the important concept of " three represents " in close connection with the profound changes in the domestic and international situation and with the actual conditions of Tianjin 's work , further emancipate people 's minds , further break new ground and make new progress , grasp opportunities , and develop by leaps and bounds .  
and facilitating the internationalization of the market , allowing Sino-foreign joint-venture enterprises and foreign-funded enterprises to seek listings on the domestic stock exchanges while encouraging qualified domestic enterprises to raise funds through initial public offerings on the overseas stock exchanges , and also allowing foreign capital to purchase stock ownership in enterprises in some competitive industries in China so that China 's capital market will be fully opened to foreign investors step by step .  
Ever since the 1990 ' s , China has been developing its maritime resources .  The output of maritime industries has been growing 30 percent annually on the average , and this year 's output will account for 5 percent of the nation 's gross domestic product .  But this figure is still below the level of the world 's maritime economy , which accounts for 7 percent of the world 's total economic aggregates .  
[ Reporter ] At present , our economic development is in a very crucial period .  As the national economy has undergone profound changes and is transforming from the economy of shortage into an economy marked by the buyer 's market , China is confronted with the dilemma of a structure-caused surplus on the one hand and a domestic market with untapped potentials on the other .  
This is not only beneficial to stimulating trade and international resources , but is also helpful in alleviating the contradiction of domestic oversupply .  It is beneficial toward developing an economy of scale and will help to effectively attract advanced foreign technology and management experience .  Moreover , direct overseas investment will be beneficial in terms of employee training and introduction .  
They also pointed out : Economic globalization has impacted the industries and domestic markets of developing countries that are in a " vulnerable positions " on differing degrees , and have greatly increased the risks of economic fluctuations and of triggering a financial crisis in a country .  Economic globalization has continuously widened the gap between the rich and the poor around the globe , and the economic sovereignty and independence of many countries have been tested .  
Accordingly , we should cultivate and develop domestic money markets by accelerating reform of the domestic investment and financing system , as well as creating a fair competition mechanism for domestic and foreign capital , making full use of the potential of the high domestic savings rate , being truly rational and effectively taking advantage of " two markets and two sources of funding " , thus avoiding over-dependence on outside sources of funding .  This is the main approach to guard against and dispel international balance of payment risks .  
In his important speech at the central ideological and political work meeting , Comrade Jiang Zemin made a brilliant analysis and profound exposition of the important position , main tasks , guiding ideology , and basic requirements of the party 's ideological and political work in the new period , and major issues that need handling in doing the work , from the height of both international and domestic overall situations .  
The arduousness of ideological and political work is determined by the fact that international and domestic factors are complex and people 's thinking is lively , complex , varied , and constantly changeable from person to person , from matter to matter , and from time to time .  
Li Ruihuan said that China and Russia are facing huge domestic tasks in developing their economy and improving living standards , and they hold identical or similar views on many major international issues ; their two economies are strongly complementary , and there are broad prospects for developing bilateral friendly cooperation .  
Competition of this kind is a means to stimulate consumption as well as a necessary market mechanism to save efficient enterprises and eliminate the poor ones .  The reason why China 's home electrical appliance enterprises , such as color televisions , refrigerators , and washing machine enterprises , have been able to grab an overwhelmingly large domestic market share and in turn enter international markets is just the fierce price competitions a few years ago .  
Currently we regulate and control the money supply mainly by controlling the total credit of state-owned commercial banks and we have not yet adopted indirect regulation and control means in real terms in this regard .  After China enters the WTO , changes in money supply and swings in interests in international markets will have a direct impact on China 's domestic financial market and money supply and they will make it more difficult to regulate and control money supply .  Consequently , China 's existing macroscopic financial regulation and control will face challenges .  
Moreover , our country 's financial supervisory departments have not yet indirectly controlled and regulated domestic financial supervision in real terms and established an effective supervisory system .  
In order to increase domestic demand and stimulate economic growth , the CPC Central Committee and the State Council pursued a proactive fiscal policy for three consecutive years , thus creating a fine macroeconomic environment for the process of reforming state enterprises and lifting them out of difficulty .  
Looking at the changes in market prices , the main impact came from the big rise in international oil prices and domestic policy-style price adjustments , and the real impact from being drawn forward by expanded market demand was still rather weak .  
Moreover , under the situation that relevant laws , regulations , and policies are not very perfect , opening China 's education markets will give rise to contradictions and problems in terms of education sovereignty , direction of running schools , education concepts , national cultural traditions , and management , and vehemently impact the relatively weak domestic educational industry , such as the production of educational instrument , studying appliances , books , software , toys , and so on .  
Since 1997 , with reference to those issues like the Asian financial crisis , insufficient effective domestic demands , and so on , active financial policies and firm and steady monetary policies were implemented .  Through issuing national debts , expanding investments , promoting consumption , and increasing exports , the deflation development tendency has been effectively stopped .  
During the period of the " Ninth 5-Year " Plan , the historical opportunity of expanding domestic demands and implementing active financial policies was seized .  Through issuing national debt and expanding investments , we have concentrated efforts to build a batch of major projects and fulfilled some big projects which we had always wanted to fulfill but failed .  The agricultural , forestry , and water conservancy construction has noticeably quickened .  
The Changzheng rockets independently developed by China have attained the advanced level in the world in the aspects of technical functions and practicability .  Apart from meeting the demands of domestic clients , it has also entered the international commercial market for rocket launching and attained remarkable social and economic effectiveness .  
In modern history , almost all debates on major issues concerning the country 's development orientation occurred against a background of domestic chaos or external threats or when the nation was facing profound crises .  In such circumstances , people did not have the objective environment for discussing such issues calmly and patiently .  As a result , people could not avoid reaching conclusions leading to rash actions for quick successes and instant benefits at the expense of long-term interests .  
However , the party central leadership and the State Council displayed its strategic insight , grasped the trend in the development and changes of the domestic and foreign economic situation , resolutely readjusted the orientation of macroeconomic control , and made a timely decision on shifting the primary task in macroeconomic control from curbing inflation to expanding domestic demand and overcoming deflation .  
The making of such a change was an important and timely strategic decision made by the party central leading body and the State Council according to its correct analysis of the domestic and international situation and development tendencies , with principal contradictions being grasped accurately .  
For the purpose of curbing deflation and expanding domestic demand , the implementation of a positive financial policy was consistently combined with the implementation of a moderate and stable monetary policy .  While efforts were made to promote economic growth , attention was also paid to keeping the smooth and stable operation of the economy .  
The fundamental approach to dealing with all our existing problems , including such economic construction problems as insufficient domestic demand , an irrational industrial structure , and uneven development across the regions and such political problems as the unification of the motherland , lies in accelerated development .  
Our comprehensive national capability is now of a substantial size .  Our gross domestic product is expected to reach 8,600-billion yuan for 2000 , with the overall economic volume being the seventh largest in the world ; foreign exchange reserves total over $ 160-billion ;  
Early in the War to Resist the United States and Help Korea , suddenly arriving new armaments were strange to many officers and soldiers because officers and soldiers of our armed forces had rather low scientific and educational levels and had all along used rather crude armaments during long years of domestic war .  Thus , in the second campaign , over 2,000 captured automobiles were destroyed by bombings executed by US armed forces because basically no one was able to drive an automobile to a place under cover .  
People have paid increasingly greater attention to such a harsh reality : With the process of economic globalization gathering pace and the scope of opening to the outside world expanding , national boundaries have been broken by fierce market competition , and the two markets , domestic and international , are gradually integrated .  
our domestic market has huge potential ; the socialist market economic system has taken shape ; the pattern of opening up in all directions is basically established , and all these factors have laid the sound foundation for accelerating development .  
Under the " Ninth Five-year Plan " in particular , despite the complicated domestic and international situations , China 's national economy still sustained rapid and healthy development ; the GDP grew at an average rate of 8 percent a year , and it is estimated that the year 2000 ' s GDP will top more than 8.7-trillion yuan , or more than $ 1-trillion at today 's exchange rate .  
In short , the opportunities globalization provides are objective opportunities , and we must seize these opportunities by participating in the globalization process , especially by joining the WTO , to fully utilize the international and domestic markets and resources , further perfect the socialist market economic system , accelerate the change in the pattern of economic growth and the adjustment of the economic structure , and continuously increase our international competitiveness .  
At the Party Central Committee 's conference on ideological and political work , Comrade Jiang Zemin noted that , " to do the ideological and political work well in the new period , we must profoundly analyze both the objective environment and the characteristics of the thinking of the larger number of cadres and the masses in the new situation from international , domestic , historical and realistic perspectives .  We must correctly examine and solve significant problems in both theory and reality that are influential to the thinking of cadres and the masses .  
After acceding to the WTO , China will engage in international economic and trade cooperation under the multilateral , stable , and unconditional most favored nation treatment provided by all WTO member countries .  It will enjoy the benefits of market access in other countries and regions , and international discriminatory trade restrictions will be eliminated in a step-by-step fashion .  This will create a beneficial international economic environment for developing China 's domestic economy and foreign economic relations and trade .  
From an overall perspective , China faces a good domestic and international environment for the development of foreign economic relations and trade next year ; global trade is expected to maintain a certain level of growth , and China 's domestic economy will continue to maintain fairly rapid growth .  
In recent years , China has faced complex domestic and international economic conditions .  In spite of this , China 's economy has continued the trend of sustained , rapid , and healthy growth .  
In recent years , the Central Committee has addressed the problems of overproduction and constant lowering of prices in China . In order to curb the trend of deflation , the Central Committee authoritatively made major policy decisions that included increasing domestic demand , the implementing positive fiscal policy , and stable and healthy currency policy studies .  They decided to issue more national bonds and increase infrastructure construction .  
Based on the overall strategic plan for national economic and social development for the new period , in the next five to 10 years the tourist industry should play a more vigorous role in promoting reform and opening-up , implementing the policy of expanding domestic demand , accelerating economic restructuring , and improving the people 's living standards .  
When moving into the new century , we have all reasons to believe that under the guidance of the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and under the strong leadership of the party central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , we will certainly be able to surmount all challenges and risks from either domestic or foreign factors , and the banner of socialism will flutter high on the vast land of China for ever .  
Similar to the criminal syndicates outside of Mainland China , domestic criminal and vicious groups have tried one-thousand and one ways to place themselves under a " protective umbrella . "  They have tried by hook or by crook to infiltrate into party and government organizations to seek political protection even to the point of directly seizing political power .  This is an extremely dangerous signal .  It is terribly harmful .  
Recently , a leading Taiwan official openly claimed that cross-strait transport links are " special international routes " and " the formulation that cross-strait links are domestic routes is absolutely unacceptable , " adding that this has involved the serious issue of so-called " national prestige . "  
Since Iraq recovered its domestic and some of its international air routes , more than 40 foreign planes have flown to Baghdad carrying ranking government officials and humanitarian materials , including even some US political figures , and the " no-fly zone " set up by the United States and Britain in fact exists only in name ; the United States has felt all the more that it " has no face at all " and seeks to demonstrate its powerful military strength and Gulf presence by bombing Iraq .  
Not only has it been innovative in adopting new ideological concepts and modes of thinking in carrying out its domestic construction , it has also changed the isolationism of its past foreign policy , enthusiastically taking the initiative in developing relations with various countries .  
In recent years , given the complicated circumstances where international struggles changed tremendously and domestic reforms constantly intensified , and in the face of severe economic , political and natural tests , the united front promoted a united and stable political situation and also created a vigorous and vital democratic atmosphere .  It has relied most on Deng Xiaoping Theory , and united front theory for the new period , in particular .  
We must uphold the policy of expanding domestic demand , continue to implement a proactive fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy , use various macro-control means in an integrated manner , and strengthen and develop the excellent economic growth situation .  
Deputy Ren Shimao , Secretary of the Huangshi municipal party committee , noted : those enterprises that intend to go abroad must upgrade their business management concepts , which include : taking the initiative in striking out on the international market , being prepared for surviving and growing amid fair competition in the international and domestic markets , attaching great importance to information collection both at home and abroad , and respecting others ' intellectual property rights while safeguarding ours . 
In conclusion , Committee Member Song Linfei stressed that , besides system innovation and efforts by enterprises , speeding up the urbanization process , bringing into full play the synergy of factors , strengthening the role of agricultural industrialization in promoting urbanization , and forming strong regional economic centers and growth points are also important strategic measures that should be taken in order to raise the international competitiveness of our domestic economy and cope with economic globalization .  
They briefed each other on their respective domestic situations and had an extensive exchange of views on further developing the relations of friendly cooperation between the two parties and the two countries of China and DPRK , on regional and international relations , and on other issues of common concern .  
Therefore , our military 's attitude toward the recent international focus of topics on Aegis frigates is of a very low key , thinking the heated debate of this topic will not help Taiwan obtain the Aegis frigates .  Furthermore , the Ministry of National Defense indirectly expressed its hope that the domestic military media will lighten the report on this issue .  
Facing the complex and complicated international and domestic environments , the vast number of officers and soldiers in the whole army have always affirmed their faith in Marxism , their conviction in socialism , their confidence in the reform and opening up and the modernization drive , and their trust in the party and the government .  They have further strengthened the concept of absolute leadership of the party over the army and more consciously maintained uniformity with the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core .  
During the period of the 10th Five-Year Plan , we should work closely around the goal of expanding domestic demand and adopt practical and effective macroeconomic fiscal policy and monetary policy to stimulate domestic market demand for investment and consumption in order to promote economic growth and upgrade the industrial structure .  
At the same time , because various non-tariff measures will be prohibited , our country can not employ traditional protective measures to protect domestic markets for agricultural products .  We can only learn and explore " the green box policy " with which we are unfamiliar , and , in certain regards , do not have the proper conditions to employ .  Thus , we will be in a unfavorable position to employ trade protection for our agricultural products .  
After our entry into WTO , domestic agricultural markets will certainly come into contact with the international market .  Faced with the unified , large international market which has over one-hundred years of history and which enjoys increasingly sound and healthy systems and operational mechanisms , such short-comings as the split between trade , industry and agriculture , disconnects between production and marketing , and enclosed , excessive and disorderly regional competition in our domestic agricultural market which has been divided by departments and administrative regions will be fully exposed .  
The overall quality of the main bodies of our rural markets does not measure up to that in developed western countries .  Many peasants and farm enterprises not only do not understand international agricultural trade , but also have little knowledge about the domestic market situations involving agricultural products and agricultural key elements .  It will be hard for them to participate in a timely and effective way in vigorous international market competition after our entry in the WTO .  
At this time , we must do an outstanding job on the following key links : first , we must entirely eliminate market barriers to realize self-motivated commodity trading and free commodity circulation and to ensure timely and rapid transportation of domestic agricultural products to the international market .  
He said that , in line with the international trend and existing domestic precedent , using high-tech principles to mix electronic sound with natural sound could unite the opera house and concert hall into one .  That would mean building only an opera house and a Beijing Opera playhouse , or one cultural square with two structures , which would save much investment .  
He noted that Taiwan has its fixed territory and stable government and can exercise its domestic power and international functions in a normal way .  " I am positive that based on typical and customary definitions of the international law , Taiwan qualifies to be a state , " he said .  
The source said that " a sense of crisis " was especially stressed at the Central Work Conference held earlier this year .  Analysis by the central authorities shows that the current domestic and international situation is intense .  
We are convinced that the Chinese Government can certainly and properly solve this matter according to the norm of international law and based on protecting state sovereignty and best interests , win extensive sympathy and support from world people , and defend a stable international and domestic environment needed for carrying out reform , opening up and economic construction .  
Jin Chanrong said : Currently , the political and diplomatic channels remain the main channels for solving the plane collision incident .  The denunciations made by the Chinese Communist side against the US side 's violation of international law and the mainland 's domestic laws were mainly aimed at supporting its own position , not aimed at taking any legal action .  
Once a vessel , either domestic or foreign , enters the waters covered by the harbor radar , it must declare its name , number , and tonnage to the control center and have them registered .  The radar monitor screen at the control center will clearly display the course , speed , position , and relative orientation of all vessels entering and leaving the harbor , enabling precise pilotage for them .  
Wang has conducted surveys of some joint venture enterprises in the coastal region of southern China , an area which is seen by many domestic and foreign companies as an excellent processing base , and as long as the design and standards for electronic products are provided , there are various ready-made associated facilities there , from raw materials and parts / components to assembly , etc .  
Wang Zhile surveyed some joint venture enterprises in southern China 's coastal area , which is regarded by many domestic and foreign corporations as the best processing base .  One only has to provide the designs and standards for electronic products , because all kinds of necessary factories , from raw materials , spare parts , to assembly , are already there .  
Wang Zhaoguo emphatically pointed out : Facing the very complicated current international situation and formidable domestic construction tasks , comrades of the united front must have a clear understanding of the situation , firm up their confidence , keep their heads cool , and adhere to the socialist road with Chinese characteristics .  
The committee members held that the economic situation in the first quarter of this year was rather stable , and the gross domestic product increased by 8.1 percent according to comparable prices over the same period of the previous year .

In the wake of expanded market access , tariff reduction , and elimination of non-tariff measures , foreign products , services , and investment will enter the Chinese markets en masse , and the domestic enterprises will face even more intense competition .  The township enterprises , in particular , are marked by the inherent poor quality among many of them , as demonstrated by , one , some enterprises ' extensive management mode .  Their environment is filthy , chaotic , and inferior ;  
People have noticed that after this incident occurred , political leaders in the United States showed a truculent and unreasonable attitude .  They were forced to express their regret to the Chinese side only after facing tremendous domestic and international pressure .  
The recently published " Blue Paper on Chinese Economic Forecasting , " which was put together by several well-known economists , predicts that China 's GDP will grow about 7.8 percent this year , barring a major deterioration in the international economic environment and provided that the Chinese government continues to base macroeconomic regulation and control on an active fiscal policy , properly coordinates the various macroeconomic regulatory and control measures , and further stimulates domestic demand .  
Xiang Huaicheng said : In order to encourage enterprises at home and abroad to participate in developing and building China 's western region , the Chinese Government has adopted some preferential policies in the tax revenue sector : The income taxes of domestic and foreign-investment enterprises engaged in industries that are encouraged to develop in the western region by the state will be reduced at a rate of 15 percent within a certain period ;  
Among the prohibitive clauses , the revised law has added the stipulations of prohibiting the married people from cohabiting with the persons other than their spouses and prohibiting domestic violence .  This has enhanced , in legislation , the dynamics of safeguarding monogamy and protecting the personal rights of family members .  This has also provided a basis in basic law for stemming unlawful behaviors of this kind through other legal means .  
Dai Xianglong , governor of the People 's Bank of China who is attending the Fortune Global Forum 2001 in Hong Kong , said today that when facing the slowdown of the world economic growth , China will continue to carry out its positive financial policy and moderate and prudent monetary policy , extensively open domestic markets , continue to increase its foreign exchange reserve , and continue to maintain the stability of the Renminbi exchange rates .  
In order to consolidate the good momentum of a turnaround in the economy this year and comprehensively size up the situation , China will continue to practice an active fiscal policy : First , we will issue 150-billion yuan worth of long-term construction bonds , with the focus on investment in sectors with the nature of " public items " such as infrastructure , environmental protection , and science and education ; we will increase effective domestic demand and also promote economic restructuring , innovation in science and technology , and sustainable development .  
When giving a briefing about Cambodian 's domestic situation , Hun Sen said : Under the leadership of King Sihanouk , Cambodia terminated the civil war and the consequent domestic turmoil which lasted many years , realized national reconciliation , and moved onto the path of national reconstruction with the cooperation of all political parties inside the parliament .  
As market competition gets increasingly sharp , state-owned enterprises , especially state-owned large companies and enterprise groups must strive to become international advanced enterprises , have an accurate grasp of the changes in domestic and international markets and the development direction of leading technology , find out the gap with international advanced enterprises , formulate a scientific and rational development strategy and a technological innovation plan , and clearly define what they endeavor to catch up with and surpass and where they should develop themselves .  
Right now , a considerable number of domestic enterprises are relatively low in standard .  Some of our enterprises carry out extensive management , while others are backward in technology and equipment .  Still others are weak in carrying out technical innovations .  
The new edition of " Military Doctrine " approved by Putin , which opposes NATO 's eastward expansion , has for the first time put forward the viewpoint that Russia 's national security is faced with " the danger of foreign invasion and domestic trouble and the aggravation of outside threat will constitute a military threat " to Russia .  
In recent years , your distinguished government has devoted itself to maintaining domestic political stability , vitalizing the national economy and promoting social progress , and has achieved positive results .  
We should closely associate with the domestic and international situation , military construction and the ideological reality of every individual person .  We should inspect ourselves in accordance with the requirements of the " three represents " , profoundly consider and effectively understand the essence and internal relations of the " three represents " .  We must thoroughly understand the historical background and the era-oriented significance of the " three represents " .  
Thus it is very natural for the Chinese people bullied and humiliated by superpowers from Western countries and domestic reactionary forces over the past 100-plus years ? to look forward to the socialist ideal - expect their country to be prosperous , rich and strong , but without the phenomena of a huge gap between the rich and the poor and the weak being bullied by the strong .  
US domestic and foreign policies will definitely have a tremendous effect on the world because of the United States ' superpower status in the world .  In particular , the readjustment of US military strategy will not be limited to US security only .  We can see that the political scheme and economic needs from that readjustment will have a major impact on the international political structure and strategic environment of the entire 21st century .  
It is for this reason that Comrades Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin , respectively the core of the first three generations of the leadership group of the Party Central Committee , published at crucial moments in the revolution and construction important speeches on " the current situation and the task , " comprehensively and correctly analyzed the domestic and international situation at that time and educated the Party , the military and the people .  
Particular efforts should be devoted to meticulously studying Chairman Jiang 's expositions on how we should understand the historical progress of development of socialist society , how we should understand historical progress of the development of capitalist society , how we should understand the influence on people 's thinking exerted by our practice of socialist reform and how we should understand the impact of the current international environment and international political struggles .  These expositions should be regarded as the guiding principle and fundamental basis for observing and understanding the international and domestic situation .  
Faced with complicated and dynamic international situations and domestic situations which are rapidly changing , some particularly significant unexpected issues over the past years , the Party Central Committee , with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , took a broad and long-term view of issues , devised strategies in a confident manner , and handled expected and sudden issues in a confident and calm manner , which embodied extraordinary leadership skills and the ability to handle complicated situations .  
At the time when the US economy is in recession and the depreciation of Japanese yen and Korean won has reduced the competitive edges of China 's exports , China 's economic officials and scholars maintain that devaluation of renminbi to stimulate exports and the economy is not likely in the foreseeable future , and that further expanding domestic demand and increasing investment and consumption remain to be China 's only correct policy measure for the present to cope with global economic slowdown .  
Some economists of China hold the view that the adverse influence of the decrease in exports on China 's economy has begun to show , but as long as we expand domestic total demand and implement the proactive financial policy and the steady currency policy , we will be able to sustain the stable growth , and there will be no need to adopt the policy of stimulating exports and the economy by appropriately devaluing renminbi .  
The Chinese Government will continue to carry out its vigorous financial policy and its steady currency policy in 2001 , and will steadily promote economic structural adjustment and its western development strategy , so the domestic economy will maintain steady and continuous growth .  
The meeting will center on the two major issues of preparations for the 16th CPC Congress and the international and domestic economic situations : First , the CPC Central Political Bureau will set out requirements on fostering senior leading cadres , so as to provide a basis for examining the qualifications of 16th CPC Central Committee members .

Especially since the beginning of the 1990 ' s , with the continuous progress of the domestic and international situation and the magnificent cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , the central leadership collective of the party with Jiang Zemin as the core has adhered to the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts , and made new explorations in practice and a new summarization in theory of many major economic , political , cultural , military , and diplomatic issues , thus enriching and developing Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
We should understand the political value of the important thinking of the " three represents , " not only in light of the international environment faced by our country but also in light of the domestic tasks to be completed , particularly social issues .  
A division of Jinan Military Area Command regarded strengthening the leadership over ideological and political work as an important responsibility of party committees .  In light of the rapid development in the international and domestic situations as well as with frequent occurrence of crucial issues , this division promptly analyzed the ideological trend of the military , and adhered to the system according to which leading cadres give reports on the situation , answer questions that officers and soldiers are generally concerned about and use decisions made by the party Central Committee to unite thinking .  
Second , in order to expand domestic demand , should give 900-million farmers priority in benefiting from infrastructure investment that the state should be making in the countryside , including increasing road networks , water supply networks , electric supply networks , communications networks and radio and television networks between cities and the countryside , as well as inputs for the fundamental construction of farms , water conservancy and the ecological environment in the countryside , absorbing as many temporary farmers as possible and creating more employment opportunities for them .  
We should strive for diversification of property rights through multiple forms , such as standard public listing of companies , mutual purchase of shares by legal persons , domestic natural person investment , foreign investment , conversion of bank credits rights to equity , market share subscription , stock right transaction , and the holding of shares by employees of a company , and gradually establish and improve a standard system of corporate governance .  
We created a revolutionary path of encircling the cities from the rural areas and seizing state power by armed force .  With the people 's army as the backbone , we relied on the people and armed them .  We persisted in educating the officers and men in the party 's theory and program and defeated the better-equipped ferocious domestic and foreign enemies in the prolonged revolutionary wars .

Qiu Xiaohua was of the view that this year the theme of China 's economy is steady growth .  He predicted that steady growth in China 's domestic demand will be maintained in the near future and growths in both government and private investment will see a good development trend .  He added that , because of the government 's policy of encouraging utilization of foreign capital , it is expected that growth in foreign capital utilization also will be quite satisfactory .  
In the current trend of staff reduction in the domestic electronic sector , all factors and all personnel from the grass-roots level upward at home and abroad , who generated poor economic benefits , were strictly examined by enterprise owners .  
It is necessary to carry forward the fine study style of linking theory with practice .  The study should be closely linked with the fighting course of the party , with the profound changes in the domestic and international situation and in our country 's society , with the new things and new issues that we are facing in the work of party building .  The study of the speech should be combined with summing up work experience , solving problems , and promoting routine work .

The latest issue of the Hong Kong journal Economic Reporter carries an article by Yuan Gangming , Director of the Macroeconomic Research Office of the Institute of Economics in the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences expressing the belief that strong domestic demand during the first half of the year supported China 's continued economic upswing , while the slowdown in exports threatened the macroeconomic upswing , estimating that policy options for encouraging exports in the second half of the year will encounter difficulties , and therefore proposing that China seek accelerated growth led by domestic demand .  
The article expresses the belief that China will join the WTO before the end of the year , the openness of the domestic market will be increased , and the traditional means used to control import growth will be reduced , so there may be a rather significant growth in imports , while net exports will decline further , perhaps to the point where the trade surplus becomes a trade deficit , which would have a fairly serious adverse effect on macroeconomic stability .  
The foreign policy must serve the needs of domestic development : making the country strong and prosperous , developing the economy , and improving the living standard of the people .

After Comrade Jiang Zemin examined the current domestic and foreign situations and the mission of our Party , and after he analyzed how to persist in keeping the Party 's nature one as the vanguard of the working class in the new historical conditions so as to safeguard our Party 's advanced nature , he put forward this extremely profound explanation , making clear the orientation of Party construction in the new period .  
First of all , with regard to the " theory of the China threat " spread by certain people in the international and domestic arenas , the two parties stated that they have no territorial demands on each other and they will act in accordance with the principle of international law that territory and national borders are inviolable , strictly observe the national border between them , and build this border into a border of everlasting peace and friendship for all generations .  
There is an absolute relationship between escalating domestic unemployment rates and industries relocating operations overseas ; since the economic advisory committee wants to solve the problem of unemployment , but instead focuses on discussing opening up the " three links " and the problem of relaxing the " no haste , be patient " policy , it can not escape being contradictory .  
As result of the democratic reform and socialist transformation as well as the ongoing reforms and opening up , Tibet has liberated and developed its social productivity in an unprecedented scale .  Last year , the region 's gross domestic product was more than 50 times that of the period before the democratic reform in 1959 .  
On the one hand , we should seize the present favorable opportunities to speed up the technical transformation of our traditional industries , the renewal of our products , and the upgrading of our industries , through digesting and introducing advanced technologies from foreign countries .  On the other hand , we must also base our efforts on our existing domestic resources ;  
He briefed Jiang Zemin about Moldova 's domestic situation , and said that since the general elections earlier this year , Moldova has won the best opportune moment for the nation 's economic and social development .

On the " Falungong " issue , Yang Jiechi said , based on its unspeakable aims , " Falungong " has come up with a whole series of absurd theories such as " the earth will be destroyed many times , " practiced mental control of its followers , and proclaimed that there is no need for sick people to seek medical treatment ; over 1,600 practitioners have died as a result , causing many domestic tragedies .  
The after-effects of the financial crisis still exist in certain countries in varying degrees , resulting in political turmoil and conspicuous ethnic , religious , and other social contradictions , seriously affecting the confidence of domestic and foreign investors .  
However , on the whole , the slowdown in global economic growth will not have a serious impact on China 's economy : Firstly , China has a huge domestic market ; public investment and private consumption take up most of the total supply and demand ; and economic growth in real terms is based on domestic demand .  
An informed person in Beijing said that because of weak foreign demand , the State Council has decided to continue the policy of expanding domestic demand in the second half of the year .  The Ministry of Finance will apply to the National People 's Congress next month for an additional issue of 50-billion yuan of constructive treasury bonds , and plans to distribute them to commercial banks in late October after the approval .  
He pointed out : With the economic slowdown in the developed countries of the United States and Japan , the principal driving force behind China 's economic growth ( 8.1 percent ) in the first half of the year mainly came from domestic demand .  The task of expanding domestic demand is still very urgent and must not be relaxed at all .  
China uses its military power to ensure a safe and secure domestic and foreign environment for our national economic construction and reform and opening up , to protect our national interest , national dignity and international prestige .  These all fall into the category of a self-protection strategy .  
Proceeding from the profound changes in the domestic and international situation faced by our party and from major historical tasks shouldered by our party , the speech systematically and penetratingly expounded the scientific connotation and the spiritual essence of the important idea of " three represents . "

4 .  The Government should assess the feasibilities of establishing an offshore capital market .  According to international regulation , Taiwan should be prepared to establish an offshore capital market that operates independently from the domestic market .  Taiwan should attract overseas businesses , including the Taiwan businesses now operating on the Mainland , to become listed businesses or to issue securities in US dollar in this capital market .  
The fact that after being elected prime minister Koizumi insisted on stating that he would pay respects at the shrine , heedless of domestic opposition and external protests , shows not only his individual political attitude but is also an expression of the swelling growth of rightist forces in society , and people should be particularly concerned about this .  
Given this , in order to divert public attention from domestic economic issues , allow himself a breathing spell , and win more time for working out new economic policies , Junichiro Koizumi deemed it necessary to create some political , diplomatic , and military news , and this is nothing but an old trick favored by some Japanese politicians .  
With the fall of the Socialist Party , the LDP lost its main opposition , and the restricting forces against the LDP were weakened substantially .  Consequently , its domestic and foreign policies , with heavy conservative overtones , can be " carried out without hindrance . "  In foreign policy , in particular , its US policy , and policies toward Asia and China , have shown an increasingly sharp contrast between close and distant relationships .  
Any historical assessment of Japan 's war of aggression has been subjected to rigorous historical examination by every successive postwar Japanese government , but their annual statements marking the " Day the War Ended " ( they dare not call it the " Day of Surrender " ) have all been disappointing .  Disregarding strong domestic and foreign opposition , Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi insisted on paying his respects at Yasukuni Shrine , where a large group of war criminals is enshrined .  
As for which direction Japan is likely to move under Junichiro Koizumi 's leadership , we may view things from the following two aspects : First , insofar as domestic reform is concerned , Japan is expected to meet strong resistance and a host of difficulties , first and foremost , from Junichiro Koizumi 's Liberal Democratic Party , and thus , whether Japan 's reform can succeed and meet the Japanese people 's expectations is bound to have a direct bearing on the Junichiro Koizumi Administration ;  
Generally speaking , fluctuations in the exchange rate for the RMB are primarily driven by the following factors : domestic economic growth trends , situation of China 's international balance of payments , changes in interest rates inside and outside of China , the degree of liberalization of capital markets and social stability .  
After China 's entry to the WTO , she will have to act according to the relevant regulations , and with the basic premise of protecting the stability of the renminbi , use a phased liberalization of Chinese domestic capital markets .  This is because the protection of the exchange rate 's fundamental stability is beneficial to the long-term stability of Chinese economic growth .  
Some people close to the issue feel that international and domestic experiences all indicate that social stability is the fundamental guarantee of stable and rapid economic growth , and is also the foundation for a stable exchange rate for a currency .  
As Bush said that he regarded China as a " strategic competitor " during his election campaign , Henry Kissinger pointed out : Bush 's viewpoint is just an " immature expression aimed at pleasing the conservatives and the hard-liners in the Republican Party .

It was learned that the Beijing hierarchy believes that though potential of domestic demand remains optimistic , owing to a host of adverse factors that hamper domestic demand , the country still faces a rigorous situation in this regard .

At the same time , we should continue to practice the open strategy of " going out into the world , " make positive , rational , and effective use of foreign investment , and truly shift the focus of using foreign investment to importing advanced technology , modern management , and specialized talent , so as to spur the restructuring of the domestic economy .  
As China has fixed its economic goals at opening to the outside world in a comprehensive way , absorbing more foreign capital , and intensifying domestic competitive power , the pressure of Renminbi depreciation will not exist in the coming few years , instead , there is room and demand for its appreciation .

as published ] " and that he himself was " a citizen of a fallen state " shortly after escaping to Taiwan . Now the Taiwan authorities ' so-called " Republic of China " is in fact nothing but a historical issue left from the civil war between the Kuomintang [ KMT ] and CPC . It is illegitimate according to either domestic or international law and it fundamentally has no right to represent China .  
In front of the Zhongxing Communications stall , the general secretary had his attention attracted by a conference television system developed and produced by the company .  He carefully examined the product and inquired about development , production , and market in a detailed manner .

In his briefing to a news conference , which held by the Information Office of the State Council today , Liu Hong said : In 1999 , China 's gross domestic product topped the mark of 8,000 billion yuan , or an increased of 7.1 percent over the previous year calculated on comparable items , thus achieving the expected growth target . 
According to initial revelations , continuing to increase domestic demand , carrying out structural adjustments , pressing ahead with the great development of the western region , deepening reform of state-owned enterprises , stepping up efforts to rejuvenate the country by promoting science and education , and improving the social welfare and insurance systems , will be the vital parts of the report .  
The domestic economic situation also is not bad and has turned for the better since the second half of last year .  Inventories have dropped , enterprises ' economic results have improved , growth of the new - and high-technology and information industry has accelerated , the drop in prices has slowed down , and social consumption has increased steadily .  
In relevant reports , it also will be announced that a positive financial policy will be implemented this year - - the third consecutive year .  By issuing treasury bonds , the state will make financial investments to increase domestic demand and ensure economic growth .  
This vast strategy geared to the new century will not only help to attain common prosperity , strengthen the unity of nationalities , and maintain social stability and border tranquillity , and help to expand domestic demand , open up markets , and provide a new support force for economic development , but will also have a direct bearing on whether the goal of the third step in China 's modernization strategy ( to reach the standard of a medium , developed country by mid-century ) can be attained .  
The practices of ignoring the actual situation , criticizing the situation of human rights in other countries by wearing colored glasses , and even interfering in other countries ' domestic affairs under the pretext of " safeguarding " human rights , are in fact grossly trampling on human rights .  The move is not beneficial to the development of the international cause of human rights .  It also sabotages the North-South relations .  
Relevant experts have noted : According to a prediction based on a comprehensive analysis of both domestic and international factors , China 's economy is expected to remain in a new growth phase for a considerably long period of time to come , its average annual economic growth rate can be maintained at about 7 percent , and the country 's economy will show a sound development trend during the early years of the 21st century .

The foreign environmental protection enterprises ' natural link with the market economy enables them to gain advanced experiences in operational mechanism , market concepts , innovation awareness , personnel and distribution system , and others which are suited to the market economy .  These are useful experiences that the domestic environmental protection enterprises can use for reference in their development , reform , and transformation of operational mechanism at a faster pace so as to suit the major development trend of the environmental protection markets all over the world .  
While giving less attention to economic growth target , the government will give macroeconomic guidance to the major problems in economic development from an even higher level .  For instance , in vigorous promoting economic restructuring , the government will give consideration to the changes at the present stage of the domestic economic development and to the increasingly sharpened international competition .  Meanwhile , the government will not only manage to resolve immediate problems but also lay eyes on long-term development .

On the basis of summing up the experience of the Ninth Five-Year Plan and soberly analyzing the domestic and international situation at the turn of the century , the fifth plenum put forward the following major objectives for economic and social development during the 10th Five-Year Plan after carefully analyzing the situation : Maintain a relatively rapid speed of economic development , make progress in strategic economic restructuring and considerably improve the quality and efficiency of economic growth , in a bid to lay a solid foundation for doubling the GDP in 2010 compared with that of 2000 ;  
However , such a contrast does reflect , to a certain extent , a phenomenon , that is , unlike large-scale prominent enterprises in the overseas , some domestic enterprises fail to understand the historic opportunity arising from the development of the vast western region .  They lack the sense of urgency in grasping the opportunity .  It can not even be ruled out that some enterprises regard the party Central Committee 's strategic policy decision on the development of the western region as a political slogan .  
Now we are beginning to carry out the third-step strategy , that is , by the middle of the 21st century , China 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita will reach the level of moderately developed countries , and we will basically realize modernization and build a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized socialist country .  
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , in terms of the fundamental implementation of goals for the reform and development of the banking industry , it is estimated that during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , combined domestic and foreign financial loans increased by a total of 5.8 trillion yuan , for an average annual increase of 13.9 percent ;  
We must unswervingly focus on economic development by grasping opportunities and accelerating development .  This is a scientific decision made by the CPC Central Committee after making a correct judgment of international and domestic situation .  Facts related to China 's social development and national defense construction have proved that only when we have developed our economy , can we enhance our overall national strength and can the modernization of our armed forces have solid material foundation and strong personnel support .  
During his brief stay in the United States , Xiang Huaicheng also held talks with Summers and US National Economic Adviser Sperling [ si po lin ] .  The two sides exchanged views on international and domestic issues of common concern .  On 27 October , representatives of the Chinese Finance Ministry and the US Treasury Department will also hold a Sino-US financial dialogue and the first vice-ministerial-level session of the Sino-US Joint Economic Committee here to exchange views on such issues as capital markets , financial monitoring , corporate reorganization , and disclosure of accounting information .  
Both sides looked forward to the strengthening of cooperation in this regard .  They also noted that the APEC recently agreed to set up a working group that would conduct a survey of the domestic legal and regulatory frameworks for fighting financial crime in various economies .  
Wei Jianxing reiterated that the CPC is willing to develop fresh inter-party exchange and cooperation with the MPRP on the principle of independence and self-determination , total equality , mutual respect , and mutual noninterference in domestic affairs , so as to make new contributions to developing Sino-Mongolian good neighborly and friendly cooperative relations .  
According to a financial official , the total quantity control of the no haste , be patient policy absolutely will have no precise restriction on figures , but will take foreign investment demand , the amount of domestic funds , and the rate of economic growth as indexes .  
pay close attention to the tests facing party building under complicated domestic and foreign situations , carry out in-depth study of outstanding problems existing within the party , and earnestly solve them according to the important ideas of the " three represents [ representing the demands for the development of advanced social productive forces , representing the direction of the advanced culture in China , and representing the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people ] " ;  
Jiang Zemin said : Since the formation of the new Cambodian government , the two major ruling parties have , proceeding from the fundamental national and ethnic interests , cooperated unifiedly and worked hard to consolidate national reconciliation , developed the economy , actively developed foreign relations , and made tremendous achievements in domestic and foreign affairs work .  
Comrade Deng Xiaoping , chief architect of our country 's socialist reform and opening up , led all party comrades in emancipating their minds , seeking truth from facts , observing the characteristics of the times and the current international situation in an all-round way , summing up foreign and domestic socialist construction as well as historical and immediate experiences , and conducting difficult explorations , thus making important achievements in the theory and practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Dr . Zhao Jianglin pointed out : Judging from the present situation , the principal factors affecting the economic development in the ASEAN countries is the failure to set up a regional market so that they are unable to compete with the EU and other rivals .  In the future , the economies in the ASEAN countries will be regulated by stimulating domestic demand and enhancing efficiency .  
In accordance with the demands of economic development , we have upheld the guideline of expanding domestic demand , continued to implement an active fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy , vigorously pushed economic restructuring , strengthened the agricultural foundation , intensified the work of extricating state enterprises from difficulties , instituted the strategy of major development of west China , and adopted various means to expand exports .  
Uphold the guideline of expanding domestic demand , continue to practice an active fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy , and make comprehensive use of various means of macroeconomic regulation and control , to consolidate and develop the good momentum of economic growth .  
All these fully indicate the outstanding ability and leadership art of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core in controlling the overall economic situation under complex international and domestic situations .  These also suggest that the central authorities ' major decisions , principles , and policies on economic work are absolutely correct .  
The party 's third generation of leadership collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core upholds the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory and the party 's basic line ; despite varied and complicated international and domestic conditions , meets grim challenges of various types , including economic , political , and natural ; and firmly grasps the key theme of great unity and great union to further strengthen and develop the broadest patriotic united front .  
Three days after the tragedy , Beijing has learned from domestic and foreign media that Dongguan people had strong dissatisfaction at the casualty tolls - - eight persons dead and 32 injured - - published by local government .  The Beijing high echelon has also learned from a reliable source that the death toll was more than eight and , therefore , believed that Dongguan is concealing the truth .  
In the near term , the continuous practice of the proactive financial policies and moderate monetary policies is the concrete measure for carrying out the policy of expanding domestic demand , which is needed to ensure the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
In recent years foreign investment by developed countries has tended to be concentrated in a number of sectors which require small investment , yield high profit , and are regionally concentrated ; this not only runs counter to the goal of the host countries in making efforts to develop hi-tech industry , but is also extremely prone to result in foreigners controlling the pattern of industry and domestic market , and this directly endangers the economic lifelines of the developing countries .  
The local departments in charge of economic and trade matters must tightly seize this advantageous time of economic growth and the opportunity of the country 's impending WTO accession to vigorously forge ahead , actively make breakthroughs , and work hard to open up new prospects in domestic and foreign trade .  
The election this year was held at a time when the US economy is prospering for the ninth successive year , the social environment is relatively stable , and the United States has maintained its strong international status .  According to convention , this domestic and foreign situation should benefit the ruling Democratic Party instead of the opposition Republican Party .  
The DPP 's numerous domestic policy changes , which are rife with contradictions , have accelerated foreign migration of industries and capital and caused severe depression in the stock market , depreciation of the Taiwan dollar , and considerable shrinkage of people 's assets .  
After an arduous struggle , Texas Governor George W . Bush finally becomes the new US president in the new millennium and new century .  Bush 's campaign road was rough and rugged , and his road to the White House will not be smooth .  According to an analysis , the new Bush administration faces four stern challenges : How to suit the domestic situation of balance of power between the left and the right and appropriately take a centrist road ;  
We must adhere to the principle of expanding domestic demand , continue to implement a proactive financial policy and a moderate monetary policy , comprehensively use all means of macroeconomic regulation and control to consolidate and develop the good situation of economic growth and promote the sustained , rapid and healthy development of the national economy and comprehensive social progress , and strive to make a good start in fulfilling the Tenth Five-year Plan .  
American media started to call Clinton a " lame duck " before the curtain was raised on the election campaign in the first half of this year , meaning that as he was soon to leave office , domestic attention switched the new master of the White House who would replace him , while international opinion would gradually take an attitude of observation , so it would be hard to him to have much impact on domestic and foreign affairs in the future .  
Zeng Peiyan said : In 1998 , the CPC Central Committee decided to implement a proactive fiscal policy in order to overcome the adverse impact of the Asian financial crisis , expand domestic demand , and maintain sustained , rapid , and healthy national development .  
China 's grain production capacity has rapidly advanced in recent years but the cost has increased progressively at an average annual rate of 10 percent and the structural imbalance between supply and demand has manifested itself increasingly and had a negative effect on increasing peasants ' income and on state finances .  Except for rice , domestic grain prices generally have been 20 percent higher than prices on the world grain market during this period .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents " was precisely put forward from the high ground of the future and destiny of the party and state on the basis of a sober understanding and accurate grasp of the domestic and international situation , the historical tasks shouldered by the party and the reality of party building , as well as on the basis of a thorough analysis and profound summary of the positive and negative experiences of the building of proletarian political parties , especially the building of our own party .  
The introduction of these policies and measures is conducive to increasing fund input for the western development , improving the environment for investment in the western region , opening the western region still wider to both foreign and domestic investors , and giving greater support to the development of science , technology , education , and the training of talented personnel in the western region .  It will certainly produce an important effect in pushing forward the implementation of the large-scale western development strategy in a positive and orderly way .  
Zeng : To put the large-scale western development into effect , we should be adapted to the trend of economic globalization and China 's upcoming accession to the WTO , seize the opportunity of opening up still wider to foreign and domestic investors , enlarge the spheres of investment by foreign businessmen , broaden the channel of using foreign capital , make positive use of foreign loans , vigorously develop foreign economic relations and trade , and expand economic and technological exchange and cooperation with various countries in the world including the neighboring countries .  
To put the large-scale western development into effect , we should also adapt our work to the requirements of instituting and perfecting a nationwide unified market system , seize the opportunity of opening to the domestic sectors , break down regional barriers , smash departmental and industrial monopoly , further open the markets , and encourage and support enterprises in the eastern and central regions to make investment and operate business in the western region .  
In 1998 , in order to counter the adverse effects of the Asian financial crisis and continue the national economy 's sustained , rapid , and healthy development , the Party Central Committee decided to implement a policy to expand domestic demand by issuing more treasury bonds to finance long-term construction projects and strengthen infrastructure constructions .  
At the NPC Standing Committee 's request , the arrangements and utilization of long-term treasury construction bonds have focused on expanding domestic demand to spur economic growth , promote structural readjustments , and lay a solid foundation of the country 's long-term development .  Projects already underway were given priority , and preferences were given to the central and western regions , especially the west .  
The party at large must center on this topic , conduct investigations and studies , reach a consensus , and respond by taking into full account changes in the international and domestic situations , growth of our country 's productive forces and profound transformations of the economic system , calls for the development of the material and cultural life of the masses , and major changes in the contingent of party members and cadres .  
Although the overall international situation tends to be eased up , the forces of hegemony and power politics still exist .  They rely on their economic and scientific and technological edge to interfere in the domestic affairs of other countries and attempt to control the world , thereby threatening world and regional peace and stability .  
Many of the existing favored treatment measures in tariff reduction and waivers can be studied and readjusted ; by this means we can not only expand the tariff base and ensure that revenue will not be reduced as the tariff rate falls but , as the total value of imports rises , tariff revenue will show a big increase , and in particular , it can protect the healthy development of domestic industries in an environment of equal competition and avoid conflicting with the demands of the WTO rules .  
At the meeting , Zhu Rongji pointed out : In the past five years , the people of all nationalities throughout the country were united in brave advancement under the leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core to make great achievements in all areas , fulfill the Ninth Five-Year Plan as scheduled , and successfully achieve the second-step strategic objective of modernization in the face of complex international and domestic situations .  
The Chinese and Korean party and state leaders briefed the other side on their domestic situation in a cordial and friendly atmosphere , and exchanged views on the further development of bilateral relations as well as major international issues of common interest . 
Since the beginning of winter , there have been six major snowfalls in the eastern and central parts of Inner Mongolia . The low temperatures and accumulated snow throughout an extensive scope have become disastrous to 1.6 million people in 31 banners and counties of five leagues in the autonomous region , and a large number of domestic animals have frozen to death .  
All this will definitely provide various business opportunities for Hong Kong . For example , Hong Kong may raise and provide funds , financial services , and other relevant professional service for the development projects in the western part of China , and may directly launch investment projects there as well .  The local advantages in the interior areas may be used in cooperative production , and the products may be exported and directly shipped to domestic markets in other areas .  
Through competition between the same trades at home and abroad , our investment climate will improve further and our domestic markets will completely be open to the outside world .  The government on the mainland is sparing no efforts to create conditions for encouraging investment in the central and western regions .  Under these new circumstances , Hong Kong businessmen in the mainland will face issues such as how to expand and upgrade themselves , how to shift their orientation to high technology and additional high value , and how to carry out a new regional distribution program .  
It has been learned that at an informal discussion meeting of a domestic databank on Wednesday , which has not been made public , McVadon specially clarified the main purpose of his speech delivered on Monday . He said he did not mean Taiwan need not deploy the TMD , and he thought because Taiwan is close to the mainland , the early warning time is short , and even if Taiwan has a complete missile defense system , it still can not intercept so many short-range missiles from the other side of the Taiwan Strait .  
Since the beginning of 2000 , the volume of contracted foreign investment has rapidly recovered and begun to climb up , driven by the effect of the pending WTO accession and a major turnaround in China 's domestic economy .  However , the volume of actual foreign investment continued to drop , due to the delayed effect from the drop of contracted foreign investment in the previous year .  By the end of November , the amount of foreign investment in real terms was 2.29 percent lower than the same period of the previous year .  
Zhu Mingxian said : At the critical period of China 's economic structural adjustment , it is imperative to firmly seize the quality work as the main direction of attack , which is of extremely important significance to expanding domestic demands and practicing the proactive financial policy .  
President Chen pointed out that as a state leader , he deeply understands the implications of cross-Strait relations on domestic politics , foreign relations , economy and trade , national defense and other sectors .  He described this as " a slight move in one part may affect the situation as a whole . "  He also recognized the popular wish for a " stable and peaceful situation in the Taiwan Strait . "  
Shi Fenghai pointed out : It is expected that foreign capital will be concentrated first in high-profit business fields and areas - - international and domestic long-distance calls , IP telephony , Beijing , Shanghai , Guangzhou , and other important eastern areas will become the key business fields and areas which foreign capital will enter .  
China must go further to expand domestic demand , promote sustained and stable economic development , and can not depend for a long time on methods of borrowing money from national financial organs .  It must expand the vigor of non-government investment , and make up an investment system and mechanism for the entire society that is driven by finance and investment , and in which non-government investment actively participates .  
The improvement of the state 's macroeconomic environment mainly included the adoption of a proactive financial policy and moderate monetary policy , the expansion of domestic demands , and the promotion of economic growth by means of investment , consumption , and export , which have played an excellent role in improving the external environment for enterprises ' production and operation .  
We must be sincerely patient , painstaking , and fair and reasonable in our education and guidance of the majority of " Falungong " practitioners , helping them to further understand the essence of and grave threat represented by Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " organization and walk away from the preposterous world he has fabricated so they have concern for the development of the international and domestic situation , the future fate of the Party and the country , and the great enterprise of reforms and opening up and the drive to socialist modernization .  
Presently , excessive export of capital is still unsuited for China , being a developing country .  Allowing domestic residents to invest in B shares with their legally owned foreign currencies , therefore , is a new subject stemming from the changes in the macroeconomic situation .  
Although it is impossible to make a concrete judgment before the detailed rules for the implementation of the policy are promulgated , yet the fact that foreign and domestic investors compete with one another to trade B shares in the same markets and their profits and losses are inevitably reflected in the balance of international payments in foreign exchange shows that , after all , extremely important progress has been made even though we can not say that the free convertibility of renminbi is right under our noses . 
Those attending today 's forum unanimously held : Putting forward this important thinking is of profound theoretical and practical significance , and it is a scientific thesis reached on the basis of summing up foreign and domestic experiences in governing countries as well as an enrichment and development of the Marxist theory of states ; it is also an important overall strategy for running the country put forward at a time when our country is entering a new stage of economic and social development .  
After listening to what others said , Jiang Zemin pointed out that since the beginning of the new century , profound changes have been taking place in the international situation , and the domestic tasks in reform and construction are also quite heavy and formidable .  He said that we have rare opportunities and favorable conditions for speeding up development , but we also face new situations , new contradictions , and new difficulties , and we may encounter all kinds of risks as we move ahead .  
The development environment over the next five years suggests that the 10th Five-Year Plan will be implemented against a backdrop that is entirely different from the backdrop to all previous five-year plans - - one that is characterized by China 's impending accession to the World Trade Organization , the growing trend toward economic globalization , the close integration of domestic and foreign markets , a world swept up in a knowledge-based economy and a new technological revolution , and the launching of the strategy of developing western China on a massive scale .  
To lay a solid foundation for achieving a gross domestic product in 2010 that is double the 2000 figure , the document is expected to call for maintaining a fairly rapid pace of national economic development , achieving remarkable results in the strategic realignment of the economic structure , and achieving marked improvements in the quality of economic growth and economic returns .  
Zhu Rongji said in his report : The main objectives of economic and social development in the next five years are as follows - - maintain a rather fast growth rate in the national economy , achieve marked results in the strategic adjustment of the economic structure , substantially enhance the quality and efficiency of the economic growth , lay a solid foundation for doubling the 2000 gross domestic product in 2010 ;  
This is because we have initially established the socialist market economy structure , and accumulated more experience in macroeconomic management and in regulation and control ; and we have overcome difficulties caused by insufficient effective domestic demand through implementing the guideline of expanding domestic demand and practicing an active fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy .  
At the turn of the century , China 's economy is facing a great deal of opportunities and challenges against the domestic and international background : After more than 20 years of reform and opening up , the domestic market has shaken off the longstanding condition of short supply , the structure of a market economy has been established in a preliminary form , and a fundamental change has occurred in foreign economic relations ;  
CPPCC member and Shanghai Fuxing High Tech ( Group ) Inc . CEO Guo Guangchang said that when China joins the WTO , the dynamics of financial opening to foreign counties will increase further , presenting our domestic economic and fiscal reform with new opportunities and challenges .  Opening up a non-government owned and operated bank market and preparing to establish non-government owned and operated banks is essential , and in every aspect of this the prerequisites have already matured .  
Delegate Jiang Demin believes that " We must improve the economic value for intellectuals .  Although domestic treatment still can not compare with that of foreign countries , we can adopt some special , favorable policies to permit talent returned from overseas to draw a certain percentage of sharing in the profits from their technologies , and permit them to hold multiple positions and salaries . "  
The ' outline ' of the " 10th Five-Year Plan " is predicated on the overall situation , long-term and fundamental needs and on the basis of analyzing domestic and foreign environmental factors and making scientific determinations , the plan takes a fresh look at the direction , goals , and path of our nation 's social and economic development in the new century - - our nation has begun to move towards the strategic goal of the third step .  
Nine hundred million of the total of over 1.2 billion people are in the rural areas .  The key to expanding domestic demand lies in developing the rural market , trying by every possible means to increase the peasants ' income , and turning the potential purchasing power in rural areas into actual purchasing power .  
In the 1980 ' s we started relatively early in opening up the trades of electric appliance and information industry equipment to the outside world .  While a number of enterprises have crumpled , after 10 and more years of efforts , some domestic enterprises have become well developed in the course of competition , typical among them are Haier , TCL , Changhong , Kangjia , Chunlan , Lianxiang , Changcheng and Huawei , which not only have won back a considerable share of the domestic market , but are advancing toward the world also .  
In the vast central and west region , the natural and human resources are abundant , the operational costs are cheap , the domestic markets are huge , and the scientific and technological development and manufacturing industry have also had considerable foundations .  
All the armed forces stood up to the rigorous tests of complicated international and domestic situations as well as military and political struggles , always kept a high degree of stability , centralization , and unification , and accomplished with flying colors such tasks as conducting major military exercises , fighting floods and dealing with emergencies , holding a military review in celebration of the 50th founding anniversary of the PRC , and assuming the defense responsibilities in Hong Kong and Macao , making important contributions to defending and building the motherland .  
It is necessary to promote development through opening up , to always persist in implement the strategy of opening to the outside world to bring along economic development , and to raise the level of our work in using resources at home and from abroad and both the international and domestic markets .  We should cater to the domestic market and seize business opportunities ; we should advance both east and west and make it possible for the eastern and western regions complement each other with their own advantages .  
Competition in the aspect of agricultural development comes more often from the foreign market than from the domestic market .  As far as hundreds of millions of peasants are concerned , it is rather difficult to increase their incomes by simply relying on growing crops .  Having insufficient stamina , township enterprises , which flourished some years ago , find it hard to become a major channel for increasing peasants ' incomes in a short period of time .  
deepen reforms , expand opening-up , strive to make the two fundamental changes , take the initiative in advancing in the front of institutional and technological innovations , actively make use of both domestic and overseas resources , open up both domestic and international markets , gather momentum and vigor of sustained development ;  
We should adhere to the policy of expanding domestic demand and continue to follow a proactive fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy so as to promote the steady growth of effective demand and the adjustment of economic structure .  We should strengthen the foundation position of agriculture , increase peasants ' income , and consolidate and expand results in helping state-owned enterprises carry out reform and eliminate deficits .  
In accordance with the domestic and international situation our nation is facing , the outline of the Tenth Five-Year Plan sets forth the main objectives , guiding principles , and major tasks for economic and social development in our country , points out the orientation for our further advances , and gives expression to the fundamental interests and common wishes of the entire people of all ethnic groups throughout the country .  
The key to conforming to the general trend of readjusting the world 's economic structure and striving to hold a still more advantageous position in the international and domestic division of labor lies in building up an industrial pattern with optimum structure and high competitive power .  
Legqog excitedly said : Tibet has developed fastest in the past seven years .  Its annual gross domestic product ( GDP ) has topped 10 billion yuan , and its economic-growth rate has surpassed the country 's average for seven years in succession , reaching 12.9 percent ; Tibet has basically fulfilled the 2000 objectives and tasks set for it at the Third Central Forum on Tibet 's Work .  
Since the second half of 1998 , under the leadership of the party central committee and the State Council , the State Development Planning Commission started to organize personnel to make preliminary preparations and conduct investigation and study for the formulation of the 10th Five-Year Plan , which included more than 140 special subjects totaling as many as five million words and covered such contents as the basic judgment on the domestic and international environments , the principal development targets , the basic strategic choices , the main considerations about policies , and so on .  
It is necessary to further improve the investment environment , formulate policies that will encourage investment in geographic survey , prospecting and developing mineral resources in the western areas , guiding domestic and foreign investors to making investment in the western areas , and promoting the sustained , high-speed , and healthy development of mining industries in the western areas .  
from investment to consumption and to other fields , a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy have been implemented flexibly , the policy of expanding domestic demand has been resolutely pursued , and measures for macroeconomic regulation and control have been highly effective .  
Further expanding domestic demand will make it possible for us to have the initiative in our hands in developing the economy and maintaining sustained and steady economic growth , and this is also a strategic move in smoothly carry out the 10th Five-Year Plan and fulfilling the third-step development objective .

Meanwhile , local credit demand continued to be subdued , with loans for trade financing falling by 1.2 % and other loans rising by a meagre 0.1% , as domestic economic activity remained slow .  
Notwithstanding the sharp currency depreciation in the region , the price competitiveness of Hong Kong 's exports was preserved to a considerable extent by the continued downward adjustment in export prices , moderating domestic inflation , and upgrading of productive efficiency and product quality . 
In macro terms , this means greater transparency and disclosure , greater accountability , stronger domestic financial systems , liberal trade , open financial markets , a high quality of regulation , and independent legal processes .  
In broad numbers , there is tremendous potential for the Asian bond market .  At the end of September 1997 , the nominal value of all outstanding bonds issued by Asian economies , including Japan , was about US $ 6 trillion .  Out of this amount , about 90% were domestic bonds , that is , bonds denominated in local currencies .

About 2,000 tonnes are either part of domestic waste and go straight to landfills , mostly through USD and RSD collection services , or are of poor quality or contaminated commercial waste that the collectors again take direct to the landfills or refuse transfer stations .  
The spokesman explained that the distinct narrowing in the visible trade deficit in 1998 reflected the adjustment in domestic demand upon the impact of the regional financial turmoil , which led to a marked decline in imports retained for local use .

In the first quarter of 2003 , the value of domestic exports classified to the four major industries of wearing apparel ; textiles ; machinery , equipment , apparatus , parts and components ; and consumer electrical and electronic products together accounted for 75% of Hong Kong 's total domestic exports of manufactured goods , according to statistics released today ( May 12 ) by the Census and Statistics Department .  
Comparing March 2003 with a year earlier , decreases were recorded in the volume of domestic exports of most principal commodity groups , with particularly large declines recorded for " scientific , medical , optical , measuring , and controlling instruments and apparatus " and " electronic components " .  
Overall investment spending , as represented by gross domestic fixed capital formation ( GDFCF ) , had a modest growth of 3.9% in real terms in the first quarter of 2003 over a year earlier , after a 0.7% decline in the fourth quarter of 2002 . 
The strong current account surplus reflected both an improvement in competitiveness , resulting from the depreciation of the real effective exchange rate , and weak domestic demand .  
An environmentalist is reported to have stated that the underground drainage system in the area around Dundas Street in Mongkok has been misconnected , causing the inflow of sewage from commercial and domestic buildings into the stormwater drainage system and threatening the health of the residents in the vicinity .  As such sewage may not have undergone any treatment before it is directly discharged into the Victoria Harbour , the marine environment may be polluted .  
The presence of domestic sewage and trade effluent in the communal drains there is probably caused by illegal expedient connections between individual private buildings and the communal drainage system , or by the direct discharge of wastewater into the drains at roadsides or back lanes .  
Some public housing tenants have recently expressed certain demands in connection with the judicial review .  Since their demands are closely linked to the Authority 's decision to appeal , the Authority therefore decided this morning that upon conclusion of the legal proceedings and clear judgment from the court on the proper interpretation and implementation of the relevant legal provisions , it would proceed to review its domestic rent policy and identify a satisfactory arrangement for rent adjustment immediately in accordance with the law . "  
For value of airborne domestic exports , decreases were registered for " electrical machinery , apparatus and appliances , and electrical parts thereof " ( by $ 2.8 billion or 45.3% ) , " professional , scientific and controlling instruments and apparatus " ( by $ 464 million or 55.4% ) and " miscellaneous manufactured articles consisting mainly of jewellery , goldsmiths ' and silversmiths ' wares " ( by $ 345 million or 9.7% ) in the first half of 2003 .  
In the second quarter of 2003 , the value of domestic exports classified to the four major industries of textiles ; wearing apparel ; machinery , equipment , apparatus , parts and components ; and consumer electrical and electronic products together accounted for 75% of Hong Kong 's total domestic exports of manufactured goods , according to statistics released today ( August 11 ) by the Census and Statistics Department .  
Overall investment spending , as represented by gross domestic fixed capital formation ( GDFCF ) , fell back by 5.3% in real terms in the second quarter of 2003 over a year earlier , following a 3.5% rise in the first quarter . 
The forecast rate of change in real terms in overall investment spending in the economy in 2003 , as represented by gross domestic fixed capital formation , is broadly unchanged at - 5.4% , as against - 5.5% put out earlier . 
They hope to meet domestic needs and also to sell their products abroad . One of the important factors deciding the quality of electric wire and cables is the copper " wick . " High quality electric wire and cables call for pure and highly malleable copper rod .  
Since the oil shock , the price of textile raw materials has skyrocketed , and meanwhile the people 's living standards were rising , resulting in higher labor costs . The developed countries protected their domestic textile industries with import quotas . Moreover , the ROC had been concentrating on the low-priced market . As such less-developed areas as the Philippines , India and Mainland China took advantage of very low labor costs and local resources , the competition grew .  
The Epidemic Disease Control panel supported continued cooperation with foreign organizations to develop a vaccine for hepatitis B . The overseas scholars set up a continuation committee to carry on this and related work . The Food Technology panel : Increase cooperative planning between domestic growers , producers , and exporters , increase the quality of products ; reduce overhead ; produce new processed foods to open new markets .  
One of the first national measures promulgated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs was in May 1981 . This legislation sought to contain the violation of trademarks and the false marks of " made in . . . " trend in domestic manufacturing of counterfeit goods . Conditions of this measure included : All products manufactured in the country had to have a label stating made in the Republic of China as well as proper evidence of registration from importing countries for OEM items .  
As the economy industrialized , however , domestic makers began to supply spare parts and accessories and maintenance services , gradually developing the ability to make simple goods , until today where the product range extends from machines that make instant noodles to those that manufacture concrete and chemical products .  
The 1987 Taiwan economic construction plan approved by the Executive Yuan , which foresees the attainment of an eight percent growth rate , includes many policies and measures , among which particularly to be stressed is that , besides maintaining an appropriate increase in exports , domestic demand must also be expanded , including raising the private willingness to invest and expanding public investment , thereby making domestic demand and export trade the two main forces for economic growth .  
As to how to clean up the Tamsui River system , Premier Yu stated that his preliminary view is that the main sources of pollution of the Tamsui River system are pollution caused by urban domestic sewage , industrial waste water , and refuse dumped along the river banks .  
The method of controlling urban domestic sewage is to construct a modernized sewerage system that would collect sewage from buildings , transport it through sewage lines , treat it in treatment plants , and discharge it in a suitably selected location and which would prevent sewage that has not been treated appropriately from flowing into the river .  
The late President Chiang Ching-kuo , who boldly strove to promote democratic , constitutional government and march down the road of liberalization , left unfulfilled aspirations behind . At a time when our nation faces dramatic changes in its economic and political situations , how will President Lee fuse the conservative and reform forces , adapt to domestic and foreign trends , and lead the nation along the road to advancement ? The question is not a small one .  
To maintain economic growth , Taiwan must spur its domestic demand , although a large increase over a short time will not be easy . In addition , the growing incidence of demonstrations brought on by the democracy movement , the spread of influence by interest groups on the legislative process , and the growth of environmental consciousness mean that business must pay higher social costs , higher costs which will slow down Taiwan 's economic growth .  
As for the international situation , the United States had already issued forth an official government report , and was prepared to cast aside Taiwan . As for the domestic situation , Taiwan had met up against a dire shortage of raw materials and inflation . Also , the Chinese Communists had their eyes set on Kinmen and Matsu , and were making strategic preparations to attack .  
The government hopes that overseas experts and consultants can work together with domestic construction firms and academic institutions from the viewpoints of urban planning , financing , and urban management in exploring the comprehensive utilization of space in the area and in determining urban design control , development methods for public and private lands , development organizations , implementation schedules , and the like in order to promote the comprehensive development of the entire area .  
On the surface , this second plenum is a routine meeting . However , given the rapidly changing domestic and international situation , the changes in ranking personnel in party and government , and the approaching challenge of the year-end elections , as well as the sudden bursting forth of the democracy movement in mainland China , the convening of the plenum has its timeliness and significance . "  
Besides military work , the large capital investment and cultivation of talent can provide enormous resources for the future development of a complete air industry and for raising the level of domestic industry in general .  
Big stock players , wealthy businessmen , and the owners of construction firms - - the " highrisk groups " that are prime targets for criminal attacks - - have become apprehensive and fearful , hiring security teams to protect their homes and bodyguards when they go out and even giving up their imported limos for inconspicuous domestic sedans .  
Looking at it from the point of view of the domestic and external economic situations , the outlook is not very rosy . Because just now the world economy is performing poorly , market expansion is extremely tough . At the same time there is inflationary pressure in Taiwan , so that the government can not devalue the NT dollar to enhance export competitiveness , nor can it adopt a loose money supply policy to free up capital for enterprises .  
The US stands in sharp contrast to Japan , respecting the individual , pursuing happiness , favoring direct expression . Because of its vast size , attention is focussed on domestic matters , and there is a common lack of understanding of the outside world .  
On the tangible side , we must begin by changing modern domestic architecture . Builders should adopt the spirit of the traditional courtyard house and design residential developments that meet the needs of small families yet reflect the spirit of the extended family home .  
Currently , the editors at Sinorama have set their three main directions as " the domestic pulse , " " traditional culture , " and " overseas reports , " in order to serve as a link for the aspirations of Chinese home and abroad and to truly become a comprehensive and international publication which " has its footing in Taiwan , is concerned about the mainland , and has its eyes open to the world . "  
" In the past . everybody assumed that all a high-tech company needed was technology to be successful . Later it was discovered that management skills are also required , " points out Hong . According to their studies of domestic and foreign experiences , the cause of failure of many companies is by no means that the product is poor , but that management is unsatisfactory .  
The Taiwan Straits may seem calm , but there is an unseen and turbulent undercurrent . The naval vessels that cruise these rough waters are in the front line in more than one sense . Externally , they face mainland forces that are ten times numerically superior to our own , and the threat from nearly one hundred submarines , as well as the worsening problems of smuggling and illegal entry . On the domestic front the navy is going through a transition period , with aging vessels being decommissioned and manpower reduced .  
It is as though our image of a Korea with high foreign debts , political turmoil and wife-beating machismo has not changed for over ten years , " says Jing Ker-yi , Korea expert at the Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research . " At present Korea has incredibly overtaken us in a number of industries . This includes their high-profile automobiles and domestic appliances . It 's not very easy for people to realize , but they have made startling achievements in petrochemicals , steel , upper and mid-stream primary products and components .  
According to Council for Economic Planning and Development member Wu Chia-hsing , the main reason for Korea going into the red has been fulfilment of the government 's election pledges . With the construction of two million houses in the public sector domestic demand has diverted glass , concrete and steel from exports and even led to their being imported from overseas .  
Chen Er-nan , a planner / designer at Hong Jian Industries , which accounts for half of the domestic market in man-made polyesters , says that natural silk is colder to the touch , that it is more rough and textured when rubbed , and that real silk lets air pass through , making it more comfortable to wear . Fake silk is warmer , and tends to be more smooth and shiny .  
We discovered that with the prosperity of the domestic economy , the music population has grown quickly , " states Cheng . These romantic little pieces at the juncture of classical and pop are just right for winning those consumers who have a bit of musical cultivation , but have n't the patience to listen to extended , serious classical pieces .  
" The system of agents has long been in place abroad , and is the long-term trend , " explains Luc Kwanten . For people overseas who have the publishing rights , dealing with a single agent saves a great deal of trouble over negotiating with individual publishers whose operating situations are unclear . For the domestic publishing industry , going through an agency saves even more in expenses than setting up your own publishing rights department or hiring specially trained negotiators . "  
Complementary factors home and abroad : Although the scale and professionalism of overseas markets are key factors in enticing animators to go abroad to develop , if you look carefully at this trend , the larger domestic and external environments are also complementary . "  
Of course , given the current technological level of domestic manufacturing , it is still difficult to undertake joint R &amp; D or sales exchanges with major American or European corporations . In order to transfer some of the more advanced technologies , it is necessary that they first be digested by ITRI before they can be given over to local operations .  
On the other hand , our word " alliances , " although it is very trendy , has from start to finish remained an ideal on the level of discussion only , whereas Japan 's arbitration councils are formal organizations which can be flexibly divided and united as needs dictate . Moreover , cases of successful American strategic alliances that have divided and united as they need , have mostly been between medium - and large-scale enterprises and are thus not suitable models for our domestic medium - and small-scale businesses .  
The domestic environmental protection industry still is quite a bit behind international standards , and the gap is unbridgeable in incinerator beds and in prevention of air pollution from emissions . Thus this set of domestic bidding restrictions includes a proviso : The domestic firm that wins the bid must cooperate with an original manufacturer from the United States or Europe to import the technology and undertake joint responsibility for the projects .  
In 1982 , domestic production had fallen to unacceptably low levels and the government had to change its economic strategy to one of developing agriculture and light industry , while emphasizing exporting for foreign exchange . Individual entrepreneurs were allowed to organize factories along the lines of cooperative production , and some family-style small businesses were also freed from restrictions , providing the Chinese with a lifeline .  
Cheng Shu-min , manager of program planning at Chinese Television System , also says that when you look at examples from overseas , audiences tend to identify with their native culture and we have yet to see terrestrial television stations closing down due to competition from satellite . Yet the rise of new electronic media technology has still made the networks aware of a change in the domestic market , a change which has seen a breaking up of the tripartite world of the three television channels and a movement towards audience fragmentation . "  
As well as this , in recent years Taiwan 's financial strength has grown and the New Taiwan Dollar has appreciated significantly . This has led the ITRI to begin introducing technology from abroad , becoming a technological bridge between foreign high technology and domestic businesses and shortening the length of time spent on research and development .  
Among the 34 special government projects commissioned last year , a total of 274 domestic and foreign patents have been won . That is on average a patent coming out every 1.3 days .  
Professor Hsia Liang-chou of the Pingtung Polytechnic Institute , who has studied animal welfare in depth , explains that animal welfare is concerned not only for wild animals ; the hope is that people will understand that it is not true that any animal " can be used for medical experiments in laboratories , so it 's all right to butcher them any way one pleases ; " and that one should also consider the feelings , moods , and physical responses of the domestic fowl and animals which supply human beings with rich protein .  
As Legislator Cheng Chien-jen observes , " the fates of the overseas Chinese and the Republic of China have been closely linked since the Revolution , through the founding of the Republic , the Northern Expedition , the War of Resistance against Japan and the ' Period of Mobilization for Suppressing the Communist Rebellion , ' right up to the present day . " But changing times and the rapid evolution in the domestic and international environment have brought a qualitative and quantitative change in the relationship between Chinese people and their motherland .  
As far back as the time of the prehistoric matriarchal society , the primitive people living in the Yellow River valley had begun to keep dogs . Dogs were the first domestic animals to be reared by humans , and were not only intimately involved in people 's daily lives on a prac tical level , but were also an indispensable part of life on the spiritual plane .  
Chung Chin explains that she used data for 1991 because it made calculations relatively simple . In 1991 the PRC was strongly encouraging foreign firms to go all out to export goods and earn foreign exchange , and Taiwan firms were given little access to the domestic market . Therefore using total Taiwanese investment in the economic formula to calculate the contribution made to mainland Chinese exports would give a close approximation to the actual figure .  
Taiwan firms are now defined as " special domestic investors " by the PRC , and they enjoy somewhat greater privileges and incentives than foreign firms . However , as the mainland makes the transition to a less protected market , it may be hard for Taiwan firms to hold on to the advantages that come with being one of the " local boys . " In the future they will have to compete with non-Chinese companies from the same starting point .  
Meanwhile , China 's painters , living amidst domestic turmoil and foreign invasion , felt the pressure of disappearing traditions . Forced to absorb the creative techniques and methods of the West , China 's painters devoted their efforts to the reform of traditional painting , seeking an East-West fusion of technique . The content of their paintings abounded in themes of ethnic consciousness . Western painting thus followed completely different courses of development in China and Taiwan .  
Within these 20 years , there have been fundamental changes in the international and domestic situations . For example , the Soviet Union has collapsed and the Cold War is over . Within Taiwan , there has been political liberalization , economic transformagion from developing country to newly industrialized country status , and social pluralization . The authoritarian and rigid education methods of the past can not produce the leaders that society and the country will need in the future .  
They have had nowhere to turn because traditionally " the law ends at the family threshold . " There was a widespread social taboo on even discussing the issue . But after the case broke of a woman , Teng Ju-wen , who murdered her abusive husband , women 's groups went into action and began researching legislation designed to reduce domestic violence . Yet success has not always come easy , and there have been many setbacks .  
And it was n't until very recently , when the problem of strays became very serious , that environmental agencies began strengthening their dog catching functions . With domestic dog lovers raising angry cries , conservation groups here are saying that dog-catching as it is now practiced is cruel , and they have invited foreign animal protection groups to teach sanitation personnel " how to catch dogs humanely . "  
A food supply is the most basic of human needs , and farm produce is the last bastion of protectionism in the ROC ; it is also the segment most prone to sensitive price fluctuations . This situation is not unique to Taiwan , but is common throughout the world . Fortunately , except for agricultural produce , most household items , domestic appliances , cosmetics and so on were thrown open to free competition earlier , and so have already entered an era of more stable prices in line with those in advanced countries worldwide .  
Meanwhile the domestic tenders , which were intended to support the ROC 's own civil engineering sector , also provoked a fierce conflict between the forces of the big established operators and those of new players , and suspicions of collusion or excessive price cutting in their tenders have not been laid to rest to this day .  
After the plan for the offshore shipping center was brought before the public , the PRC government , which up until then had been constantly calling for direct cross-strait shipping to be established , based on the definition of a " domestic shipping line , " reversed its attitude 180 degrees . Since the regulation was passed over one year ago , not even one commercial ship has succeeded in crossing the strait .  
The recovery in exports indicates that the threat of domestic deindustrialization has for the most part abated , and economic restructuring has been effective . The rise of the petrochemical , computer , and electronics industries suggests that Taiwan has already staked out a place for itself in the future world economy . As far as the stock market is concerned , the increase in exports means more capital at home , becoming a powerful force reinvigorating the bourse .  
One senior reporter could not help but tremble when he heard this remark , because it hit home . He has grave doubts about the current domestic situation where " everything is political and the economy is at the service of politics . " In addition the influence of gangsters and big corporations is pervasive , and illegal activities thrive while those who obey the law are overly restricted . The competitive advantage that Taiwan ought to enjoy is sacrificed in the resulting confusion .  
Another reason for the PRC 's low-key attitude is that the current model for direct shipping does not have the " domestic " shipping label which PRC officials regard as ideal , meaning that the flagging issue has not been completely resolved . Further , the PRC 's Taiwan policy-making bodies and its Ministry of Transportation and Communications , which is responsible for handling this issue , are at odds with one another .  
Her main hope now is revise the laws to meet the demands of the times , so that executive agencies can be more efficient . Film is another industry " guided " by the GIO . Though not as complex as the broadcast industry , it has its headaches as well , especially the poor economic returns on domestic films .  
With the opening of the domestic telecommunications market , TransAsia Telecommunications won the right to operate a cellular telephone business in southern Taiwan . The company established its headquarters in Kaohsiung but could n't find a marketing manager . Eventually , the company had to go through a head hunter which found them Sean Hsieh in Taipei . Hsieh had worked as a sales strategist at an advertising firm and as a marketing strategist at a producer of physical education products before he was hired to be TransAsia 's marketing manager .  
Oblivious to the traffic thundering across the Yungfu and Chungcheng bridges , which connect the south side of Taipei City with Taipei County , the ducks forage among the cattails and turn up algae , quite in keeping with their nature . There is none of the jostling and bickering of domestic ducks raised in pens . Against the distant roar of the traffic , the birds ' occasional calls from the sandbars lend a strange serenity to the scene , imparting a sense of harmony and grace rarely seen in this bustling metropolis .  
Judge Tsai decided that while medical service is not a product per se , it is intimately connected to public health and safety . The stated intent of the law she applied is to " protect consumer rights and interests , promote consumer safety , and raise the quality of life for domestic consumers . " On this basis , the judge decided that the law also applied to medical care .  
In the case of travel , people are not satisfied with what domestic trips have to offer and are going abroad , increasing the amount of money Taiwanese spend on overseas travel . In 1996 , 5.71 million Taiwanese traveled abroad spending a total of US $ 8.15 billion , an amount equal to 46% of what Taiwan earned from trade in that year .  
There is little realism in Chinese lion statuary . Apart from anthropomorphic facial expressions , often in the form of a broad , all-too-human grin , stone lions ' poses and movements are often modeled on those of familiar domestic dogs and cats .  
It hopes to raise its political status at a global level and at the Asia-Pacific regional level through the development of a high-technology operational capability . It also aims to increase its capability to deal with domestic and border area instability . Besides these , however , and of more immediate interest to Taiwan , another of the main goals behind mainland China 's new strategy is to maintain a reliable military threat to cope with Taiwan and its so-called " separatist tendencies . "  
Lee could hardly have told us much of anything new in his memoirs , for he had already devoted a tremendous effort during 30 years in office to the task of recounting the events that preceded the founding of the republic . Furthermore , Singapore has been deeply influenced by its long years under British rule . The Singaporean government maintains copious records concerning all its domestic and foreign affairs . Political statements over the years have drawn upon a large body of diplomatic documents , parliamentary reports , private letters , and government proclamations .  
In addition , the domestic cable television market has increased its openness to foreign investment , and foreigners can directly or indirectly own up to 50% of the stock . The central government has also authorized local governments to manage local cable television operations , stipulating that operators grade their programs and sign formal contracts with subscribers to ensure the rights of consumers .  
But most worrying are the fish farms spread all over Taiwan 's coastal regions . In some places , abalone pools have been dug into the marine erosion terraces , while in others illegal and excessive pumping of groundwater for aquaculture , along with extraction for domestic , industrial and agricultural use , has caused serious land subsidence in areas covering almost 1,000 square kilometers .  
Ho Chun-jui continues : " There are other aspects as well , such as smashing ' the virgin complex , ' resisting domestic violence , and gay activism . Everywhere you can see that gender self-awareness does n't have to be taught , that it is flowing through society . A future in which everyone is conscious of gender issues is not only inevitable , it is to be looked forward to . "  
In fact , American China policy has maintained a general direction based on three main national interests : democracy and human rights , economics and trade , and security and military strategy . The periodic swinging results from a tug of war between two groups of US domestic forces , one more accomodating toward Beijing such as the mainstream China scholars , the other more critical , such as the media . Nevertheless , Taipei seeks simultaneous improvement of relations with both Washington and Beijing .  
Thanks to this explanation and analysis , readers can understand everything from the works of Shakespeare to the lives of Taiwan 's aborigines , from the views of the Dalai Lama , to those of the overseas Chinese singing star Lee-hom Wang . There is international news and also domestic news . Some of it 's serious , and some of it 's trendy . These English-instruction magazines attest to the fact that Taiwanese appetites for information are getting larger and increasingly varied !  
Minister without portfolio Yang Shih-chien , who handles domestic technology policy , explains : " Innovation is everything in high-technology . A brilliant , ground-breaking idea can open up a whole new field of industry . But innovation requires huge quantities of financial and human resources dedicated to R &amp; D , with laboratories pursuing technological breakthroughs around the clock , and with professional investment managers able to turn innovative ideas into products and profits . "  
The domestic financial crisis which afflicted Taiwan from the middle of last year until early this year , exposed several legally dubious forms of high-risk transaction , including excess loans , and high rates of stock collateral for company directors . Recently , the former president of the Control Yuan , Wang Tso-yung , publicly labeled the Taiwan stockmarket a " cannibal market . " The challenges of a financial economy have clearly only just begun to emerge , and economic policy will probably now confront more difficulties and resistance than ever .  
Increasingly complex parent-child rela-tions , a rising divorce rate , and seemingly insoluble marital problems are causing people to feel more and more that " the family is sick . " That 's bad enough , but the succession of child abuse , domestic violence , incest , and other cases which have been appearing in the news one after another are causing people to fear that " the family may be harmful ! "  
After returning to Taiwan , Chen worked diligently to bring the theory and methods she learned into this country . Working with a social service agency , she handled individual cases of domestic violence . She has come away feeling somewhat powerless and disappointed .  
I think that Lee Teng-hui has shown in this book that he has lived up to this ideal . In its ideological consistency , in its lucidity of thought , With the People Always in My Heart is a world-class piece of literature . As a politician responsible for protecting domestic industry , preserving the welfare of a nation 's citizens , and maintaining international economic and trade relations , Lee has had an extremely busy career , yet he is still able to conduct himself with dignity and aplomb .  
In the center of one of the exhibition rooms , the NPM has laid out a realistic picture of the life of the literati , based on a portrayal in an anonymous Song painting . The main character sits alone in front of a painted screen depicting wild and domestic fowl . To one side , a servant pours tea from a white porcelain pot ; on a table are two or three dishes of fruit and snacks . In front of the scholar stands a basket of classically arranged flowers .  
In Wang 's view , before Lee Teng-hui took over , the KMT was preoccupied with both the external threat and the many demands of domestic reconstruction , and while it held back the reins of power from local Taiwanese and was slow about democratization , it none the less managed , through caution and deliberation , to secure Taiwan 's existence and develop the economy . Therefore , says Wang , " it deserved 80 out of 100 for its performance in government . "  
A : Of all the wealthy and powerful countries in the world today , there is not one that does not employ overseas investment to maximize the efficiency of factors of production and to develop overseas markets . In so doing , they achieve the dual goals of improving the domestic industrial structure and raising their international economic position .  
The main points include : mutual respect and mutual love , positive use of language and prohibition of domestic violence , equal contributions to the family by the husband and wife , prohibition of seeing the children as instruments for the realization of the parents ' own ambitions , acceptance of the monogamous marriage system , cultivation of concern and caring in the course of ordinary married life , filial respect for one 's own parents and for the parents of the partner , and cultivation of artistic interests outside of one 's profession .  
Chen Ai-ni , an expert on gender and marriage , says that emphasizing human rights in marriage is not meant to put one 's spouse " on warning " or to make divorce more fair . Rather it is to preserve marriage and secure the foundations of happiness between husband and wife . Chen believes that it can effectively deter physical and psychological domestic violence , which would be the first step in " happiness engineering . "  
While the advantages of the PRC are undeniably clear-the market is huge , labor costs are low , and firms can easily move into both the domestic and international markets-this swarming of Taiwanese investors , each seemingly determined to outdo the ones before in size , has generated its own ill-effects which are now gradually coming to the surface .  
Since the beginning of this year the government has held a series of national conferences on economic development , administrative reform , industrial development , and science and technology . It has also adopted a dizzying array of measures designed to stimulate the economy , including plans to spur domestic demand , bolster the property market , create job opportunities , and promote mergers between financial institutions .  
The PRC is reported to be the main cause of the diplomatic rupture . Macedonia has been beset in recent years by both internal and external threats . Fighting connected with the separatist movement in neighboring Kosovo has generated a mass exodus of refugees into Macedonia , while the Macedonian government has been unable to quell a domestic rebellion by ethnic Albanians .  
The rapid expansion of China 's economy over the last few years has been a powerful lure to Taiwanese industry , and local businesses have flocked to China . This situation is widely held to be responsible for the problems of capital flight , sluggish domestic investment , the hollowing out of Taiwan 's manufacturing base and rising unemployment .  
In the domestic market , most goods can already be imported freely , although the automotive sector is still protected by regional import quotas and will be affected by the opening of Taiwan 's market to vehicles from the US , Japan and Korea . Other local industries that will need to improve their competitiveness in response to WTO entry are electrical appliances , heavy electrical engineering , papermaking and foodstuffs .  
Joining the WTO may be an inevitable trend , but at a time when all countries are eager to conquer new territories overseas and put up a protective umbrella for their weaker domestic industries , perhaps Taiwan too should be giving more balanced attention to the future of different sectors of society .  
The author makes the optimistic as well as bold prediction that good management of Internet cafes can bring about unprecedented social and economic benefit in areas ranging from improving parent-children relations to stimulating the domestic software industry , and expanding the Internet infrastructure .  
It is a pity that , although Taiwan has attained democracy , it has yet to rationalize its public sector . Instead it is increasingly a " street vendor " culture , with fractious grassroots movements here and there , or just plain vulgar . This points to the necessity of us following the path of advanced nations and upgrading our domestic services . Taiwan must create a quality environment in which people want to live .  
Ku enthusiastically consults with people from all areas , and has done his utmost to assist domestic research in fields related to welding . Ku also contributes by " resuscitating " expensive machinery damaged by human errors or natural disasters , thus helping industry and educational institutions reduce the massive financial losses that can result from such events . While his work has guaranteed that machinery works , he has helped even more people by passing the torch of his knowledge on to his students .  
It 's just that in comparison with the enormously powerful TNCs , domestic companies are still the runts of the litter , and only venture into relatively mature directions in their R &amp; D . Because it is impossible to alter this " hand-me-down-ism " in the short run , it is in Taiwan 's interest that foreign R &amp; D pace-setters are here , because future international industrial trends will be clearer , and local R &amp; D centers can avoid unnecessary detours .  
Regrettably , even as the country was getting tough on domestic quarantine , in mid-May a doctor from Mackay Memorial Hospital caused an international incident when he showed SARS symptoms while in Japan . Assuming that he only had the flu , he took some cold medicine and finished his travel itinerary , only later discovering that one of the patients he treated in hospital later died as a probable SARS victim .  
In any case , the domestic tourist economy is rapidly gaining ground after its precipitous fall and entrepreneurs feel like they have jumped from the cold pool at a hot springs straight into the hot pool , going from one extreme to the other . Aside from SARS receding into the background and the approach of the summer holiday season , a new-found unity among tourism entrepreneurs has been a key element in the rapid resurgence of the industry .  
Eight of the ten largest tourist agencies in Japan manage domestic tourism and depend solely on this market . Japan has managed the tourism industry with amazing skill . This is especially true for the hot springs areas popular with the silver-haired generation , where nature is combined with human artifice , places that can truly be described as " products of culture , " like the famous Hakone and Izu hot springs areas .  
Originally established 45 years ago as a tourism-development taskforce , these days the TAT operates 17 overseas offices and has an annual budget of THB3 to 3.5 billion .

A survey conducted in Kaohsiung County showed a clear rising trend in the number of domestic violence cases reported by foreign brides .

" These women and children have no support at all from friends or the bride 's family . When they run into problems they are lost , " says Sister Therese Tang , executive director of the Good Shepherd Sisters Social Welfare Services Foundation . The language barrier often means they have no clue about how to seek help , to the point where they even accept violence as a natural part of their daily life , as their unalterable fate . This is the reason foreign brides suffer a high level of domestic violence .  
Take for example the laws on domestic violence . Every locality has established a commission and a center for prevention of domestic violence , but these typically lack adequate staffing . For example , there are only two social workers assigned to handling domestic violence cases for all the married women in Hsinchu County , so you can guess what the quality of services there is like .  
Having tried all kinds of domestic and foreign railway lunches , Taiwan Railway Culture Association administrative director Hsieh Ming-hsun says that of all the foreign railway lunches available , he considers Japan 's to be the best . They 're also often tied in with the special features of the local area-for example , seaside stations offer seafood lunches . Also , the lunch boxes come in all sorts of different designs , from cane baskets to ceramic boxes . When he visited Japan , he brought back several extraordinary lunch boxes as souvenirs .  
Aside from the massive popularity of the Nostalgia Lunches , domestic convenience store chains are also paying attention to this virgin market . Starting a couple of years ago , one after another they started offering different kinds of local packed lunches , starting a " biandang war , " - one would offer theirs for NT $ 40 , so a competitor would drop theirs to NT39 , all promoting their lower prices .  
He says that at present , unclear policies and sporadic services result in serious problems such foreign wives failing to adjust well to their surroundings , domestic violence , children doing poorly in school , and bogus marriages that are actually a cover for prostitution .

The first example is the Procomp case , involving intricate and complicated capital flows . After two weeks of investigation , preliminary findings have been made public . In addition , four accountants who had contracts to audit Procomp were severely punished with a two-year suspension of business . Because the accountants were from two major domestic accounting firms , this action was a serious warning for the accounting industry and embodied the hope that the age-old abuses of purposeful undervaluation , placing too much trust in the client and not pro-actively verifying accounts could be rooted out .  
Then the Hsinchu Science-Based Industrial Park came along some years later , attracting domestic and overseas tenants with its autonomous management , customs-bonded operations , and " deep processing " ( i.e . processing that yields a significant level of value-added content ) . This was the key to Taiwan 's successful transition to a new type of industry .  
Hsu tells an anecdote : more than ten years ago , local inventor Huang Ying-chun devised an air-cushioned shoe .

Article 22 , paragraph 5 ( b ) , of the Convention precludes the Committee from considering any communication from an individual , unless it has ascertained that the individual has exhausted all available domestic remedies ; this rule does not apply if it is established that the application of domestic remedies has been or would be unreasonable prolonged or would be unlikely to bring effective relief .  
The opposition to a strong and dynamic United Nations is political and profoundly ideological , and is largely concentrated in a few States whose establishments prefer not to strengthen a forum in which their domestic and global policies can be challenged or trimmed .  But the United Nations exists for all humankind , not just a handful of Member States representing a small minority of the world 's population . . . .  
In our domestic policy we have had two main priorities : to develop and consolidate the legal and institutional framework of a State of law and the smooth functioning of institutions appropriate to a modern democratic society on the one hand , and , on the other , to ensure economic restructuring and the transition to a market economy .  
The Islamic Republic of Mauritania which , since 1984 , has been engaged in a determined battle that aims at restructuring the Mauritanian economy despite difficult domestic , regional and international conditions , has made tangible progress towards restoring the macroeconomic balance and reducing its foreign debt , a fact that is attested to by international financial institutions .

Any discriminatory trading practice , any imposition of unilateral economic measures or extraterritorial application of domestic laws hampers this process and is unacceptable and incompatible with the standards of international law and the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations .  
The United Nations agencies involved in the entire range of processes covered under this omnibus goal should ensure that their activities are carried out in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations , in particular the sovereign equality and political independence of States , territorial integrity , and non-intervention in matters that are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State .

Our efforts have helped develop a text that , in its final version , makes no mention of Chapter VII of the Charter , addresses requests to States that are not binding in nature and specifies that any detentions will be effected in accordance with their national law which , in our view , means that only those States that have domestic legislation enabling them to act along the requested lines will be able to do so , as the resolution can not serve by itself alone as a legal basis for arresting anyone . 
With regard to the possibility that special laws or exclusive jurisdictions could be invoked to uphold impunity in respect of human rights violations , a careful study has begun of Guatemalan domestic legislation , with special reference to the military criminal justice system and the identification of cases in which the functioning of this special system could promote impunity .  
The reasons for this vary and include a lack of political commitment ; an unresponsive legal system ; attitudinal obstacles to the incorporation of international standards when these are believed to be in conflict with religious , cultural or customary practices ; the absence of effective domestic groups that can lobby for change effectively and without fear of intimidation ; and an absence of effective enforcement mechanisms even where legislation exists .  
According to the World Industry Council for the Environment ( WICE ) , 39 / inbound foreign capital only accounts for some 3-4 per cent of total domestic capital formation in developing countries , the vast majority coming from domestic savings .  
In 1993 , the total stock of external debt ( measured at current prices and exchange rates ) rose by 5 per cent - much less than gross domestic product ( GDP ) - to $ 1,630-billion , with much of this attributable to growth of debt stocks in Asia as well as to valuation effects .  
Use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external financial resources , through various innovative schemes ( such as co-financing and joint ventures , underwriting of country risks , and venture capital funds ) in order to mobilize more efficiently new financial flows for sustainable development from all potential sources .  
The Working Group recognized that joint studies on some form of international cooperation , keeping in mind the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities , could help overcome concerns about international competitiveness as a result of unilateral implementation of domestic policy reforms aimed at promoting sustainable development .  
Among such new approaches are the use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external financial resources , including foreign direct investment ; improved coordination and cooperation among national institutions in recipient and donor countries , on the basis of national sustainable development strategies ; partnership arrangements ; and networking between scientific institutes active in the field of sustainable development in various countries and regions .

The Constitution of El Salvador , amended pursuant to the peace agreements , gives the President of the Republic the power to use the armed forces for the maintenance of domestic peace , tranquillity , order and public safety " in exceptional cases , where the normal means [ for that purpose ] have been exhausted " .  
It should be noted that although this measure is , in theory , based on the Constitution , the spirit of the peace agreements requires that it be subject to legal rules which establish expressly and restrictively the requirements and conditions which must be met before domestic peace , tranquillity , order or public safety can be considered to be endangered , in exceptional cases , and before the normal means for their preservation can be considered to have been exhausted .  
Industrialization , which was essential for diversifying the production base and generating employment opportunities , especially for a rapidly growing urban population , required adopting measures to create an environment conducive to private investment , both domestic and foreign ;  
Apart from the moderating effect of the unsynchronized pattern of the recession in the major industrial countries , the region 's ability to withstand the adverse impact of the recession can be attributed to the growing strength of domestic markets , intraregional trade and investment links , and the competitiveness of exports from the region , which are now well diversified into a variety of manufactures . 
The momentum of policy reforms that place a strong emphasis on deregulation , liberalization and outward orientation will be maintained or accelerated throughout the region , providing a congenial environment for a sustained increase in domestic saving and investment .

However , the principle that harm which does not entail economic loss should be compensated is not a new absolute in law , as can be seen in the universal acceptance , in domestic and international law , of compensation for moral injury , which is as difficult to evaluate in monetary terms as ecological harm .  
The use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external financial resources , through various innovative schemes ( such as co-financing and joint ventures , underwriting country risks , and venture capital funds ) in order to more efficiently mobilize new financial flows for sustainable development from all potential sources .

The main reasons included a shortage of resources , both domestic and external , the lack of an appropriate macroeconomic framework in several countries and , in some cases , various crises - political and / or natural - that interrupted economic activity .  
In the context of the new demands on operational activities , the capacity for policy connections between the different strands of political , economic , social and environmental factors has become important .  The United Nations system 's effort at capacity-building is now undertaken mainly by individual organizations in relation to their respective mandates and focused primarily on their domestic counterparts .  
Its main functions include : ( a ) processing the dissemination of human rights as an effective means of guaranteeing their observance and consolidating the democratic system , ( b ) cooperating with relevant institutions to promote the teaching of human rights at the primary , secondary and university levels and in non-formal education and ( c ) promoting the alignment of domestic legislation with international agreements and treaties on human rights .  
In the first year of the Tribunal 's existence , the President of the Tribunal drew the attention of the Secretary-General to the necessity for Member States not only to designate , in their domestic legal systems , a body responsible for dealing with any request from the Tribunal , but also to adopt the legislative or regulatory provisions required to give effect to the Tribunal 's statute .

For most developing economies in Asia , success in maintaining their growth rates lies in continuing their high levels of domestic savings , in broadly based human capital development , in improving the competitiveness of domestic markets , in their openness to foreign capital and technology , and in improved macroeconomic management .  
However , in an increasing number of developing countries , with the accumulation of physical and human capital , technology and management know-how , the domestic base for more sophisticated services is being developed . 
In this context , special emphasis should be placed on ensuring that international financial institutions make the most effective use of existing financing facilities and establish additional ones , attracting capital investments in conditions of respect for the domestic legislation of each country and using efficient energy technologies mainly to support the execution of the projects that are necessary for our region in this sector .

The first question raises macroeconomic issues concerning domestic saving and the net transfer of foreign saving to developing countries ; the second question raises microeconomic issues concerning the role of government and the financial sector in intermediating between savers and investors .  
The net transfer of resources - the difference between gross domestic investment and gross domestic saving - has not been more than plus or minus 1 per cent of the GDP of the developing countries since 1980 , a year of unusually high oil prices when oil exporters placed substantial surplus resources in other countries . 
NULLWhatever the level of domestic savings and however large or small the net transfer of foreign savings , there is legitimate concern to ensure that those savings are allocated to investment in developing countries in a manner that is efficient and desirable in the social , political and developmental senses .  
NULLFor most of the post-war era , it has been taken for granted that the domestic savings of developing countries need to be supplemented with foreign savings to boost investment adequately and that it is not practical to expect private international financing to do the job : some projects that are developmentally important are just not bankable or practical areas for direct foreign investment .  
Successful countries have been those that have been capable of attracting a high level of external capital inflows while , through active macroeconomic policies , avoiding the over-heating of domestic demand , excessive exchange rate appreciation and volatile interest rates .  
NULLThe Working Group also concluded that foreign direct investment was attracted most strongly to those countries that had adopted measures to strengthen their domestic technological capability and created an overall policy framework conducive to innovation , investment in infrastructure , intellectual property protection , human capital formation and a stable macroeconomic and regulatory environment .  
In most developing countries , the process of technological capability-building might be hampered by , inter alia , declining rates of investment , misallocation of resources , external imbalances , lack of diverse and sophisticated skills , weak linkages between domestic research and development institutes and enterprises as well as unfavourable external factors .  
While historic factors such as the low level of African incomes and inadequate domestic technical expertise and capacity explain a part of this situation , it is also the general perception that inappropriate macroeconomic policies , combined with an antiquated and ineffective legal , regulatory and prudential framework , have been the main impediments .  
Uganda intended to continue to work with its bilateral and multilateral development partners on innovative ways of mobilizing private productive capital and , to that end , had taken a number of domestic administrative and policy measures .  
Even the most rigorous and effective programmes of domestic economic stabilization and structural adjustment would leave those countries with serious obstacles to moving to a sustained and sustainable development path .  
Besides , foreign markets have been lost , the domestic market has contracted , capital and other foreign financial transactions have been interrupted , the economy has been decapitalized and the country is devoid of resources for simple reproduction , let alone for development investment .  
In addition , foreign markets have been lost , the domestic market has contracted , capital and other foreign financial transactions have been interrupted , the economy has been decapitalized and the country is devoid of resources for simple production , let alone for development investment .  
Expressing also its concern that serious external and domestic financial constraints have been experienced by developing countries that have continued to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion ,  
Within the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) , the remote sensing program of the Foreign Agricultural Service ( FAS ) continued to be a critical element in the analysis of domestic and foreign agricultural production , supply , and demand - - providing timely , accurate , and unbiased estimates of global area , yield , and production .  
From the point of view of internal law , the court 's statute should be established on the basis of balanced principles and rules that would ensure the requisite harmonization with domestic substantive norms and penal procedures , in particular those pertaining to detention , imprisonment , transfer of the accused , pre-trial release , trials , evidence and sentencing .  
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
Mindful of the urgent need for African countries to increase and mobilize internal resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development through , inter alia , policies for the promotion of domestic savings , improved and accessible banking facilities and further improvements in traditional practices of capital formation at local levels ,  
Governments bore the primary responsibility for formulating appropriate strategies , policies , programmes and actions to combat poverty ; the effort required sound macroeconomic policies , structural changes and the mobilization of domestic resources , inter alia , through more equitable tax regimes and a reduction in military expenditures .

of the urgent need for African countries to increase and mobilize internal resources for the implementation of the New Agenda through , inter alia , policies for the promotion of domestic savings , improved and accessible banking facilities and further improvements in traditional practices of capital formation at local levels , as well as to continue creating an enabling environment for domestic and foreign investment ,  
Also requests the Secretary-General to include in his report to the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole estimates of the projected resource requirements from all sources , public and private , domestic and international , needed for the full implementation of the New Agenda , the amount expected to be mobilized and proposals to address any resource gaps , taking into account the specific economic and development situations of African countries ;  
In accordance with the fundamental principle that the least developed countries are primarily responsible for formulating and implementing growth and development policies , the Government of Myanmar had introduced far-reaching economic reforms , replacing the centrally planned socialist system with a market-oriented economic system , and a series of follow-up economic measures including reversal of price controls and subsidies , liberalization of domestic and foreign trade , reduction in the general level of taxation and opening up of border trade with neighbouring countries . 
when ratifying a convention , a State declared under the terms of its reservation that it was bound by the instrument only in so far as it was not contrary to domestic legislation , then in real terms it had not accepted any international obligation , and the appearance of its name on the list of signatories was irrelevant .  
In August 1985 , a major shift took place in our economic policy that included , among other measures , a reform and simplification of the taxation system , a drastic reduction in the fiscal deficit , price deregulation , a reordering of the public enterprise sector and a greater openness to private investment , both foreign and domestic .  
It also involves injecting new capital from the private sector , either domestic or foreign , into national public enterprises through an innovative , efficient capitalization and administration plan , in collaboration with strategic private partners .  
Significant political and economic changes are taking place all over the world , characterized by , among other things , a growing concern for democratization and good governance , by the increasing resort to privatization and greater reliance on market forces , by an enhanced awareness of the need to mobilize domestic resources and reduce fiscal deficits , by growing participation of non-governmental and community-based organizations in development processes and by greater recognition of the need to ensure that development is not only sustainable but also environmentally sound .  
Though a service designed for a different society and limited to the specific areas assigned by the colonial administration , Malta 's public service gave its contribution to the development of the new State by providing continuity in certain vital domestic sectors and in the setting up of new services , including that of foreign affairs .  
At the same time , it is necessary to recognize what the Secretary General 's report points out : that the challenges which Governments worldwide face in establishing a framework of public administration and a financial system for sustainable economic development are not just domestic influences , but are also unpredictable external factors .  
After having solved a prolonged domestic conflict by political means , we Salvadorans have many challenges before us which can be summed up in a few words : the achievement of a lasting , stable and modern democracy based on the rule of law that will enable us to achieve social peace and the building of a new El Salvador .  
With regard to the matter of the extraterritoriality of national laws , a most sensitive issue for peoples and Governments the world over , the Rio Group summit meeting expressed its rejection of any attempt to use a country 's domestic legislation to impose unilateral sanctions of an extraterritorial character , as this contravenes the standards governing coexistence between States , disregards the fundamental principle of respect for sovereignty and is a clear violation of international law .  
The special significance of this historic event is that , based on the successes achieved over the last 10 years of renewal , reform and national revival , the Congress decided to lead the country into a new phase of industrialization and modernization , with a view to doubling by the year 2000 the 1990 per-capita gross domestic product and essentially transforming Viet Nam into an industrialized country in the next 20 to 25 years .  
If the developed countries are demanding protection for their sensitive domestic industries , then similar demands by developing countries with respect to their domestic industry should not be viewed as a request that is unreasonable or inconsistent with current international trends .  
At the same time , it was able to ensure political stability , improve security and engineer a rapid economic recovery , as reflected by a strong gross domestic product growth of 7.6 per cent , an inflation rate kept at 3.5 per cent and a stable exchange rate of the national currency throughout 1995 .  
These figures , combined with a liberal investment law and a low gross domestic product of $ 287 per capita , are providing strong incentives for foreign direct investment , in particular now that Cambodia enjoys most-favoured-nation status with the United States , the European Union and other important countries in the world .  
While we are aware that the matter of economic and individual personal development is first and foremost a national responsibility , we are deeply conscious that our limited domestic resources constitute a severe constraint upon us in our quest to fulfil this obligation .

At the domestic level , the national Government , owing to radical economic reforms , has made progress in the far-reaching process of bilateral cooperation with countries committed to the peaceful use of nuclear energy .  
We commend the commitments made at national level to the implementation of relevant recommendations through , inter alia , the effective mobilization and efficient utilization of domestic resources and through increased allocation of resources to the social sector .  
We also fully agree with the idea that pursuing and deepening economic reforms and improving the physical and institutional infrastructure for the purpose of attracting further domestic and foreign direct investment are crucial .  
Until these two challenges in particular are addressed , Africa 's capacity to mobilize resources at the domestic level will continue to be stunted , and its reliance on fickle and declining official development assistance and inflows of external resources will be unavoidable .  
Any discriminatory trade practice , imposition of unilateral economic measures or extraterritorial application of domestic law obstructs that process and is unacceptable and incompatible with the norms of international law and the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter .  
Almost five years ago , on 1 December 1991 , in a national referendum , the people of Ukraine confirmed its sovereign will and determination to build its own independent State with a predictable domestic and foreign policy to integrate our nation into the European family of free democracies .  
Among the critical ones are ensuring the peaceful nature of political reforms ; establishing and consolidating domestic democratic institutions and standards ; restructuring ; and ensuring a social orientation that promotes economic transformation and is consolidated by a system of measures and safeguards to preserve social justice and protect society .  
Furthermore , and still within the same context of prevention , the countries whose institutions and infrastructures have been devastated by long-standing domestic warfare now need increased assistance from the international community to help them rebuild their economies and improve the living conditions of their peoples , because without ongoing economic and social development , internal tensions will always continue to threaten the stability of these countries .  
Secondly , I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to remind the international community that my country is suffering from an inhuman , illegal and unjust economic blockade imposed by the neighbouring States under a pretext involving my country 's domestic policies a question that has already become nugatory .  
While others were progressing , we were stagnating , locked in a cruel domestic struggle that included elements imported from the cold war , which arbitrarily kept in check for 40 years our political , social and economic evolution .  
The Working Group entrusted with this issue should also strive to reach an understanding on the possibility of harmonizing legal norms and existing national administrative procedures in the area of domestic control of weapons and in the import and export of arms , in order to establish a common and effective international arms control system that would make it impossible for arms to be diverted through clandestine or illicit channels .

The outlook for natural gas consumption in developing countries is for continued steady growth , given that many of these countries have indigenous gas resources that can be developed or expanded for domestic use , and considering their high electricity demand growth and the economic and environmental benefits of additional gas use ( see figure X ) . 
In view of those difficulties , the Government was developing a policy that combined campaigns to eradicate stereotypes in several areas , ranging from the sharing of domestic responsibilities to the role of the media , with the establishment of affirmative action programmes in the public and private sectors .  
9 One respondent concurred with the proposal for annual instead of quarterly statistical reporting on international trade in narcotic drugs but added that quarterly reconciliation at the domestic level would have to be maintained .  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Recognizes the urgent need for the international community to assist developing countries , in particular the poorest and heavily indebted countries , in mobilizing the resources needed for their development efforts , and also recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries could contribute towards releasing domestic resources and sustaining their development efforts , in particular those for social development ;  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access ,  
While some delegations believed that financial liberalization had led to an increase of speculative capital movements , others saw inadequate economic policies and poor fundamentals as the main culprit , in particular excessive creation of domestic credit , loose fiscal policies and insufficient domestic savings .

The United States has set itself up as an international judge , invoking its own fanciful interpretation of the relevant provisions of those international treaties , the articles of which possess , all in equal measure , the same importance and legally binding force for those States which , in the first place , through the act of constitutional ratification , transformed those treaties into sources of their domestic legislation and into international obligations , apart from the ethical aspect of their application at the international level . 
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
The domestic factors include : civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some LDCs and the resulting social and economic burdens , political instability , macroeconomic imbalances , manifested in large fiscal and balance-of-payments deficits , in many cases the unfavourable short-term impact of macroeconomic policy adjustments on specific areas , in particular the most disadvantaged and vulnerable sections of the population , and poor performance of the productive sectors including lack of adequate physical infrastructure .  
Requests improved annual reporting on financial flows including allocations / expenditures based on consistent criteria , relating to the costed elements of the Programme of Action , including a clear account of levels and trends of funding by source ( bilateral , multilateral ( both core and non-core ) , private , domestic allocations , etc . ) ;

Also requests the Secretary-General to include in his report to the Ad Hoc Committee estimates of the projected resource requirements from all sources , public and private , domestic and international , needed for the full implementation of the New Agenda , the amount expected to be mobilized and proposals for filling any resource gaps , taking into account the specific economic and development situation of African countries ;  
During the 1980s , improvement efforts of all types in developing countries were disrupted by economic crises , most notably external debt crises and rising debt burdens , depressed commodity prices , slow growth of output and inadequate mobilization of domestic resources .  
During the 1990s , dramatic political and economic shifts had been occurring throughout the world , marked by increasing tendencies towards democratization , greater reliance on market forces , greater emphasis on mobilizing domestic resources and reducing fiscal deficits , increasing privatization , growing participation of non-governmental and community-based organizations in development processes , and heightened recognition of the need to assure environmentally sound and sustainable development .  
In its representation , Latvia pointed to its over-assessment , dating back to 1991 , the current economic situation of the country , with falling real gross domestic product and a recent banking crisis , and severe restrictions on the budget of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , given other pressing humanitarian and social needs .

In that resolution , the Assembly dealt with the matter from a criminological perspective , inviting Member States to adopt specific measures to make the crime prevention and criminal justice system more responsive to domestic violence , for example , by enacting criminal law and procedure and improving the situation and the fair treatment of the female victim .  
The participants in the workshop made the following recommendations , applicable to countries in central and eastern Europe : criminal law and procedure should be reviewed to determine any discriminatory provisions and effects ; consideration should be given to making rape in marriage a criminal offence ; criminal justice practitioners should be sensitized to the dynamics of domestic violence ; the police should be given specific and intensive training in crisis intervention and in the collection of evidence in domestic disputes .  
The Council recognized that it continued to be a widespread international activity frequently involving highly organized international syndicates that trafficked in human cargo without regard to the dangerous and inhumane conditions to which they were subjected , and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards .  
In spite of some encouraging individual examples of the growth of official development assistance ( ODA ) , as well as of some promising approaches towards mobilizing domestic and international resources for sustainable development identified and explored by the Commission through its Ad Hoc Inter-sessional Working Group on Finance , the overall picture in regard to the implementation of all the recommendations and commitments related to finance as contained in Agenda 21 remains an area of concern .  
A number of countries reported that cases against law enforcement officials charged with crimes connected with the infliction , instigation or toleration of any act of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment were heard by regular domestic criminal courts .  
36 Panama reported on legislative amendments to its Penal Code , dealing , inter alia , with the criminalization and penalization of physical or psychological aggression , violence and intimidation , corruption of minors and indecent assault , incest and the commission or knowledge of an act of domestic violence by a public or private official , as well as the failure to inform the proper authorities of such an act .  
The information received suggests that differences in the judicial traditions , systems and practices of the responding States did not prevent an increased number of countries from including in their domestic legislation , substantial and procedural provisions designed to improve the position of victims in civil , criminal and administrative proceedings .  
It also asked Governments and agencies of the United Nations system to promote programmes for guiding management and corrective actions to control pollution in the larger coastal urban settlements , specifically in the treatment of sewage and waste disposal , both domestic and industrial , as well as to control pollution in river systems caused by mining industries .  
Accordingly , most of the countries of the region maintained , and seemed to be consolidating , a pattern of economic performance characterized by moderate growth rates accompanied by moderate and diminishing inflation , large current account deficits covered by external capital , and low domestic savings rates .  
In particular , the net inflow of external financial resources and the greater or lesser uncertainty prevailing in domestic markets as a result of foreign or domestic events were decisive factors in the policies applied in response to the crisis .  
On the one hand , Argentina , Mexico and , to some extent , Uruguay had to manage their economic policies in a climate marked by a sharp contraction of external financing , in which they faced severe slumps in domestic demand , with adverse effects on output and fiscal revenues .  
In contrast to this median situation , at one extreme were countries with fast-growing domestic demand and good access to foreign currency , which expanded both their output and their external purchases , or countries which experienced real appreciation of their currencies . 
In chapter II of its report , the Board places particular emphasis on the sharp and controversial increase in the use of methylphenidate , better known under its trade name Ritalin , in the treatment of attention deficit disorder ; the abuse of synthetic drugs , in particular " ecstasy " and " ice " ; the diversion of psychotropic substances , in particular benzodiazepines , from domestic and international distribution channels ; and the illicit traffic and diversion of acetic anhydride to clandestine drug laboratories .

Barring adverse weather conditions , the progress made in enhancing political and social stability in some countries and the benefits accruing from the impact of domestic economic-policy reforms , coupled with favourable developments in the international economic environment , lead to estimates of regional growth in output of 2.9 per cent in 1996 , as against 2.3 per cent in 1995 .  
Since private capital flows are becoming a major source of financing for developing countries , African countries that seem to be involved in a process of adjusting their financial structures and liberalizing their economies are likely to attract foreign resources , both for portfolio , and more particularly , direct investment .  Creation of domestic capital markets , as complementary measures to the process of economic liberalization and privatization , is essential if the countries need to broaden and improve the savings / investment process .  
But the most important prerequisites for the successful mobilization of foreign and domestic resources are confidence in the financial system and appropriate macroeconomic policies , a well-established and clear legal and regulatory framework , a transparent and non-distortionary taxation system , a stable domestic financial system , and adequate infrastructure .  
Stabilization of prices and exchange rates would ensure positive rates of return on domestic assets , while a more aggressive drive by the formal financial institutions through intensive branch expansion , the broadening of the menu of saving instruments and the forging of strong linkages with the informal financial institutions , would have a positive impact on the volume of resources mobilized .  
In addition , their capacity to take advantage of the expansionary cycles of international and regional trade and to withstand adverse conditions and financial instability must be increased through the diversification of products and markets , the search for foreign investment and partnerships , the use of domestic stabilization mechanisms and better linkages between exports and other productive activities .  
To promote awareness in Africa and in the international community of the nature of the critical economic and social situation in Africa , and of the domestic and international efforts required for recovery and development , through wide dissemination of the periodical African Recovery to the general public and to target groups such as parliamentarians , non-governmental organizations , trade unions and academic institutions , as well as through outreach to the African and international mass media ;

The major features of the strategy are to support private sector farming activities through improved legal , regulatory and institutional frameworks , to enhance the efficiency of traditional and domestic market-oriented agriculture , to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of intensive and export-oriented agriculture and to improve access to regional and international markets .  
While it is the primary responsibility of African States to bear the bulk of their development burden by tapping as a matter of priority their own financial resources , the rigid international economic environment , the domestic economic hardship and the lukewarm disposition of some creditors to adopt radical measures have constituted obstacles to the mobilization of financial resources and to the development of Africa .  
Measures to enhance socio-political stability and good governance and to secure sound macroeconomic policies that will be conducive to private foreign and domestic investment should be strongly encouraged .  
With regard to the external debt , it is also relevant to point out the Declaration of the Support Group for Nicaragua of 16 April 1996 , which considers that , within the framework of a sound and responsible macroeconomic policy that encourages domestic savings , resources released as a result of a comprehensive approach to the debt problem should be used to support productive and social development .  Alleviation of the external debt burden would thus help to eliminate widespread poverty among the Nicaraguan population .  
In developing countries , however , the current flows of private investment are highly concentrated among a few countries with export potential while serious shortages of funds are experienced in countries where forestry is oriented towards domestic markets .  
NFP links together strategic and operational planning and it is specifically designed to increase effectiveness and efficiency in sustainable forestry development at the country level , potentially leading to increased commitments by potential sources of both domestic and external funds .  
The defence motion was based on three arguments : the alleged unlawful establishment of the Tribunal ; alleged unjustified primacy over competent domestic courts ; and an alleged lack of subject matter jurisdiction under articles 2 , 3 and 5 of the statute .

There have been financial losses of some $ 890-million owing to the non-implementation of letters of credit in , for example , the importation of ready-made clothing and shoes , milk and other baby food , electric and other domestic appliances , spare parts , home and office furniture , and other essential goods imported from abroad to meet the consumption needs of the local market ;  
Mobilization of substantial new and additional resources from all sources , domestic and international , public and private , and from traditional and new sources would also be instrumental .

The Government 's development efforts in the last three months have centred on encouraging passage by Parliament of two key laws related to the structural adjustment programme - civil service reform and modernization of public enterprises , maintaining the macroeconomic balance necessary to attract private investment and reactivating externally financed public investment to improve the country 's infrastructure and provide a much-needed stimulus to domestic demand .  
These measures are : ( a ) the establishment of a permanent international criminal court with universal jurisdiction over mass violations of human rights and humanitarian law ; such an international criminal court would have to be bestowed with an adequate mandate and sufficient means to enable it to conduct thorough investigations and enforce the implementation of its decisions ; and ( b ) the adoption of a convention , similar to the Convention against Torture , which would provide domestic courts with international jurisdiction over persons suspected of having committed mass violations of the right to life .  
Additional financial resources are called for , whether obtained through established means including increased and dependable official development assistance , better mobilization of domestic resources and greater direct foreign investment , or through innovative means .  
It must be pointed out here that children and adolescents are targeted by this education-for-health programme as recipients and agents who can pass on the benefits , and health topics are increasingly incorporated in primary and secondary curricula as well as in cultural activities in schools and universities ( hygiene , nutrition , accident prevention , living with domestic animals , prevention of transmissible diseases , contraception , sexually transmitted diseases , AIDS . . . ) .

Employers found guilty of abusing domestic workers were liable to heavy sentences , including jail terms and corporal punishment , and were permanently barred from employing foreign domestic workers in the future .  
The problem of communicating how information should be used involved three challenges : how to measure the uncertainty underlying estimates of economic aggregates , such as gross domestic product ( GDP ) ; how to communicate that degree of uncertainty to users ; and how to communicate the conceptual relevance of alternative statistical measures , such as matching available price measures to administrative and policy uses , to different users .  
The reform and structural adjustment programmes to which African countries are committed have all been multidimensional in nature , including measures for domestic economic and commercial liberalization aimed at improving financial management , expanding the tax base and enhancing efficiency and transparency in the fiscal system .  
But it should be noted that , while innovation and competitiveness are activities of enterprises , success in innovation depends on a wide range of external factors , including the domestic institutional and social environments , national macroeconomic policies , incentive structures , the availability of skills , the local supply base , and the level of investment and linkages .  
What is particularly lacking in terms of raising domestic competition and increasing the competitiveness of economies in transition is a sufficient number of privately owned medium-sized enterprises capable of growing and competing not only in domestic markets but also in foreign markets .  
Subsequently , as the industrial base of the country in the industry concerned is developed and capabilities are acquired , the domestic sector may be exposed to import competition through gradual trade liberalization .  
Natural resource endowments , the level of development of the industrial base and of the physical and communications network , the size of the domestic market and the degree of integration of the domestic economy , the technological capacity and availability of adequate human capital in terms of skills , and the proximity to major production and consumption poles are elements in which developing countries also exhibit differences among themselves .  
For these countries , the main issue is how to speed up the creation of supply capacity through the mobilization of adequate resources , both domestic and foreign , for the development of productive capacity ( physical , human and institutional ) , a necessary first step towards building up export capabilities .  
Such work may also require international support for related activities at the national level , including technical cooperation activities to strengthen national policy and institutional instruments , and the domestic capabilities needed for this purpose , in the specific areas concerned .

Stresses the urgent need to continue trade liberalization in developed and developing countries , including liberalization through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries , and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,

These included macroeconomic stability , high rates of domestic saving , maintenance of sound financial intermediaries , high priority given to human resource development ( especially to high _ quality primary and secondary education ) , competitive exchange rates , export orientation , a supportive environment which rewarded entrepreneurship and allowed open and constructive dialogue between government and the private sector regarding objectives and policies , and governance which balanced the promotion of social cohesion and consensus with that of competition between individuals and companies .  
In view of the acute external financial constraints and low levels of domestic savings in most African countries , there was a pressing need to improve their capacity to attract foreign investment , in the process drawing investors ' attention to the considerable opportunities existing in all major economic sectors , namely natural resources , agro-industry , other manufacturing , tourism , other services , and infrastructure .  
The representative of the Republic of Korea identified the following crucial components of the East Asian development experience : political and economic stability , which could only be fully ensured by sound domestic governance ; an export orientation with export promotion ; capital accumulation financed both domestically and from abroad ; the upgrading and importation of new technology and the development of overseas marketing skills ; balanced enterprise development ; and human resource development , at the level of both skilled workers and advanced education .  
In spite of all these setbacks , African countries had pressed ahead with efforts to facilitate the effective development and utilization of human resources , harness their vast natural resources , mobilize both domestic and foreign financial resources for development and strengthen regional and subregional cooperation and integration .  
Take steps to prevent and counteract , through appropriate domestic measures , the financing of terrorists and terrorist organizations , whether such financing is direct or indirect through organizations which also have or claim to have charitable , social or cultural goals , or which are also engaged in unlawful activities such as illicit arms trafficking , drug dealing and racketeering

While expressing its full support for UNDCP , his delegation was greatly concerned by the attitude taken towards that body by some donor countries , and stressed that countries with a high level of domestic consumption of illicit drugs should continue to bear a fair share of the increasing financial burden of UNDCP .  
Stresses the need for all countries to develop economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
In a judgement rendered on 21 April 1982 , the Supreme Court of Justice , ruling on appeal , declared void a provision on bank employees ' labour contracts which gave married male employees the unreserved right to a domestic subsidy , while allowing the subsidy to married female employees only under severely restricted conditions . 
He stated that the relegation of women to a domestic role , attributable to cultural factors , their lack of political involvement , the reduced pay they received when on maternity leave , the violence within the family that affected two out of every three women , the discrimination practised by families in respect of education and the sexual attacks by soldiers and policemen already reported in 1994 , continued unabated in 1995 .  
In its representation , Latvia pointed to its over-assessment , dating back to 1991 , the current economic situation of the country , with falling real gross domestic product and a recent banking crisis , and severe restrictions on the budget of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , given other pressing humanitarian and social needs .  
Sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; these countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
Those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
Besides promoting a dynamic and competitive domestic economy , based on comparative advantages , and providing physical and institutional infrastructures , domestic sectoral policies should also seek to integrate the protection and conservation of the environment and the achievement of social development objectives into sectoral development plans .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
It was noted , for example , that , if the courts applied their broad " domestic " notion of public policy to the recognition of foreign judicial decisions , very few foreign decisions would ever be recognized since most foreign proceedings would , in one or the other aspect , depart from procedures which , internally , constituted matters governed by imperative rules .  
At the same time , the reform process must assign special importance to measures and mechanisms designed to accelerate economic and social development , especially in Africa , by supporting domestic efforts at economic restructuring , diversification of raw materials and increased food security being carried out by the countries of the region . 
The political exploitation of this international problem , through hurling unfounded allegations in order to advance certain ulterior motives or cover up deficiencies in domestic or external policy , is no less dangerous than terrorism itself .  
But the main specific feature is that all these Republics are in the process of building a State , and therefore give the highest priority to the issues of peace , security and stability in their domestic and foreign policies , because only with these basic conditions is sustainable economic and social development possible .  
They include poverty and growing economic imbalances in and between countries ; rising unemployment and underemployment in many parts of the world ; environmental degradation ; war and civil strife ; intensified domestic and international conflicts for political , religious or ethnic reasons ; disparities in economic development and income levels ; globalization ; labour market demands ; and increased international trade and investment .  
The peri-urban poor live in the most hazardous environment where their health is at risk from exposure to toxic chemicals and pathogens from domestic solid wastes and human faecal wastes .  
The Agreements contain not only such provisions as the parties considered to be necessary for ending the legal situation of domestic armed conflict and remedying its effects , but also a much longer set of provisions which set out a State plan which encapsulates many of the recommendations contained in the reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights , and in particular several relating to the structural changes needed to ensure the effective exercise of human rights .  
Violence against women , especially domestic violence , appears to be pervasive , and systematic and serious efforts are required to address this problem , at the legislative level and through practical measures such as a comprehensive awareness-raising and education campaign for the public in general , and in particular for law enforcement agencies such as the police , lawyers and judges .  
In situations where the constraints on domestic resources are most severe , owing to weak economic performance , inadequate infrastructure , and the shortage of trained personnel , it is expected that most of the needed resources will be supplied through external population assistance .  
The Committee was also concerned that the country had not made much real progress in implementing the Convention and that , despite its efforts , it had yet to respond effectively to problems such as domestic violence , prostitution , early pregnancy , female illiteracy , discrimination in the workplace in terms of how much women were paid , the high percentage of women receiving less than the minimum wage , the elimination of stereotypes , and the changes that needed to be made in the country 's legal system , which reinforced existing stereotypes .  
Recognizing that investment in human capital and domestic and international policies supportive of economic and social development are essential prerequisites for the eradication of poverty ,  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Noting also that the future course of net transfer of resources to developing countries depends on a growth-oriented and supportive international economic environment and on sound domestic economic policies ,  
Stresses the urgent need to continue trade liberalization in developed and developing countries , including liberalization through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Stresses the need for all countries to develop economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
It was stated that paragraph ( 1 ) essentially contained a provision on the allocation of liability to the domestic certification authority in the event that the foreign certificate was found to be defective , a liability to be derived from draft article H . Paragraph ( 2 ) , in turn , was not concerned with liability issues , but with the legal effects that might be produced directly by a foreign certificate , for example where that foreign certificate would be relied upon in the context of a dispute before the courts of the enacting State . 
However , the concern was voiced that , when read in conjunction with draft article B , which required such prior approval for certification authorities established in the enacting State , paragraph ( 1 ) might be read as allowing the recognition of certificates issued by foreign certification authorities which had not been authorized to operate under domestic rules , while denying legal effectiveness to certificates issued by domestic certification authorities that had not received the required authorization in the enacting State .  
That new capital is envisaged to come from a redirection of private capital from mature markets to markets with new absorptive capacity created for sustainable development ; from the removal of existing subsidies ; from domestic savings ; from debt-relief ; and from public monies , including increased ODA . Efforts should be made to provide the necessary flexibility to allow those reallocations to take place naturally in response to incentives . 
The Committee shall not declare a communication admissible unless it has ascertained that all available [ legal ] domestic remedies have been exhausted [ in accordance with generally recognized rules of international law ] ; [ this shall not apply where the Committee considers the application of the remedies to be [ unreasonably prolonged ] [ unreasonable ] or unlikely to bring effective relief ] [ unless the claimant demonstrates that such remedies are ineffective or that the application of the remedies has been unduly prolonged ] ; 
Recalling also and concurring with the conclusions of and recommendations made by recent international conferences on the human rights of women and girl children , in particular with respect to the violation of those rights through sexual and economic exploitation for the profit of recruiters , traffickers and crime syndicates , as well as other illegal activities related to trafficking , such as forced domestic labour , false marriages , child marriages , clandestine employment and false adoption ,  
The Panel recognized that in developing countries , domestic resources for financing the management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forest are scarce and international financial sources remain vital .  
It reiterated the need for external support through ODA and the provision of new and additional financial resources , and emphasized the need to mobilize new , innovative and additional forms of finance at the public , private , international , domestic and local levels .  
Efforts in developing countries to secure additional financial resources and technology at domestic level need to be strengthened , and should be supplemented from international sources .  
Since supply capacities would play a crucial role in determining the extent to which developing countries ( and especially least developed countries ) could seize the opportunities arising from the Uruguay Round Agreements , the report identified some of the measures required for improving the domestic supply response .  
The extent and shape of the international presence in Haiti following the withdrawal of UNSMIH will necessarily be based on the careful consideration of such factors as the degree of professionalization of the HNP ; the security situation as it relates to the ability of the HNP to carry out its mandate ; the state of the Haitian economy ; the commitment of the Government to promoting national reconciliation ; domestic political support for continued international presence ; and the financial and other constraints facing the United Nations .  
As a result of the transition to a market economy , the Russian Federation has experienced a sharp deterioration of all major economic and social indicators since 1990 , including a decrease in real gross domestic product ( GDP ) of roughly 38 per cent from 1990 to 1995 .  
One reason is the objective differences in the curricula offered by different countries / institutions , while another is the resistance of health professional associations to opening the domestic markets to students who have studied abroad , especially when there is no shortage of medical personnel trained in local schools .  
Decides to renew , for a three-year period , the mandate of the Working Group composed of five independent experts entrusted with the task of investigating cases of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily , provided that no final decision has been taken in such cases by domestic courts in conformity with domestic law , with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with the relevant international instruments accepted by the States concerned ;  
During the last two years only , the inspections have led to the unmasking of : a complete biological weapons development and production programme ; highly sophisticated and advanced work on the extremely lethal chemical warfare nerve agent VX ; and the multifaceted domestic development and production of Scud-type missile engines under Iraq 's project 1728 .  
The elements of macroeconomic balance and stability , such as inflation , fiscal deficits and current account deficits ( which reflect the gap between domestic savings and investment ) are widely acknowledged to affect foreign trade and external financial inflows through their effects on interest rates , exchange rates , rates of return on investments and credit ratings , among others .  Sources : ESCAP , 1995 ESCAP Population Data Sheet ( Bangkok , 1995 ) ; United Nations , World Population Prospects : The 1994 Revision ( United Nations publication , Sales No .  
In particular , such provisions could invite States , in accordance with or subject to their domestic laws or pursuant to bilateral or multilateral agreements or arrangements : ( a ) to take all appropriate measures to prevent preparation in their respective territories for the commission of those offences outside their territories ; ( b ) to exchange information in accordance with their national law ; and ( c ) to coordinate administrative and other measures to be taken , as appropriate , to prevent the commission of offences set forth in the convention .  
Decides to renew , for a three-year period , the mandate of the Working Group composed of five independent experts entrusted with the task of investigating cases of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily , provided that no final decision has been taken in such cases by domestic courts in conformity with domestic law , with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with the relevant international instruments accepted by the States concerned ;  
Serve as a mobilizer of ideas and a catalyst for action to identify and promote new policy options at the national , subregional and regional levels for the removal of constraints on the economic and social development efforts of these countries , with emphasis on the adoption of measures for increased mobilization of domestic and foreign resources , trade and private sector development , public sector reform , and provision of economic advice , on request , to Governments with limited internal capacity .  
In many countries , particularly those of the British Commonwealth , as well as others , exclusive use and occupancy of land from time immemorial gives rise to aboriginal title , a title that is good against all but the sovereign , that is , the Government of the State . 15 / Where aboriginal title is recognized , indigenous peoples have at least some legal right that can be asserted in the domestic legal system . 
Thus , both international war and internal armed conflicts , just as states of tension or domestic disturbances caused by political , economic , social or cultural factors , when accompanied by clashes , acts of violence , vandalism , inter _ ethnic confrontations , terrorist attacks , etc . and provided they represent an actual or at any rate imminent threat to the community as a whole , constitute a public danger or public emergency in the meaning conferred on those terms by the international instruments referred to above .  
This is why both the domestic law of States ( whatever its theoretical foundations ) and international law accept that in such circumstances the competent authorities may suspend the exercise of certain rights for the sole and unique purpose of restoring normality and guaranteeing the exercise of the most fundamental human rights .  
In situations where the constraints on domestic resources are most severe owing to weak economic performance , inadequate infrastructure and the shortage of trained personnel , it is expected that most of the needed resources will be supplied through external population assistance .  
To realize the concrete and achievable goals set out by the International Conference on Population and Development , the mobilization of resources , both domestic and external , must be placed high on the global development agenda and the implications of increasing financial resources to the level of $ 17-billion by the year 2000 , as called for in the Programme of Action , must be faced squarely .  
In order to avoid military courts , in those countries where they have not yet been abolished , helping to perpetuate impunity by virtue of a lack of independence resulting from the chain of command to which all or some of their members are subject , their jurisdiction must be limited solely to specifically military offences committed by military personnel , excluding human rights violations constituting serious crimes under international law , which come under the jurisdiction of the ordinary domestic courts or , where necessary , an international court .  
Thus promotion of exports of health services required the designing of strategies to improve domestic capacity , create export potential without adversely affecting national health services , identify excess supply of health services and potential markets for such services and overcome internal and external barriers .  
They included : the particularly high proportion of women living in poverty in southern Italy ; the need to ensure greater participation by women in policy-making ; the excessive glorification of women 's role in domestic life ; the inadequate emphasis on article 4 of the Convention and the absence of quantitative goals for women 's participation in political and public life ; and the need to address questions relating to violence against women from a broader societal prospective which would reject traditional patriarchal attitudes .  
An essential component of an enabling environment for development is sound national macroeconomic policies and the creation of favourable conditions for investment and increased domestic savings , including through the creation of a sound banking system .  
These include weak domestic employment capacity , uneven sectoral growth , weak intersectoral articulation , severe marketing bottlenecks , poorly coordinated and fragmented new investments in both public and private ventures and structural imbalances among macroeconomic aggregates .  
These should provide in particular protection of contractual agreements and an even playing field between domestic and foreign investors ( therefore preventing discrimination against foreign investors ) , and policy formulation should be consistent and well planned so that partial reversals or inconsistent legislation are not implemented later .  
These include the existence of a properly functioning banking system with the ability to mobilize an adequate level of domestic savings ; a legal system that protects private property ; the existence of company laws that allow multiple ownership as a precondition for share ownership by the public ; and the freedom of foreign investors to own domestic assets in clearly specified sectors of the economy .  
The idea was also raised that building up a domestic institutional investor base could help provide additional local private demand for marketable securities .  
Since 1990 , however , a number of major international and humanitarian crises , a global economic downturn , and domestic preoccupations and budgetary pressures in a number of the donor countries have dominated aid policies .  
In normal circumstances , growing developing countries should see their external debt rising , reflecting foreign borrowing to supplement domestic resources for investment .  
It could be argued that a staged approach for the penetration of foreign markets , starting from domestic markets and moving to regional ones which displayed similar sociocultural characteristics , could be a viable option .  
The Special Rapporteur affirmed that , owing to their double marginalization as women and as migrants , women migrant workers might easily find themselves in situations in which they were vulnerable to violence and abuse , especially since women migrant workers dominated the informal labour market of most countries , working as domestic , industrial or agricultural labourers , or within the service industry . 
ECA has collaborated with OAU in various meetings and seminars organized in the following areas : domestic mobilization of financial resources for the development of Africa ; the role of African workers and trade unions in subregional and regional economic integration ; the mobilization of resources and public awareness for refugees in Africa ; trade policies and World Trade Organization negotiations ; future relations between the African , Caribbean and Pacific Group of States and the European Union ; and globalization , development and international labour standards .  
There has been a sizeable expansion of private flows of financial resources from developed to a limited number of developing countries and , in a number of countries , efforts have been made in support of domestic resource mobilization , including the increasing use of economic instruments to promote sustainable development .  
At the national level , there are three major types of private actors involved in capital market operations : security exchanges ( the parallel and the over-the-counter markets ) ; domestic custody , settlement and clearing institutions ; and listed companies and brokers .  
With investment in the last decade having risen faster than both trade and gross domestic product , and with continued impetus from expected further liberalization of portfolio and long-term capital flows in the future , the promotion of South-South cooperation desired by developing countries may include greater emphasis on the role of investment within the context of an integrated intra-South production framework . 
The financial sector , however , continues to be viewed as deserving of special consideration because of its central role in the national economy and the far-reaching damage that financial disruption , caused for instance by imprudent lending or unanticipated changes in prices , can produce in the domestic economy .  
The Commission encourages countries to continue to pursue coherent and coordinated policies including the creation of a possible domestic legal framework and a stable economic environment , to attract foreign direct investment in order to benefit from its contribution to development . performance and the unexploited opportunities available . 
Sound domestic macroeconomic policies in each country for promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; those countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
Those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-servicing obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
Besides promoting a dynamic and competitive domestic economy , based on comparative advantages , and providing physical and institutional infrastructures , domestic sectoral policies should also seek to integrate the protection and conservation of the environment and the achievement of social development objectives into sectoral development plans .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
In order to encourage domestic investment and to attract foreign direct investment , it is essential to have in place a stable , supportive , effective and transparent legal framework .  
In Mozambique a major part of this initiative has involved a radio drama series in which Mozambican actors act out a lively series of plots conveying messages such as the importance of staying in school , how to deal with sexual harassment , AIDS-awareness , and covering delicate issues such as female genital mutilation , early marriages , and the domestic workload of girls .  
While such savings now represented a greater proportion of the gross domestic product of developing countries than they had a decade earlier , savings rates in Africa and Latin America remained comparatively low , owing to low absolute levels of per capita income in Africa , the low rates of growth in income , continuing high levels of unemployment in both regions and patterns of income distribution .  
In close cooperation with the World Bank , the European Commission , the United States Treasury and the United States Agency for International Development , my office is focusing on getting the privatization process started , modernizing the framework for domestic and foreign investment , reforming the social security system as a prerequisite for easing the excessive burden of contributions , and approximating basic commercial laws to the standards of the European Union . 
Further , implementation strategies advocated were not adopted at the country level , the nascent African private sector was not fully prepared to assume the new responsibilities in the industrial investment process and financial support , including term lending , from both domestic and foreign sources was not readily available for industrial projects .  
Those organizations had been in general agreement that an accurate and transparent impact assessment , based on a common approach to or understanding of the issues involved , was essential both to design the appropriate domestic policy response and to seek adequate external assistance .  
While there was no simple solution to pursuing development goals in an increasingly competitive and globalized world and even though economic growth was not automatic , notable strides had been made by those who embraced credible macro-economic settings ; those who addressed the social dimension of development in tandem with the pursuit of economic growth ; those who fostered domestic private sector development ; and those who pursued representative , open and accountable governance .  
The Commission encourages countries to continue to pursue coherent and coordinated policies , including the creation of a possible domestic legal framework and a stable economic environment , to attract foreign direct investment in order to benefit from its contribution to development .  
The objective in this thematic area is to provide the poor populations in urban and rural areas , especially women , with the capabilities needed to increase their profit from participation in the market , thus improving their standards of living and raising their share of contribution to the gross domestic products of their countries .  
While making steady advances in economic and social development , China was also undertaking tremendous efforts in drug control through strengthened law enforcement and control of domestic narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances , and chemicals used in the manufacture of illicit drugs .  
The number of such associations is constantly rising , and their diverse objectives include childcare , encouraging the work and education of women , raising women 's awareness of educational , health , social and legal matters and providing vocational training for women in skills such as dressmaking , printing and domestic food preparation .  
Reiterates the need to continue trade liberalization in areas of export interest to developing countries , including through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Calls upon all countries to develop economic policies that promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
Noting that the globalization of financial markets can generate new risks of instability , including interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations , which have the potential to aggravate the volatility of short-term capital flows and to adversely affect the international financial system , requiring all countries to pursue sound economic policies and to recognize the external economic impact of their domestic policies ,  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
Also recognizes the importance of ensuring transparency and accountability at the national level to achieve policy credibility and confidence-building as well as sound regulatory and supervisory arrangements so as to strengthen the domestic financial system , and further recognizes the importance of a stable international economic environment and stability in the international monetary system ;  
Reiterates the importance of trade liberalization in developed and developing countries and the need to continue liberalization , particularly in areas of interest to developing countries , through , inter alia , a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access , and recognizing the need for African countries to use both human and financial resources more effectively in the process of industrialization ,  
This has not been effective , however , in raising growth the extra liquidity created by low interest rates has not been channelled into real domestic economic activities , but has sought higher yields in other countries .  
The Commission encouraged the Secretariat to devise ways to address the continuing and significant increase in the importance being attributed by Governments , by domestic and international business communities and by multilateral and bilateral aid agencies to improving the legal framework for international trade and investment .  
In specific terms our countries , despite various structural reforms , have been unable to attract in sufficient quantities the necessary capital inflows for investment , and are confronted at the same time with domestic supply-side constraints which limit our export potential , an unsustainable debt which swallows a great part of our national income , and declining levels of official development assistance , among others .  
There can be no universal environmental preservation without a genuine change in the unsustainable consumption patterns that bring about the increasing deterioration of the global environment , without adequate financial assistance for development in percentages proportional to gross domestic product , and without adequate facilities to access modern technologies .  
The efforts at domestic stabilization through reorganization of the State and the reconciliation of opinions and the return to work of the civilian population are accompanied by other efforts aimed at achieving peace and regional stability in order to create economic and political conditions conducive to productive national and foreign investment .  
In our ceaseless struggle as a small nation to achieve people-centred development goals , the present Government , within the international constraints of sustainable development and environmental protection , will continue its endeavours to increase domestic efficiency and international competitiveness in agriculture , production , manufacturing and export , as well as to strengthen the institutions of local entrepreneurship , with a view to ensuring political stability and fostering equitable economic growth .  
It is with that concern in mind that for more than a year the Government of Burundi has been engaged in a peace process based on an extensive consultation of our people through domestic debate and on the peace conferences held abroad , so that all the people of Burundi , without exception , could be involved in inclusive political negotiations open to all parties concerned in the conflict in Burundi . 
On the question of health , the Government has undertaken to rationalize the current programmes carried on under the auspices of the Ministry of Public Health and Population and to replace the traditional vertical approach with a more effective , regionally integrated strategy based on providing a minimum service , estimated to cost 2 per cent of gross domestic product a year .  
The sanctions imposed on Iraq and the foreign interference in its domestic affairs have given rise to clandestine excavations that have enabled their organizers to appropriate and sell cultural property and rare art objects of inestimable value , as well as manuscripts and antique books .  
In only a few developing countries , mostly in East and South-East Asia and Latin America , have domestic companies joined the integrated networks of transnational corporations and , in some cases , forged strategic alliances to exploit dynamic trade and investment interlinkages .  
Large capital inflows can also result in speculative bubbles in certain economic sectors or the stock market or in an over-expansion of domestic credit if prudential regulation is inadequate or not enforced .  
Sustained capital inflows and long-term growth , however , also require continuous upgrading of domestic technological and productive capabilities , for comparative advantage shifts within and between countries and can not be maintained based simply on static comparative advantage and outward-oriented liberalization policies .  
Empirical evidence suggests that the countries that have been successful in sustaining capital inflows and long-term growth are those that have systematically upgraded their human capital and infrastructure and have promoted the continuous diversification or deepening of their domestic productive base .  
Economic , social and political stability , including stable macroeconomic policies , have been a major factor in encouraging domestic savings and investment and attracting FDI in the more successful developing countries .  
For their part , most small island developing States face the reality of constrained domestic savings and public revenue potential due to a number of factors , notably the small size of their economies and the imperative of granting tax holidays and exemption from import and export duties to foreign investors in order to attract and retain foreign capital , which accounts for significant proportions of investments in major sectors , such as tourism , textiles and in some cases mining .  
Reducing the worst inequities will depend on ( i ) international and national action to reverse the stagnant or negative economic growth patterns currently experienced in the lowest income countries ; and ( ii ) domestic policies ( in all countries ) which enable all sectors of society to benefit from growth .  
The Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines expressed concern with regard to several important socio-economic issues , including youth unemployment , the high rate of female migration , decreased export earnings in the agricultural sector , the high rate of pregnancy among pre-teenagers and adolescents , traditional socio-cultural attitudes reflecting stereotyped gender roles and the prevalence of domestic violence .  
Recognizing that , in general , large external capital movements are likely to be the market response to changes in expectations about domestic economic performance , the 1995 meeting of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) Interim Committee enhanced the IMF ability to monitor the economic policies of member countries and increase the transparency of national policies through improved and more timely provision of data .  
At its third session , the Commission proposed ways to enhance the effectiveness of ODA through the elaboration of national sustainable development strategies , with the participation of all interested parties ; the use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external resources , through such schemes as co-financing , joint ventures , underwriting of country risks and venture capital funds ; and the promotion of public and political support in donor countries for raising ODA levels .  
Since supply capacities would play a crucial role in determining the extent to which developing countries ( and especially least developed countries ) could seize the opportunities arising from the Uruguay Round Agreements , the report identified some of the measures required for improving the domestic supply response .  
States parties shall not be required by this Convention to provide any information which they are not permitted to communicate pursuant to domestic legislation or which would jeopardize the security of the State concerned or the physical protection of nuclear material , nuclear fuel , radioactive products or waste , radioactive substances , nuclear installations , nuclear devices or their components or objects of which they are components .  
The Committee noted with satisfaction several measures taken between the third and fourth periodic reports , such as credit assistance to women , legislation prohibiting sexual harassment , raising the minimum wage for domestic workers and increasing maternity and paternity benefits for employed persons .  
In this connection , the Mission underscored the importance of excluding from the extinction of liability those human rights violations which had occurred outside the strict framework of the internal armed conflict , and the major responsibility of the judicial authorities for complying with the spirit of the law by disallowing an extinction of criminal liability for those crimes which , under domestic law or the international treaties ratified by Guatemala , are imprescriptible or are not subject to such an extinction .  
Noting also that the unfavourable situation of the Comoros , which is on the list of least developed countries , is aggravated by several important factors , including its physical distance from its trading partners , the scarcity of natural resources , the diminutive size of the domestic market , the fall in prices of its export products and the poverty of its soil ,  
As of January 1997 , it became a constant feature of government policy to declare war and a general mobilization against its domestic and external enemies , without making a distinction between those Sudanese citizens who join the armed forces fighting against the Government which are assumed or are known actively to oppose the Government of the Sudan and those who happen to be in the conflict areas , once again regardless of their race , religion , language , ethnic or social origin and status .  
First , once they are fully implemented , the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture , market access reforms in manufactured and industrial products , and the phasing out of the Multifibre Agreement in textiles trade are projected to raise global income substantially ( estimates range from an increase of US $ 40-billion to one of US $ 215-billion relative to the 1992 base period gross domestic product of approximately US $ 23-trillion ) .  
In the same resolution , the Council recognized the importance of enhancing international cooperation in the enforcement of domestic and international environmental criminal laws , of promoting operational activities in that area , and of protecting the environment not only at the national level but also at the international level .  
Panama continued that the foregoing provisions would not apply where the domestic legislation of the State did not provide for due process of law with regard to the protection of the right or rights which had allegedly been violated ; the alleged victim of a violation had not been allowed access to domestic remedies , or had been impeded in exhausting such remedies ; there had been unreasonable delay in a decision with regard to domestic remedies .  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
Also stresses that implementation of sound domestic monetary , fiscal and structural policies over the medium term , including ensuring sound banking systems , is required to promote financial and exchange rate stability ;  
Indeed , FDI could negatively impact the development process , for example through TNC entry that inhibited the growth of domestic firms , through the repatriation of capital that aggravated balance-of-payments difficulties , or through social and environmental effects that impeded further economic development .  
Policies for promoting domestic resources mobilization should include macroeconomic and structural reforms , public expenditure reforms , the promotion of environmental taxes and charges , a review of existing subsidy policies , and financial sector development to promote personal saving and access to credit , taking into account the characteristics and capabilities of individual countries .  
The representative of the Netherlands felt that a provision for resource mobilization as proposed by the representative of South Africa should not include a reference to the single general domestic legislation clause , because it would be redundant and might set a bad precedent for the inclusion of similar restrictions in other provisions contained in the consolidated text .  
The Commission will review progress made in the implementation and follow-up of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , and will consider at each of its sessions issues relating to the enabling environment for social development , the special situation of Africa and the least developed countries , the enhancement of social development goals in structural adjustment programmes , the mobilization of domestic and international resources for social development , and the framework for international , regional and subregional cooperation for social development .  
Reiterates the importance of trade liberalization in developed and developing countries and the need to continue liberalization , particularly in areas of interest to developing countries , through , inter alia , a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
His Government ( a democratically elected one , as the international and regional organizations that had supervised the electoral process had duly reported ) had enacted just such domestic legislation , and had met , and would continue to meet , its corresponding international obligations .  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access , and recognizing the need for African countries to use both human and financial resources more effectively in the process of industrialization ,  
While in the majority of African countries manufacturing output stagnated , strong performance was recorded for the northern and eastern subregions , with growth rates of 4.2 per cent and 5.3 per cent , respectively , sustained by strong domestic demand as well as buoyant inflows of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) .  
Among the inhibiting domestic structures and growth-constraining factors in Africa are the internal social disarticulation at almost all levels of production ; weak and undiversified production base ; economic delusion and fragmented domestic factor and product markets ; low level of endogenous human resource development and capacity utilization ; and weak physical , institutional and technical capacities .  
The creation of wider markets through regional and subregional economic integration remains a fundamental prerequisite for a viable economic diversification strategy in Africa , if only to make up for the small size of domestic markets and to encourage the restructuring of national production systems to take advantage of complementarities in resource endowments and economies of scale .  
With the decline in the external resource inflows to Africa and with little or no prospects for any major improvements in accessing external savings , particularly in the form of official development assistance ( ODA ) , African Governments are now fully aware that effective mobilization of both domestic and external resources is crucial for long-term sustained development .  
While the mobilization of external resources should target and tap into the growing non-debt-creating arrangements and particularly direct foreign investment ( FDI ) , the domestic counterpart should seek to exploit the rich potential within both the urban and rural milieus .  
Although the measures introduced in 1995 to restore internal and external balance to the Hungarian economy have made considerable progress in this direction , their impact on domestic demand and especially on household consumption has been more severe and more long-lasting than expected .  Economic growth in Slovenia also continued to slow down in 1996 , despite earlier forecasts of an acceleration .  
Nevertheless , a number of countries ( Czech Republic , Hungary , Poland , Slovenia and Croatia ) have achieved significant success in lowering and controlling their inflation rates ; but one consequence of this success is that they have been attracting large and rapid inflows of foreign capital which threaten to destabilize domestic monetary control and to push up the exchange rate , thereby further weakening the competitiveness of the tradeables sector .  
A recent study1 has stressed that a current account deficit of more than 5 per cent is likely to become a problem only when a range of conditions apply : when the export sector is small , debt service is large , domestic savings are low , and the financial sector is weak and dominated by banks subject to weak regulation .  
It is against this background that developing and transitional economy countries must grapple with the problem of maximizing the mobilization of financial resources from both domestic and foreign sources while at the same time ensuring that those resources are used in the most efficient and productive way so as to benefit all classes of the population , including the poor , and that public financial operations are reliably accounted for so as to inspire confidence among both citizens and foreign donors and investors .  
In 1995 , the gross domestic product stood at US $ 96 million , while per capita it increased to $ 6,415 .  4 .  The performance of the Turks and Caicos economy in 1995 was characterized by continued rapid growth in tourism , a steady rise in offshore financial services business and an increase in fishing activities , combined with lower inflation rates and a slight reduction in the unemployment rate .  
Further , a stable and transparent legal framework that provides for respect for and enforcement of property rights , the rule of law and the tackling of corruption , as well as transparent , efficient and accountable public administration , are conducive to domestic and foreign investment and capital inflows .  
Investment ( domestic and foreign ) , capital inflows and access to foreign exchange are facilitated by a low and predictable rate of inflation , a sustainable fiscal deficit and a realistic exchange rate .  
The Council may urge that structural reforms aimed at establishing a competitive domestic financial system , privatization and / or restructuring of public enterprises continue to be implemented in order to enhance the efficient allocation of resources and support private sector development ; such reforms are also expected to boost domestic savings and investment and thereby contribute to higher economic growth .  
Sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; these countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
Those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
Besides promoting a dynamic and competitive domestic economy , based on comparative advantages , and providing physical and institutional infrastructures , domestic sectoral policies should also seek to integrate the protection and conservation of the environment and the achievement of social development objectives into sectoral development plans .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
In this regard , the Netherlands stated that institutional and human capacity , a reliable regulatory and a supportive legal system , as well as stable and sound macroeconomic policies , were among the central building blocks to attract domestic and international capital to finance development .  
Thus promotion of exports of health services required the designing of strategies to improve domestic capacity , create export potential without adversely affecting national health services , identify excess supply of health services and potential markets for such services and overcome internal and external barriers . on service providers . 
The Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines expressed concern with regard to several important socio-economic issues , including youth unemployment , the high rate of female migration , decreased export earnings in the agricultural sector , the high rate of pregnancy among pre-teenagers and adolescents , traditional socio-cultural attitudes reflecting stereotyped gender roles and the prevalence of domestic violence .  
The Committee noted with satisfaction several measures taken between the third and fourth periodic reports , such as the provision of credit assistance to women , legislation prohibiting sexual harassment , raising the minimum wage for domestic workers and increasing maternity and paternity benefits for employed persons .  
Noting that Canada faced new domestic and global socio-economic challenges , the representative emphasized that Canada had taken decisive steps to provide women with an effective legal framework against discrimination . 
There has been a sizeable expansion of private flows of financial resources from developed to a limited number of developing countries and , in a number of countries , efforts have been made in support of domestic resource mobilization , including the increasing use of economic instruments to promote sustainable development .  
Except for two years since Rio , Zambia has been unable to register positive growth in its gross domestic product , despite my Government \ x { e5b8 } very determined effort to put in place comprehensive reform measures in the private and public sectors .  
In his paper , Mr . Alfredsson suggested that better use should be made of international and bilateral technical cooperation programmes with a view to enhancing respect for minority rights at the domestic level ; that the Working Group should show , using concrete examples , that dialogue and technical cooperation could be effective mechanisms for conflict prevention and resolution ; that the Working Group might encourage research on topics of particular relevance to its mandate and ensure that the guidelines on State reporting addressed minority concerns .  
In principle , there is general agreement that an accurate and transparent impact assessment , based on a common approach to or understanding of the issues involved , is essential both to design the appropriate domestic policy response and to seek adequate external assistance in coping with the side effects of sanctions .  
Anti-dumping proceedings have been criticized on grounds of inadequate examinations as to whether imported and domestic products fall , in fact , within the same quality segment , lax determinations of causality between dumping and injury , neglect of consumer interests and the legal possibility to file new complaints whenever earlier complaints regarding the same import product have been unsuccessful . \ x { ffff } seq level0 \ * arabic \ x { ffff } 15 \ x { ffff } . 
Over the preceding 10 years , the international community had established legal standards and created an institutional framework for regional and international cooperation in the struggle against illegal drugs , which would be greatly reinforced by universal ratification of the international treaties , the adaptation of domestic legislation and the implementation of the relevant programmes .  
For the first time , more than half the gross domestic product had been generated by the private sector , and more favourable conditions for national and foreign investors had been created through the ongoing privatization process , the completion of the first phase of financial stabilization , the gradual liberalization of domestic and foreign trade and the introduction of a new national currency .  
The explanation for that situation lay in the accumulation of such factors as poor physical infrastructure , a generally unskilled labour force , high levels of indebtedness , high inflation and small domestic markets , problems which the African countries must face up to by seeking to establish sound macroeconomic equilibrium and suitable infrastructure , and by investing in social programmes to promote the integration of their people in the global system .  
Each developing country should adopt macroeconomic policies conducive to domestic savings and investment , which had more impact on growth than external contributions , and should stress human resources development , education and health at the social level and respect for the rule of law at the political level .  
The efforts of developing countries to mobilize domestic resources should be supported by external resources commensurate with their needs ; accordingly , the depletion of financial assistance agreed and committed by the developed countries , particularly official development assistance , was cause for concern .  
Despite the decisive role of domestic policy in respect of the influx of private capital , it was essential to take measures at the international level to ensure the effectiveness of domestic reforms ; in that respect it should be recalled that , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 50 / 91 , cooperation and coordination must be broadened among interested countries and the Bretton Woods institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries .  
Assumptions related to gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth , demographic growth , energy prices , structural changes in energy demand and supply , and policy choices differed considerably among Parties , reflecting the different national circumstances , and the time span of the projections .  Economic growth was considered to be a driving force for several Parties , but in some of them ( e.g .  
In the absence of ratification making it possible to apply a universal jurisdiction clause to the country where a violation was committed , States may take practical measures in their domestic legislation to establish extraterritorial jurisdiction over serious crimes under international law committed outside their territory , which by their nature fall within the scope not only of domestic criminal law but also of an international punitive system which disregards the concept of frontiers .  
Those principles and norms , as set out in the Charter of the United Nations , elaborated in a number of international legal instruments and backed by declarations adopted by international conferences , proscribe the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State and the imposition of coercive economic measures as instruments of intervention in matters that are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State , without prejudice , however , to the application of preventive or enforcement measures under Chapter VII of the Charter .  
In order to be operational , however , such a global model should comprise large-scale national models that should be designed to cover domestic economy , external sector and supply-side response to external shocks such as coercive economic measures .  
Specific procedural and legal problems include identification of , and communication with , the proper domestic authorities whose consent is required before boarding a foreign ship , the inability to exercise jurisdiction over domestic vessels or nationals outside territorial waters , and the inability to exercise jurisdiction over stateless vessels .  
But for many developing country enterprises , quite the opposite may also be true : exposed to international competition , or to domestic competition from firms established with the help of FDI , they may be unable to compete .  
One result is that growing attention is being paid at the national level to the need to combine increased contestability with competition policies aimed at preventing market concentration and abuse of dominant positions , and / or with policies directly aimed at improving the competitiveness of domestic enterprises .  
Governments in all countries that have successfully closed the gap on the leading industrial economies have pursued policies aimed at directing the form and focus of competition , be it between domestic firms or from the international market-place , to achieve specific development goals .  
The ability of the domestic industries of weak economies to respond to competition is impeded by inefficiencies which are due to inappropriate technology , obsolete equipment , inadequate infrastructure and support services , and previously excessive levels of protection .  Although in due course import liberalization will have dynamic positive effects on growth and employment , in the short run there is a risk of the failure of inefficient domestic firms , with the attendant social costs if workers lose their jobs and can not shift immediately to produce static efficiency gains from more productive employment elsewhere .  
At the domestic level , we must promote higher standards of national government by strengthening our regulatory and supervisory frameworks , improving corporate governance , increasing transparency and lessening government interference in market decisions .  
They should pursue sound macroeconomic policies , strive to increase domestic savings and investment , strengthen institutional , legal , regulatory and supervisory capacities and improve economic management in the public and private sectors .  
In accordance with that objective , Mexican diplomatic and consular offices have a set of legal powers under both domestic and international law for carrying out their protective functions .  
Thanks to the prudent policy pursued by the Government and the National Bank , its domestic public debt was low and its gross foreign debt among the lowest in Central Europe .  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
It was of great importance that the concluding observations be widely published and made accessible by the States parties concerned in domestic languages and distributed to the relevant national authorities .  
In 1989 , in cooperation with the World Bank , Jordan had elaborated a comprehensive economic reform programme designed to curb inflation , reduce the growing external debt and stop the decline in the gross domestic product .  
At the national level , over the past 10 years , his Government had substantially increased domestic resources for development financing , but it continued to need external resources , both private and official , in order to sustain current growth rates .  
Its objective is twofold : ( a ) to assess how to enhance national capacities to manage private capital , both domestic and foreign , in least developed countries and ( b ) to search for feasible ways and means of facilitating private investment in support of SHD .  
Liberalization needed to be combined with sound and coherent domestic economic policies , the creation of effective judicial systems , the promotion of the rule of law and respect for the regulatory responsibility of Governments .  
A well developed financial sector is critical in stimulating private domestic savings and investment in Africa to achieve sustained economic growth and development .  
According to a survey commissioned by the Office for Rural Development in 1993 , rural women employed in agricultural activities worked an average of 12 hours and 58 minutes a day , of which a mere 4 hours were devoted to household management and domestic work .  
The second stage would focus on major structural transformations of the national economy by promoting domestic production , thereby creating further opportunities for private business and favourable conditions for sustainable economic growth .  
The Czech Republic is convinced that the necessary prerequisite for an effective anti-drug action , on the domestic and international level , is the political will of each State concerned .  
A stable macroeconomic environment when accompanied by low inflation , competitive exchange rates , manageable public debt , democratic institutions and principles of good governance was conducive to increased domestic and foreign investment .  
Following UNCTAD advisory missions to strengthen the capacity of the domestic insurance sector , a set of legal , institutional , managerial and procedural measures for follow-up has been outlined .  
Additional constraints included the small size of their domestic markets , the vulnerability of their economies to external shocks owing to excessive dependence on a narrow range of exports and the difficulty of gaining access to international capital markets .  
Recourse to competent judicial authorities , both national and international , to denounce the perpetrators and impose the appropriate criminal , civil and administrative penalties , particularly as provided in domestic legislation and under international law ;  
The Rio Group noted with satisfaction that the approach to international cooperation had been balanced , realistic , innovative and global , and that the extraterritorial application of domestic laws and recourse to sanctions against States had been rejected .  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Countries at level 1 are characterized by compiling gross domestic product at current and constant prices , broken down by kind of economic activity and final expenditure .  
Until the current crisis , the high level of global financial integration had allowed economies in transition to obtain the foreign direct investment they required owing to their insufficient domestic savings .  
The Meeting recognized the potential of the manual to contribute to changing cultural , social and legal attitudes towards and perceptions of domestic violence and its victims , which might improve their treatment by the criminal justice system .  
In the case of contractual preferential rules of origin , considerable political resistance to harmonization can be expected , as such rules are the outcome of intensive negotiations that reflect the vested interests of domestic industries .  
The Honduran approach to the problem of social insecurity is based on the belief that the primary cause is the insufficient and unreliable national supply of food , either home-produced or imported , for domestic consumption .  
Globally , ODA has fallen to just 0.25 per cent of gross domestic product in 1996 the lowest level since foreign aid was institutionalized with the Marshall Plan about 50 years ago .  
The gap between the official and unofficial exchange rates continued to widen , discouraging domestic production and leading to a situation whereby foreign currency is used side by side with the national one , in both official and private transactions .  
He noted that despite global economic and financial turmoil in several regions in the world , foreign direct investment ( FDI ) had continued to grow in 1997 and early 1998 , surpassing the growth of other aggregates such as GDP , exports and domestic investment .  
The rise in social spending has encouraged public investment , which increased in 1997 to a level equivalent to 4 per cent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) , which in turn had a positive multiplier effect on other economic activities and on total employment .  
The Angolan economy continued to show signs of deep stagnation : foreign receipts from oil have been declining , public budget allocations have been revised downward and public domestic debt has increased .  
In order to encourage domestic investment and to attract foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , it was essential to have in place a stable , supportive , effective and transparent legal framework .  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
It was also apparent that prudential norms and strong supervisory capacity were required as much for facilitating efficient international intermediation of volatile capital flows as they were for an efficient domestic financial system .  
Institutional constraints normally linked to weak capital markets and inadequate regulations should be addressed in order to strengthen the confidence of investors , both domestic and foreign , and decrease the volatility of financial flows .  
Institutional constraints normally linked to weak capital markets and inadequate regulations should be addressed in order to strengthen the confidence of investors , domestic and foreign , and decrease the volatility of financial flows .  
Their gross domestic product ( GDP ) had been over 5 per cent , inflation had stood at a 50-year low and a larger proportion of the increased capital flows into the region had been made up of foreign direct investment .  
An enabling external financial environment to support domestic measures could require , inter alia , adequate and transparent supervision of volatile , short-term capital flows .  
The Committee noted that the improved economic performance of LDCs in recent years was mainly attributable to their own sound macroeconomic policy reforms , undertaken under most difficult domestic and external conditions .

Other training and reference materials in the pipeline are : a training manual for primary and secondary school teachers ; a training manual for national and local NGOs ; a handbook for parliamentarians ; a trainers guide for military peacekeepers , a training manual for the treatment of victims of domestic violence for the police ; and a handbook on human rights and constitutions .  
Such a situation would create additional pressure on developing countries , including small island developing States , to meet their growing domestic demand for fish as food on the one hand a problem likely to be aggravated by declining productivity of coastal fisheries due to coral reef degradation , as previously discussed and to increase their share of international markets on the other .  
Another alternative would be to consider the guidelines purely as providing non _ binding standards and criteria at the international level rather than legal rules , but which , once incorporated in domestic law , would be enforceable at the domestic level . 
To ensure the universality of the revised guidelines , the expert considers it necessary to conduct an in-depth comparative study of the relevant international , regional and domestic norms of States Members of the United Nations in order to reveal patterns and trends in the application of the right to restitution , compensation and rehabilitation in cases of human rights violations .  
Each State Party may consider ensuring that the onus of proof is reversed regarding the lawful origin of alleged proceeds of crime or other property liable to confiscation , to the extent that such action is consistent with the principles of its domestic law and with the nature of the judicial and other proceedings .  
For the purpose of cooperation under this article , the offences covered by this Convention shall not be considered fiscal offences or political offences105 or regarded as politically motivated , without prejudice to the constitutional limitations and the fundamental domestic law of the States Parties .  
Although the need to strengthen international economic cooperation based on the principles of international law and recognized norms had been reiterated in most intergovernmental fora , there was increasing recourse to unilateral coercive economic measures and the enactment of domestic laws with extraterritorial effects .  
In terms of national strategies , many countries had undertaken policies aimed at strengthening fiscal performance , increasing domestic savings , strengthening financial sectors by improved regulation and monitoring and greater capital requirements , and increasing macroeconomic stability .  
The financing of development was a much bigger concern than the establishment of a new international financial system or the strengthening of the existing one , for it touched on the core requirement of development , namely , financing and encompassed a host of interrelated issues , including the mobilization of domestic resources ; development cooperation and official development assistance ; and the resources generated from trade and other export services . 
The view was also expressed that international human rights instruments limited the scope of national jurisdiction by guaranteeing uniform standards of protection , whereas diplomatic protection functioned exclusively in relations between States and after domestic remedies had been exhausted .  
Second , financial aspects , recognizing that it is very difficult to rely on mobilizing domestic financial resources in very poor and populous countries where natural resources are degraded , and international cooperation will need to play a very key role .  
The Committee also recommended that efforts be intensified in order to establish a vigorous plan of increased mobilization of resources directed at the eradication of poverty , economic development , substantial reduction of debt , institution of partnership innovations , market access and trade opportunities , mobilization of domestic resources and allocation of additional resources .  
The 1952 Convention establishes a formal regulatory system which can permit the arrest of a ship to secure the satisfaction of any judgment that may eventually be pronounced because the holder of a maritime lien can not , sometimes in a matter of hours , fulfil the standard procedural requirements ( likelihood of the claim alleged , valid title , precise value of the claim and risks of delay ) under formal national or domestic regulations for his application to proceed ;  
Urges all States to enact and enforce legislation protecting girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , female genital mutilation , rape , domestic violence , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;  
Recognizes also the importance of appropriate policy responses to the challenges of globalization at the national level , in particular by pursuing sound and stable domestic policies , including , inter alia , sound macroeconomic and social policies , so as to realize the objective of the eradication of poverty ;  
No exceptional circumstance , of whatever kind , whether a state of war or threat of war , domestic political instability or any other exceptional situation may be invoked to justify infringement of these intangible rights : the right to life , the right to physical integrity , the right not to be subjected to torture or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , the right to a fair trial , the right to freedom of thought , conscience and religion , and so forth .  
Based on past experience and the changes brought about by the rapid globalization of the economy , there had been a growing convergence of policies that encouraged investment in human resources and government responsibility in creating a dynamic domestic framework in which the private sector could play its role as the driving force of industrial development .  
Obviously , however , development of the private sector was impossible without support at the public level , which should include , inter alia , demonopolization , the introduction of tax incentives , a sound legal environment and the promotion of domestic and foreign investment .  
In some countries , practical guidance provided to domestic contracting authorities advises them to consider carefully whether and under what circumstances such guarantees are required , which specific risks or loss they should cover and which type of guarantee is best suited in each case .  The ability of the project company to raise finance for the project may be jeopardized by bond requirements set at an excessive level .  
Mr . Petrella ( Argentina ) , referring to the current international economic crisis , said that the countries most affected by the crisis should understand that the promotion of growth and stability was contingent on the existence of open markets that would allow increased exports , sustained flows of investment capital , the promotion of domestic savings and the continuation of structural reforms .  
To complain about the policies and actions of individual officials and governmental bodies with regard to violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms , by petition or other appropriate means , to competent domestic judicial , administrative or legislative authorities or any other competent authority provided for by the legal system of the State , which should render their decision on the complaint without undue delay ;  
The Special Rapporteur is encouraged to note that the Government sought outside , non-governmental expertise to : ( i ) develop a coherent policy and strategy for domestic violence ; ( ii ) propose a set of legal measures ; and ( iii ) implement a framework for training local staff .  
The Special Rapporteur is encouraged to note the passage of the Domestic Violence Act of 1995 , which includes provision for : a new single protection order ; a broadening of the definition of domestic violence to include psychological abuse ; increased penalties for breaches of protection orders ; free legal aid with respect to protection orders ; and new guidelines to ensure the arrest of violent abusers and the automatic revocation of firearms licences .  
One of the main reasons for growing domestic violence , both in overt and covert forms , is in the lack of a legal and moral environment for effectively opposing it .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature and are punished by penalties consistent with their grave nature .  
Each State Party shall ensure that , subject to relevant domestic legislation of the State Party , the said legal entity may incur criminal , civil or administrative liability and is subject to effective measures taken as a result of such liability .  
They recognized that unusual and massive movements of populations , particularly in the aftermath of armed conflict in certain countries of the subregion , constituted a grave threat to domestic peace , and urged each Government to manage migratory flows more effectively and efficiently and to better control their borders .  
They also have the right freely to apply their systems of political , social , economic , cultural and religious organization and voluntarily to observe customary practices for the regulation of their domestic coexistence , provided that none of them runs counter to the fundamental rights established in this Constitution .  
In order to prepare for the high-level consideration of the topic of financing for development , it was important to focus on a number of key elements : States should begin with the mobilization of domestic resources , review the allocation of national expenditures and their fiscal priorities , look into the private sector and review their legal and administrative structures for rapid growth .  
Ms . Cardoze ( Panama ) , speaking on behalf of the Rio Group , said that the consequences for the Rio Group region of the global financial crisis which had begun during the previous year had included a decrease of two percentage points in the growth rate of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) , a decline in imports and exports , particularly of raw materials and semi-manufactured products , an increase in the current account deficit and , in some cases , a decrease in international reserves .  
To reduce the armaments of others whilst keeping one 's own intact , to reduce the obsolete while developing the state _ of _ the _ art , or even to sacrifice the security of others for one 's own security and to require other countries to scrupulously abide by treaties while giving oneself freedom of action by placing domestic laws above international law : such double standards make a mockery of international disarmament efforts and run counter to the fundamental purposes and objectives of disarmament .  
Each State Party may consider ensuring that the onus of proof is reversed regarding the lawful origin of alleged proceeds of crime or other property liable to confiscation , to the extent that such action is consistent with the principles of its domestic law and with the nature of the judicial and other proceedings .  
For the purpose of cooperation under this article , the offences covered by this Convention shall not be considered fiscal offences or political offences119 or regarded as politically motivated , without prejudice to the constitutional limitations and the fundamental domestic law of the States Parties .  
Aside from the mobilization of domestic and international financial resources , effective implementation must be based on comprehensive strategic thinking , including a clear identification of capacities and constraints at national and international levels .  
While a critical analysis of the contribution of the 20 / 20 initiative to the promotion of basic social services was urged , interested parties also underscored that the initiative leads to the combination of efforts of both donors and recipients of aid in a most visible way , matching domestic funds with an equal amount of foreign financial resources .  
Recent cases of international capital flight from developing countries , which have created tremendous strains and increased poverty , have been attributed in part to shortcomings in domestic policies and institutions , for example , but they can also be seen as symptomatic of an international financial system which fails to differentiate satisfactorily the performance of individual developing countries .  
Crucial requirements are well known and include improving the access to and quality of primary , secondary , technical and vocational education ; improving marketing arrangements for primary commodities ; land reform ; mobilization of domestic saving for infrastructure including small scale , local public works and for private investment ; and attracting foreign direct investment under conditions that ensure benefits to the receiving countries .  
For example , in advanced economies , average proportional revenue collections have not fallen at all so far ; in fact , the average proportion of gross domestic product ( GDP ) of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) countries collected as revenue continued to edge up during the 1990s . 
The main economic determinants are : the size of domestic market ; spatial distribution of natural and created resource endowments ; input prices , quality and productivity of labour ; international transport and communications costs .  
Indeed , in the future , investors will look more carefully at macro - and microeconomic policies [ 24 ] , most particularly at : high economic growth rate , the degree of exchange rate stability , level of foreign exchange reserves , general macroeconomic stability , health of domestic banking system , quality of stock market regulatory framework , quality of domestic accounting / disclosure standards and degree of investors rights protection .  
Instead of improving on the relatively weak performance in 1997 , gross domestic product ( GDP ) in Eastern Europe rose on average by just 2 per cent , less than half the rate implied by the official forecasts and nearly a percentage point lower than in 1997 ( see table 2 ) .  
For many transition economies , the scale of restructuring required by the shift from central planning to competitive markets is so large that the domestic economic , political and social institutions , which are also in a state of transition , are unable to cope with the adjustment costs , which in turn may generate large-scale resistance to reform ( the study of Romania in the current Survey provides a telling example of this ) .  
Sudden inflows and equally sudden outflows of foreign capital create considerable difficulties for the management of domestic monetary policy ; 27 the resulting uncertainty and higher risks implied by financial volatility lead to caution on the part of Governments ( which tend to set interest rates higher than they might otherwise have been ) and of private business ( faced with increased costs of capital and increased uncertainty over future demand ) .  
Gravely concerned at the increasing activities of transnational criminal organizations and others that profit from international trafficking in women and children without regard to dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards ,  
To enact and , where necessary , reinforce or amend penal , civil , labour and administrative sanctions in domestic legislation to punish and redress the wrongs done to women and girls subjected to any form of violence , whether in the home , the workplace , the community or society , in custody or in situations of armed conflict , and to ensure that they conform with relevant international human rights instruments and humanitarian law ;  
Without prejudice to articles ( 14 and 19 ) of this Convention , ensure that administrative , regulatory , law enforcement and other authorities dedicated to combating money-laundering ( including , where appropriate under domestic law , judicial authorities ) have the ability to cooperate and exchange information at the national and international levels [ within the conditions prescribed by its domestic legislation1 ] .  
Gravely concerned at the increasing activities of transnational criminal organizations and others that profit from international trafficking in women and children without regard to dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards ,  
To enact and , where necessary , reinforce or amend penal , civil , labour and administrative sanctions in domestic legislation to punish and redress the wrongs done to women and girls subjected to any form of violence , whether in the home , the workplace , the community or society , in custody or in situations of armed conflict , and to ensure that they conform with relevant international human rights instruments and humanitarian law ;  
The delegation of Kuwait is of the view that both options of paragraph 2 ( c ) are appropriate because the question of the legal rules governing evidence presented before the court and the element of intent should be reserved for domestic laws , and such laws state that the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty .  
This will lead to the design of policy packages aimed at increasing physical and human capacities , taking into account the administrative requirements of such packages , sustainability concerns related to expanded production , the social and human context of polices related to international trade , and complementary measures .  The generation and optimal use of domestic finance for commodity-based development will also be part of these packages .  
Under the overall objective of assisting developing countries to address emerging challenges and persistent problems , the objective of this project is to strengthen the capacity of research institutions in developing countries to conduct development policy analysis , particularly in the examination of changes in domestic economic conditions and of regional and international developments that have a bearing on them .  
Joining forces was perceived to imply not only developing innovative measures for international cooperation , but also strengthening domestic legal and criminal justice systems by adopting appropriate legislative and administrative measures and upgrading the skills of criminal justice personnel .  
Without prejudice to articles [ 14 and 19 ] of this Convention , ensure that administrative , regulatory , law enforcement and other authorities dedicated to combating money-laundering ( including , where appropriate under domestic law , judicial authorities ) have the ability to cooperate and exchange information at the national and international levels [ within the conditions prescribed by its domestic legislation20 ] .  
Many participants informed the Commission about their national laws and practical initiatives aimed at preventing crime , such as programmes to prevent domestic violence and sexual and violent crimes , as well as organized and transnational crime , and corruption .  
The Committee is concerned that there is currently before Congress a bill to decriminalize domestic violence at both the civil and criminal level , passing responsibility for dealing with these human rights violations to an administrative court .  
In his seventh report , in response to various suggestions for dealing with the question of liability by giving greater weight to domestic or private law remedies , Barboza proposed that civil liability should be primary and State liability should be residual . 82 In this regard , State liability would only replace civil liability if the private person who is liable can not fully compensate the harm or if that person can not be identified or located . 
In fulfilling its role as a catalyst of change , EBRD encourages co-financing and foreign direct investment from the private and public sectors , helps to mobilize domestic capital and provides technical cooperation in relevant areas .  
The courts in a number of civil law States had ruled that any such agreement must be subject to domestic administrative law , and one of the practical consequences of that ruling was that Governments were unwilling to agree to submit disputes to arbitration , since the law itself provided specific remedies , penalties and rights .  
As a State Party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child , Malaysia was committed to improving the situation of children at the domestic level , and for that purpose had promulgated laws and formulated programmes , such as the seventh Malaysia plan , designed to further improve the education system , inculcate good values among children and parents and create a society in which care and love for children were given strong emphasis .  
For the purposes of extradition under this article , the offences established in articles 3 ( [ Criminalization of ] participation in an [ organized criminal group ] ) , 4 ( Money-laundering ) , and 4 ter ( Measures against corruption ) of this Convention shall not be considered fiscal offences or political offences or regarded as politically motivated , without prejudice to the constitutional principles and basic concepts of the domestic legal systems of States Parties .  
Without prejudice to articles [ 14 and 19 ] of this Convention , ensure that administrative , regulatory , law enforcement and other authorities dedicated to combating money-laundering ( including , where appropriate under domestic law , judicial authorities ) have the ability to cooperate and exchange information at the national and international levels [ within the conditions prescribed by its domestic legislation60 ] .  
For the purpose of cooperation under this article , the offences covered by this Convention shall not be considered fiscal offences or political offences131 or regarded as politically motivated , without prejudice to the constitutional limitations and the fundamental domestic law of the States Parties .  
Internal enabling environment : policy framework incentives for domestic private savings , equitable tax systems ( development and enforcement of ) , macroeconomic policies , disincentives to corruption ; good governance ; transparency ; effective regulatory and supervisory framework for the financial sector ; banking infrastructure , pension funds ; corporate governance ; internationally accepted accounting standards , and a sound legal system ( land and property rights ) ;  
Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) : need to spread FDI more widely and to diversify private capital flows in order to reduce country / sector concentration , strengthened contribution of FDI for domestic capacity-building and national development goals , role of South-South flows , reasons for marginalization of countries with a sound investment environment ;  
Use of ODA for reinforcing developing countries potential for better access to global markets , and poverty eradication , leveraging larger levels of domestic or foreign private capital ;  
There is also a steady increase in the number of developing country member States reporting that suitable domestic conditions exist for the management and operationalization of TCDC programmes , namely , an effective domestic focal point mechanism ; elucidation of a clear national policy for TCDC ; and an established approach to funding TCDC activities .  
In many countries , particularly those of the British Commonwealth , exclusive use and occupancy of land from time immemorial gives rise to aboriginal title , a title that is good against all but the Sovereign , that is , the Government of the State . 22 / Where aboriginal title is recognized , indigenous peoples have at least some legal right that can be asserted in the domestic legal system .  
There is also a steady increase in the number of developing country member States reporting that suitable domestic conditions exist for the management and operationalization of TCDC programmes , namely , an effective domestic focal point mechanism ; elucidation of a clear national policy for TCDC ; and an established approach to funding TCDC activities .  
Integrate inland water transport within intermodal transport systems to provide door-to-door services for the movement of domestic and international traffic , thereby responding to market demand for convenient and competitive service while optimizing the economic , financial , environmental and social benefits that can be derived from each mode in the entire transport chain ;  
The Ministers stressed the critical role of capital markets in raising the level of domestic savings , attracting foreign private investment , and stemming and reversing capital flight .  
It was disturbing that the gap between the poor and the rich in the world was increasing while official development assistance ( ODA ) measured as a percentage of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) of the developed countries had just reached its lowest level in 50 years .  
In the view of several Ministers , efforts were necessary to stabilize State revenue by means of a fair system of taxation and efficient tax administration , and to mobilize more domestic capital through an effective private sector financial system subject to adequate bank supervision .  
Progress in domestic economic reforms , though varying from country to country , and the improved international environment , notably less unfavourable commodity prices and more stable global financial markets , have been instrumental in improving the outlook .  
There are various reasons for this : the lagged growth cycle in many emerging market economies ; the former high levels of interest rates in some of these countries , especially in real terms ; the greater , though still limited , degree of independence gained for monetary policy in the many countries that have embraced floating exchange-rate regimes ; and the improved international and domestic financial conditions in many countries . 
Whatever the reasoning followed , the dominant viewpoint - as reflected , in general , in the specialized literature and in State administrative decisions , as well as in the decisions of the domestic courts - asserts that treaties involving indigenous peoples are basically a domestic issue , to be construed , eventually implemented and adjudicated via existing internal mechanisms , such as the courts and federal ( and even local ) authorities .  
However , to legitimize beyond any doubt the ways and means used to take issues that originally belonged to the realm of international law away from it and to justify making them subject solely to domestic legislation unilaterally passed by the States and adjudicated by domestic non-indigenous courts , States should produce unassailable proof that the indigenous peoples in question have expressly and of their own free will renounced their sovereign attributes .  
Jurists ( with their conceptual elaborations ) , domestic laws ( with their imperativeness both in the metropolis and in the colonies ) , the judiciary ( subject to the rule of [ non-indigenous ] law ) , one-sided international law ( its enforcement assured by military means ) and international tribunals ( on the basis of existing international law ) were all present to validate juridically the organized plunder at the various stages of the colonial enterprise .  
Particularly in the light of the present poor short-term prospects for the world economy , it is of interest to explore whether the use of international measures , rather than reliance purely on domestic action , might have achieved a more positive outcome for the countries concerned and , at the same time , might have boosted global economic growth . 
It is now increasingly recognized that the response to crises has to address the domestic social consequences of any economic measures that are adopted and should not be restricted to restoring macroeconomic stability and international financial confidence .  
Other women-based policies since put in place deal with the elimination of female genital mutilation ; adolescent health ; legal reforms to eliminate domestic violence and to raise the minimum age for marriage to 18 years ; and the development of a strategic framework for the implementation of adolescent reproductive health , among others .  
The country 's narrow economic base , with tourism and fisheries contributing about 40 per cent of the gross domestic product , leaves the country excessively vulnerable to external shocks .  
The Directors stressed that the successful implementation of the financial programme , including the clearance of external and domestic arrears , would hinge crucially on a sustained increase in budget revenue and the timely implementation of agreed measures .  
As mentioned above , in most situations of realizing human rights in a particular country , there is so much waste and inefficient use of domestic resources that substantial progress can be made in improving the realization of most human rights even within the existing resources , which can be augmented by international cooperation for which a call has been given explicitly in the Declaration on the Right to Development .  
With this in mind , educational and training activities should be strengthened and supported by bilateral and multilateral programmes adapted to domestic needs , which should also consider the strenghthening of such as the regional training centres for space science and technology education established with the assistance of the United Nations .  
In short , what we should seek is the virtuous integration of developing countries into a more receptive global system , one which will help them to grow in a steady and socially harmonious way , increasing domestic savings and productivity , diversifying their supply capability , capturing an increasing share of the value-added chain , and incorporating technology .  There can be no denying that a new order of sorts is gradually taking shape .  
Special attention needs to be given to improving the understanding of the interdependence of foreign direct investment , domestic investment , technological change and technology flows , the policies and practices of multinational firms and the evolution of corporate governance .  
Despite the declining share of income from the agricultural sector in their gross domestic product ( GDP ) , the sector remained essential for rural development , employment creation , food security and foreign exchange earnings in many developing countries , in particular the least developed countries ( LDCs ) .  
For developing countries to achieve the best results from domestic and international agricultural liberalization , for example , they needed to have a stable macroeconomic environment and a basic level of infrastructure ( e.g . transport , storage , communications and finance ) in place .  
Regarding market price support measures , for instance , in several developing countries the total current AMS , the difference between the administered price and the nominally fixed external reference price ( ERP ) , in domestic currency terms had exceeded its bound level as a result of the high rate of inflation experienced by them in the years since the base period ( 1986-1988 ) .  
Others claimed that non-trade concerns of developing countries should be distinguished form those of developed countries , whose interests seemed to be focused on a justification of their continuing use of massive subsidies to the domestic agricultural sector .  
The increased political and financial support to UPE is a promising sign of greater international and domestic attention to creating a basis for effective recognition of the right to education .  
A large number of non-governmental organizations - international , foreign and domestic - work in Uganda in areas related to the right to education ( such as social development , literacy , special education , gender , human rights ) but few explicitly address that right , thus exacerbating the paucity of conceptual and analytical work necessary for its promotion and protection .  
While the previous decades left a negative heritage , as is summarized below , the political and financial commitment to investment in education that led to UPE in 1997 promises to remedy the inherited dissociation between political and economic governance and open the way towards defining the right to education within Ugandas specific international and domestic environment .  
However , the results in the field fell far short of the continents hopes and aspirations : for instance , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) of sub-Saharan Africa had been decreasing at a rate of 0.8 per cent each year for the past 20 years and both official development assistance and private capital flows to African countries had proved extremely disappointing .  
This constitutes an adverse structural shift in the economy , though one which still could be reversed through sustained export growth driven by a combination of domestic and foreign investment and further industrial and agricultural production diversification .  
Effective integration into international capital markets requires a deepening of domestic capital markets by increasing domestic savings and developing a strong domestic institutional investor base on the one hand , and by strengthening the prudential supervision of financial markets , together with sound and efficient banking systems , on the other .  
Resulting exchange rate appreciation and abrupt compensatory movements in fiscal and monetary policies that accentuate the cyclical movements of foreign capital can entail high development costs , especially if domestic financial systems are weak and not well regulated and supervised .  
There needs to be a deepening of domestic capital markets , within an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework and with the development of a strong domestic institutional investor base .  
An indigenous representative from Manipur in India said that recent developments in India indicated that existing domestic and international mechanisms to promote and protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous peoples , including children , and to conserve vital wetlands and sensitive eco-zones of spiritual value had failed to fulfil their objectives , despite strong efforts by the indigenous peoples in Manipur to protect their human rights .  
Although this represents a slight increase over the previous year , FDI continues to be hampered by some characteristics shared by most of the LDCs , such as adverse climatic conditions , small domestic markets , export vulnerability , limited transport and communications infrastructure , insufficient domestic investment and lack of a skilled labour force , as well as lack of information on profitable business opportunities ( box 2 ) .  
Additionally , we would like to reiterate our suggestion contained in the previous written submission that the Working Group on Communications at its first meeting would be requested to ensure that 1503 submissions meet the following preconditions : ( a ) domestic remedies have been exhausted ; ( b ) the matter under consideration is demonstrably a gross and reliably attested violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms ; ( c ) the submissions are clearly devoid of politicization .  
Except for Angola , Burundi , the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Djibouti , Haiti , Rwanda and Sierra Leone , all of the least developed countries for which data are available recorded , on average , positive growth in real gross domestic product ( GDP ) in the period 19901997 , although there were wide variations in country performance in annual growth rates over the period .  
The sustainability of the recent growth performance of the least developed countries would also depend on increasing the level of gross domestic saving and gross domestic investment , the supply of critical skills and consolidation of political and macroeconomic stability .  
A joint study was entitled Strengthening the participation of developing countries in world trade and the multilateral trading system was carried out in 1996 , which included sections on improving market access in commercial services and improving the domestic supply response .  
Misalignments of exchange rates and trade imbalances owing to domestic economic policies that were introduced without concern for their impact on the global economy are generally acknowledged to be a major source of protectionist pressures which manifest themselves both in unilateral national measures and in tensions threatening the rules of the multilateral trade regime .  
In this regard , attention was drawn to the relevant international conventions to which Kuwait had acceded ; 8 the inclusion in its bilateral agreements in the field of civil aviation of provisions relating to the safety of aviation ; its support for international and regional efforts to counter terrorism ; and its adoption of a series of practical and executive measures to protect its domestic security .  
Through renewed support for IDDA , efforts must be intensified to reduce the gap between those with knowledge and skills and those without , as well as to facilitate foreign and domestic private sector investment in the value chain of primary products and other manufacturing activities in order to address the emerging problems of the technology gap , urban unemployment and rural poverty .  
The critical issue to be put on the development agenda for Africa is why macroeconomic reforms in Africa have not generated the expected microeconomic responses and have not promoted significant changes in technological capability , improvements in factory-wide skill levels , higher productivity , better manufactured export performance and greater value added in the domestic economies .  These are the elements that determine a countrys or regions successful integration into the global economy .  
Singapore drew attention to a recent penal provision enhancing penalties for offences committed against foreign domestic workers by employers or members of the household of employers . 16 The Philippines indicated that its comprehensive legislation on migrant workers , including protective provisions for such workers and penalties for abuses , such as illegal recruitment , and providing for information dissemination and shared information systems for governmental agencies , was being accessed . 
Growth slowed in the majority of African countries and , at 2.6 per cent in 1998 , average gross domestic product for all of Africa fell far short of the eight per cent annual growth rate envisioned by the World Bank as the level capable of significantly reducing poverty levels on the continent .  
The dynamic of todays world is an unavoidable challenge demanding not only domestic democratic cooperation , but also negotiations that will raise countries to a level of development at which they can work with other regional and multilateral partners .  
They also stressed the importance of sound domestic policies , private capital flows and appropriate functioning of markets , as well as a favourable and open international economic environment , to overcome this crisis and reverse the marginalization of some developing countries , in particular the least developed ones .  
The annual summary of the economic and social situation in Africa submitted this year to the Economic and Social Council put the figure for gross domestic product growth in 1998 at 3.3 per cent , up from 2.9 per cent in 1997 , the highest growth rate of any region in the world ; it reported that the 33 African least developed countries increased their growth rate from 2.4 per cent in 1997 to 4.1 per cent in 1998 . 
For the purpose of investigating the crimes [ covered by this Convention ] [ established in articles . . . of this Convention ] , if permitted by the basic principles of domestic legal systems , States Parties shall take appropriate measures , when necessary , to permit their competent authorities to use special investigative techniques such as controlled delivery and electronic surveillance within their own territories .  
A favourable and enabling investment climate which mobilizes FDI and domestic savings and channels them into productive investments also requires that the suppliers of capital have reliable , transparent and comparable financial information .  
This approach can now be embedded into substantially improved policy conditions and a strengthened policy framework resulting from structural adjustment , trade and investment liberalization : exchange rates are now aligned with markets , quantitative import restrictions widely removed , investment policies largely liberalized , and domestic policies considerably strengthened .  Economic integration can build on this progress and deepen the process further .  
C In cooperation with other international and regional institutions , undertake technical assistance programmes on capital market development and other specific actions to strengthen the domestic financial infrastructure , with a view to assisting developing countries to mobilize stable sources of finance ;  
Three in particular stand out : the return to stability and growth has not been the result of a unique formula ; the severe economic and social consequences of the crisis have highlighted the need to strengthen institutional structures at the international and national levels ; and corrective domestic policies have to be complemented by resolute international support measures .  
To deal with the volatility of capital flows , developing countries needed to deepen domestic capital markets , institute an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework and develop a strong domestic institutional investor base .  
Each State Party shall , within its possibilities and under the conditions prescribed by its domestic law , take the necessary measures to allow for the appropriate use of special investigative techniques , in particular controlled delivery , electronic or other forms of surveillance , and undercover operations ( by its competent authorities in its territory ) for the purpose of effectively combating organized crime . 
Gravely concerned by the increasing activities of transnational organized criminal groups and others that profit from smuggling of and trafficking in human beings , especially women and children , without regard to dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards ;  
They were : the timely adjustment of domestic policies in developing countries ; the opening up of developed countries commodity markets and the provision of timely , relevant and affordable information and technology by those countries to commodity-dependent developing countries ; and a global effort to reduce trade and non-trade barriers in order to make the playing field level for all parties .  
Without prejudice to articles [ 14 and 19 ] of this Convention , ensure that administrative , regulatory , law enforcement and other authorities dedicated to combating money-laundering ( including , where appropriate under domestic law , judicial authorities ) have the ability to cooperate and exchange information at the national and international levels [ within the conditions prescribed by its domestic legislation15 ] .  
Recognizing the continuing efforts of debtor countries , despite the great social cost involved , to pursue economic reform , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes aimed at achieving stability , raising domestic savings and investments , reducing inflation , improving economic efficiency and addressing the social aspects of development , including the eradication of poverty as well as the development of social safety nets for the vulnerable and poorer strata of their populations ,  
Also stresses the importance of additional debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Globalisation through free trade and open investment regimes can improve the overall performance of developing countries economies provided domestic policies are enhanced by strengthening competition on domestic markets , by opening up new market opportunities abroad for developing countries exports and by increasing the financial resources available for investment in physical capital and intangible assets , including indispensable public goods . 
The progressive integration of developing countries into the multilateral trading system will depend not only on the success of their domestic reforms and on the competitiveness of their economies , but also on the capacity of this system to appropriately address and take into account the specific economic and social capacities and constraints of these countries and , in particular , of the least developed among them .  
Stability and efficiency of the national as well as regional financial markets , increased domestic savings and optimal allocation of resources are a sound basis for sustainable economic growth .  
the promotion of effective prudential supervision as well as the promotion of norms on capital flow transparency so as to consolidate domestic financial sectors in developing countries and to prevent global systemic crises ;  
Analytical work should be carried out on the establishment of a legal and regulatory framework conducive to the development of the private sector and favourable to FDI and to domestic investment and the development of local expertise as well as regional networks .  
Norwegian support of private sector development in developing countries was aimed at increasing income for individuals , providing jobs for poor groups , and raising tax revenues so as to create the necessary economic base for a rise in domestic investment .  
The representative of the Republic of Korea said that the development of LDCs had been constrained by shortcomings in the physical infrastructure and human resource development , low levels of domestic resources , and poor performance in the agricultural sector .  
The risks involved for lenders included ( a ) the difficulty in forecasting traffic and determining what amount of tolls users would be prepared to pay ; ( b ) the fact that users usually paid in domestic currency , so that foreign investors faced a currency mismatch between their investment and their cash-flow return ; and ( c ) the risk that municipalities would change the tolls to please their constituency , in particular before elections .  
In the light of the poor prospects for the internal mobilization of adequate development resources , through domestic savings and the production of adequate exportable surpluses , official development assistance ( ODA ) flows continue to be of critical importance in sustaining growth and development in LDCs .  
Secondly , debtor Governments and international institutions could agree on a multi-year fiscal scenario that addressed , inter alia , macroeconomic stability consistent with non-inflationary financing ; domestic rates of taxation consistent with rapid growth ; and adequate financing for core public goods , including education , public health and basic infrastructure .  
Along with domestic efforts , the international environment must also be improved , as it could have a direct impact on developing countries , which were fragile and especially vulnerable to external blows .  
Core elements of a new poverty eradication strategy should include a broadly based understanding of the mechanisms of sustainable poverty reduction ; the selection of those public interventions that would have the largest impact on the poor and reduce their vulnerability by reducing income volatility resulting from global and domestic shocks and natural disasters ; and the establishment of outcome indicators .  
Further urges all States to enact and enforce legislation to protect girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , female genital mutilation , rape , domestic violence , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;  
In the light of the poor prospects for the internal mobilization of adequate development resources , through domestic savings and the production of adequate exportable surpluses , official development assistance ( ODA ) flows continue to be of critical importance in sustaining growth and development in LDCs .  
The settlement of the Saharan problem would be beneficial not only to the fraternal Saharan and Moroccan peoples but also to all the peoples of the region wishing to live in the Maghreb , to the attainment of domestic peace , to a unified , stable and prosperous Maghreb truly able to solve the countless complex problems arising in a world embarked on globalization .  
Further recognizing the continuing need for the international community to extend technical and other support , including , inter alia , enhanced official development assistance , investment guarantees , debt-for-industrial-development swaps and enhanced market access to enable the continent to leverage domestic and international resources and investment to take advantage of the increasing role of the private sector ,  
Recognizes the importance of adopting appropriate policy responses to the challenges of globalization at the national level , in particular by pursuing sound and stable domestic policies , including sound macroeconomic and social policies , in order to realize the objective of eradicating poverty ;  
Each State Party , in accordance with its domestic legal principles , shall take the necessary measures to enable a legal entity located in its territory or organized under its laws to be held liable when a person responsible for the management or control of that legal entity has , in that capacity , committed an offence set forth in article 2 .  Such liability may be criminal , civil or administrative .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
In order to cope with global challenges , there was a need for a range of measures , such as international cooperation and partnership to reform the international financial architecture , including early warning systems and the introduction of responsible domestic policies , good corporate governance and efficient and transparent financial sectors . 
Besides sound macroeconomic fundamentals , a strong domestic financial and banking system with adequate supervisory and regulatory mechanisms , transparency and good governance were extremely important in order to guard against vulnerability to shifts in market sentiment and to contagion effects from policy weaknesses in other countries . 
Among the obstacles faced by developing countries were the current lack of infrastructure in the domestic and global economies and the instability of capital markets , the fall in the price of raw materials , debt burdens , lack of investment , uncontrolled exchange rates and social resistance .  
Without prejudice to articles [ 14 and 19 ] of this Convention , ensure that administrative , regulatory , law enforcement and other authorities dedicated to combating money-laundering ( including , where appropriate under domestic law , judicial authorities ) have the ability to cooperate and exchange information at the national and international levels [ within the conditions prescribed by its domestic legislation57 ] .  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including adequate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
Considering the content of the subject matter , the emergence of extreme poverty was examined from various angles taking into account both the domestic and international dimensions of the problem and the economic , political and social factors contributing to it .  
Expansionary fiscal and monetary policies large government deficits to stimulate aggregate demand , or low interest rates to encourage domestic investment can no longer be used because of an overwhelming fear that such measures could lead to speculative capital flight and a run on the national currency .  
Several developed countries , too , have operated domestic &amp; lt ; set aside = programmes to reduce productive capacity for particular farm products in market surplus ; while in cases of chronic overcapacity , developed country Governments , have on occasion , encouraged the major firms involved to reach informal arrangements to reduce capacity .  
Further urges all States to enact and enforce legislation to protect girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , female genital mutilation , rape , domestic violence , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;  
Some are prohibited ( for exports and for domestic , rather than imported , inputs ) ; others are actionable ( they can be punished subject to proof of injury ) ; and three are permissible ( all heavily utilized in the North Atlantic ) .  
Under this criterion , the contracting authority may take into account the potential for social and economic development offered by the bidders , including benefits to underprivileged groups of persons and businesses , domestic investment or other business activity , the encouragement of employment , the reservation of certain production for domestic suppliers , the transfer of technology and the development of managerial , scientific and operational skills ;  
The EU stresses its concern at the use of diamonds , gold and other resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to fund military operations in the region , and calls on all the parties to ensure that all commercial dealings of this nature are legal under the relevant domestic and international law , transparent , consistent with States ' arrangements with the international financing institutions , and benefit the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and not private individuals .  
Notes the importance of providing adequate resources for debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
The Forum underscored the need for implementation of strategies in terms of investment , mobilization of domestic and international resources and in the case of developing countries , with special attention to least developed countries and developing countries with low forest cover appropriate financial mechanisms and / or measures including support through official development assistance ( ODA ) .  
Public official shall be understood by reference to the definition of public official in the domestic law of the State in which the person in question performs that function and as applied in its criminal law and shall include , but not be limited to , any judicial official , juror or lay judge , police official , border control or customs official , investigator , prosecutor or other official with law enforcement responsibilities in the State concerned .  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including appropriate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
Adequate and timely information on the macroeconomic situation in different parts of the world was essential for early warning efforts , and sound macroeconomic policies to strengthen institutional capacity and regulatory frameworks , as well as domestic banking systems , were also essential .  
Mr . Robertson ( New Zealand ) said that his delegation was committed to joining in the efforts to address the issues raised in the wake of the recent international financial crisis , namely , how to address stability in financial markets , how to find appropriate domestic and international policies to meet developmental challenges and how to secure greater coherence in the international financial and development system .  
Export subsidies should be outlawed , domestic producer subsidies reduced , access under tariff quotas increased , tariff escalation on processed agricultural products removed , and the level and the dispersion of bound tariffs on agricultural imports reduced .  
Each State Party , in accordance with its domestic legal principles , shall take the necessary measures to enable a legal entity located in its territory or organized under its laws to be held liable when a person responsible for the management or control of that legal entity has , in that capacity , committed an offence set forth in article 2 .  Such liability may be criminal , civil or administrative .

Also stresses the importance of additional debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Notes the importance of providing adequate resources for debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
In the strict sense outlined above , the rule of law does not exist as a crime control mechanism at the international level . 3 There is no international legislation that creates conventional offences and criminal procedures applicable to individuals in the same sense as domestic criminal laws do .  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including adequate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;

Other delegations expressed concern that dealing with possession was beyond the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee or that simple possession offences might not be treated as criminal offences ( as opposed to administrative or regulatory offences ) in domestic law .  
The total cost of crime to communities ( in terms of criminal justice , lost property , shattered lives and private security ) , measured as a proportion of gross domestic product , is several times greater in developing countries than in developed countries .  
. . .  For the purpose of cooperation among States Parties to this Protocol , including , in particular , cooperation under article 9 of this Protocol , offences established in accordance with article 5 , paragraph 1 , of this Protocol shall not be considered fiscal offences or regarded as politically motivated , without prejudice to the constitutional limitations and the fundamental domestic laws of the States Parties . 16 .  The title of article 18 bis should be amended to read as follows :  
Without prejudice to articles [ 14 and 19 ] of this Convention , ensure that administrative , regulatory , law enforcement and other authorities dedicated to combating money-laundering ( including , where appropriate under domestic law , judicial authorities ) have the ability to cooperate and exchange information at the national and international levels [ within the conditions prescribed by its domestic legislation57 ] .  
The rationale behind the permanent International Criminal Court agreed to in Rome , designed to be complementary to the domestic legal systems of States parties , is to ensure that individual perpetrators do not escape criminal justice where the State is unwilling or unable to prosecute .  
Commission resolution 1997 / 50 spells out the revised mandate of the Group , which is to investigate cases of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily , provided that no final decision has been taken in such cases by local courts in conformity with domestic law , with the standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with the relevant international instruments accepted by the States concerned .  
Internal enabling environment : policy framework incentives for domestic private savings , equitable tax systems ( development and enforcement of ) , macroeconomic policies , disincentives to corruption ; good governance ; transparency ; effective regulatory and supervisory framework for the financial sector ; banking infrastructure , pension funds ; corporate governance ; internationally accepted accounting standards , and a sound legal system ( land and property rights ) ;  
Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) : need to spread FDI more widely and to diversify private capital flows in order to reduce country sector concentration , strengthened contribution of FDI for domestic capacity-building and national development goals , role of South-South flows , reasons for marginalization of countries with a sound investment environment ;  
Use of ODA for reinforcing developing countries potential for better access to global markets , and poverty eradication , leveraging larger levels of domestic or foreign private capital ;  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature and are punished by penalties consistent with their grave nature .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature and are punished by penalties consistent with their grave nature .  
At the domestic level , there is a particular responsibility to maintain a constant balance between fiscal austerity measures and the need to find the resources required to fund social policies , while not ignoring other issues , especially the lack of fiscal discipline and macroeconomic stability , inadequate social policies and difficulties in broadening the participation of the various sectors of society .  
In order to meet the requirements of domestic resource mobilization to strengthen the fragile economies in Africa and reduce poverty there , current levels of external funding sources , such as official development assistance and foreign direct investment , need to be increased .  
Fifty per cent of Latin American and Caribbean women have suffered some kind of domestic violence ; fewer than 50 per cent of births in the Central American and Andean area countries are attended by trained personnel ; maternal mortality rates remain high within the region , pointing to marked social , economic and gender inequalities that persist within the region .  
We urge all domestic , regional and international institutions to factor international environmental concerns into mainstream decision-making regarding agriculture and industrial production , trade , economics , transportation and all other economic , social and developmental fields .  
The draft resolution would also reiterate its invitation to Governments to submit comments and observations on the draft articles on the prevention of transboundary damage from hazardous activities under the topic of international liability for injurious consequences arising out of acts not prohibited by international law , and on national legislation , decisions of domestic courts and State practice relevant to diplomatic protection .  
Island States must elaborate suitable national and regional sustainable development strategies and create domestic political , economic , social , environmental and legal conditions that promote the implementation of these strategies .  
Protect the health of women workers in all sectors , including agricultural and domestic household workers , through effective environmental and occupational health policies for gender-sensitive work environments , free from sexual harassment and discrimination , which are safe and ergonomically designed to prevent occupational hazards ;  
Innovative and new approaches for financing development of sustainable energy , including renewable sources of energy is required and essential while continuing to pursue efforts to increase official development assistance , ensure continued replenishment of the Global Environmental Facility and encourage domestic and foreign private investments .  
For many developing countries , human , technical and financial resources are still not adequate , imposing severe restraints on their domestic capacity to meet the requirements of developing and using sustainable energy systems .  
Developing the capacity to export is particularly crucial in light of the fast expansion of international trade and the limited size of the domestic market of many developing countries .  
The Committee recommends that the State party accord equal treatment to both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights in terms of their domestic legal status and that if measures are taken to incorporate civil and political rights treaty obligations consideration be given to similar measures in relation to economic , social and cultural rights .  
Many participants informed the Commission about their national laws and practical initiatives aimed at preventing crime , such as programmes to prevent domestic violence and sexual and violent crimes , as well as organized and transnational crime , and corruption .  
Joining forces was perceived to imply not only developing innovative measures for international cooperation , but also strengthening domestic legal and criminal justice systems by adopting appropriate legislative and administrative measures and upgrading the skills of criminal justice personnel .  
The services provided are the usual postal services for private or official delegation mailings , including parcel post , air mail , registered and insured mail , international and domestic money orders , information about postage rates and regulations concerning entry or dispatch of parcels to and from various countries .  
Calls upon all countries to develop economic policies that promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
These divergencies in terms and underlying concepts demonstrate the need for a consistent and comprehensive advocacy for the human rights approach to education so as to integrate human rights into the existing domestic educational policies and laws as well as into international strategies and monitoring mechanisms .  
AAPSO remains concerned about the impunity of international financial institutions , which are not held accountable for the negative impact of their policies on domestic economic and social conditions .  
The Special Rapporteur attended the seventh session of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice on 22 and 23 April 1998 and made a statement on 22 April 1998 , in which he said that crime prevention and bribery in international commercial transactions required the cooperation not only of the international community but the political will of Governments to organize their domestic systems of justice to meet the challenges . 
Where backward linkages between tourism and other sectors of the economy are weak or absent , income and employment multipliers from tourism are lower because the potential stimulus to indirect spending is dissipated by increased imports rather than domestic production , as happens with many small island developing States .  
The low gross domestic product ( GDP ) , which was essentially equivalent to that of 1958 , although the population had tripled in size since that time , the annual demographic growth rate having risen from 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent ;  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening institutional capacities and regulatory frameworks , especially the regulatory and supervisory systems of the domestic financial and banking sectors ;  
Emphasizes that the opening of the capital account must be carried out in an orderly , gradual and well-sequenced manner , keeping its pace in line with the strengthening of the ability of countries to sustain its consequences , underscores the crucial importance in this regard of solid domestic financial systems and of an effective prudential framework , and invites the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank and relevant international regulatory bodies to contribute to this process ;  
Emphasizing the necessity for the developing countries , in particular African countries and least developed countries , for a domestic industrial transformation of their commodity production with a view to enhancing productivity and stabilizing and increasing their export earnings , thus promoting the sustainable economic growth of developing countries in their integration into the global economy ,  
Pollution of marine and coastal areas from land-based sources of pollution is a major issue for small island developing States ; the pollution is largely from domestic sewage , industrial effluents and agricultural run-off ; in a few larger islands ( for example , Jamaica and some Melanesian countries ) , pollution from mining effluent is also a cause for concern ;  
Enhancing the capability of small island developing States to ( i ) assess and monitor fish catch and the processing and marketing of fish by foreign and domestic fishing companies ; ( ii ) develop a legal framework for sustainable fisheries activities ; and ( iii ) develop management plans and policies for assessing , monitoring and exploiting both the living and non-living resources in the EEZ ;  
In the same resolution , the Council recognized the importance of enhancing international cooperation in the enforcement of domestic and international environmental criminal laws , of promoting operational activities in that area and of protecting the environment not only at the national level but also at the international level .  
The discussion contained in this section is illustrative of different options that have been used in domestic legislative measures to set up a regulatory framework for privately financed infrastructure projects , but the Guide does not thereby advocate the establishment of any particular model or administrative structure .  
Noting that the ongoing international financial crisis is adding further burdens to the external debt problems of many developing countries and that a number of developing countries have continued to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion , despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Each State Party may consider ensuring that the onus of proof is reversed regarding the lawful origin of alleged proceeds of crime or other property liable to confiscation , to the extent that such action is consistent with the principles of its domestic law and with the nature of the judicial and other proceedings .  
For the purpose of cooperation under this article , the offences covered by this Convention shall not be considered fiscal offences or political offences 102 ] or regarded as politically motivated , without prejudice to the constitutional limitations and the fundamental domestic law of the States Parties .  
Reaffirms the necessity for humanitarian personnel and United Nations personnel to be properly informed , inter alia , by their sponsoring organizations of the scope of their activities and the standards that they are required to meet , including those contained in relevant domestic and international law , and suitably trained so as to enhance their security and effectiveness in accomplishing their functions ;  
With regard to the laws against discrimination , the Minister stated that it was critical that refugees be specifically regulated under domestic law rather than treated as ordinary aliens , and that , whilst general discrimination was largely addressed , particular forms of discrimination should be rendered unlawful i.e.racist and xenophobic offences as well as discrimination in employment and the supply of goods and services ;  
Encourages Governments to take effective and expeditious measures , particularly the enactment or amendment , if necessary , of domestic legislation to provide appropriate penalties , such as substantial imprisonment , fines and forfeiture , in order to combat all aspects of organized criminal activities related to trafficking at the international level in women and children ;  
The need for carrying out adjustment measures in some small island developing States , such as Cook Islands , Fiji , Papua New Guinea , Solomon Islands and Vanuatu , to correct economic imbalances rooted in the past , combined with the recent economic and financial crisis in Asia , have had both direct and indirect economic impacts affecting domestic output , prices of export commodities and export earnings , incomes from tourism and foreign investments .  
Those materials included international human rights instruments , memorandum and election reports issued by the Special Representative , relevant domestic laws , training curricula , and free and fair elections posters developed by the office .  
The current conflict in the Congo has led to a deepening humanitarian crisis , exacerbated the plight of refugees and internally displaced persons , impeded the delivery of critical food and medical assistance , and in general hampered international and domestic efforts towards development and democracy .  
They were : the timely adjustment of domestic policies in developing countries ; the opening up of developed countries commodity markets and the provision of timely , relevant and affordable information and technology by those countries to commodity-dependent developing countries ; and a global effort to reduce trade and non-trade barriers in order to make the playing field level for all parties .  
To deal with the volatility of capital flows , developing countries needed to deepen domestic capital markets , institute an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework and develop a strong domestic institutional investor base .  
Recognizes the importance of the adoption of appropriate policy responses to the challenges of globalization at the national level , in particular by pursuing sound and stable domestic policies , including , inter alia , sound macroeconomic and social policies , in order to realize the objective of the eradication of poverty ;  
The discussion contained in this section is illustrative of different options that have been used in domestic legislative measures to set up a regulatory framework for privately financed infrastructure projects , but the Guide does not thereby advocate the establishment of any particular model or administrative structure .  
The representative of New Zealand indicated that her delegation could accept the inclusion of the right to self-determination in the draft declaration subject to it being consistent with the domestic understanding of the relationship between the Maori and the Crown and with respect for the territorial integrity of democratic States and their constitutional frameworks , where those met current international human rights standards .  
Furthermore , the least developed suffered from declining official development assistance , heavy indebtedness , falling export earnings owing to low commodity prices , virtually no foreign direct investment , and the effects of the structural adjustment imposed on them by IMF , which was why they had major difficulties in mobilizing domestic resources .  
The drop in aid contributions , especially the continuing decline in the share of net official development assistance in the gross domestic product of donor countries , had led to increased reliance on private loans on the international capital market .  
The Convention requires that bribery of foreign public officials be punishable by effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties comparable with those applicable to bribery of domestic officials .  
On the domestic front , he pursued a comprehensive patriotic policy that was consolidated over the years by deeprooted national unity and by social , cultural and economic achievements exceeding the bounds of imagination .  
We say that the reasoning is unfair , being based on our high per capita gross domestic product , without taking into account either our ability to pay or the seriously disproportionate distribution of national income between capital , labour and taxation .  
Efforts are being made at the national level , yet , paradoxically , official development assistance is still decreasing , and the commitment made by rich countries to commit 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product is far from being fulfilled .  
By cutting deep into all sectors of society , it undermines vital economic growth , perhaps reducing future national gross domestic product size in the region by a third over the next 20 years .  
This concern was also raised by the Government of South Africa who reported that the extensive and highly exploitative system of domestic workers provides hidden opportunities for sex services , either forced or paid .  
A favourable and enabling investment climate which mobilizes FDI and domestic savings and channels them into productive investments also requires that the suppliers of capital have reliable , transparent and comparable financial information .  
At the national level , UNCTAD could contribute to sound domestic macroeconomic and financial policies , administrative reforms and continuing efforts to promote a stable and transparent national legal and regulatory framework favourable to development .  
It is important that the global public is concerned about the economic , social and environmental consequences of foreign and domestic investment .  
For many developing countries , in particular countries that are unable to attract sufficient external private capital resources , it is essential that Governments undertake greater efforts to promote the mobilization of domestic sources of capital .  
Other delegations expressed concern that dealing with possession was beyond the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee or that simple possession offences might not be treated as criminal offences ( as opposed to administrative or regulatory offences ) in domestic law .  
Other delegations expressed concern that dealing with possession was beyond the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee or that simple possession offences might not be treated as criminal offences ( as opposed to administrative or regulatory offences ) in domestic law .  
Undertaking studies on the level of national savings , the development of stable and transparent domestic financial resources , monetary systems , foreign capital flows and the financial aspects of social policies ;  
Export subsidies should be outlawed , domestic producer subsidies reduced , access under tariff quotas increased , tariff escalation on processed agricultural products removed , and the level and dispersion of bound tariffs on agricultural imports reduced .  
Several delegations expressed the view that , for such negotiations to be successful , developed countries must find the political will to overcome narrow domestic interests and deal with the concerns of developing countries in an equitable manner .  
To promote the mobilization of domestic financial resources and to establish the basis for an enabling environment through , inter alia , a sound macroeconomic framework , a dynamic private sector , improved governance , and participatory development ;  
In only a few developing countries , mostly in Asia and Latin America , have domestic companies joined the integrated networks of transnational corporations and , in some cases , forged strategic alliances to exploit dynamic trade and investment interlinkages .  
Had these assets been freely available , they might have made a major contribution to the economic and social development process and it is possible that they might have increased more than twofold by contributing to gross domestic product .  
The larger fiscal deficit partially offset the fall in private domestic demand , while monetary policy makers maintained an austere stance until midway through the year .  
In this regard , the collective Presidency is required to ensure the full implementation of the Accords , showing real political will at the domestic level while seeking complementary solutions at the regional level .  
Reference should be made , for instance , to how the legal and institutional frameworks are geared to supporting or hindering private domestic and foreign investments .  
Furthermore , the threat may not be determined on the basis of ulterior political motives there must be genuine international concern behind the sanctions , not the foreign or domestic policy considerations of a single State or group of States .  
The common requirement that all existing domestic remedies must be exhausted before citing a State party before an international forum may result in injustice where no timeframe is set for hearing complaints of violation of human rights ;  
The underlying weakness of the social services in a number of LDCs is that they were established or instituted on the availability of external loans and grants rather than on the basis of strong , vibrant and growing domestic production and economic base .  
In the light of low and unstable export earnings , limited access to private financial flows , small domestic savings and the serious debt problems experienced by these countries , ODA remains a critical source of their development finance .  
First , rapidly rising income would allow domestic savings to rise , thereby increasing the amount of total investable resources ; and secondly , sustained growth would attract private capital as a substitute for official financing .  
Given the limited size of the domestic market and the unstable conditions of the international market , the major difficulty faced by Viet Nams agricultural sector is to find markets for its increased production .  
The Conference needs to focus on finding solutions to the inherent problem of weak productive capacities in LDCs through improved domestic policy frameworks , human capital development , traderelated capacity building and improved physical infrastructure .  
It was therefore urgent that LDCs and the international community be encouraged to foster private entrepreneurship , create a domestic environment conducive to foreign investment and expand trade internally , regionally and to the world at large .  
The development of a strong domestic construction services sector should be supported by instruments of industrial policy , human resource development and macroeconomic policies , and by removing unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles internally .  
There is very limited scope , in the foreseeable future , to meet these multiple development finance requirements with domestic resources because of sluggish growth or economic stagnation , widespread poverty and a weak domestic corporate sector .  
The development of a strong domestic construction services sector should be supported by instruments of industrial policy , human resource development and macroeconomic policies , and by removing unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles internally .  
One of the main problems faced by local firms in the domestic market is securing effective and substantive participation in projects funded by multilateral funding agencies since they have found it difficult to meet the prequalification requirements .  
There are positive signs for increasing the stability of capital markets , with the emergence of mutual funds , provident funds , the use of fund managers and the concomitant decline in reliance on individual domestic investors and foreign investors .  
Even for the larger developing countries , ODA continues to have major qualitative significance ; due to their low economic development and limited domestic resources , ODA is still irreplaceable for them .  
The need to adapt the provisions of domestic and international legal instruments to the specific requirements of electronic commerce has been emerging for some 15 years both at the national level and at the international level .  
They emphasized that domestic factors , especially consistent reform policies designed to achieve broadly based economic and social progress , are of prime importance for the transition process and the process of economic development in general .  
It was emphasized that efforts should be made by developed countries to meet as soon as possible the objective to raise the level of official development assistance ( ODA ) to 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product ( GDP ) .  
Enabling domestic environments : governance issues ; sound macroeconomic policies , including fiscal and private savings policies ; special needs of Africa , the least developed countries , small island developing States , landlocked and transit developing countries and other developing countries as well as countries with economies in transition with special difficulties in attracting financing for development .  
Societies in which citizens can openly air their grievances ; choose their governments in free , open elections ; have a say , through elected local bodies , in aspects of governance that touch their daily lives the most ; and get redress when they need it from an independent judiciary that upholds the rule of law , are far less likely to erupt into domestic conflict than those under totalitarian or military rule .  
The comprehensive agenda of the Committee , spanning the domestic , regional and global dimensions of economic , social and cultural rights , bodes well for the future , as does the immense interest shown for bridging the gap between the rhetoric on economic , social and cultural rights and the operative priorities at all levels . 
Content : Structural features of and trends in the financial system ; the role of capital flow vulnerability of developing countries in recent financial crises ; implications of external debt for the formulation of domestic and foreign economic policies ; the World Banks Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) and Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers ( PRSP ) initiatives ; the debate on the international financial architecture ; the coherence between the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank and the World Trade Organization ; and domestic and foreign sources of financing for development .  
Experts indicated that margin of preference in international tendering allocated to local firms should be sufficient to allow their effective participation , and that criteria established for participation in multilaterally financed projects should not be so stringent as to exclude domestic construction firms in developing countries .  
The unhealthy tendency to overstate alleged violations of civil and political rights with a view to satisfying special interest groups or domestic constituencies had become a characteristic of the Third Committees country-specific draft resolutions .  
The reasons were weak economic governance , lack of response to stabilization measures , weak institutional and physical infrastructure , small domestic markets and limited access to regional and global markets , and also the absence of a critical mass of small - and medium-sized enterprises .  
While international efforts could create conducive conditions for economic development , the primary responsibility for a nations development lay with its Government and people , and discussions on financing growth the development should focus on how to help LDCs mobilize domestic financial resources and attract external resources .  
In order to extricate the continent from its deep-rooted socioeconomic problems , domestic policy reforms had to be accompanied by concerted action at the global level , including measures designed to achieve an expeditious resolution of the debt crisis , enhanced productive capacity , improved and expanded market access , increased official development assistance and a more generous transfer of technology .  
The representative of Ethiopia , speaking on behalf of the African Group , stressed the complex and daunting development challenges facing the LDCs and argued that the resolution of such challenges required a multi-dimensional approach encompassing increased development aid and outright debt cancellation , enhanced productive capacity and reduced supply constraints , improved market access , and a mutually supportive domestic and international policy environment .  
It was therefore urgent that LDCs and the international community be encouraged to foster private entrepreneurship , create a domestic environment conducive to foreign investment and expand trade internally , regionally and to the world at large .  
That report concluded that for African countries to be able to attain the target of reducing poverty by half by 2015 , set by the World Social Summit in Copenhagen , an average annual gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth rate of around 7 per cent and an investment rate of around 33 per cent of GDP were required .  
It believed that the existing legal regime was adequate to govern the exploration and uses of outer space , and that it would be practical for Member States , after having reviewed their domestic laws on outer space , to adhere to and apply the international legal instruments governing outer space .  
We emphasize the importance of more stable and predictable financing for social and economic development and stress the important role that official development assistance can still play , in this respect , for the majority of developing countries , particularly least developed countries and other countries with limited potential for domestic savings or export earnings .  
The Committee is concerned , further , that domestic law is not yet fully compatible with the provisions and principles of the Convention , that the process of drafting and adopting new legislation is slow and that , in addition , some customary practices which are prejudicial to childrens rights may still be applied instead of modern domestic legal provisions .  
The Committee recommends that the State party conduct a comprehensive review of the Basic Law and domestic laws , including administrative regulations and legal procedural rules , to ensure that they conform to international human rights standards , including the Convention , that they are sufficiently clear and precise , are published , and are accessible to the public .  
Both the new State and entity Governments have ambitious plans to further the reforms cutting tax rates and widening the tax base , improving collection of customs and excise payments and pushing forward with privatization to attract both domestic and foreign investors and to balance official budgets .  
It was generally agreed that it is important for countries to establish an enabling environment at both the international and domestic levels in order to promote sustainable development , including economic growth , social development and environmental protection .  
Elements of such an environment were considered to include sound macroeconomic policies , accountable and transparent governance , a sound domestic legal and regulatory framework , incentives for investment , the involvement of civil society in public decision-making and the strengthening of civil , political , economic and financial institutions .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention , are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Each State Party , in accordance with its domestic legal principles , shall take the necessary measures to enable a legal entity located in its territory or organized under its laws to be held liable when a person responsible for the management or control of that legal entity has , in that capacity , committed an offence referred to in article 2 .  
States Parties shall further cooperate in the prevention of the offences set forth in article 2 by exchanging accurate and verified information in accordance with their national law , and by coordinating administrative and other measures , consistent with their respective domestic legal and administrative systems , taken as appropriate to prevent the commission of offences as set forth in article 2 , in particular by : ( a ) . . .  
By 2005 , most Member States that have not already done so will have developed , adopted and implemented the necessary domestic legal and administrative measures , which will create an infrastructure for preventing and controlling illicit transnational traffic in firearms and related items .  
The development and implementation of effective measures at the national level is essential to enable each State to combat domestic money-laundering activities , to avoid becoming a haven for money-laundering by foreign organized criminal groups and to cooperate effectively with other States in the international effort to combat money-laundering .  
Implementation of the objective will result in more effective tools to combat domestic and transnational aspects of money-laundering , with a consequent reduction of the ability of organized criminal groups to derive benefits from their proceeds and to dedicate illicit resources to further criminal activities .  
The view was expressed that the interaction and potential conflicts between the proposed system of international interests in mobile equipment and existing domestic legal regimes would require careful analysis .  
While domestic public investments have a positive role to play , in view of scarcities of domestic resources in LDCs , it will also be important to mobilize external capital , including official development assistance and foreign direct investment .  
However , there is very limited scope , in the foreseeable future , to meet the multiple development finance requirements of LDCs with domestic resources because of sluggish growth or economic stagnation , widespread poverty and a weak domestic corporate sector .  
Underlines that unilateral coercive measures are one of the major obstacles to the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development and , in this regard , calls upon all States to avoid the unilateral imposition of economic coercive measures and the extraterritorial application of domestic laws which run counter to the principles of free trade and hamper the development of developing countries , as recognized by the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on the Right to Development in its report ( E / CN . 4 / 1998 / 29 ) ;  
Commission resolution 1997 / 50 spells out its revised mandate , which is to investigate cases of detention imposed arbitrarily , provided that no final decision has been taken in such cases by local courts in conformity with domestic law , with the relevant standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with the relevant international instruments accepted by the States concerned .  
Another pillar of an enabling domestic environment is a sound macroeconomic framework , including , for example , sound budget priorities for health , education and agriculture / food security , and transparent and accountable public expenditure management and an efficient tax system .  
Ending corruption is fundamental for mobilizing domestic resources , and increased direct and indirect measures are required , including increased transparency , in both government and private sector activities .  Fighting corruption is one of the main priorities of the development agenda and this has been a strong message from a wide spectrum of countries .  
The role of developing countries in establishing or enhancing favourable conditions for a sustainable enabling environment for both domestic and international investments , including improving the legal , economic and social environment for investment .  
Trade is the most important mechanism for most if not all small island developing States to expand domestic savings and finance their various development processes especially because they seriously lack comparative advantages and economies of scale , being vulnerable and dependent on a small number of export commodities , predominantly agriculture , light manufacturing and underdeveloped service-based sectors , to drive much-needed foreign exchange earnings , employment and development . 
All countries must realize that the mobilization of domestic resources for development calls for a supportive environment in which sound macroeconomic policies are applied ( stabilization of public finance , control of inflation , use of effective and efficient mechanisms for the distribution of public expenditure ) and favourable conditions in which the private sector can grow .  
Other essential factors in promoting the mobilization of domestic resources for development are political stability , good governance and the rule of law , a sound and transparent legal system , guarantees for private investors , transparency in public administration , markets and companies , respect for contract law and private property , efforts to combat corruption at the national and international levels , the participation of citizens and civil society in public life , and equal access to resources for women and men .  
Nevertheless , although the individual countries must mobilize the domestic resources that they need for their development , the high-level international event should acknowledge that some developing countries do not have a sound enough economic base to ensure that they will have the necessary production , saving and management capacity to undertake , on their own , the effort of financing poverty-reduction programmes and ensuring growth .  
Gravely concerned at the increasing activities of transnational criminal organizations and others that profit from international trafficking in women and children without regard to dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards ,  
Affirms that the term violence against women means any act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life , and including domestic violence , crimes committed in the name of honour , crimes committed in the name of passion , traditional practices harmful to women , including female genital mutilation , and forced marriages ;  
Underlines that unilateral coercive measures are one of the major obstacles to the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development and , in this regard , calls upon all States to avoid the unilateral imposition of economic coercive measures and the extraterritorial application of domestic laws which run counter to the principles of free trade and hamper the development of developing countries , as recognized by the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on the Right to Development in its report ( E / CN . 4 / 1998 / 29 ) ;  
Calls upon all States to take all appropriate national , bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent all forms of violence against children and to protect them from torture and other forms of violence , physical violence including domestic violence , child abuse , mental and sexual violence , abuse by the police and other law enforcement authorities or by employees in juvenile detention centres , orphanages , child care institutions and others , as well as violence in the street and in schools ;  
The view was expressed that , although the provisions of the treaties were managing well with the increasingly complex activities of outer space , member States should focus on their domestic legal regimes in order to ensure that the provisions of the treaties were being properly implemented , including putting in place appropriate domestic regulatory mechanisms to ensure effective compliance .  
The view was expressed that the interaction and potential conflicts between the proposed system of international interests in mobile equipment and existing domestic legal regimes would require careful analysis .  
National efforts to mobilize domestic financial resources should consolidate enabling domestic environments geared to promote growth with equity , through good governance , effective domestic institutions , the rule of law and sound macroeconomic , structural and social development policies that are gender - and environment-sensitive .  
How best to enhance cooperation between donors and recipient countries so that resources are available on a timely basis to respond to improvements in domestic policies and the ensuing opportunities for investments in areas key to the achievement of Millennium Summit goals and other internationally agreed targets , through the development of comprehensive poverty reduction strategies by developing countries and matching commitments from donors for coordinated and harmonized support ?  
Others for different reasons , including domestic economic mismanagement , conflicts , natural catastrophes and external economic shocks , such as terms of trade changes , international interest rate hikes or contagion are faced with difficult or even unbearable debt burdens .  
The prevailing view within the Working Group , however , was that , although the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce was a useful basis for modernizing domestic legislation or interpreting international instruments , the legal barriers to the development of electronic commerce posed by international instruments , in particular multilateral treaties and conventions , required special attention .  
Request States to adopt public policies and give impetus to programmes on behalf of indigenous women , with a view to promoting their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ; to putting an end to their situation of disadvantage for reasons of gender ; to dealing with urgent problems affecting them , in education and in the economy and in the matter of domestic violence ; and to eliminating the situation of discrimination suffered by indigenous women on multiple grounds of racism and gender discrimination ;  
Urge States to give special attention , when promoting and implementing legislative and judicial policies designed to give workers adequate protection , to the serious situation of lack of protection and , in some cases , the exploitation or trafficking of victims of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , a situation that allows or facilitates confinement , as in the case of domestic workers and dangerous and badly paid jobs ;  
To implement and follow up the commitments undertaken pursuant to paragraph 17 of the Vienna Declaration and to develop , adopt and implement effective domestic legislation , regulations and administrative measures to prevent , detect and combat , in cooperation with other States , domestic and transnational money-laundering , in accordance with the relevant international instruments , in particular the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime , and using as a guideline the relevant initiatives of regional , interregional and multilateral organizations against money-laundering , the specific measures below are recommended .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to prepare , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the domestic , bilateral , regional and multilateral legal provisions and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with illicit access to genetic resources and also the extent to which organized criminal groups are involved therein and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session .  
The report addressed the following areas : mobilizing domestic financial resources for development ; mobilizing international resources for development : foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and other private flows ; trade ; increasing international financial cooperation for development through , inter alia , ODA ; debt ; and addressing systemic issues : enhancing the coherence and consistency of the international monetary , financial and trading systems in support of development .  
Requests the Secretary-General to prepare , within existing resources or drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing domestic , bilateral , regional and multilateral legal provisions and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with the prevention , combating and eradication of illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna by organized criminal groups and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to prepare , within existing resources or drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the domestic , bilateral , regional and multilateral legal provisions and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with illicit access to genetic resources and also the extent to which organized criminal groups are involved therein and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session .  
Some speakers noted that those and other issues related to the return of funds of illicit origin were the subject of constitutional and other provisions of their domestic legislation and that those issues would need to be addressed by the intergovernmental open-ended expert group to prepare draft terms of reference for the negotiation of an international legal instrument against corruption and the ad hoc committee for the negotiation of such an instrument .  
The 1997 Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict found , for example , that the gross domestic product ( GDP ) in Lebanon in the early 1990s remained 50 per cent lower than it was before fighting broke out in 1974 ; that civil war and widespread use of landmines was widely blamed for the abandonment of an estimated 80 per cent of Angolas agricultural land ; and that already inadequate food production in Burundi dropped 17 per cent during recent periods of conflict .  
Declining availability of financial resources , domestic and external , including ODA , a heavy and unsustainable debt burden , falling or volatile commodity prices , complex trade barriers , lack of economic and export diversification and market access for key products which LDCs benefit from , as well as supply-side constraints , have seriously affected the growth and development prospects of LDCs .  
It is recognized that this initiative is important in mobilizing new and additional resources , both from domestic and external sources , with a view to facilitating universal access to basic social services .  
While domestic public investments have a positive role to play , in view of scarcities of domestic resources in LDCs , it will also be important to mobilize external capital , including official development assistance and foreign direct investment .  
However , there is very limited scope , in the foreseeable future , to meet the multiple development finance requirements of LDCs with domestic resources because of sluggish growth or economic stagnation , widespread poverty and a weak domestic corporate sector .  
Long-term foreign private capital flows have a complementary and catalytic role to play in building domestic supply capacity as they lead to tangible and intangible benefits , including export growth , technology and skills transfer , employment generation and poverty eradication .  
While we strive our best to mobilize domestic resources and to learn from best practices , the global community must help us with increased flows of official development assistance , better trading opportunities , expanded debt relief and support for institutional development so that our people , living in urban and rural areas alike , can lead a decent and productive life .  
Urges States to give special attention , when promoting and implementing legislative and judicial policies designed to give workers adequate protection , to the serious situation of lack of protection and , in some cases , the exploitation or trafficking of victims of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , a situation that allows or facilitates confinement , as in the case of domestic workers and dangerous and badly paid jobs ;  
These are the precise considerations that led to Russias initiative to convene a Balkan summit , with a view to the conclusion , by the States of the region and interested neighbouring countries , of a legally binding agreement that would set out mutual obligations for absolute compliance with the fundamental principles of State relations , the most important of which are the inviolability of borders , sovereign equality , respect for territorial integrity , non-interference in the domestic affairs of other States and the non-use of force . 
In order to achieve economic development , the Government intended to apply strict fiscal and budgetary measures , holding inflation at about 3 per cent , enhancing the competitiveness of the domestic economy and improving the business environment so as to promote the development of the private sector .  
To adopt and implement , in the States that have not already done so , the necessary legislative or other measures to establish as criminal offences under their domestic law the illegal manufacture , possession , stockpiling and trade of small arms and light weapons within their areas of jurisdiction , in order to ensure that those engaged in such activities can be prosecuted under appropriate national penal codes .  
The costs involved are certainly much less than the overall costs of malnourishment and malnutrition : for example , it has been calculated that malnutrition costs Pakistan 5 per cent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) and just iron deficiency in children costs Bangladesh 2 per cent of GDP . 81 The fact that the primary cause of hunger and malnutrition is poverty does not prevent efficient measures being taken that are not costly . 
That the Parties included in Annex I shall implement domestic action in accordance with national circumstances and with a view to reducing emissions in a manner conducive to narrowing per capita differences between developed and developing country Parties while working towards achievement of the ultimate objective of the Convention ;  
In addition , a large number of public information systems such as local news and weather , entertainment , tourism , maps and sports are developed based on local content and will stimulate the development of the domestic information services industry and raise the living standard of the local people .  
That the Parties included in Annex I shall implement domestic action in accordance with national circumstances and with a view to reducing emissions in a manner conducive to narrowing per capita differences between developed and developing country Parties while working towards achievement of the ultimate objective of the Convention .  
A monthly average of 300 crimes have been reported to the police , half of which constitute cases of theft or personal assault , in particular domestic violence , and criminal investigations have been completed in over 80 per cent of the cases .  
The World Bank notes that if aggregate gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth in developing countries over the next 15 years were to equal the average attained during the 1990s , then progress in poverty reduction would be even slower than in scenario B , and the number of people living on less than $ 1 a day at the end of the forecast period would be only marginally lower than in 1998 .  
In light of the additional financial resources urgently required to enable countries to achieve the poverty reduction goal as well as the other Millennium development goals , the General Assembly may wish to urge Governments to continue to implement policies to enhance domestic financial resources further and to promote foreign direct investment and other private capital flows , and to put them to efficient use .  
In the process of rural industrialization , independent entrepreneurs cater for local and international markets and act as subcontractors to larger domestic and foreign firms , thus further intensifying market integration .  
Training programmes and discussions aimed at both rural women and men to promote gender awareness should be organized by national and local governments , human rights groups and other non-governmental organizations in order to encourage the sharing of parental roles and domestic duties by men .  
The challenges faced by developing countries in terms of acute food insecurity should be carefully addressed to ensure adequate flexibility in national policy design to foster domestic agricultural production .  
While noting that anti-dumping and countervailing actions were legitimate measures , he said that AD actions had increased owing to the less than stringent implementation of the relevant WTO agreements , because of their somewhat vague and ambiguous provisions , which had permitted domestic complainants to make full use of the flexibility deriving from imprecise and ambiguous provisions .  
In implementing its interim programme , the Government thus faces a serious problem of external financing , which is essential in view of the countrys meagre domestic resources and the unresolved problem of its external debt arrears , which stands in the way of conventional official development assistance mechanisms .  
Thus the weighted average of gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita ( estimated at current official exchange rates ) is estimated to be $ 0.65 per day for the total population in African LDCs and $ 0.88 per day in Asian LDCs in the late 1990s , whilst in PPP terms ( in 1985 international prices ) it is estimated to be $ 1.51 per day in African LDCs and $ 4.59 per day in Asian LDCs .  
Participants affirmed their commitment to providing the full financing and speedy and effective implementation of the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) Initiative , which is essential for freeing domestic budgetary resources for poverty reduction , and they undertook to make expeditious progress towards full cancellation of outstanding official bilateral debt within the context of the Enhanced HIPC Initiative . 15 .  The Framework for Partnership ( A / CONF . 191 / 11 , chap .  
It calls for the implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative on the basis of mutual agreement and commitment by donors and least developed countries , and recognizes that this initiative is important in mobilizing new and additional resources , both from domestic and from external sources , with a view to facilitating universal access to basic social services .  
As regards physical infrastructure , development partners committed to supporting infrastructure development , both through public investment and by facilitating private investment , and particularly for the creation of essential infrastructure to facilitate the functioning of liberalized domestic and regional markets .  
The least developed countries committed to pursuing balance policies that sought to limit transmission of external shock into the domestic economy while promoting gradual liberalization , and developing safety nets to protect the poor and vulnerable segments of the population against the consequences of external shocks .  
It was acknowledged that the large investment requirements of least developed countries and the very limited scope , in the foreseeable future , to meet the multiple development finance requirements with domestic resources , implied a need for new and additional resources and efforts to increase ODA to least developed countries supportive of national programmes of action , including poverty eradication strategies .  
With the strengthening and upgrading of the former Logistics Communications Service to the Logistics Support Division , due attention is given to the magnitude and level of responsibilities in terms of providing all United Nations peacekeeping operations and field political offices with the technical and domestic accommodation , communications , transportation , information technology , engineering , utilities , material supply , contracting services , medical support , detailed logistics planning and supporting coordination which they need for cost-effective and efficient performance of their mandates .  
Everyone is aware of the critical role of the mass media in shaping public opinion on any question , be it domestic or international , and of its major responsibility to observe impartiality and complete objectivity in covering events such as those that took place in the United States recently .  
The economic and social problems of the region remained acute and the rate of growth of gross domestic product ( GDP ) required to place Africa on the path of sustainable development had not been attained .  
Beyond complying with the Tribunal , the Framework Agreement places responsibility on the domestic authorities to undertake crucial measures , including the prosecution , dismissal or transfer , as appropriate , of persons in military , paramilitary and police forces and other public servants , responsible for serious violations of the basic rights of persons belonging to ethnic or minority groups . 2 It is essential to the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina that an adequate legal framework to effect such duties be established . 
The illicit trade in small arms and light weapons is directly linked to social , economic and humanitarian problems caused by the domestic civil confrontations and international conflicts , as well as by the ruthless action of organized crime , especially that of terrorism and drug traffickers .  
Structural adjustment programmes have not had the expected outcome , and the Trade and Development Board , while welcoming the new emphasis of such programmes on poverty reduction , encourages continued attention to be paid to external factors as well as to shortcomings of domestic markets and enterprises , human capital and physical infrastructure , institutions and income distribution . 
Reaffirms that a strong political commitment by the international community is needed to implement strengthened and effective international cooperation and assistance for development , including social development , that the mobilization of domestic and international resources for development from all sources is an essential component of the implementation of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action and of the further initiatives for social development ;  
High rates of unemployment , in particular among young people , the non-functioning of the national safety net system , scarce opportunities for private investment , declining domestic production and other financial , cultural and criminal factors have contributed to political instability .  
The effects have included a major decline in the countrys gross domestic product and in per capita income ; a sharp increase in mortality rates , especially among mothers and children ; marked deterioration in infrastructure , especially in connection with the water supply , sewerage , electricity and hospitals and health centres ; a drop in school enrolment to 53 per cent and the consequent cultural and scientific impoverishment ; and the destruction of the social fabric .  
On the domestic front , his Government had sought to improve the legal and economic instruments of environmental management and to promote a sustainable development by giving priority to investment in pollution prevention and various progressive environmental technologies ; and it would be working to improve the efficiency of the energy sector after accurately assessing the costs involved . 
In this context , and given the decline in official development assistance , the former Secretary-General of the United Nations , Mr . Javier Prez de Cullar , speaking on the subject of the link between disarmament and development on 11 June at the opening of a workshop in Lima , noted that developing countries needed to rely more on their own resources and , to that end , to re-examine the percentage of their gross domestic product and national budgets used for military spending .  
It was therefore the role of the International Conference on Financing for Development to provide developing countries with realistic advice enabling them to reformulate domestic policies and review regulatory constraints that were currently hampering the growth of the private sector and discouraging foreign investment .  
In order to promote domestic savings , attract foreign investment , increase trade revenue , manage external debt and make the most effective use of official development assistance , developing countries needed to have essential human resources and , therefore , to train experts in those fields .  
Given that the current difficult situation could be overcome only by a combination of adequate domestic policies and an enabling international environment , the Committee must review the main economic issues and identify areas for cooperation .  
The mobilization of additional resources , both domestic and foreign , was essential in order to achieve higher levels of growth and more effective poverty eradication ; private capital flows , and the promotion of trade , which would generate foreign capital , particularly in countries which had not been able to attract international financial flows , were equally important .  
Debt relief was one way to free resources for investment and poverty eradication , but , if it was genuinely to improve economic and social conditions in the poorest countries , it must be accompanied by sound domestic economic and budgetary policies , supported by the civil society of the countries concerned .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .

They considered that the lack of access to modern and sustainable energy is a major cause of environmental and health hazards in vast areas of the developing world and a major impediment to quality of life , while recognizing both the fundamental role of energy as the largest component of gross domestic product in several countries and the very rapid changes taking place in that sector . 
For that purpose , alliances have to be promoted between domestic and foreign enterprises of all sizes for the supply of services nationally and internationally ; a network of national and international companies supplying core and related energy services should be established ; and the energy strategy must be supported by Venezuelas active participation in the multilateral trade negotiation forums .  
Calls upon States to investigate the possibility of mercenary involvement whenever and wherever criminal acts of a terrorist nature occur and to bring to trial those found responsible or to consider their extradition , if so requested , in accordance with domestic law and applicable bilateral or international treaties ;  
The system supported domestic applications in areas such as crop forecasting , ground and surface water harvesting , forest surveying , wasteland and potential fishing-zone mapping , urban planning and environmental monitoring ; and the data from those satellites was being shared with several countries under commercial agreements .  
Recognizes the importance of the adoption of appropriate policy responses to the challenges of globalization at the national level , in particular by pursuing sound and stable domestic policies , including sound macroeconomic and social policies , inter alia , those contributing to increased income of the poor , in order to realize the objective of the eradication of poverty ;  
Recalling that prevention , preparedness and contingency planning for emergencies at a global level depend , for the most part , on the strengthened local and national response capacities as well as on the availability of financial resources , both domestic and international , 1 .

Activities : Two workshops were held from 22 to 27 October : ( i ) application of international human rights norms by domestic courts and tribunals ; and ( ii ) the elaboration of strategies for the promotion and protection of economic , social and cultural rights . 
Commission resolution 1997 / 50 spells out the revised mandate of the Group , which is to investigate cases of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily , provided that no final decision has been taken in such cases by local courts in conformity with domestic law , with the standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with the relevant international instruments accepted by the States concerned .  
A significant enhancement and strengthening of international cooperation in the field of human rights leading to increased effectiveness of international machinery , improved respect of human rights at the national level , through , inter alia , universal ratification of all international human rights treaties , the incorporation of those standards into the domestic legislation of States and the continuing adaptation of the United Nations human rights machinery to current and future needs in the promotion and protection of human rights , as reflected in the Vienna Declaration ;  
There was a need to give legal meaning and support to economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development at the domestic level ; concrete steps should be taken to entrench those rights in constitutions and ensure their justiciability as human rights and not mere aspirations ; judges and lawyers had an important role and responsibility in that regard ; their independence must be safeguarded by Governments ;
