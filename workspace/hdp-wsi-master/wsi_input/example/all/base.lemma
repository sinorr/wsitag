At the same time , in order to enhance the consciousness , foreseeability , and effectiveness of practical activities , we should base all major policy decisions on scientific research and adequate proofs ; and base all scientific forecasts and management on a correct understanding of the objective law of the society .  
Drawing a lesson from the bitter experience , Hainan has since then set sights on its good ecological environment and its unique resources and re-established the industrial strategy of building itself as a base of tropical and high-efficiency agriculture and as an island tourist resort .  At the same time , it has developed high-technology , high-value-added , and high-efficiency industry which does not cause pollution , does not require redundant construction , and does not destroy resources .  
Deputy Du Qinglin , secretary of the Hainan provincial CPC committee , said : Hainan 's industrial structural adjustment is based on , from a strategic viewpoint and bearing the overall situation in mind , making use of the resources for Hainan 's development , studying the market trend , deciding strategic industries to be developed , and bringing about industrial upgrading by making scientific and technological innovations .  In addition , through structural adjustment and linking the industries , we have effected new economic growth on an industrial base at a higher level .  
Wen Jiabao pointed out : From now on , the stress of aiding the poor through development should be laid on the western region , areas inhabited by minority nationalities , old revolutionary base areas , and utterly destitute area with very poor natural conditions .  It is necessary to take effective measures to step up the work of aiding the poor and to change their straitened circumstances .  
Traditional industries are still the principal bodies in Liaoning , which is an old industrial base , and to a great extent , state-owned industries manifest the model of speed and efficiency .  The state 's efforts to stimulate domestic demand , and gradually put the proactive fiscal policy into place , have produced a certain effect of stimulating the market for Liaoning industries .  
Inner Mongolia deputies Liu Mingzu , Yun Bulong , Lei Eerdeni , Niu Yuru , Chen Pengshan , Ma Dehai , Wang Weishan , Zhu Guangkai and Cha Gan separately expressed their views on the autonomous region 's economic development , large-scale development of China 's Western Region , transformation of old industrial base , exploitation of rare earth elements , grassland construction , reform of state-owned enterprises , establishment of a social security system , economic restructuring , and attaching importance to education in ethnic minority regions .

Zeng Peiyan said : We must control population growth , protect and develop the ecological environment , and save and effectively utilize resources to truly base economic and social development on constant scientific and technological advancement , the sustained utilization of resources , an ecological balance , and a clean environment .  
Because amateur creative works have a wide base of experience from the lives of the rank and file , professional literary and artistic workers must be good at absorbing nutrients from amateur works to enrich their own base of experience from the lives of the rank and file and broaden their own sources of materials from the lives of rank and file .  
Beijing has become not only the largest education base nationwide , but also a renowned international education center in the Asia-Pacific region , thereby laying a good foundation for deepening education reform and comprehensively carrying out personal quality education .  
and we must base our efforts on those major projects that will play a strong locomotive role , make extensive impacts , and expedite future economic and social development of the whole region , and adopt feasible policies and measures , thus pushing ahead a large-scale exploration of resources and large-scale development of the economy in this region .  
To push forward the large-scale development of the western region , all localities are required to act in line with the unified arrangements of the central authorities , carry out their work in a down-to-earth manner , further broaden their vision , and base their work on a higher starting point , stressed Wu Bangguo .  
Also through structural readjustment , the western region is expected to eliminate a batch of technical the backward small enterprises which pollute the environment ; and at the same time , the region should expand and reinforce those industries and enterprises which enjoy a sound competitiveness in the market and which can increase the financial sources of the region , so that they can become a pillar and a base for the rejuvenation and the development of the local economy .  
It is necessary to proceed on the basis of resolving currently prominent problems and to have in mind long-term development ; it is necessary to vigorously proceed with the strategic adjustment of the economic structure , to further stabilize and enhance agriculture 's position as the base , to intensify the adjustment of the industrial structure , and to accelerate the grand development of the western region , so as to improve the overall quality of the national economy and to raise the economy to a higher level .

The above-mentioned " Opinion " points out : Over the past five decades following the founding of New China , especially since the start of reform and opening-up , the social welfare work in this country has made considerable progress and played a positive role in building the socialist material and spiritual civilizations .  As far as our old-age population is concerned , however , we have a large base figure , and the number of old people is still increasing at a rapid pace .  
The relationship between " one center " and " two basic points " embodies the dialectical and unified relationship between the economic base and the superstructure , including ideology and politics , in which the former plays a role as the final and decisive factor and the latter plays a tremendous reactive role in supporting the former .  
Those who truly base themselves on reality and on the long future have set their vision on some feasible aspects .  While improving their own techniques and management , they have established the systems of authentication , distribution , and security , in addition to developing in the direction of professionalization .  They have aimed at the identified market targets and actively opened up market space , and made a link between enterprises and enterprises and between enterprises and consumers with networks .  
Today , with the reforms and opening to the outside , only when leading cadres at all levels possess noble values , strive to become pure people , noble people , people detached from base interests , people benefiting the people , thinking what the masses think , feeling the anxiety of the masses , suffering first , enjoying later , content to live an austere life , and having far-reaching ambitions , can they unite and lead the masses to approach common prosperity sooner .  
Xu Qifeng ( professor ) : We know that satellites and guided missiles operate primarily under the effects of the earth 's gravitational force , and a precise calculation of their orbits or trajectories requires an accurate calculation of these gravitational forces .  Furthermore the calculation of earth 's gravitational force must be established on the basis of a coordinate system with a geocentric base point .  
On the basis that an all level network will gradually become familiar with office , strategic , and technical exercises , we should strengthen the joint communications connections of the information networks of all military branches , taking the theater level as the base unit .  In particular we should pay attention to applying computer network technology and satellite technology , gradually expanding the three branches joint network training avenues by forming into one entity the training among combat , support , and logistics systems among the various military branches .  
Through reinforcing and improving ideological and political work , clearly explaining the common interest relations and our trans-century development objectives , plans , and policies among the masses though propaganda and inculcation , we shall make the 1.2-billion people share the same ideological base , hold the same ideal and belief , and strive for the same goal .  Thus , greater enthusiasm , initiative , and creativity will burst forth among our people in their joint struggle for building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
During the visit , both sides signed six agreements including a petrochemical base cooperation project worth $ 6 billion and a coal mine fire fighting project .  The agreements inject new vitality into the two countries ' economic and trade cooperation and will produce a major and deep impact on the two countries ' long-term cooperation .  
At the direct-and-dispatch center , the writers noticed that the " red " and " blue " sides had not seen each other before hand .  Using an agile direct-and-dispatch monitoring and control system , the base directorial department monitored the " red army 's " movements at any time , while at the same time mobilizing the " blue army " , and racking its brain to create problems for the " red army " .  The " blue army " tackled the " red unit 's " weak points .  
The computer-assisted evaluation system that was established at the combined tactical training base has enabled the mechanized division that participated in the exercise to know for sure where they stood in terms of combat effectiveness .  The modern computer-assisted evaluation system uses a tree-structured computer theory to carry out automated processing of electronic mail , positioning , and imagery information compiled from the direct-and-dispatch monitoring and control system ;  
Therefore , the unit , relying on its own efforts in the face of these difficulties , took the initiative in carrying out coordinated training with a transportation regiment of the military region , a helicopter wing , and a naval test base under the support of the military region 's relevant department .  For the first time in the entire armed forces , it conducted a long-distance three-dimensional maneuver for its troops by four transportation methods - - " sea routes , air links , railways , and highways " .  The maneuver was a success .  
On a military training base in the northern frontier where the winds were strong and grasses were robust , a combined real-troop and live-ammunition military exercise engaging in various arms of the services turned the vast grassland into a spectacular painting of a battlefield .  
This successful exercise , with a landing operation as its backdrop , has showed clearly that the multidimensional combat ability of our army is being enhanced today , as it not only has the means to cope with hard offensives launched by the enemy with such high-tech weapons as cruise missile and armed helicopter ; but also has the right measures to counter soft assaults , such as network attacks , which base on high technologies means .  
The creative spirit of the masses of people is respected , the spirit of daring to think and act and be pioneers is recommended and admired in the society , and the new experiences acquired by the masses at the grass-roots level have become a powerful base for the party to formulate policies .  
have transformed our field equipment support , supply , and maintenance structure from one for ensuring separate support , supply , and maintenance for three armed services or different departments respectively into an integrated structure for ensuring support , supply , and maintenance for three armed services at the same time , which is capable of providing joint and regional support for three armed services ; handling repairs at a base ; and ensuring follow-up emergency repairs .  
- - - Equipment training system for combat readiness : In the training system , this department adopted a training system which organically combines education in institutions with training in the base and troop training , persisted in conducting complete and united individual training , unit training , training for chiefs and organs , and comprehensive drills , basically built an orderly , regular , and well-coordinated equipment training system for combat readiness , which has a perfect structure and content .  
Designated as the " blue army " in a combined tactical training base , a certain armored brigade of the Beijing Military Region has conducted confrontation exercises with several " red army " divisions and brigades in succession , thus playing an important role in inspecting the military region 's achievements in training with science and technology and raising the quality of the training .  
In the exercise of " continuous attacks by submarines against an enemy frigate formation " organized by the base in early November , commanders of the " Red " and the " Blue " sides carried out confrontations without giving advance notice on their operational intentions .  Strong winds and heavy storms happened to be ragging at the sea area where the drill was conducted .  Large sea waves and low visibility increased the difficulty of spotting the targets .  
We should base its implementation on winning modern regional wars , particularly high-tech regional wars , and closely center its implementation on preparing for future military struggles .  We should take needs as the drive , regard technology as the boost , and consider systems as the insurance .  We should strictly carry out the principles , procedures and methods stipulated in the " armament regulation , " comprehensively complete every task in armament construction , reinforce the quality of our military construction and strengthen the military through science and technology .  
However , we should clearly understand that we are still in the early stages of a socialist society .  We are still facing a basic national climate characterized by vast space , a large population , a weak economic base and slow economic and cultural development .  We are still facing a basic national climate characterized by a dominating social contradiction expressed as a gap between social productivity and the increasing material and cultural demands of the populace , as well as a huge economic , scientific and technological gap with developed countries .  
Second , the US military may plan to use Guam as an experimental site for US nuclear submarines in the new century .  For instance , a submarine 's deep-water communications and data image transmission and the suitability of undersea launching of missiles under new fighting conditions can all be tested at the base in Guam .  
In light of this principle , vigorously promoting the spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career is not harmful to the socialist economic situation and the development of the socialist market economy - - it is beneficial to the development of the socialist market economy and the consolidation of the socialist economic base .  
Between 22 and 26 January this year , an unprecedented war game took place at an isolated , super-secure base east of Colorado Springs . It captured worldwide attention .  The war game was set in a space war in 2017 .  In the game , the United States was an innocent party being pushed around .  A space contest was simulated with space weapons .  Over 250 people participated in the three-day exercise .  
Quoting an anonymous Washington official , a foreign news agency reported that after the aircraft collision incident , three missile destroyers that had just completed their vocation in Hong Kong immediately changed their schedule of returning to the base in US West Coast , turned back to the South China Sea , and stayed in the vicinity of Hainan Island to " await orders . "  
- - US officials are not at all concerned about the missing Chinese pilot and the destroyed Chinese fighter , endlessly stressing instead : The EP-3 electronic reconnaisance plant is covered by US sovereignty , and the Chinese side can not send people to board the plane and still less carry out a search .  They also demand that China provide assistance for repairing the plane as soon as possible , so that the crew can fly back to base as soon as possible .  
Wang has conducted surveys of some joint venture enterprises in the coastal region of southern China , an area which is seen by many domestic and foreign companies as an excellent processing base , and as long as the design and standards for electronic products are provided , there are various ready-made associated facilities there , from raw materials and parts / components to assembly , etc .  
Wang Zhile surveyed some joint venture enterprises in southern China 's coastal area , which is regarded by many domestic and foreign corporations as the best processing base .  One only has to provide the designs and standards for electronic products , because all kinds of necessary factories , from raw materials , spare parts , to assembly , are already there .  
The troops deployed at the base will first conduct tactical training under reciprocal conditions from the single soldier , single vehicle , single artillery up to battalion level , learning coordinated operations among the various branches of the armed forces .  After that , comprehensive exercises will be carried out , and the base will conduct comprehensive examinations .  
Investment in the western areas increased obviously faster than that in the central and eastern parts of the country .  The high growth rate of investment was a result of the state 's policy to increase investment projects funded by national debt , and was also related to the fact that the base figure in the same period of last year was comparatively low and the construction periods this year moved ahead of schedule .  
Soon afterward , the army crossed the Chang Jiang to the south .  After a half year of arduous long-distance marching and fighting , it arrived in central Hunan where it fulfilled its mission of establishing an anti-Japanese base area centered around Heng Shan .  
The recently published " Blue Paper on Chinese Economic Forecasting , " which was put together by several well-known economists , predicts that China 's GDP will grow about 7.8 percent this year , barring a major deterioration in the international economic environment and provided that the Chinese government continues to base macroeconomic regulation and control on an active fiscal policy , properly coordinates the various macroeconomic regulatory and control measures , and further stimulates domestic demand .  
The western region 's economic development has been relatively slow ; the condition of its social base is poor , and the strategic logistical facilities have always been a weak link and have never been able to meet the new demands of military combats .  
The state has decided to make infrastructure construction the base , strengthening the protection and construction of the ecological environment the main content , grasping the readjustment of the industrial structure the key , developing scientific and technological education the basic condition , and thorough reform and expanded open up the strong driving force of development .  
Taking the " Pine Gap joint air defense research facility " electronic reconnaisance base as an example , this is located in a remote site in central Australia , well screened by trees , and equipped with large antennae ; it can receive signals from US satellites through infrared sensors , collect many signals from radar , radio , and telephone signals from Asia and the Middle East , and can also detect the great heat produced by ballistic missile launches in any place on the Eurasian land mass .  
It is only right and natural that such an action is unacceptable to them .  As to Falungong 's plan to have Falungong elements from overseas gather in Hong Kong to repeat what they did during a previous international gathering , it is another sinister attempt to transform Hong Kong into an anti-Chinese base targeting at the central government .  
As far as the departments are concerned , in calculating how much money they can spend in the future , they do not take the budget for the previous year as the base figure but instead make decisions according to how many tasks they have ; if they have tasks to accomplish , they will have the money to spend , and if the tasks have been completed , their funds are cancelled accordingly ; thus we ensure that all expenditure goes on the crucial points in building the units .  
He stated that the science and technology hall is an important place for people to acquire scientific and technical knowledge , understand science and technology , and exchange S &amp; T knowledge and results , as well as being a base for primary and middle-school students to engage in quality education , so we should make full use of existing facilities , enhancing the content of the exhibits and also doing a good job of making the briefings and lectures lively and explaining difficult concepts in simple terms .  
While conducting a search operation , search and rescue teams may be shielded by a number of planes , including an early warning plane , an electronic jamming plane , an assault plane , and a fighter plane , and some warplanes conducting a search operation may also be armed with high-speed anti-radiation missiles in light of actual conditions so as to suppress an enemy surface-to-air missile base and guard against a sudden attack by the enemy .  
The open market operation played an important role in putting base money into circulation in 1998 and 1999 , regulating the liquidity of commercial banks in 2000 , and guiding the interest rates for money markets .  It has become a major tool of monetary policies in the daily operation of the central bank , which indicated that the operating system of monetary policies has basically achieved the change from direct to indirect regulation and control .  
Over the past few years , in particular , under the conditions of a large base figure of population , limited per capita resources , and relatively backward economic and scientific and technological levels , our rapid economic development has brought enormous pressures to the originally weak ecological environment , so that the situation in environment is even grimmer .  
To strengthen the actual combat capability of the United States Air Force in Korea , the United States military , of late , has continuously strengthened the facilities of the Osan air base , specifically constructing underground a reinforced command and control center , and a C41 ( command , control , communication , computer and intelligence ) system .  
Guam is located in the southern extreme of the Pacific Ocean 's Mariana Island Chain . The strategic function Guam as a forward deployment and support base for the United State military is increasing by the day .  
What stable supply and maintenance support links refers to is the integrated use of various support means , with pre-combat support deployment serving as the base , to form a multidimensional logistical support network for the entire in-depth joint combat battlefield , including supply and support links in which the replenishment of ammunition is a key point , technical support links in which the maintenance of new and high-tech equipment is a key point , and knowledge support links in which troops with special skills are the key points .  
Further , this base allowed different types of units under different arm services to conduct combined tactical training at the same time .  Crack troops have been selected and established as the " blue army brigade . "  Through direction , transfer , separation , and back-to-back training , troops participating in military exercises were able to use their skillful tactics under sharp confrontations .  
To meet the requirements of the present new situation in the work of poverty relief through development and in consideration of the current distribution and the special characteristics of the poverty-stricken population in rural areas , the " Program " has placed the stress of state support on minority-inhabited areas , old revolutionary base areas , border areas , and exceptionally impoverished areas in the country 's central and western regions .  
He further hoped that the quality education base for youths and the science and technology hall will extend the quality education of schools and allow every middle and elementary school student to be trained and nurtured in creative thinking , willpower and moral character , physical health , environmental protection sense , and capability in practical living .  
and four Armed Forces Awards for Scientific and Technological Advancement , Third Class . Tao Qian , an officer with a doctorate degree in science of military campaigns , recently demonstrated his ability in the base that the military region built for combined campaign training exercises .  His remarkable performance in teaching the theory of organized campaigns and directing a real exercise has made him the pacesetter of the military region in providing the armed forces with science and technology training .  
However , since he took office , he has failed to honor his commitment .  To consolidate his political base , he has been blindly playing up to the interests of the conservative forces , the rich , and large enterprises , especially of the military industrial enterprises , in the financial budget and taxation policy , education policy , social security policy , environment policy , and on a series of other issues .  
In view of the different features of party members at different levels and ranks , a certain frigate unit under the Navy and a certain base under the 2d Artillery Corps have worked out , according to the specific duties and responsibilities at different work posts , concrete advanced state-maintaining guidelines respectively for party-member leading cadres , party-member cadres working under leading organs , party-member cadres involved in specialized or technical fields , party-member cadres at the grass-roots level , party members among cadets and compulsory servicemen , as well as party-member staff .

When phase one goes into production , it will have a yearly production capacity of 10,000 tons of explosion suppressing material .  
An expert working on a certain base of the General Armament Department said that faced with new situations and tasks , scientific researchers must strive to realize the important ideology of the " Three Represents , " to occupy the main battle position of the world 's advanced military scientific and technological development , and to become the advanced representatives for the modernization construction and development of the weapons and equipment of the Chinese Army .  
We must base ourselves on the new practice of social life today and on the new development of the times , strengthen theoretical study , conscientiously sum up the experience , tackle problems in real earnest , make explorations in the midst of practice , make innovations in the midst of explorations , and move forward in the midst of innovations .  While doing a better job in the building of material civilization , we must keep pushing ahead with the building of socialist spiritual civilization .  
base ourselves on the realities in China , with attention focused on the front line of world scientific and cultural development ; and unceasingly develop a healthy , progressive , rich , and colorful socialist culture with Chinese style and characteristics .  That is also the fundamental expression and requirement for our party to remain in the forefront of the times and maintain its advanced nature .  
All military units and armed police units should offer assistance to areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups , old revolutionary base areas , border areas , and areas bogged down in serious poverty in the central and western parts of the country .  
During the period of democratic revolution , given the special conditions of our country at the time , we had no choice but to base our revolution in the rural areas , so the working class and the peasants formed a close alliance .  As a result , the majority of the members of our Party and the revolutionary troops led by the Party were peasants .  
To triumph in future sea battles under a high-tech environment , in recent years officers and men of the logistical department of the East China Sea Fleet base have centered on the most complex and difficult situations , combined theoretical study and training on the sea , and boldly reformed and innovated logistical measures to stage splendid performances in logistical support on the sea .  
In recent years , the base 's relevant departments have repeatedly organized rapid mobilization of maritime medical teams from its hospital and urgently dispatched them for training in sea rescue , with some of them participating in the highly difficult joint ship-airplane rescue drills .  
To increase the rapid response capability of the base for accidental events on the sea , the base 's logistics leaders and units have vigorously developed the maritime emergency support services .  They have organized emergency support subunits out of defense logistics , arms and equipment , and military supply departments .  They have equipped them with light and advanced logistic facilities as well as conducted special training for them so that they can promptly provide maritime logistical support on receipt of an order .  
To make a breakthrough in this logistical support at sea , this base has organized missile technology experts and officers and men of battleships and logistical support ships to jointly study various operational measures for overcoming adverse weather conditions and formulated scientific plans on missile replenishment .  
The MND organized more than 100 officers to participate in the operation of the " Lecheng " plan , which includes many plans and special projects and requires a wide range of cooperation .  Frequent meetings every month enabled US officers on active service to visit all Taiwan 's sensitive and important military areas , such as the Air Force Operation Command , the Army 's missile bases , and the Navy submarine base , and to conduct field investigations of the coastal areas where the Chinese communists may conduct landing .  
On the one hand , we should seize the present favorable opportunities to speed up the technical transformation of our traditional industries , the renewal of our products , and the upgrading of our industries , through digesting and introducing advanced technologies from foreign countries .  On the other hand , we must also base our efforts on our existing domestic resources ;  
In the past few days Comrades attending a study meeting of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee 's central theoretical study group freely talked , in the context of the CPC 's 80-year glorious course since its founding and of carrying forward and developing the good traditions and work style of the old revolutionary base of Shandong , about what they had learned from the study of Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech at the party founding anniversary .  
We have a system to establish political commissioners and political institutions .  We also have a system to base Party branches on the military units at the company level .  The availability of and the adherence to these systems enables our military to ensure the military remains under the Party 's firm control despite the dynamic historical conditions and constant changes in members of the military .  
When a certain brigade that was a-thousand li away maneuvered toward the site area , an automatic battlefield assessment system was operating simultaneously in the base director 's hall .  From whether the overall posture of the unit was rational , to whether the tactical action of an individual soldier was standardized , the system recorded on file its assessments on all the actions .  
The officials and men cooled down after hearing forceful evidences and logical analyses , and reached a common understanding : The base was not harsh , but our training fell short of the requirements of real battles .  
Over 60 qualified military and technical personnel and 34 university students who were from the current term entered the base and settled down , while scores of directing and dispatching personnel pursued advanced studies in colleges and institutes .  
At the same time , in line with the features of the establishment of external units , the base has provided the " Blue Army " with infantry , artillery , armored , engineering , chemical , communication , electronic confrontation , and helicopter troops - - which form a joint training command headquarters with the air force and the army aviation unit - - and has copied military drills and training conducted by powerful adversaries . 
in terms of new development , the important concept of " three represents " has enriched and developed the Marxist theory of political parties , classes , and the masses according to the fundamental tenets of Marxism on the relationship between the productive forces and production and between the economic base and the superstructure , by keeping the new century in mind , and by proceeding from the laws of social development and the basic nature of the party ;  
In making plans , therefore , we should base ourselves on the present and have our eyes on the future , and combine the solution of the current outstanding problems with the realization of the long-term development objectives .  Our plans should both reflect the spirit of emancipating the mind and positively forging ahead , and conform to the principle of seeking truth from facts and following the objective laws .

These programs were connected to the political plan Japan had for its colony : Japanese leaders felt that Taiwan occupied an important strategic position astride the East and South China seas , and the navy was especially anxious to exert effective control over Taiwan and the Pescadores . Not only did they want to build Taiwan into a base for further military expansion , they hoped to squeeze the colony for its economic resources ( such as sugar ) to support capitalist economic development in the mother country .  
The broad idea for this was floated two years ago .

" In fact , Hong Kong 's intrinsic importance for Taiwan 's economy is not absolute . " C . J . Lee , director of the First Institute of the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research , points out that Hong Kong 's own manufacturing industry has almost all moved north , and naturally Taiwanese companies will not choose to set up factories in Hong Kong . Hong Kong is not a production base , and there are no key raw materials or components which can only be obtained from the colony .  
" The best situation would of course be cross-strait reconciliation , so that Taiwan could enter the middle phase of its national unification plan , and establish trade , transport and financial links on the basis of equal and friendly relations , " says C . J . Lee . At that point Taiwanese firms could base decisions as to whether to set up a center of operations directly in , say , Shanghai , or to go through Hong Kong , purely on commercial considerations , and would not have to shoulder an additional political burden .  
However , although there is no concealing the negative effects of China 's growing influence over Hong Kong in the run-up to 1997 , the colony has also profited as China has reaped the rich benefits of its reform and liberalization program over the last ten years . Companies around the globe have moved from initial doubts and a wait-and-see attitude to gradual acceptance , and China has come to be widely seen as a place on which the hopes of the whole world for the manufacturing base and consumer market of the 21st century are focused .  
In other words , even though the production base moves overseas , the " headquarters " and " logistical support center " remain in Taiwan .

With an abandoned schoolhouse as their base , they embarked on a program of patient training and rigorous exercise including a daily run of 5,000 meters . The students learned that while drumming , every bodily action-from breathing to using arm muscles-had to be done in a particular way . And that 's how the Ondekoza , which is also known as the Divine Children of the Drum , became famous around the world .  
Because Kaohsiung harbor has a huge capacity , and is a pivotal spot for routes to southeast Asia , in the Japanese occupation era the authorities made it a concentration point for heavy industry and petroleum refining . After the outbreak of the war in the Pacific , Japan used Kaohsiung as a base for advancing southward , and established many military facilities there .  
Chinese ink painting , on the other hand , approaches the canvas from a kind of " shifting " vantage point . Layer upon layer of mountain ridges overlap across the painting , a thatched hut enclosed by a bamboo fence rests at the mountain base , and a river runs along the summit , flowing off into the distance . Questions of height and distance are irrelevant ; everything seems to be encompassed by a single perspective . Even variations in size or brightness of lighting are lacking .  
The company was to be headed by Rojas , the stock to be floated on the Mexican market . The Mexican City market was to be its base , chiefly responsible for financial and legal services . Miami was to be the operational and transport hub , responsible for sales , technical assistance , product planning , dispersal , warehousing , and so on .

A special feature of aboriginal pottery is its imperfectly circular shape , which results from being produced by hand rather than formed on a potter 's wheel . A lump of pounded clay is made into the vessel 's base , then beaten into shape using an egg-shaped stone and wooden paddle .  
Take for example nasopharyngeal cancer , to which Chinese are specially susceptible . Nasopharyngeal cancer originates near the base of the skull , close to vital organs , so there 's little room for safety to make surgery more practicable . In addition , nasopharyngeal cancer is extremely likely to spread to the lymph nodes in the neck or other more remote areas of the body , so it is difficult to get all of the cancer with surgery .  
" The Marshall Islands have a severe shortage of water for industrial use , so it is not appropriate to set up fish processing operations there such as canning factories . But their geographical location makes them suitable to be developed as a Pacific base for Taiwan 's fishing industry , if they are amenable to this kind of cooperation , " says Koo Kuan-min .  
This led to the questions getting more and more difficult . It was the sole basis for determining educational advancement , but it was completely removed from the basic educational level . What we want to do is to expand the base . " As long as the schools put the emphasis on imparting basic knowledge , then they will be meeting the goal of the reforms .

Chromosomes , which carry the genetic blueprint for living organisms , are formed of tightly coiled strands of DNA , in which four chemical bases-designated A , T , G and C-are paired together in different combinations along a double-helix-shaped molecular chain . Certain sequences of base-pairs along these DNA strands form genes , and the totality of base pairs makes up the " genome . "  
The level of education soared , and a total of 43 candidates from Kinmen eventually passed the extremely competitive imperial examinations over the years . The military period began after the Mongols put an end to the Song dynasty in 1279 . Loyal Song subjects unwilling to submit to Mongol rule retreated to Kinmen . Four centuries later , after the Ming dynasty was conquered by Manchus from the north , Zheng Chenggong ( Koxinga ) used Kinmen as a base in his attempt to restore Ming rule .  
But it also leads to irreversible hyperpigmentation ( extreme darkening of the skin ) . Tsai Yen-ping notes that in fact " meibai does not mean bleaching . It means only to lighten the skin color of the face to the same tone as that of skin on parts of the body less exposed to the sun . " The amount of pigmentation secreted by the basal metrocytes ( base layer cells ) plays the main role in determining a person 's skin color .  
When the Dutch took over Tainan , they encouraged the cultivation and export of cane sugar , a crop that grew exceptionally well on the Chianan Plain stretching out from Tainan in almost every direction . On the strength of this economic base , Tainan naturally became the political center of Taiwan . Although southern Taiwan is dominated today by Kaohsiung , back then the latter was just one of Tainan 's satellite ports , with development limited by heavy silting and shallow berths .  
Consider the fact that it depends on the central government for less than 10% of its revenues , while the average for Taiwan 's local governments as a whole stands at about 50% . Taipei City can almost make ends meet through its own tax revenues , but other cities are heavily reliant on the central government , and they are trapped in a vicious cycle in which slow economic development makes it difficult for them to broaden their tax base no matter hard they try .  
Tunnel 88 was originally an air raid shelter . It was bored into the base of a granite hill , so it stays at a relatively even temperature , warm in winter and cool in summer . That makes the tunnel ideal for long-term aging . As time goes by , odd and impure tastes in the liquor are eliminated .  
Because the paper is impermeable , after the overall composition has been sketched out the artist applies layer after layer of expensive pigments-ground crystal , blue chalcedony , emerald green-with the gold base left uncovered to provide the linear sketch elements of the painting .

It is said that diplomacy is the extension of national power .  
The rapid expansion of China 's economy over the last few years has been a powerful lure to Taiwanese industry , and local businesses have flocked to China . This situation is widely held to be responsible for the problems of capital flight , sluggish domestic investment , the hollowing out of Taiwan 's manufacturing base and rising unemployment .  
It 's not a listed company and its founders are n't well known members of Taiwan 's technological aristocracy .

The Chinese first made lacquer ware some seven millennia ago . Archeologists have discovered that the Hemudu Culture produced red lacquer on a wood base , and numerous archeological digs over the past few decades at burial sites dating back two to three millennia have turned up perfectly preserved lacquer ware surrounded by badly rotted artifacts made of wood and other materials . Records of Artisanry mentions the kings Shun and Yu ( both of whom ruled roughly 3,200 years ago ) making lacquer ware items .  
As a liquid , lacquer must be spread onto some solid material . This solid material is called the base , and may be made of wood , bamboo , cloth , copper , paper , or other materials . In its original state the lacquer is highly viscous and must be thinned with camphor oil .  
It is then spread onto the base . After it dries , it is polished using moistened emery paper . Another coat of lacquer is applied and polished , and the process is repeated a dozen times or so . The lacquer can then be worked using a number of techniques , such as painting , carving , and the application of inlaid designs , before being set to dry in a dark place .  
While Lai was in Japan he pored over the ancient Records of Artisanry , pondering and experimenting continuously in an effort to resurrect the long lost technique . But for years he was frustrated .

The traditional style of face painting that Tsai Lien passed down at Juyi Tsengshoutang involves evenly spreading a base color across the actor 's face and waiting for it to dry before getting on with the main painting work , which is highlighting the characteristics of the individual characters . This tradition of first applying a base and then applying the facial lines promotes speed and convenience . Its weak point is that the colors easily run .  
Before starting to paint , face painters first take a red cloth to hold down the actor 's hair while exposing the face . Then they dab their fingers with red or black pigment and outline the shape of the character 's eyes . Next , they begin to paint the base . For instance , the civil and martial mandarins and Generals Liu and Xie have white pigment applied first , whereas the two sides of General Gan 's face are painted separately red and black , and General Fan 's face is painted inky black .

After base areas are set up at Meifeng , vegetable crops suitable for cool , high elevations can be planted by machine instead of by hand ; fruit trees too are planted in rain-sheltered systems and managed for increased yields . The wooded areas that separate cultivated fields from the original land provide staged filtration of contaminants from rainwater runoff . Meifeng 's soil management methods have proven effective enough to preserve its resources over an eight-year period that has seen numerous typhoons and the 921 earthquake .  
Farm director Chang Yu-sen explains , " We base the camps on our existing crops and cultivation areas . We 've set up activities including bird and insect watching and stargazing , premised on the idea of no additional land development and using the abundant resources of the surrounding virgin forests . We also have ecological gardens and displays of seed samples and dried flowers . "

Although in the past the delegations of Canada , New Zealand and Australia had maintained that the only element in the current methodology that could be considered a transparent and equitable measure of capacity to pay was net national income , they could accept the recommendation of the Committee on Contributions to base future scales on estimates of gross national product if it was part of a comprehensive set of methodological changes .  
Given that Mozambique takes off from an extremely low economic base and after factoring in population increases , the prevalence of the recent trend of lacklustre growth performance would translate into GDP per capita increases too modest to make a visible contribution to , and to sustain , the goals of poverty reduction , social sector development , reconstruction and restoration of external viability .  
On the question of an increase in permanent membership , many States have retained an open mind , asking legitimate questions regarding the criteria on which to base such a decision , now and in the future , for any course of action adopted will , in fact , establish a precedent .

It should be noted , however , that economies in transition are also far from being homogenous , reflecting differences in levels of economic development , enterprise culture , infrastructural and educational base , pre-communist economic and social patterns , geographic location and most of all the degree of the use of market mechanisms prior to the change in their political systems .  
Subsequently , as the industrial base of the country in the industry concerned is developed and capabilities are acquired , the domestic sector may be exposed to import competition through gradual trade liberalization .  
While for most developing countries this appears to call for increasing and qualitatively upgrading their infrastructural and human resource base , for economies in transition it would seem largely to involve new ways of using existing R &amp; amp ; D and technological potential - created for a different economic system - in a way that is more appropriate to market economies and their changing societies .  
Natural resource endowments , the level of development of the industrial base and of the physical and communications network , the size of the domestic market and the degree of integration of the domestic economy , the technological capacity and availability of adequate human capital in terms of skills , and the proximity to major production and consumption poles are elements in which developing countries also exhibit differences among themselves .  
Consequently , their main concerns are quite different from those of other developing countries which have already developed some industrial base but which need to improve their productivity and efficiency in order to penetrate international markets or of those developing countries which have developed competitive enterprises and significant export capacity , such as the newly industrializing countries ( NICs ) and a number of second-tier NICs , but which need to sustain their export capabilities by a process of continuous upgrading and productivity improvement .  
Faced with the related phenomena of a large informal sector and a missing middle in their enterprise structure , LDCs need to take specific measures , in the context of their enterprise development strategies , targeted at helping their micro and small enterprises to grow and drawing them into the formal sector , through the development of an infrastructural and human resource base , the strengthening of their technological capabilities , and the provision of finance , training and other business support services .  
The design of the mobility element attempted to strike a balance between different needs : ( a ) for organizations without rotation policies , and / or with a large proportion of their staff at headquarters , it recognized that the first move was the most difficult to effect ; ( b ) for staff with extensive field networks , which consequently had systematic rotation policies , it made provision for the additional toll exacted by frequent moves , more often than not without a home base .

The current rules on equitable representation are based on two criteria , the first being the base figure of posts subject to geographical distribution , the second being the notion of a midpoint or number of posts attributable to each member State , which itself is exclusively governed by two factors : membership in the Organization , which automatically entitles a State to a minimum quota , and the size of a member State 's contribution to the operating budget .  NULLThe base figure is the number of posts theoretically subject to geographical distribution .

After the implementation of these reform measures , there was for the most part a significant " clearing of the corruption " in a short period of time , so farmers had the opportunity to relax and generate profits .  But in the end , because of the restrictions imposed by the social and political environment at that time , the opposite result was the outcome , with the base for future taxes actually increasing , and the farmers ' burden was heavier .  
This was the case especially during the " 96-2 " exercise , which was staged under clear-cut stress involving units from different services and arms .  The exercise was directed by the leaders of the Central Military Commission in person , who worked in the forefront , and despite more stringent requirements and arduous and pressing tasks , the base organized officers and men to work hard in face of difficulties and by demonstrating superb fighting capacity , fully fulfilled its tasks in the end .

By chemical injections into the roots , combined with periodic drainage of underground water during the heavy rain season , many of the trees have recovered their previous vitality . Matou pomelos , approximately palm sized , are round and plump at the base and pointed towards the top .  
But a strong base of agricultural success has already been firmly established . New produce such as the avocado , the new fish hatcheries and domesticated animal farms in Peishihli , and the recently planned re-cultivation of Hsiaopili have successfully taken over what began with pomelo cultivation .  
The trail was originally called Yushan after the majestic peak , but it was renamed Pat'ungkuan after a large stretch of grassy plain located at the base of a towering ( 3404 meter ) mountain of the same name that the road cut across .  
Taiwan 's economic structure changed during the 1960 ' s from an agricultural to an industrial base , and its core industries have developed during the 1980 ' s from labor-intensive to capital - and technology-intensive ones . The future job market will require higher quality manpower , and the demand for technical personnel will grow ever larger .  
Perhaps you 've experienced these conditions : Your teeth are sensitive to eating cold , hot , or sweet foods .

One of the real contributions of this congress was to establish a process for the input of public opinion through the nominating system for the Central Committee , for which half the nominees were selected by the chairman and half by petition among the delegates . The vote was by secret ballot of all the delegates , increasing the supervisory role of the base level vis-a-vis the center while making the latter more sensitive to the former .  
Under principles of " internationalization and liberalization " the system should be harmonized with those of our major trading partners . Consideration should be given to eliminating the exemption for military personnel and teachers as well as unreasonable erosions of the tax base ( like leaving out interest income up to 360,000 NT dollars or from stock trading ) , simplifying tax brackets , lowering the highest rates , and looking into the tax reporting method ; these are all concrete proposals to make a thorough reform of the tax system .  
The " Civil Service Performance Review Law " which has just passed its third reading in the Legislative Yuan is sending a little " red envelope " to all government employees in time for the new year : The content of the civil service performance review bonus has been changed from " base pay " to " full pay . " This will almost double the original amount , making civil servants ' wallets once again a subject of after-dinner discussion .  
The pay for a general civil servant is divided into " base salary " and " supplementary salary . " It differs according to rating and position .

Chuo : In fact , when Lan Ling had just been established , we had no real concept of commercial drama . In order to appeal to a broader base , our ticket prices were very low . In Taipei , sales were OK , but this was impractical in the center and south of Taiwan . Sometimes sales would only be one-third or one-fifth of Taipei .  
The more powerful the backwave , the faster the base will be washed away . Given this vicious cycle , both dikes made of steel reinforced concrete or " breakwaters " made up of huge concrete tetrapods dropped into the ocean off the coast are both are basically weak structures that require continual repair . Dikes must be periodically raised and new concrete tetrapods laid down .  
In the dark , researchers can only remain inland , observing the seashore at a long distance , watching the turtles crawl ashore like huge ambulant rocks . The green turtles dig their holes in slow motion , and concentrate on laying eggs .

He was unexpectedly called back to China to attend to his mother 's burial , and found himself ground to a halt in Jimei for two years , not a particularly easy base for launching foreign ventures . Then surprisingly his father 's enterprise went bankrupt , squandered into a penniless state by his father 's second wife . Tan had no choice but to start from scratch , running a rice store and a pineapple factory .  
These programs were connected to the political plan Japan had for its colony : Japanese leaders felt that Taiwan occupied an important strategic position astride the East and South China seas , and the navy was especially anxious to exert effective control over Taiwan and the Pescadores . Not only did they want to build Taiwan into a base for further military expansion , they hoped to squeeze the colony for its economic resources ( such as sugar ) to support capitalist economic development in the mother country .  
The broad idea for this was floated two years ago . The hope is that Taiwan can take advantage of its geographic location , orthodox Chinese culture , business connections with overseas Chinese , and solid industrial base to become the regional center for foreign firms coming to the Asian region ( and especially for those firms investing in the PRC ) .  
The elephant veteranWhen they arrived at the military base at the head of Fengshan Bay , Ah-Lan passed away , perhaps because she could not adjust to the new environs . And because the military was not actively engaged , the remaining two elephants could only look forward to retirement .

Thereafter there was a rapid decline , creating a dramatic " U-turn " in the situation ( see chart ) .  
" In fact , Hong Kong 's intrinsic importance for Taiwan 's economy is not absolute . " C . J . Lee , director of the First Institute of the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research , points out that Hong Kong 's own manufacturing industry has almost all moved north , and naturally Taiwanese companies will not choose to set up factories in Hong Kong . Hong Kong is not a production base , and there are no key raw materials or components which can only be obtained from the colony .  
" The best situation would of course be cross-strait reconciliation , so that Taiwan could enter the middle phase of its national unification plan , and establish trade , transport and financial links on the basis of equal and friendly relations , " says C . J . Lee . At that point Taiwanese firms could base decisions as to whether to set up a center of operations directly in , say , Shanghai , or to go through Hong Kong , purely on commercial considerations , and would not have to shoulder an additional political burden .  
However , although there is no concealing the negative effects of China 's growing influence over Hong Kong in the run-up to 1997 , the colony has also profited as China has reaped the rich benefits of its reform and liberalization program over the last ten years . Companies around the globe have moved from initial doubts and a wait-and-see attitude to gradual acceptance , and China has come to be widely seen as a place on which the hopes of the whole world for the manufacturing base and consumer market of the 21st century are focused .  
In other words , even though the production base moves overseas , the " headquarters " and " logistical support center " remain in Taiwan . Operations items stay in Taiwan , along with capital sourcing , legal , tax , and financial planning , and training of internationalized personnel . All these could service the production bases located in surrounding countries .  
Up on the hilltop , though , we find that a bitter wind is blowing-this is not the place of warm sunshine and gentle breezes that it appears from afar .

With an abandoned schoolhouse as their base , they embarked on a program of patient training and rigorous exercise including a daily run of 5,000 meters . The students learned that while drumming , every bodily action-from breathing to using arm muscles-had to be done in a particular way . And that 's how the Ondekoza , which is also known as the Divine Children of the Drum , became famous around the world .  
Because Kaohsiung harbor has a huge capacity , and is a pivotal spot for routes to southeast Asia , in the Japanese occupation era the authorities made it a concentration point for heavy industry and petroleum refining . After the outbreak of the war in the Pacific , Japan used Kaohsiung as a base for advancing southward , and established many military facilities there .  
Chinese ink painting , on the other hand , approaches the canvas from a kind of " shifting " vantage point . Layer upon layer of mountain ridges overlap across the painting , a thatched hut enclosed by a bamboo fence rests at the mountain base , and a river runs along the summit , flowing off into the distance . Questions of height and distance are irrelevant ; everything seems to be encompassed by a single perspective . Even variations in size or brightness of lighting are lacking .  
The company was to be headed by Rojas , the stock to be floated on the Mexican market . The Mexican City market was to be its base , chiefly responsible for financial and legal services .

As for attacks from the air , ROC ships have search radar to counter these . " From Tsoying naval base in Kaohsiung , we can see all the way to the airspace beyond Penchia Yu [ 200 nautical miles away ] , " says Captain Liu . After being detected , incoming enemy aircraft can be locked on , tracked , and shot down .  
The US plays the leading role under the newly issued Guidelines , while Japan will support the US in any military conflict around Japan . When there is a crisis involving a " regional " issue , the US is required to take responsibility for restoring peace and security in the " region . " Japan , meanwhile , is obliged to keep open its base facilities , airfields , and ports , and provide support to US forces in operating in international waters and airspace .  
A special feature of aboriginal pottery is its imperfectly circular shape , which results from being produced by hand rather than formed on a potter 's wheel . A lump of pounded clay is made into the vessel 's base , then beaten into shape using an egg-shaped stone and wooden paddle .  
Take for example nasopharyngeal cancer , to which Chinese are specially susceptible . Nasopharyngeal cancer originates near the base of the skull , close to vital organs , so there 's little room for safety to make surgery more practicable . In addition , nasopharyngeal cancer is extremely likely to spread to the lymph nodes in the neck or other more remote areas of the body , so it is difficult to get all of the cancer with surgery .  
" The Marshall Islands have a severe shortage of water for industrial use , so it is not appropriate to set up fish processing operations there such as canning factories . But their geographical location makes them suitable to be developed as a Pacific base for Taiwan 's fishing industry , if they are amenable to this kind of cooperation , " says Koo Kuan-min .  
This led to the questions getting more and more difficult . It was the sole basis for determining educational advancement , but it was completely removed from the basic educational level . What we want to do is to expand the base . " As long as the schools put the emphasis on imparting basic knowledge , then they will be meeting the goal of the reforms .  
Looking at this list , commentators have identified a number of characteristics : a broad , cross-party base ; attention to economic and financial issues ; emphasis on professional ability ; and stress on the appointment of women and of outstanding people from outside central government .  
Chromosomes , which carry the genetic blueprint for living organisms , are formed of tightly coiled strands of DNA , in which four chemical bases-designated A , T , G and C-are paired together in different combinations along a double-helix-shaped molecular chain .

" The amount of pigmentation secreted by the basal metrocytes ( base layer cells ) plays the main role in determining a person 's skin color .  
When the Dutch took over Tainan , they encouraged the cultivation and export of cane sugar , a crop that grew exceptionally well on the Chianan Plain stretching out from Tainan in almost every direction . On the strength of this economic base , Tainan naturally became the political center of Taiwan . Although southern Taiwan is dominated today by Kaohsiung , back then the latter was just one of Tainan 's satellite ports , with development limited by heavy silting and shallow berths .  
Consider the fact that it depends on the central government for less than 10% of its revenues , while the average for Taiwan 's local governments as a whole stands at about 50% .

The Chinese first made lacquer ware some seven millennia ago . Archeologists have discovered that the Hemudu Culture produced red lacquer on a wood base , and numerous archeological digs over the past few decades at burial sites dating back two to three millennia have turned up perfectly preserved lacquer ware surrounded by badly rotted artifacts made of wood and other materials . Records of Artisanry mentions the kings Shun and Yu ( both of whom ruled roughly 3,200 years ago ) making lacquer ware items .  
As a liquid , lacquer must be spread onto some solid material . This solid material is called the base , and may be made of wood , bamboo , cloth , copper , paper , or other materials . In its original state the lacquer is highly viscous and must be thinned with camphor oil .  
It is then spread onto the base . After it dries , it is polished using moistened emery paper . Another coat of lacquer is applied and polished , and the process is repeated a dozen times or so .

The traditional style of face painting that Tsai Lien passed down at Juyi Tsengshoutang involves evenly spreading a base color across the actor 's face and waiting for it to dry before getting on with the main painting work , which is highlighting the characteristics of the individual characters . This tradition of first applying a base and then applying the facial lines promotes speed and convenience . Its weak point is that the colors easily run .  
Before starting to paint , face painters first take a red cloth to hold down the actor 's hair while exposing the face . Then they dab their fingers with red or black pigment and outline the shape of the character 's eyes . Next , they begin to paint the base .

Although in the past the delegations of Canada , New Zealand and Australia had maintained that the only element in the current methodology that could be considered a transparent and equitable measure of capacity to pay was net national income , they could accept the recommendation of the Committee on Contributions to base future scales on estimates of gross national product if it was part of a comprehensive set of methodological changes .  
Given that Mozambique takes off from an extremely low economic base and after factoring in population increases , the prevalence of the recent trend of lacklustre growth performance would translate into GDP per capita increases too modest to make a visible contribution to , and to sustain , the goals of poverty reduction , social sector development , reconstruction and restoration of external viability .  
On the question of an increase in permanent membership , many States have retained an open mind , asking legitimate questions regarding the criteria on which to base such a decision , now and in the future , for any course of action adopted will , in fact , establish a precedent .  Can the historical realities which influenced the Council 's composition 50 years ago be paralleled or matched in any way by present contingencies ?  
The reform and structural adjustment programmes to which African countries are committed have all been multidimensional in nature , including measures for domestic economic and commercial liberalization aimed at improving financial management , expanding the tax base and enhancing efficiency and transparency in the fiscal system .  
But it should be noted that , while innovation and competitiveness are activities of enterprises , success in innovation depends on a wide range of external factors , including the domestic institutional and social environments , national macroeconomic policies , incentive structures , the availability of skills , the local supply base , and the level of investment and linkages .  
It should be noted , however , that economies in transition are also far from being homogenous , reflecting differences in levels of economic development , enterprise culture , infrastructural and educational base , pre-communist economic and social patterns , geographic location and most of all the degree of the use of market mechanisms prior to the change in their political systems .  
Subsequently , as the industrial base of the country in the industry concerned is developed and capabilities are acquired , the domestic sector may be exposed to import competition through gradual trade liberalization .  
While for most developing countries this appears to call for increasing and qualitatively upgrading their infrastructural and human resource base , for economies in transition it would seem largely to involve new ways of using existing R &amp; amp ; D and technological potential - created for a different economic system - in a way that is more appropriate to market economies and their changing societies .  
Natural resource endowments , the level of development of the industrial base and of the physical and communications network , the size of the domestic market and the degree of integration of the domestic economy , the technological capacity and availability of adequate human capital in terms of skills , and the proximity to major production and consumption poles are elements in which developing countries also exhibit differences among themselves .  
Consequently , their main concerns are quite different from those of other developing countries which have already developed some industrial base but which need to improve their productivity and efficiency in order to penetrate international markets or of those developing countries which have developed competitive enterprises and significant export capacity , such as the newly industrializing countries ( NICs ) and a number of second-tier NICs , but which need to sustain their export capabilities by a process of continuous upgrading and productivity improvement .  
Faced with the related phenomena of a large informal sector and a missing middle in their enterprise structure , LDCs need to take specific measures , in the context of their enterprise development strategies , targeted at helping their micro and small enterprises to grow and drawing them into the formal sector , through the development of an infrastructural and human resource base , the strengthening of their technological capabilities , and the provision of finance , training and other business support services .  
The design of the mobility element attempted to strike a balance between different needs : ( a ) for organizations without rotation policies , and / or with a large proportion of their staff at headquarters , it recognized that the first move was the most difficult to effect ; ( b ) for staff with extensive field networks , which consequently had systematic rotation policies , it made provision for the additional toll exacted by frequent moves , more often than not without a home base .

The current rules on equitable representation are based on two criteria , the first being the base figure of posts subject to geographical distribution , the second being the notion of a midpoint or number of posts attributable to each member State , which itself is exclusively governed by two factors : membership in the Organization , which automatically entitles a State to a minimum quota , and the size of a member State 's contribution to the operating budget .  NULLThe base figure is the number of posts theoretically subject to geographical distribution .  
" Noting also that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base , and recent natural disasters ,

The Centre established a comprehensive data base on non-governmental organizations and other partners active in human settlements and is expanding its programme with those partners which had participated actively in the Habitat II preparatory process and had organized their own forums and presented their declarations and commitments to Committee II of the Conference . 11 .  At the present time , the main operational activity of the Centre in relation to the Global Strategy for Shelter , is the application of the urban and housing indicators .  
The provision of finance for shelter and urban development has been constrained by the absence of an attractive investment climate , a negative regulatory environment , a narrow housing finance base and low levels of savings owing to low disposal incomes .  
Recurrent drought in the southern Africa region this decade , the weak economic base of the country , which is almost exclusively agricultural , a rather unbalanced social infrastructure , which is partly due to the low literacy rate inherited from the previous regime , and the problem of disease , including HIV / AIDS , pose a serious threat to our nascent democracy .  
Empirical evidence suggests that the countries that have been successful in sustaining capital inflows and long-term growth are those that have systematically upgraded their human capital and infrastructure and have promoted the continuous diversification or deepening of their domestic productive base .  
Given the limitations of tax administration systems in developing countries , the introduction of " objective income criteria " for the computation of taxable income , whereby taxable income is imputed on the basis of combined criteria , including , inter alia , the number of transactions , the total value of purchases and the size of the commercial unit , has proven to be effective in broadening the tax base with minimum political costs .  
Historical data on consumption of fuelwood are scarce but it is estimated that today some 1.8-billion-m3 , more than half of the total volume of wood produced , is consumed as fuel . 7 Fuelwood consumption is leading in some areas to deforestation , soil impoverishment and further hardship for the poor , who are dependent on the natural resource base for their day-to-day survival .
