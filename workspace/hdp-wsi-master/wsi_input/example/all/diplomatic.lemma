Both sides felt pleased and satisfied with the remarkable achievements in the friendly cooperation in political , economic and cultural and other fields between the two countries for over 30 years since China and Austria established diplomatic relations .  
Actually , in view of the fact that the " TSEA " has directly undermined efforts exerted by both China and the United States since the establishment of their diplomatic relations in 1979 in improving and developing their bilateral relations , that it has violated the principled stand on " one China , " and that it has directly interfered in China 's internal affairs , it will definitely aggravate tension in the Taiwan Strait , intensify the regional arms race and further push Taiwan to war rather than protect Taiwan 's security .  
Zhu Rongji said : Mr President is the Chinese people 's old friend .  We satisfactorily see that in the last 36 years since China and the Republic of Congo forged diplomatic ties , our bilateral friendly and cooperative relations have been steadily and smoothly developing .  Sound cooperation full of positive results has been carried out in the political , economic and trade , public health , and educational fields .  
Since the two countries formed diplomatic ties 36 years ago , friendly relations of cooperation between the two have maintained development on a healthy and stable track through the ups and downs of global situations and their domestic conditions .  
Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in early 1998 , with the joint efforts made by both sides , relations between China and South Africa have been developing smoothly , and substantive progress has been made in the cooperation between the two countries with broad prospects being shown .  It is hoped that both sides will continue to make efforts and do effective work , thus continuously advancing bilateral friendship and cooperation and achieving more concrete cooperation results to bring benefits to both peoples .  
Recently , the DPRK has actively carried out diplomatic activities ; worked hard to improve and strengthen its relations with the neighboring countries ; readjusted its diplomatic strategies towards the United States and Japan in a timely fashion ; expanded its exchanges with the developing countries ; and further normalized its relations with the western countries with excellent results .  
it is necessary to do a good job of effectively carrying out nationality , religious , national defense , diplomatic , and Taiwan affairs work , to resolutely fight sabotage activities carried out by hostile forces at home and abroad , and to combat various law-violating and criminal activities , so as to maintain social and political stability , the unity of the motherland , and national security and to create a good international and domestic environment for reform and development .  
He pointed out that the Chinese Government attaches great importance to developing friendly cooperative relations with Cuba . The two countries ' relations have developed smoothly in recent years .  Particularly since the realization of the mutual visit between President Jiang Zemin and President Castro , the cooperation level between the two sides has risen ; cooperation areas have constantly expanded ; and the Sino-Cuban relationship has entered a period of comprehensive development .  This year marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relationship between China and Cuba .  
Since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1992 , considerable progress has been made in bilateral friendly and cooperative relations in the political , economic , cultural , and other fields .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : Since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1992 , bilateral relations have been healthily and rapidly developing .  Our cooperation in the political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , agricultural , and cultural fields has achieved gratifying results .  
Since the establishment of diplomatic ties in 1992 , bilateral relations have developed rapidly , and the two countries have engaged in very successful cooperation in many fields .  The Chinese side is very pleased with the development , but of the opinion that there is still great potential for the development of bilateral ties , and it takes joint efforts of both sides to continuously expand fields of mutually beneficial cooperation .  
After the establishment of Sino-Egyptian diplomatic ties , the friendship between the people of the two countries has continuously been consolidated and developed .  On the basis of mutual respect , equality and mutual benefit , the two countries have established sincere and firm relations , and have carried out extensive and fruitful cooperation in the political , economic , cultural and other fields , as well as in international affairs .  
Since April 1999 , a number of U.S . scientists , experts on international issues , and former government officials with lofty virtue worthy of respect , such as former Secretary of State Kissinger , former Secretary of Defense Perry , and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Shalikashvili , have all voiced the opinion that the NMD system is technically unfeasible and economically wasteful of money and manpower and will bring grave diplomatic consequences .  
But due to Russia 's stiff resistance , the United States dares not make the plunge outright and is compelled to constantly enhance political , economic , military , and diplomatic relations with Ukraine and with other neighboring countries of Russia and to realize its strategic purposes gradually through " contacts " and in a " trot-like " manner .  
In addition to infiltrating Russia 's neighboring countries , the United States has also accelerated the pace of developing diplomatic and military cooperation relations with Mongolia in a " leapfrog " fashion in an attempt to take advantage of the unique strategic position of Mongolia and to place " an outpost " between China and Russia to monitor and control the movements of China and Russia and to deter Russia from the south and to carry out " peaceful evolution " against China from the north .  
The party 's central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core not only consistently upholds Deng Xiaoping Theory and holds high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , but has also enriched and developed Deng Xiaoping Theory in combination with the new conditions and new experience in the economic , political , scientific and technological , educational , cultural , ethnical policy , military , diplomatic , united front , and party building fields , and added new contents to scientific system of Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
Led bythe Clinton Administration over the past eight years , the United States has enjoyed economic prosperity , reinforced national strength , and won a series of diplomatic victories .  Though plagued by scandals , Clinton has maintained his public approval rate at more than 60 percent , a rare case among various previous presidents .  
We must study his noble character of being loyal to the party and the people , study his lofty spirit of seeking truth from facts and upholding the truth , and study his solid and strict style of work .  Under the leadership of the party 's central committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , we must adhere to Deng Xiaoping 's thinking on foreign affairs , unflinchingly carry out the foreign policy of independence and peace , and further open up a new prospect for China 's diplomatic work .  
In accordance with its peaceful foreign policy of acting independently and keeping the initiative in its own hands , and based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence , China did not draw ideological lines but respected the political system which these countries had chosen , rapidly extended diplomatic recognition to those states which emerged as independent from the former Soviet Union , and established diplomatic relations with them .  
In diplomatic work , Comrade Geng Biao was firm on matters of principle and flexible on matters of tactics .  He put forward his unique viewpoints and creative ideas in light of the developing and changing situation .  He displayed very strong grasp of policy and strong mastery of the art of struggle .  
Comrade Geng Biao upheld the policy of practicing economy while conducting diplomatic activities .  He was strict with himself and never gave any thought about personal fame and wealth .  He sought no privilege for himself and always maintained the distinctive political character of plain living and hard struggle .  
Some Arab countries even appealed for halting diplomatic , economic , and trade relations with Israel or discontinuing the process of normalizing relations with Israel .  A few days ago Oman decided to shut down its commercial representative 's office in Tel Aviv and Israel 's commercial representative 's office in Muscat ;  
Faced with an ever-worsening internal and external security situation , Russia has carried out readjustments to its diplomatic line and pursued a more active and pragmatic foreign policy , in a bid to restore Russia 's great power status and its influential role in world and regional affairs .  
Since the cold war , Japan has been more active in pursuing its diplomatic line in seeking to become a world political power ; in military affairs , therefore , it has gradually changed its relatively passive and inward-looking military strategy and army building guidelines of the cold war period , in order to shake off Japan 's international image as a country with imbalance of economic , political , and military status , in a bid to play a greater role in a multipolar world .  
Because the United States has become increasingly dependent on satellite support for conducting its political , economic , military , and diplomatic affairs in the past 50 years or so , it feels the pressing need to protect its vested interests in space .  
Gore were already in their seats on the presidential inauguration rostrum set up on the west side of Capitol Hill . They were flanked by nearly one-thousand seats reserved for dignitaries .  The entire Congress , the justices of the Supreme Court , governors from various states , and foreign leaders and diplomatic envoys attended the ceremony .  
In connection with Powell 's recent stream of indiscretions on various sensitive policies , which have even sparked off some diplomatic disputes , some media have pointed out that Powell 's frequent " indiscretions " on certain key issues , as the man in charge of foreign policy in the world 's sole " superpower , " may be deliberate , and that his aim in using " indiscretions " to explore reactions from various sides is very evident .  
Accordingly , although the missile problem is very complex , so long as there is a concerted effort by the concerned quarters in international society , by using political and diplomatic means and on the basis of equal dialogues and equal participation , the missile proliferation problem can be resolved in a fair , comprehensive , and non-discriminatory fashion .  
The gearing effect of improving and developing its relations with the United States will not only enable India to gain more strategic initiative in dealing with the other big powers and create an international and peripheral security environment to its own advantage , but it will all the more give impetus to India to make a big step forward to the world political and diplomatic arena .  
Chi Haotian said that China and Qatar established diplomatic ties in 1988 , and relations between the two countries as well as exchanges between the two countries ' military forces have developed ever since .  Chi Haotian said that he is confident this visit from the premier will take the friendly and cooperative relationship between China and Qatar to a new level .  
As the foremost principle in joint operations , " unified action " requires that all actions be focused on achieving a common goal .  At the national level it requires the integrated use of political , diplomatic , economic , intelligence , and military power to achieve the strategic goals of the state , as well as specific strategic goals which result from that .  
In the 1990s , he organized the military units to successfully fulfill the tasks of foreign friendly exchanges , equipment and technology imports , academic and technological exchanges , multilateral military diplomatic activity , and maritime military safety negotiations .  
They have expressed a common appeal at organs , schools , enterprises , rural areas , newspapers , radio and television programs , and internet websites : They resolutely support President Jiang Zemin'srighteous and stern statements delivered at a meeting with foreign guests.They resolutely support the Chinese Government 's proposal to resolve the issuethrough diplomatic channels in accordance with international law andinternational common practice .  They have resolutely urged the US Government toapologize to the Chinese people and to fully shoulder the responsibility .  
To resume the damaged bilateral ties , Kayato Ikeda , then prime minister of Japan , especially asked former Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida to pass a letter on to President Chiang Kai-shek , thus eventually renewing friendly relations between the two countries .  This was the diplomatic achievement made through the renowned " Yoshida letter . "  It will be clear in the next few days whether the US-China joint letter can match the " Yoshida letter . "  
The plane collision incident was the first trial of strength in the diplomatic field with the Chinese Communists after Bush took power , but so far , various signs showed that Bush was still short of savvy and proficiency in playing such diplomatic games , and his policy toward Beijing remained unstable .  This gave Beijing an opportunity of criticizing the United States ' usual reconnaissance activities in the South China Sea , and the US side was left with a justifiable argument .  
Jin Chanrong said : Currently , the political and diplomatic channels remain the main channels for solving the plane collision incident .  The denunciations made by the Chinese Communist side against the US side 's violation of international law and the mainland 's domestic laws were mainly aimed at supporting its own position , not aimed at taking any legal action .  
Reporters learned from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today that over the past few days , the Chinese and US sides have held several rounds of diplomatic negotiations with regard to handling the incident in which the US surveillance aircraft collided with and damaged a Chinese fighter , left a Chinese pilot missing , and intruded into China 's airspace and landed at an airport in China without permission .  
Sino-US diplomatic contacts are now in their 10th day regarding the incident in which a US spy plane collided with and destroyed a Chinese fighter and arbitrarily landed at a Chinese airfield , but the problem can hardly be resolved because the United States , sticking to its high-handed stance , is unwilling to bear the responsibility , and is unwilling to apologize to China .  
Jiang Zemin said he was pleased to see that in the 13 years since China and Uruguay established diplomatic relations , the two countries have increasingly enhanced friendly cooperation in political , economic and trade , and cultural fields , and the two peoples have continued to deepen their mutual understanding and friendship .  
However , we maintain that the United States should assume moral responsibility .  So the United States should be the first to take the next step , show as much goodwill as it possibly can , and make diplomatic mediation in a sustained manner .  If the United States confines itself , exerts verbal pressure , and even hints that trade sanctions may possibly be imposed and that several punitive measures may be applied with regard to the arms sales to Taiwan , no benefit will be brought to the current stalemate .  
In particular , since the two countries established diplomatic relations , the two sides have maintained frequent high-level exchanges , enhanced economic and trade cooperation , markedly increased contacts in scientific and cultural fields , and maintained sound cooperation in international affairs . "  
In the last nine years since China and Uzbekistan established diplomatic relations , leaders of the two countries have had frequent contacts and meetings .  The good working relations based on the mutual trust that Your Excellency the President and President Jiang Zemin built has powerfully promoted the friendly cooperation between the two countries .  Bilateral relations have made considerable progress .  
US allies generally connected this incident with the United States ' diplomatic tradition and the new Bush administration 's foreign policy .  They expressed the belief that such overbearing words and deeds to get what one wanted were no longer appropriate , increased tensions in the world , and made countries uneasy .  
Nevertheless , in each of their public statements , Chi Haotian and Zhang Wannian described themselves as " acting at President Jiang 's behest . "  The decision to release the crew before the Easter holiday was obviously influenced by suggestions made by the diplomatic system , and the timing was accurately controlled .  As demonstrated here , the PRC 's internal decision-making is rather rational , and Jiang Zemin is secure in his place as the commander .  
Law Suk-ching , a Hong Kong deputy to the NPC , said : By allowing the US crew to leave China , China has based itself on a humanitarian stance , taken the overall situation into consideration , been devoted to maintaining long-term China-US relations , and safeguarded China 's major task of reform , opening up , and economic construction .  All this has shown China 's diplomatic skills in proficiently handling complicated international issues .  
Although outsiders were worried that the influence of the Liberation Army would override the diplomatic system in the process of making diplomatic policy decisions or worried that without such authoritative political leaders as Mao and Deng , Jiang Zemin might not be strong enough to have the overall situation in his hand and might not make a final decision on releasing the American crew members , the Chinese Communists still proved with their action that Jiang Zemin was able to bring everything under his control .  
The plane collision incident provided an opportunity for the military and the hardliners inside the regime to affect the transfer of power with the impact of the people 's nationalist sentiments .  Jiang did not want to see that the incident developed to a degree that might seriously harm the Chinese Communists ' diplomatic relations with the United States , but neither could he openly show a sign of weakness and be outdone by the US side , because this would affect the legitimacy of his power status at home .  
Since China and South Africa established diplomatic relations in early 1998 , bilateral relations have developed in a rapid and comprehensive way , with exchanges and cooperation in various fields increasingly expanded and enhanced .  
Since China and Laos established diplomatic relations 40 years ago , our two countries and the people have trusted and supported each other , and the good neighborly and friendly relations between our two countries , established on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , have continued to strengthen and develop .  
We were at first worried that the Taiwan authorities would gloat over and revel in the recent US arms deal and the diplomatic victory of Lee Teng-hui 's visit to Japan . However , we are glad to hear that , after taking the above situations into consideration , the Presidential Office has announced in its statement today that arms purchase is not the only means of guaranteeing Taiwan 's defense , that the two sides of the Strait could only be assured genuine and lasting peace through constructive dialog and the normalization of relations .  
After the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1958 , friendly and cooperative relations continued to develop , and bilateral cooperation achieved gratifying results in the political , economic , cultural , and public health fields .  
Today , old comrades like us who used to work under his direct leadership and who stood with him through storm and stress in shouldering the historic mission are cherishing all the more this long-tested and loyal communist fighter , proletarian revolutionary and China 's outstanding leader on the diplomatic front .  Esteem and love for him well up in our hearts as we recall the historic and outstanding contributions he had made to the smooth handover of Hong Kong and Macao and the efforts he made in laying the foundation for long-term stability and prosperity .  
While China and the United States were entangled in a diplomatic stalemate due to the plane collision incident , a play was put on the stage in Washington : Jasuwant Singh , Indian minister of external affairs and concurrently defense minister , was visiting the United States at the invitation of US Secretary of State Colin Powell . The Pentagon also held a grand welcoming ceremony for him , including the reviewing of honor guards .  
Social development , especially in the modern era , has enmeshed military action more closely into the political , economic , diplomatic , and scientific and technological arenas .  More military means are now available for achieving specific politic goals , and the range of activities covered by military struggles is gradually widening .  
Of more than 10 strategic principles , the US authorities determined on measures for subverting China in various fields of social life including the political , economic , diplomatic , military , trade , cultural , and educational fields .  
Since China and Nepal established diplomatic relations in 1955 , the relations of friendly cooperation have developed in a sustained , healthy and stable manner thanks to the close attention and meticulous care of the leaders of the two countries as well as the joint efforts made by the two peoples .  
Junichiro Koizumi is bent on visiting the Yasukuni Shrine in the capacity of a prime minister .  He has deliberately established a courageous and resolute image of daring to resist diplomatic pressure to show he is determined to conduct " reform " and such " reform " of course fits in exactly with the wishes of the increasingly more active right-wingers .  
Improving and developing relations with the United States will not only enable India to win more strategic initiatives when dealing with other big powers , and create a more favorable international and peripheral security environment , but will also enable India to step into the world 's political and diplomatic arena with giant strides in the new century , thus fulfilling its " dream of being a big power . "  
Thanks to the joint efforts of both sides , significant progress has been made in our bilateral relations since the establishment of diplomatic ties , and excellent results have been achieved in mutually beneficial cooperation in all spheres .  We are happy to see that China 's NPC and the National Assembly of the ROK have also established and maintained friendly ties .  
Han Seung Soo said : Although the diplomatic ties between the ROK and China have not been established very long , yet the two countries have attained remarkable achievements in the bilateral relations and become mutual major partners of economic and trade cooperation .  
The two countries have seen rapid development in exchanges and cooperation in the political , economic , cultural , educational , and other fields since they established diplomatic relations more than eight years ago .  
To this end , India has designed a series of diplomatic steps : In 1996 , India for the first time joined the Regional Forum of ASEAN and in 2000 , its defense minister paid a visit to Japan and the two countries conducted a joint military exercise in the South China Sea , which has laid a foundation for India to be militarily involved in the South China Sea and signified that India has stridden over the second door in the process of " eastward expansion " .  
After that , the leaders of the five countries held regular annual meetings , and the contents of the meetings were extended from strengthening mutual trust in the border areas to across-the-board mutually beneficial cooperation in the political , security , diplomatic , economic , and trade fields among the five countries .  
In the organizational system of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the position of Chinese Ambassador to the United States Yang Jiechi is higher than Zhou Wenzhong . However , Zhou Wenzhong 's current visit to the United States is in the capacity of a special envoy of the Chinese Government and also at a time when the final solution of the plane collision incident has been reached between the two countries .  Therefore , diplomatic circles here have paid high attention to Zhou Wenzhong 's visit to the United States .  
It is not a special case .  With the many favorable conditions , the Chen Shui-bian administration has speedily entered a stage of good diplomatic relations with the United States . On the contrary , the new politically powerful in Washington had a poor opinion of the Chinese Communists , which greatly deteriorated further after the Chinese Communists ' handling of the military plane collision incident caused ill feelings among the American people .  
Especially since the beginning of the 1990 ' s , with the continuous progress of the domestic and international situation and the magnificent cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , the central leadership collective of the party with Jiang Zemin as the core has adhered to the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts , and made new explorations in practice and a new summarization in theory of many major economic , political , cultural , military , and diplomatic issues , thus enriching and developing Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
After the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Russia in 1991 , President Jiang Zemin and Russia 's first President Yeltsin profoundly summed up the experiences and lessons of history ; based on the strategic requirements of their countries ' national construction and development , and in accordance with the new characteristics and trends of changes in the international situation , they decided to establish a new style of interstate relationship completely different from the cold war period .  
Over the 10 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries , relations of bilateral cooperation have developed smoothly .  There have been frequent mutual visits at a high level and the two sides have established a basic framework and principle for cooperation in political , economic , trade , cultural and other fields .  
Since China and Ukraine established diplomatic relations 10 years ago , exchanges and cooperation in the political , economic and trade , science and technological , educational , cultural , sports , and other fields between our two countries have continued to broaden , and encouraging results have been achieved .  
Shuai Hwa-min pointed out that , speaking of this current phase , Taiwan-US military exchanges certainly have their necessity and importance , but this kind of exchange , rather , is not the kind which can generate a military alliance and actual troop joint military exercises , which is what the people of the nation are hoping for .  The biggest key factor is that the two sides are nations without diplomatic relations .  Therefore , future Taiwan-US military exchanges will continue to be low key , but they will be conducted in an essentially advancing way .  
Facing the US advances at every step , Beijing 's reaction in recent years was relatively low key .  This was considered by Communist China 's strategic circles as a " serious failure " of the diplomatic work .  The United States has long considered Beijing as its opponent and has made deployment of its forces beforehand , while the CPC Central Committee has not made ideological and material preparations in return .  
China and Malta are situated far from each other , and they are different in terms of national situation , size , population , and historical background .  However , their relations over the nearly 30 years after they established diplomatic ties can be held up as an example of equal treatment , mutual respect , and peaceful coexistence between a big country and a small nation .  
The questions set in the polls of the " Ministry of Foreign Affairs " did point out that " the existing system and way of life will be retained . "  However , keeping in mind the fact that Taiwan is an island and its people are afraid of losing their freedom of external connections , they emphasized that " Taiwan will not have any diplomatic power from now on , " which was also intended as a threat .  
Shi Guangsheng said that China and Pakistan are intimate , friendly neighbors , and have had close and very fruitful cooperation in international affairs and on individual construction projects since the two countries established diplomatic ties .  
Given this , in order to divert public attention from domestic economic issues , allow himself a breathing spell , and win more time for working out new economic policies , Junichiro Koizumi deemed it necessary to create some political , diplomatic , and military news , and this is nothing but an old trick favored by some Japanese politicians .  
Jiang Zemin said that since diplomatic ties were established 26 years ago , Sino-Thai relations have throughout that time maintained a healthy and stable development , regardless of any changes in the international situation , and that this can be regarded as a model for friendly relations and mutually beneficial cooperation between neighboring countries with different social systems .  
In the early days of his office , Bush put on the airs of a supercilious " global overlord " on the diplomatic front and met with extensive opposition from the international community .  It landed the United States in a very isolated state , incurring more and more criticisms and worries from within the United States . As a result , the support rate for Bush in the opinion polls kept falling .  
Today , Chinese Ambassador to Japan Wu Dawei said here that in the past few months of this year , with the occurrence of such events as the historical issue , Lee Teng-hui 's visit to Japan , and the Japanese prime minister 's action of paying homage at Yasukuni Shrine , Sino-Japanese relations have been bogged down in the most difficult condition over the past 30 years since the normalization of diplomatic relations .  The Japanese side should create favorable conditions for getting Sino-Japanese relations out of this predicament by resolving the current existing problems .  
Tang Jiaxuan says China will take an active part in multilateral diplomatic activities of international organizations , firmly safeguard the objectives and principles in the UN Charter and universally-acknowledged norms governing international relations , and work hard with all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world in pushing for the construction of a just and rational international political and economic new order so as to play our part in building a peaceful , safe , prosperous , and stable new world .  
The article stresses : As the " Taiwan Security Enhancement Act " bill has directly undermined all the efforts of China and the United States in improving and developing bilateral relations since they established diplomatic relations in 1979 , violated the " one-China " principled stand , and directly interfered in China 's internal affairs .  In reality , not only can Taiwan 's security not be ensured , but it will also intensify the situation in the Taiwan Strait and regional arms race and further push Taiwan toward war .  
Based on China 's own interests , joining G-8 will give China more opportunities to express its views and exert influence on important economic , political and diplomatic affairs and other global issues and will have an additional place to deal with international affairs and a mechanism to coordinate foreign affairs and maneuver among major western countries .  
The Chinese Government has stood all kinds of rigorous tests in the complicated changing situation and scored remarkable achievements in the political , economic , social , science and technology , cultural , and diplomatic fields .  
In accordance with the agreement on trade relations signed soon after China and the United States established diplomatic ties in 1979 , the two sides should mutually grant " MFN treatment " to each other .  However , the United States adopted the annual appraisal system for the " MFN treatment " for China in accordance with its relevant domestic law .  It further attached some conditions related to " human rights " in the process of implementation .  
Sun Yuxi said : President Jiang 's upcoming visits will be an important diplomatic move made by China at the turn of the century .  The purpose of the visits are to step up high-level exchange between China and the aforementioned six countries , ensure further development of bilateral relations , and exchange views with them on the current international situation and the situations in regions of concern , in order to enhance mutual understanding and step up cooperation on international and regional affairs .

The Chinese armed forces have paid attention to developing friendly ties with the Azerbaijani armed forces .  China would also like to develop multilevel exchanges between the two armies in various fields on the basis of mutual respect , equality , and mutual benefit .  
To sum up , we may see that only the saving of military and diplomatic expenses and the lowering of the costs by the " three direct links " will bring huge benefits ; as for the tapping of potential from cross-strait cooperation , the invisible assets in the political , foreign relations , cultural , and educational fields will be immeasurable .  
In his May 20 speech , he indicated the intention to " continually strengthen substantive diplomatic relations with friendly countries , " and also declared , in an undisguised manner , that Taiwan " will vigorously participate in various international nongovernment organizations and take an active part in international affairs through such diverse means as humanitarian concerns , economic and trade cooperation , and cultural exchanges , so as to expand Taiwan 's space for survival internationally . "  
It is in the course of developing normal diplomatic relations with foreign countries and in its struggle aimed at safeguarding China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity that the Chinese Government has adhered to the One China principle and has won both understanding and support from a growing number of countries and international organizations .  
Hu Jintao said : Since the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Burma half a century ago , the friendly cooperative relationship between the two countries has all along developed steadily in various fields , given the enormous changes in the international situation .  
Over the past 50 years since the establishment of diplomatic ties , satisfactory headway has been made in the bilateral relations , and no issues pending an urgent solution exist between the two sides , as the five principles of peaceful coexistence has constituted the cornerstone of the kindred emotion between the two peoples .  
Chi Haotian said that since establishing diplomatic relations in 1985 China and Bolivia have enjoyed smooth development of friendly cooperative relations , both sides have expanded exchanges and cooperation in political , economic , military and cultural fields , to which China is satisfied , and is willing to make continuous efforts to further relations between the two states and armed forces in a healthy and stable way .

Since the establishment of diplomatic relations seven years ago , China and Slovakia have made joint efforts to promote the constant development of friendly cooperation in the political , economic , military , science , technology , and cultural fields .

Their backgrounds involved an international human smuggling ring stretching across Asia and Africa and also included diplomatic officials of African nations .  
Chinese NPC Standing Committee Chairman Li Peng said the peoples of China and Azerbaijan have maintained friendly contacts during the Soviet era and after Azerbaijan 's independence .  Since Azerbaijan and China established diplomatic ties , a succession of Azerbaijani leaders have visited China . In particular , when President Aliyev visited China in early 1994 , the two countries signed eight documents which included a joint declaration that laid the foundation for the friendly relations between the two countries .  
They show in the face of the intricate international situation , Chinese leaders still hold fast to their judgment that peace and development remain the theme of the present-day world .  They uphold an independent foreign policy of peace while firmly adhering to the central task of economic development , which has enabled China to make new achievements of world interest on the diplomatic front and has steadily raised its international status .

When talking about his government 's foreign policy in his administrative policy speech , Yoshiro Mori said : In the first half of the 21st century , Japan 's basic diplomatic strategy in the Asia-Pacific region will be based on its alliance with the United States and oriented to strengthening the friendly ties with the ROK , its neighbor , and maintaining a stable pattern in the Asia-Pacific region through building up mutually trusted and harmonious relations with China and Russia .  
As a matter of fact , this time it was even more unjustified for Yoshiro Mori to use the same excuse as Putin did , because what the boat capsize incident involved are not limited simply to technical problems such as searching for the survivors , but also political and diplomatic issues of crucial importance to Japan such as relations between Japan and the United States . As the Prime Minister , how could he use the excuse " not right to intervene " ?

After entering the 21st century , the deepening of interdependence between nations has surpassed the limit of human historical experiences , and a " global community " has dimly appeared in an embryonic form .

Q : Now that the R . O . C has severed diplomatic relations with Nicaragua , it is rumored that Uruguay may establish ties with the Mainland . In the face of international political realities , it is very difficult for the R . O . C to appeal to " morality " and limited agricultural and economic aid as a basis for diplomacy . How should we deal with this situation ?  
Foreign Minister Lien Chan expressed his desire to use " realistic , flexible , and forward-looking methods " to break through the current reliance on substantive foreign relations and to " establish formal diplomatic relations with ever country in the world " as well as to improve substantive relations .  
However , although formal diplomatic ties have been severed between the United States and our country during the last ten years , substantive relations have not only been maintained , but enhanced immeasurably . This is mainly due to interests shared by the two nations , along with broad support from the American and Chinese people .  
Some countries have formal diplomatic relations with us and some do not , but the countries that do not all have a number of substantive relations with us , such as economic and trade ties , scientific and technological cooperation , athletic and cultural exchanges , a whole host of them .  
Despite his special fondness for the garden , he actually spent more of his time away from home involved with exhibitions and such during his 20 years there ( from 1953 to 1973 , when he immigrated to the United States ) - - except for a time after France established diplomatic relations with Communist China ( his main overseas market was Europe ) , when he stayed holed up at home and did n't care to travel about much .  
The 2:1 exchange rate of the Belize dollar to the U . S . dollar has held steady for many years , and inflation has been kept firmly under control - - a big relief when you consider the astronomical inflation and plummeting exchange rates of its neighbors . Immigrants from Taiwan also find it reassuring that Belize and the R . O . C . have diplomatic relations and that the economic assistance we are providing them has made us well liked by the government and public alike . "  
Opening International Doors : In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , situated on a quiet section of Chieh Shou Rd . , the phones in the international organizations department are constantly ringing , the staff is busily poring through documents , and officials involved in major diplomatic initiatives are streaming in and out , swinging open the thick wooden door .  
But the detailed contents - - whether or not in the future an agency specially responsible for foreign aid will be established , exactly what the foreign aid ratio should be , whether diplomatic or economic considerations should be predominant - - have not yet been determined .  
Those days of Williamsport and the " Triple Crown " surely give us some warm memories : the whole family up in front of the TV in the wee hours of the morning to cheer on the team overseas , watching the children coming through the screen from the other side of the world winning the title " world champions " even as those in Taiwan were straining away to get the economy to take off and the country was meeting diplomatic setbacks in the 1970s - - what adult was n't moved to tears ?  
Especially in 1981 , just three years after the United States broke off diplomatic relations , and with a sensitive atmosphere still lingering two years after the riots of the Kao-hsiung Incident . Although her parents had never filled her with any kind of political consciousness , Hsin Chi-ming had still , from a young age , got a fuzzy stereotyped idea that anyone who had anything to do with the 228 Incident was a thoroughly bad person , so you can imagine how she panicked .  
After the R . O . C . lost its UN seat , its international position gradually became more and more shadowy , as one country after another broke off diplomatic relations , navigational rights were rescinded , the R . O . C . was forced to withdraw from international organizations , and R . O . C . passport holders faced obstacles wherever they went .  
The policy of actively returning houses has only been going on for the past five years . Many overseas Chinese are scattered abroad , and have only heard about the program in a roundabout fashion before coming to investigate . Also , for example , in 1990 after the PRC established diplomatic relations with Indonesia , a large group of overseas Chinese from there came forward to apply . "  
There has never been a case of a country which establishes a public school in a geographic location belonging to a foreign power . And furthermore Taiwan does not have official diplomatic relations with Indonesia . Chaoalso notes that the overseas schools of America and Japan , although partly subsidized by their respective governments , remain nevertheless private schools . "  
Chen Yu-chun , the director of the Institute of American Studies at Chinese Culture University , points out that when the US had formal diplomatic ties and a mutual security treaty with Taiwan , the US stated repeatedly that the treaty applied only to Taiwan and the Pescadores , not to Kinmen and Matsu ( the latter two islands being right on the coast of mainland China , as opposed to the former , which are more distant from the continent ) .  
An incoming middle school teacher earned about NT $ 4000 per month ( or less than US $ 100 at then-current exchange rates ) . It was a time of political and diplomatic crises . President Chiang Kai-shek had died less than a year before ( in April , 1975 ) , and citizens accustomed to following a strong leader were at a loss . With little international room to maneuver following the ROC 's withdrawal from the United Nations , Taiwan 's only asset was economic growth .  
This pragmatic approach may be the model for the future presence in Hong Kong of the countries which maintain diplomatic ties with Taipei . The loss of a major diplomatic partner is a blow to the ROC 's hopes for " dual recognition , " and also reveals the cruel and unsentimental nature of international politics .  
Wang Chen-tai notes that early on there were factional conflicts , reducing the religion 's impact . Fortunately , he says , learned elders like Hsieh Sung-tao and Ting Chung-ming wrote inexhaustibly . Also , because of the importance of diplomatic ties with Islamic countries , the ROC government has strongly supported Muslims . The Taipei mosque , which has been the main spiritual and practical resource for Muslims in Taiwan for many years now , was built with government money in response to strong and far-sighted efforts by Ambassador Yeh Kung-chao .  
The combined effects of ROC foreign policy and cross-strait relations make this stage of ROC foreign relations extremely unusual . How does Chang , an old foreign-affairs hand , who studied international politics and entered the diplomatic corps nearly 30 years ago , and who bears the high expectations of the people , plan to steer the ROC diplomatic ship through these troubled times ?  
Following the economic development of Taiwan 's diplomatic partners , the number of cooperative programs the new Agricultural Technology Missions are involved in has steadily increased . In addition to growing grain and vegetables , the scope of the missions has also come to include animal husbandry work-raising pigs and chickens ; marine technology-fishing techniques and the breeding and raising of marine animals ; handicraft work-bamboo weaving , wood carving ; and such areas of work as flood prevention and water conservation projects among others .  
This building , which is located on Taipei 's Chungshan North Road , was built in 1901 . In the period of Japanese colonial rule it was the US Consulate . After the US and ROC broke off diplomatic relations it was left unattended and after almost two decades of neglect it was in a parlous state , with trees growing through the walls and holes in the roof .  
Through long-term arrangements by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and overseas representative offices , Vice President Lien Chan conducted his second visit to Europe under the low profile of a " holiday " and " private visit . " He made substantive , face-to-face contact with a nation with which the ROC does not have diplomatic ties , and established the critical beginnings of friendship and progressive exchange . The incessant actions of Beijing are additional proof of the barriers which the ROC currently faces in foreign relations .  
The visit has undoubtedly helped to promote a deeper understanding of Taiwan on the other side of the Taiwan Strait . In the midst of these positive signs , however , China surprised Taiwan by resuming diplomatic relations on 23 April with Guinea Bissau . This development was a slap in the face for Taiwan , which has lost diplomatic relations with yet another country . This naked reminder of China 's unflagging campaign to isolate Taiwan internationally makes a mockery of budding hopes for improved cross-strait relations .  
Lee could hardly have told us much of anything new in his memoirs , for he had already devoted a tremendous effort during 30 years in office to the task of recounting the events that preceded the founding of the republic . Furthermore , Singapore has been deeply influenced by its long years under British rule . The Singaporean government maintains copious records concerning all its domestic and foreign affairs . Political statements over the years have drawn upon a large body of diplomatic documents , parliamentary reports , private letters , and government proclamations .  
During Premier Siew 's visit to Belize however , many overseas Chinese reported threats to their personal safety and property , or discrimination when passing through immigration . Premier Siew reported this to Prime Minister Musa , and instructed the ROC embassy to take care of local overseas Chinese . At the same time he emphasized that all embassies and consulates should give equal treatment to Chinese from the mainland in those countries with diplomatic ties to the ROC .  
In 1978 , the legislative elections were canceled after the US announced it would switch diplomatic ties to the PRC . Many in the opposition camp ( represented by the newly published magazine Formosa ) favored working for change through street demonstrations , as opposed to the traditionally safer line of " reform through the system . " On December 10 , 1979 , the Kaohsiung riot occurred , and most of Formosa 's leaders were imprisoned . Democratization and the multi-party system were thus postponed .  
In recent years , all the countries that recognize the ROC have been small and medium-sized developing nations . Many of these nations receive long-term foreign aid , in the form of both technical missions and material assistance . This has resulted in frequent criticism about " checkbook diplomacy . " Since the ROC is an international trading powerhouse with excellent de facto relations with many nations , some people have even wondered why it is necessary to pursue formal diplomatic relations at all .  
The waves stirred up when the ROC established formal ties with the Marshall Islands and Macedonia are but one example of the ROC 's and PRC 's diplomatic wrangling . Yet they illustrate clearly the ROC 's current situation in regard to its allies . The most feasible way for the ROC to maintain or expand the number of nations with which it has formal ties is to engage in an economic - and trade-based diplomacy that provides these nations with Taiwan 's ample experience in economic development .  
This approach of marrying outside capital and technology with the rich local marine resources is one of the more feasible models by which the Taiwanese fishing industry , faced with limited opportunities at home , can develop overseas operations . The RMI , which has just established diplomatic relations with the ROC , is an ideal place for such investment .  
There has also been criticism voiced over the decision-making process . Wei Yung , director of a public policy think tank , contends that the president has neither constitutional nor legal authority to make foreign policy decisions or conduct diplomatic operations . Also , the meeting at which the decision was reached was not a meeting of the National Security Council nor of the Cabinet , so it is uncertain how binding this decision is .  
Taiwan is working hard to attain diplomatic and economic breakthroughs and hoping to gain a deeper understanding of the West . Beset with ethnic and environmental problems , popular culture reigns supreme .  
The Hsinchu Science-Based Industrial Park , which was being planned at that time , included provision for bilingual schools and American-style residential communities . This was also the period when diplomatic ties with the US were cut , which aroused resentment in Taiwan and led some Taiwanese abroad to return home as an expression of solidarity .  
Many Taiwan business people saw the establishment of formal diplomatic relations as a green light for investment in Palau . The foreign ministry delegation that visited Palau in March included private sector firms involved in tourism , textiles , electronics , and fishing , who went to investigate the investment environment .  
While she was in the US , it became clear that the United States would soon sever official diplomatic relations with the Republic of China . This event was to have enormous impact upon Taiwanese politics , and Lu was spurred to get involved in politics herself in order to use political power to correct the ills of society . In order to struggle for women 's rights and democracy , she cut her studies short and returned to Taiwan in 1978 to run for the National Assembly .  
On a large antique-style cabinet in the waiting area , Sung arranged over 20 pieces of Chinese porcelain . These were imitation antiques which he bought in Taiwan 's pottery town of Yingko , but shortly after the restaurant opened they were all stolen by thieves who mistook them for genuine antiques . Convincing imitations Of all the Chinese restaurants Peter Sung has designed , a particular favorite of his is the Tse Yang Restaurant in the diplomatic quarter of Paris , close to the Champs Elysees .  
However , WTO regulations require that exemptions be declared prior to application for entry . Given Taiwan 's current weak diplomatic position , unless the PRC agrees to the exemption , it will be difficult for Taiwan to get the required support of two-thirds of the 137 WTO member states for this escape clause . In sum , Kinmen people remain optimistic that the arguments in favor of the little three links will win out .  
" National sovereignty " is reflected in a country 's ability to engage in diplomatic relations , but in this most critical area for national survival , Taiwan has long been suffering from PRC efforts to undercut Taiwan 's international status . Indeed , as Levi C . Ying , an overseas Chinese legislator from the New Party , says , mainland China is the only real obstacle and enemy to Taiwan 's foreign relations .  
" Although you can argue that it is vital to maintain formal diplomatic relations with as many countries as possible until such time as there is a tacit diplomatic cease-fire with Communist China , today , when Taiwan 's budget faces growing constraints and the island has not yet recovered from the recent earthquake , it is not acceptable for the government to be spreading such a huge amount of money abroad . "  
Lo says that the main countries that will be at the center of future diplomatic work , besides the ROC 's existing diplomatic partners , will be the nations of North America and Europe . " The academic community is a major source of staff people for the executive branch , while congressmen set the direction of legislation and executive officials determine how it is implemented . In the future more emphasis will be placed on contacts at these three levels with European and North American countries , " he says .  
With regard to foreign aid , he said that helping diplomatic partners is Taiwan 's right and also its duty . Though these countries are not rich or powerful , " you ca n't measure everything by the same yardstick . " Though the economies of some diplomatic partners are too weak , and their democracies are immature , Taiwan must be willing to share its experience , in which economic takeoff spurred political democratization , and work together with diplomatic partner states to " stand up and move on out . "  
However , given the trend of globalization of firms , there are growing economic opportunities in ROC diplomatic partner states . New Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi , a successful entrepreneur himself , was a key member of the delegation that accompanied President Chen Shui-bian abroad in mid-August . He devoted particular attention to the local investment climate in each country , and came up with a few suggestions of his own .  
Q : Taiwan firms have always been cooperative , and overseas investment has been very helpful to the ROC 's diplomatic work . But today the government is putting political considerations first in encouraging Taiwan firms to invest in friendly countries . From an economic point of view , how effective is this ?  
Moreover , environmental protection work touches on things like community consciousness , the livelihood of farmers and fishermen , and aboriginal culture . Often the main obstacle to environmental protection work is the attitudes of people who live in the mountains and depend on the resources there . Thus environmental protection is not simply the responsibility of a few social elites , but includes economic , social , transportation , and even diplomatic and political aspects .  
The PRC is reported to be the main cause of the diplomatic rupture . Macedonia has been beset in recent years by both internal and external threats . Fighting connected with the separatist movement in neighboring Kosovo has generated a mass exodus of refugees into Macedonia , while the Macedonian government has been unable to quell a domestic rebellion by ethnic Albanians .  
The situation is also problematic in Africa , another major diplomatic base for Taiwan . Domestic turbulence is rife in Liberia and other countries that maintain formal ties with Taiwan , and see-saw struggles between opposing camps pose a big threat to our diplomatic relations . It is said that diplomacy is the extension of national power .  
In seeking to answer this question , we poured our energies into building our economy , developing the so-called folk literature , and finding strength in the land where we live . In the process , we developed self-confidence . The severing of official diplomatic ties with the US in 1978 left us even further isolated from the international community , but we responded by redoubling our efforts and pulling together . A national consciousness began to take shape .  
Further , critics say that the series of suspenseful spy-vs . - spy-like episodes ensuing over the course of Lu 's jaunt violated established norms of diplomatic behavior , leaving potential new allies at a loss and making them reluctant to undertake any substantive exchanges with Taiwan .  
It had withdrawn from the United Nations and diplomatic ties with Japan had been severed . Along with the political debate , a wave of nativization swept through every level of Taiwanese society . Within the literary community , a reevaluation of the Modernism it had adopted with Westernization was unavoidable .  
China continued to play a positive role in multilateral activities and major international affairs , and participated in diplomatic activities of both the United Nations and regional organizations in a wide range of areas , contributing to world peace and common development , it says

Croatia is of the opinion that the joint effects of Operation Storm , the coordinated activities of the army of Bosnia and Herzegovina and HVO ( Croatian Defence Council ) units , and the actions of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) rapid reaction force against the Bosnian Serbs , coupled with diplomatic efforts , have finally opened the way to serious and comprehensive peace negotiations , which will eventually lead to a realistic , balanced and lasting solution to the crisis .  
Upon signing the agreement on the peaceful reintegration of the remaining occupied areas , the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Croatia would recognize each other within their internationally recognized borders and diplomatic relations between these two States would be established at the ambassadorial level .

Regarding the organization and the direction of the Olympic Movement , a pivotal role is being played by His Excellency Mr . Juan Antonio Samaranch , who , through his policy of engaging in personal contacts and through the prestige which he enjoys throughout the world , within the most varied of political and diplomatic circles , has succeeded in making the Olympic Movement an interlocutor of the most representative and the largest world forum , the United Nations .  
Furthermore , Member States ' willingness to assume the onerous responsibilities inherent in permanent membership of the Security Council , and thereby bolster its capacity to fulfil its mandate , should have been convincingly demonstrated by their contributions to the promotion of regional peace and global security through successful diplomatic initiatives in the prevention and resolution of conflicts , as well as by participation in peace-keeping operations over a period of time .  
An extremely able and activist Secretary-General ` s Special Representative was supported by a well-organized and tightly coordinated donor community willing to apply leverage at key points , by intense diplomatic activity on the scene by a handful of influential countries with long-standing relations with the parties , and by a strong and supportive community of non-governmental organizations .  
As peace and security are closely interlinked with political , economic and social development , including democracy and the realization of human rights world wide , crisis management should consist of an adequate combination of diplomatic , military , legal , economic , environmental and social measures of stabilization .  
A further analysis of the information available in the Secretariat as well as more detailed data on diplomatic indebtedness provided by the United States Mission indicates that in the most serious cases the excessive indebtedness of missions is attributable to , and continues to persist as a result of the ongoing political and economic instability experienced by certain Member States .

The classical codification procedure of elaborating draft articles as a basis for international diplomatic conferences , with a view to the subsequent adoption of binding instruments of international law , had been successful in the past , but of late had proved rather inflexible and should be reconsidered .  
A considerable momentum had been created and a commensurate political will was required to avoid protracted discussions and ensure that preparatory work was completed in time for a diplomatic conference in 1997 .

Finally , I wish to express Colombia 's satisfaction at being engaged in the exemplary Central American process in the search for peace , harmony and development , through the geographic and cultural bonds that unite us to the region , the close economic and diplomatic relations that we have with every Central American country , and our participation in the Group of Friends .  
Beyond these diplomatic efforts at the international level , however , the most critical requirement is for the parties directly concerned to bridge the political chasm by engaging in candid and open-minded dialogue .

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation requests the heads of diplomatic missions and the representatives of international and non-governmental organizations to report objectively about what they have seen to the Governments , nations or organizations that they represent and give them an accurate account of what is taking place in Burundi : recognized crimes against innocent populations , women , children and defenceless patients can not be mistaken for a struggle for democracy or the liberation of an ethnic group , or presented simply as inter-ethnic confrontation or fighting between the army and the rebels .  
Iraq also submitted several requests to the Committee with regard to the partial release of its frozen assets for various purposes , such as paying its dues to international organizations , including the United Nations , financing the publication of the Holy Koran in Iraq , covering the cost of its pilgrimage programmes , meeting legal expenses for court actions outside the country , maintaining Iraq 's diplomatic missions abroad and purchasing humanitarian and other supplies from other countries .  
The proposal was made by the Commission in its report on its forty-seventh session in 1995 , 1 / in which the Commission notes that the topic could be considered as part of its long-term programme of work and could , inter alia , cover the content and scope of the rule of exhaustion of local remedies , the rule of nationality of claims as applied to both natural and juristic persons , problems of stateless persons and dual nationals , and the effect of dispute settlement clauses on domestic remedies and on the exercise of diplomatic protection .  
The veto power , flawed in principle as it was and remains , may have had a useful purpose during the cold war era , but with the improved international environment and , indeed , the increase of diplomatic avenues to resolve differences , the continued existence of the veto is as undemocratic as it is irrelevant .  
Such prohibitions , whether they involved the principle of non-use of force ( subpara . ( a ) ) , avoiding extreme political or economic coercion ( subpara . ( b ) ) , respect for the inviolability of diplomatic or consular agents , premises , archives and documents ( subpara . ( c ) ) or the requirement not to derogate from basic human rights , had been generally well accepted .  
Once again solemnly appeals to the community of States , the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental humanitarian organizations to redouble their commitment and take further initiatives to mobilize the political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources needed to end the Burundian crisis definitively and , thereby , to bring these collective efforts to fruition in a genuine national reconciliation of the Burundian people ;  
Moreover , and this point has been stressed by several speakers today , the experience of the Tribunal for Rwanda , like the experience of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia , is to be considered as one of the key elements for the future establishment of a permanent international criminal court , a project that is well under way and for which Italy has offered to host , in 1998 , a diplomatic conference to adopt a statute for such a court .  
In pursuing cases with regard to trafficking and forced prostitution , the police are compelled to rely on diverse sources for information , such as Interpol , border guards , police operational activities and investigations into organized crime , diplomatic representations abroad , families looking for missing persons , clients of victims and victims themselves .

the three topics mentioned in paragraph 249 of the Commission 's report - diplomatic protection ; ownership of wrecks ; and unilateral acts of States - should be topics of study , although he did not agree with the views outlined in note 9 of addendum 2 of the annexes , since the jurisdiction of the coastal State beyond its territorial sea and contiguous zone was guaranteed by the residual competence granted to it under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea .  
Moreover , at a time of increasing demand but decreasing resources within the United Nations for international action , the potential of regional groups to contribute political , diplomatic , financial , material and military resources has taken on even greater importance . 
As to allegations that the host country was ignoring legal instruments on diplomatic privileges and immunities and interfering with the functioning of the Cuban Mission , he reiterated the United States Mission 's position that the applicable principles of conventional and customary international law neither prohibited the imposition of travel restrictions nor entitled the affected individuals to unrestricted travel throughout the United States .  
Mongolia is pursuing a policy of maintaining the size of its armed forces and its defence expenditures at the lowest possible level and of ensuring its independence and national security primarily by political and diplomatic means .  
Despite strenuous diplomatic efforts , in particular by the Secretary-General and his special representative , Mr . Nobert Holl , to broker a ceasefire and engage the warring parties in a peace process , the fighting has been raging unabated , with even greater intensity in recent months . 
Apart from this lacuna in humanitarian law ( which can be remedied by the application of the doctrine of state responsibility with regard to breaches of jus cogens rules ) , it is apparent that assertive international diplomatic measures are required to ensure that territorial settlements which prohibit forcible transfers of population and the implantation of settlers are respected by the parties to the agreements .  
The International Monitoring Committee to supervise the implementation of the Bangui Agreements , acting on behalf of MISAB and / or on its own behalf , maintains regular contacts with international organizations , including UNDP and foreign diplomatic missions based in Bangui , with a view to requesting their diplomatic , financial and material support for mediation initiatives in the Central African Republic .

On the other hand , they themselves engage in massive sales of advanced weapons and equipment to sensitive regions , infringing upon the national sovereignty of other countries and damaging regional peace and stability .

International negotiations were central to bilateral and multilateral cooperation between States , to the management of international relations , the peaceful settlement of disputes and the creation of new international norms of conduct , yet the conduct of negotiations was the one type of diplomatic activity that had not been touched by regulation , codification and harmonization .  
However , the United Nations faced a choice between the widespread use of economic , diplomatic and other sanctions as a standard approach to the conduct of international relations , and their more considered use in exceptionally serious circumstances , when they would be applied in a spirit of openness for a fixed , renewable period to achieve results clearly identified in advance .  
I also take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the entire international community for their immense political , diplomatic and material support to Sierra Leone , and to my Government and people in these difficult times .  
During the discussion , it was stated that machinery should be established that does not require diplomatic action , that sufficient publicity should be given to existing means of defence and that closed investigations should be made public or open so that they will be more effective .  
This is a test of our collective responsibility , made even more pressing by the terrible massacres that have characterized recent ethnic conflicts , and Italy confirms its strong support , pledges its active contribution to this endeavour , and is prepared to host in Rome the diplomatic conference to adopt the statute for the international criminal court .

I am convinced that your rich and profound experience in diplomatic relations , together with your personal qualities , will facilitate the constructive work of this General Assembly session and make it an outstanding international event .  
Our own position , as presented to the Council in the open debate that took place on 21 May under the presidency of the Republic of Korea , can be summarized as follows : if the Security Council is to be expected to play a more active role in guaranteeing safe conditions for humanitarian assistance , our preference is for such endeavours to be attempted in parallel with multilaterally defined diplomatic agendas and within the realm of the possibilities offered by Chapter VI that of the pacific settlement of disputes .  
However , we believe it is fitting to express our thanks for the support and cooperation of the United Nations , the friendly countries that directly supported the peace processes in Guatemala , Nicaragua and El Salvador , and the cooperating community , whose technical and financial assistance complemented the political and diplomatic efforts to achieve peace in the region .  
The promotion of the Portuguese language , spoken today by more than 200-million people , the new modalities of institutional cooperation which have been established and the coordination of the diplomatic and political positions of the founder countries in the many international forums involved , have made this organization , despite its youth , an attentive participant within the international community .  The problems associated with the many components of the drug phenomenon are among the biggest challenges faced by our societies today .  
At the same tie , however , the legitimate wishes of many States to combat international terrorism were being held hostage by the double standards of powerful countries that preached against terrorism even as they impeded the negotiations on the draft Convention on the matter with all the diplomatic means and political pressure at their disposal , thus blocking the adoption of the clear and all-inclusive definition of terrorism that was needed and an unequivocal and impartial condemnation . 
With regard to diplomatic protection by international organizations , her delegation believed that since the number of international , regional and governmental organizations had grown immensely in the past decade , the functional diplomatic protection of those organizations formed an important part of contemporary diplomatic protection .  
At least at the current stage of the Commissions work on the topic , the functional protection extended by international organizations towards their agents should be considered along with diplomatic protection per se , since the initial results would supply the clarification needed for the subsequent adoption of a final decision on the inclusion of functional protection .  
The agreed conclusions on women in power and decision-making placed an emphasis on conflict resolution , peace and security matters , and the promotion of gender balance at all levels of national diplomatic service , including the ambassadorial level . 4 For example , Governments and the United Nations system were called upon to promote women 's active and equal participation as governmental and non-governmental representatives , special rapporteurs and envoys in all of their initiatives and activities , including as mediators for peacekeeping and peace-building . 
In fact , it should be evident that in our forum , political realism and a diplomatic approach constitute the fundamental essence of any aim and , consequently it would be advisable , albeit without denying the full respect of each national position , that adequate room be left for a free comparison of different theses in order to find a minimum common denominator on which the best solution for the successful attainment of our endeavours can be arrived at . 
The Ministers acknowledged the actions undertaken by the organs of the Community to implement the decisions and recommendations that had emanated from the Conference of Heads of State and Government and from the Council of Ministers , in conformity with the general guidelines contained in the Constitutive Declaration and the Statutes , in order to promote cooperation in the cultural , economic , social , scientific and legal / institutional fields , as well as to enhance political and diplomatic coordination .

The International Monitoring Committee to supervise the implementation of the Bangui Agreements , acting on behalf of MISAB and / or on its own behalf , maintains regular contacts with international organizations , including UNDP and foreign diplomatic missions based in Bangui , with a view to requesting their diplomatic , financial and material support for mediation initiatives in the Central African Republic .  
In the light of these facts , the Government of Cuba issued a denunciation , through the diplomatic channel , with a view to alerting the international community and international public opinion to what it considered to be a new campaign , developed in complete silence and complicity and aimed at tightening even further the iron-clad and criminal economic , commercial and blockade which the United States has maintained against Cuba for 37 years . 
The few cases where licences have been granted to supply certain drugs , under the sponsorship of the International Committee of the Red Cross or a diplomatic mission , have been handled on an individual basis , and not for the whole shipment but for partial shipments , after a complex and lengthy process lasting on average about seven months , which has discouraged the initiative of some organizations that were planning to donate medicine to Cuban hospitals . 
The International Monitoring Committee , acting on behalf of MISAB and / or on its own behalf , maintains regular contacts with international organizations , including UNDP and foreign diplomatic missions based in Bangui , with a view to requesting their diplomatic , financial and material support for mediation initiatives in the Central African Republic .  
In accordance with that objective , Mexican diplomatic and consular offices have a set of legal powers under both domestic and international law for carrying out their protective functions .  
They were guided not only by legal terminology and the compromises of diplomatic conferences ; before their very eyes was irrefutable proof of unprecedented of human suffering .  
A long-standing request for an additional airport permit , required to collect the diplomatic pouch , was granted to an international driver during the reporting period , bringing the total of such permits held to two .  
The remark was also made that the topic of diplomatic protection involved a series of complicated theoretical and practical questions and had an unfortunate history , having been regarded as an extension of colonial power or a system imposed by powerful States on weak States .  
The view was also expressed that international human rights instruments limited the scope of national jurisdiction by guaranteeing uniform standards of protection , whereas diplomatic protection functioned exclusively in relations between States and after domestic remedies had been exhausted .  
Moreover , juridical bodies for the protection of human rights , unlike those concerned with diplomatic protection , were well established in both the internal legal order and the international system ; that was a matter that the Commission should consider .  
As a future venue and a focal point for the Mine Ban Convention and the various activities in the field of mine action that it will produce , Geneva would offer a wide variety of diplomatic and technical expertise , a broad representation of diplomatic missions and humanitarian agencies and relevant non _ governmental organizations , including ICRC , WHO , UNHCR and the newly established Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining .  
I would emphasize here , without wanting to be too critical , an occasional lack of understanding in the implementation of adopted policies ; a pernicious role played by local personnel ; supporters of those in power being recruited by the international organizations ; a perceived lack of sensitivity on the part of those who were in charge of certain political and diplomatic aspects ; and perhaps too frequent personnel turnover .  
There is an impressive amount of expert knowledge and diplomatic skills concentrated in this room , and time and again our deliberations , which approach the subject matter from different , even opposing , viewpoints , have produced new and valuable insights and helped to clarify and develop national positions in no insignificant way .

Nor is it by chance that the Commission , on the very date on which it established the Special Rapporteurs mandate , recognized ( in impeccable diplomatic parlance ) that in various situations , indigenous peoples are unable to enjoy their inalienable human rights and fundamental freedoms ( Commission resolution 1989 / 34 of 6 March 1989 , sixth preambular paragraph ) .  
If the distinction had become commonplace in international law at the doctrinal level , it would be worthwhile searching for further applications of the concept , for example , by considering areas such as the law of the sea , environmental law and diplomatic law .  
The orthodox view of exhaustion of local remedies was the procedural view , namely , that the wrong might have occurred but no international action could be taken by way of a diplomatic claim or human rights complaint prior to the exhaustion of local remedies .  
Article 27 , subparagraph ( b ) appeared to have excluded from its scope strictly bilateral treaty obligations in which State C was not bound by any rule contained in a treaty concluded between States A and B .

Mr . CUMMINGS ( United States of America ) said that the Convention was a strong , integral part of international humanitarian law , whose purposes it served largely by enlisting military , diplomatic and legal experts alike in the crafting of the rules it enshrined : as a result , those who had to wage wars were often also involved in regulating the weapons of war .  
Both sides felt pleased and satisfied with the remarkable achievements in the friendly cooperation in political , economic and cultural and other fields between the two countries for over 30 years since China and Austria established diplomatic relations .  
Actually , in view of the fact that the " TSEA " has directly undermined efforts exerted by both China and the United States since the establishment of their diplomatic relations in 1979 in improving and developing their bilateral relations , that it has violated the principled stand on " one China , " and that it has directly interfered in China 's internal affairs , it will definitely aggravate tension in the Taiwan Strait , intensify the regional arms race and further push Taiwan to war rather than protect Taiwan 's security .  
Zhu Rongji said : Mr President is the Chinese people 's old friend .  We satisfactorily see that in the last 36 years since China and the Republic of Congo forged diplomatic ties , our bilateral friendly and cooperative relations have been steadily and smoothly developing .  Sound cooperation full of positive results has been carried out in the political , economic and trade , public health , and educational fields .  
Since the two countries formed diplomatic ties 36 years ago , friendly relations of cooperation between the two have maintained development on a healthy and stable track through the ups and downs of global situations and their domestic conditions .  
Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in early 1998 , with the joint efforts made by both sides , relations between China and South Africa have been developing smoothly , and substantive progress has been made in the cooperation between the two countries with broad prospects being shown .  It is hoped that both sides will continue to make efforts and do effective work , thus continuously advancing bilateral friendship and cooperation and achieving more concrete cooperation results to bring benefits to both peoples .  
Recently , the DPRK has actively carried out diplomatic activities ; worked hard to improve and strengthen its relations with the neighboring countries ; readjusted its diplomatic strategies towards the United States and Japan in a timely fashion ; expanded its exchanges with the developing countries ; and further normalized its relations with the western countries with excellent results .

He pointed out that the Chinese Government attaches great importance to developing friendly cooperative relations with Cuba . The two countries ' relations have developed smoothly in recent years .  Particularly since the realization of the mutual visit between President Jiang Zemin and President Castro , the cooperation level between the two sides has risen ; cooperation areas have constantly expanded ; and the Sino-Cuban relationship has entered a period of comprehensive development .  This year marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relationship between China and Cuba .  
Since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1992 , considerable progress has been made in bilateral friendly and cooperative relations in the political , economic , cultural , and other fields .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : Since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1992 , bilateral relations have been healthily and rapidly developing .  Our cooperation in the political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , agricultural , and cultural fields has achieved gratifying results .  
Since the establishment of diplomatic ties in 1992 , bilateral relations have developed rapidly , and the two countries have engaged in very successful cooperation in many fields .  The Chinese side is very pleased with the development , but of the opinion that there is still great potential for the development of bilateral ties , and it takes joint efforts of both sides to continuously expand fields of mutually beneficial cooperation .  
After the establishment of Sino-Egyptian diplomatic ties , the friendship between the people of the two countries has continuously been consolidated and developed .  On the basis of mutual respect , equality and mutual benefit , the two countries have established sincere and firm relations , and have carried out extensive and fruitful cooperation in the political , economic , cultural and other fields , as well as in international affairs .  
Since April 1999 , a number of U.S . scientists , experts on international issues , and former government officials with lofty virtue worthy of respect , such as former Secretary of State Kissinger , former Secretary of Defense Perry , and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Shalikashvili , have all voiced the opinion that the NMD system is technically unfeasible and economically wasteful of money and manpower and will bring grave diplomatic consequences .  
But due to Russia 's stiff resistance , the United States dares not make the plunge outright and is compelled to constantly enhance political , economic , military , and diplomatic relations with Ukraine and with other neighboring countries of Russia and to realize its strategic purposes gradually through " contacts " and in a " trot-like " manner .  
In addition to infiltrating Russia 's neighboring countries , the United States has also accelerated the pace of developing diplomatic and military cooperation relations with Mongolia in a " leapfrog " fashion in an attempt to take advantage of the unique strategic position of Mongolia and to place " an outpost " between China and Russia to monitor and control the movements of China and Russia and to deter Russia from the south and to carry out " peaceful evolution " against China from the north .

Led bythe Clinton Administration over the past eight years , the United States has enjoyed economic prosperity , reinforced national strength , and won a series of diplomatic victories .  Though plagued by scandals , Clinton has maintained his public approval rate at more than 60 percent , a rare case among various previous presidents .  
We must study his noble character of being loyal to the party and the people , study his lofty spirit of seeking truth from facts and upholding the truth , and study his solid and strict style of work .  Under the leadership of the party 's central committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , we must adhere to Deng Xiaoping 's thinking on foreign affairs , unflinchingly carry out the foreign policy of independence and peace , and further open up a new prospect for China 's diplomatic work .  
In accordance with its peaceful foreign policy of acting independently and keeping the initiative in its own hands , and based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence , China did not draw ideological lines but respected the political system which these countries had chosen , rapidly extended diplomatic recognition to those states which emerged as independent from the former Soviet Union , and established diplomatic relations with them .  
In diplomatic work , Comrade Geng Biao was firm on matters of principle and flexible on matters of tactics .  He put forward his unique viewpoints and creative ideas in light of the developing and changing situation .  He displayed very strong grasp of policy and strong mastery of the art of struggle .  
Comrade Geng Biao upheld the policy of practicing economy while conducting diplomatic activities .  He was strict with himself and never gave any thought about personal fame and wealth .  He sought no privilege for himself and always maintained the distinctive political character of plain living and hard struggle .  
Some Arab countries even appealed for halting diplomatic , economic , and trade relations with Israel or discontinuing the process of normalizing relations with Israel .  A few days ago Oman decided to shut down its commercial representative 's office in Tel Aviv and Israel 's commercial representative 's office in Muscat ;  
Faced with an ever-worsening internal and external security situation , Russia has carried out readjustments to its diplomatic line and pursued a more active and pragmatic foreign policy , in a bid to restore Russia 's great power status and its influential role in world and regional affairs .  
Since the cold war , Japan has been more active in pursuing its diplomatic line in seeking to become a world political power ; in military affairs , therefore , it has gradually changed its relatively passive and inward-looking military strategy and army building guidelines of the cold war period , in order to shake off Japan 's international image as a country with imbalance of economic , political , and military status , in a bid to play a greater role in a multipolar world .  
Because the United States has become increasingly dependent on satellite support for conducting its political , economic , military , and diplomatic affairs in the past 50 years or so , it feels the pressing need to protect its vested interests in space .  
Gore were already in their seats on the presidential inauguration rostrum set up on the west side of Capitol Hill . They were flanked by nearly one-thousand seats reserved for dignitaries .

In connection with Powell 's recent stream of indiscretions on various sensitive policies , which have even sparked off some diplomatic disputes , some media have pointed out that Powell 's frequent " indiscretions " on certain key issues , as the man in charge of foreign policy in the world 's sole " superpower , " may be deliberate , and that his aim in using " indiscretions " to explore reactions from various sides is very evident .  
Accordingly , although the missile problem is very complex , so long as there is a concerted effort by the concerned quarters in international society , by using political and diplomatic means and on the basis of equal dialogues and equal participation , the missile proliferation problem can be resolved in a fair , comprehensive , and non-discriminatory fashion .  
The gearing effect of improving and developing its relations with the United States will not only enable India to gain more strategic initiative in dealing with the other big powers and create an international and peripheral security environment to its own advantage , but it will all the more give impetus to India to make a big step forward to the world political and diplomatic arena .  
Chi Haotian said that China and Qatar established diplomatic ties in 1988 , and relations between the two countries as well as exchanges between the two countries ' military forces have developed ever since .  Chi Haotian said that he is confident this visit from the premier will take the friendly and cooperative relationship between China and Qatar to a new level .  
As the foremost principle in joint operations , " unified action " requires that all actions be focused on achieving a common goal .  At the national level it requires the integrated use of political , diplomatic , economic , intelligence , and military power to achieve the strategic goals of the state , as well as specific strategic goals which result from that .  
In the 1990s , he organized the military units to successfully fulfill the tasks of foreign friendly exchanges , equipment and technology imports , academic and technological exchanges , multilateral military diplomatic activity , and maritime military safety negotiations .  
They have expressed a common appeal at organs , schools , enterprises , rural areas , newspapers , radio and television programs , and internet websites : They resolutely support President Jiang Zemin'srighteous and stern statements delivered at a meeting with foreign guests.They resolutely support the Chinese Government 's proposal to resolve the issuethrough diplomatic channels in accordance with international law andinternational common practice .  They have resolutely urged the US Government toapologize to the Chinese people and to fully shoulder the responsibility .  
To resume the damaged bilateral ties , Kayato Ikeda , then prime minister of Japan , especially asked former Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida to pass a letter on to President Chiang Kai-shek , thus eventually renewing friendly relations between the two countries .  This was the diplomatic achievement made through the renowned " Yoshida letter . "  It will be clear in the next few days whether the US-China joint letter can match the " Yoshida letter . "  
The plane collision incident was the first trial of strength in the diplomatic field with the Chinese Communists after Bush took power , but so far , various signs showed that Bush was still short of savvy and proficiency in playing such diplomatic games , and his policy toward Beijing remained unstable .  This gave Beijing an opportunity of criticizing the United States ' usual reconnaissance activities in the South China Sea , and the US side was left with a justifiable argument .  
Jin Chanrong said : Currently , the political and diplomatic channels remain the main channels for solving the plane collision incident .  The denunciations made by the Chinese Communist side against the US side 's violation of international law and the mainland 's domestic laws were mainly aimed at supporting its own position , not aimed at taking any legal action .  
Reporters learned from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today that over the past few days , the Chinese and US sides have held several rounds of diplomatic negotiations with regard to handling the incident in which the US surveillance aircraft collided with and damaged a Chinese fighter , left a Chinese pilot missing , and intruded into China 's airspace and landed at an airport in China without permission .  
Sino-US diplomatic contacts are now in their 10th day regarding the incident in which a US spy plane collided with and destroyed a Chinese fighter and arbitrarily landed at a Chinese airfield , but the problem can hardly be resolved because the United States , sticking to its high-handed stance , is unwilling to bear the responsibility , and is unwilling to apologize to China .  
Jiang Zemin said he was pleased to see that in the 13 years since China and Uruguay established diplomatic relations , the two countries have increasingly enhanced friendly cooperation in political , economic and trade , and cultural fields , and the two peoples have continued to deepen their mutual understanding and friendship .  
However , we maintain that the United States should assume moral responsibility .  So the United States should be the first to take the next step , show as much goodwill as it possibly can , and make diplomatic mediation in a sustained manner .  If the United States confines itself , exerts verbal pressure , and even hints that trade sanctions may possibly be imposed and that several punitive measures may be applied with regard to the arms sales to Taiwan , no benefit will be brought to the current stalemate .  
In particular , since the two countries established diplomatic relations , the two sides have maintained frequent high-level exchanges , enhanced economic and trade cooperation , markedly increased contacts in scientific and cultural fields , and maintained sound cooperation in international affairs . "  
In the last nine years since China and Uzbekistan established diplomatic relations , leaders of the two countries have had frequent contacts and meetings .  The good working relations based on the mutual trust that Your Excellency the President and President Jiang Zemin built has powerfully promoted the friendly cooperation between the two countries .  Bilateral relations have made considerable progress .  
US allies generally connected this incident with the United States ' diplomatic tradition and the new Bush administration 's foreign policy .  They expressed the belief that such overbearing words and deeds to get what one wanted were no longer appropriate , increased tensions in the world , and made countries uneasy .  
Nevertheless , in each of their public statements , Chi Haotian and Zhang Wannian described themselves as " acting at President Jiang 's behest . "  The decision to release the crew before the Easter holiday was obviously influenced by suggestions made by the diplomatic system , and the timing was accurately controlled .  As demonstrated here , the PRC 's internal decision-making is rather rational , and Jiang Zemin is secure in his place as the commander .  
Law Suk-ching , a Hong Kong deputy to the NPC , said : By allowing the US crew to leave China , China has based itself on a humanitarian stance , taken the overall situation into consideration , been devoted to maintaining long-term China-US relations , and safeguarded China 's major task of reform , opening up , and economic construction .  All this has shown China 's diplomatic skills in proficiently handling complicated international issues .  
Although outsiders were worried that the influence of the Liberation Army would override the diplomatic system in the process of making diplomatic policy decisions or worried that without such authoritative political leaders as Mao and Deng , Jiang Zemin might not be strong enough to have the overall situation in his hand and might not make a final decision on releasing the American crew members , the Chinese Communists still proved with their action that Jiang Zemin was able to bring everything under his control .  
The plane collision incident provided an opportunity for the military and the hardliners inside the regime to affect the transfer of power with the impact of the people 's nationalist sentiments .  Jiang did not want to see that the incident developed to a degree that might seriously harm the Chinese Communists ' diplomatic relations with the United States , but neither could he openly show a sign of weakness and be outdone by the US side , because this would affect the legitimacy of his power status at home .  
Since China and South Africa established diplomatic relations in early 1998 , bilateral relations have developed in a rapid and comprehensive way , with exchanges and cooperation in various fields increasingly expanded and enhanced .  
Since China and Laos established diplomatic relations 40 years ago , our two countries and the people have trusted and supported each other , and the good neighborly and friendly relations between our two countries , established on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , have continued to strengthen and develop .  
We were at first worried that the Taiwan authorities would gloat over and revel in the recent US arms deal and the diplomatic victory of Lee Teng-hui 's visit to Japan . However , we are glad to hear that , after taking the above situations into consideration , the Presidential Office has announced in its statement today that arms purchase is not the only means of guaranteeing Taiwan 's defense , that the two sides of the Strait could only be assured genuine and lasting peace through constructive dialog and the normalization of relations .  
After the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1958 , friendly and cooperative relations continued to develop , and bilateral cooperation achieved gratifying results in the political , economic , cultural , and public health fields .  
Today , old comrades like us who used to work under his direct leadership and who stood with him through storm and stress in shouldering the historic mission are cherishing all the more this long-tested and loyal communist fighter , proletarian revolutionary and China 's outstanding leader on the diplomatic front .  Esteem and love for him well up in our hearts as we recall the historic and outstanding contributions he had made to the smooth handover of Hong Kong and Macao and the efforts he made in laying the foundation for long-term stability and prosperity .  
While China and the United States were entangled in a diplomatic stalemate due to the plane collision incident , a play was put on the stage in Washington : Jasuwant Singh , Indian minister of external affairs and concurrently defense minister , was visiting the United States at the invitation of US Secretary of State Colin Powell . The Pentagon also held a grand welcoming ceremony for him , including the reviewing of honor guards .  
Social development , especially in the modern era , has enmeshed military action more closely into the political , economic , diplomatic , and scientific and technological arenas .  More military means are now available for achieving specific politic goals , and the range of activities covered by military struggles is gradually widening .  
Of more than 10 strategic principles , the US authorities determined on measures for subverting China in various fields of social life including the political , economic , diplomatic , military , trade , cultural , and educational fields .  
Since China and Nepal established diplomatic relations in 1955 , the relations of friendly cooperation have developed in a sustained , healthy and stable manner thanks to the close attention and meticulous care of the leaders of the two countries as well as the joint efforts made by the two peoples .  
Junichiro Koizumi is bent on visiting the Yasukuni Shrine in the capacity of a prime minister .  He has deliberately established a courageous and resolute image of daring to resist diplomatic pressure to show he is determined to conduct " reform " and such " reform " of course fits in exactly with the wishes of the increasingly more active right-wingers .  
Improving and developing relations with the United States will not only enable India to win more strategic initiatives when dealing with other big powers , and create a more favorable international and peripheral security environment , but will also enable India to step into the world 's political and diplomatic arena with giant strides in the new century , thus fulfilling its " dream of being a big power . "  
Thanks to the joint efforts of both sides , significant progress has been made in our bilateral relations since the establishment of diplomatic ties , and excellent results have been achieved in mutually beneficial cooperation in all spheres .  We are happy to see that China 's NPC and the National Assembly of the ROK have also established and maintained friendly ties .  
Han Seung Soo said : Although the diplomatic ties between the ROK and China have not been established very long , yet the two countries have attained remarkable achievements in the bilateral relations and become mutual major partners of economic and trade cooperation .  
The two countries have seen rapid development in exchanges and cooperation in the political , economic , cultural , educational , and other fields since they established diplomatic relations more than eight years ago .  
To this end , India has designed a series of diplomatic steps : In 1996 , India for the first time joined the Regional Forum of ASEAN and in 2000 , its defense minister paid a visit to Japan and the two countries conducted a joint military exercise in the South China Sea , which has laid a foundation for India to be militarily involved in the South China Sea and signified that India has stridden over the second door in the process of " eastward expansion " .  
After that , the leaders of the five countries held regular annual meetings , and the contents of the meetings were extended from strengthening mutual trust in the border areas to across-the-board mutually beneficial cooperation in the political , security , diplomatic , economic , and trade fields among the five countries .  
In the organizational system of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the position of Chinese Ambassador to the United States Yang Jiechi is higher than Zhou Wenzhong . However , Zhou Wenzhong 's current visit to the United States is in the capacity of a special envoy of the Chinese Government and also at a time when the final solution of the plane collision incident has been reached between the two countries .  Therefore , diplomatic circles here have paid high attention to Zhou Wenzhong 's visit to the United States .  
It is not a special case .  With the many favorable conditions , the Chen Shui-bian administration has speedily entered a stage of good diplomatic relations with the United States . On the contrary , the new politically powerful in Washington had a poor opinion of the Chinese Communists , which greatly deteriorated further after the Chinese Communists ' handling of the military plane collision incident caused ill feelings among the American people .  
Especially since the beginning of the 1990 ' s , with the continuous progress of the domestic and international situation and the magnificent cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , the central leadership collective of the party with Jiang Zemin as the core has adhered to the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts , and made new explorations in practice and a new summarization in theory of many major economic , political , cultural , military , and diplomatic issues , thus enriching and developing Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
After the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Russia in 1991 , President Jiang Zemin and Russia 's first President Yeltsin profoundly summed up the experiences and lessons of history ; based on the strategic requirements of their countries ' national construction and development , and in accordance with the new characteristics and trends of changes in the international situation , they decided to establish a new style of interstate relationship completely different from the cold war period .  
Over the 10 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries , relations of bilateral cooperation have developed smoothly .  There have been frequent mutual visits at a high level and the two sides have established a basic framework and principle for cooperation in political , economic , trade , cultural and other fields .  
Since China and Ukraine established diplomatic relations 10 years ago , exchanges and cooperation in the political , economic and trade , science and technological , educational , cultural , sports , and other fields between our two countries have continued to broaden , and encouraging results have been achieved .  
Shuai Hwa-min pointed out that , speaking of this current phase , Taiwan-US military exchanges certainly have their necessity and importance , but this kind of exchange , rather , is not the kind which can generate a military alliance and actual troop joint military exercises , which is what the people of the nation are hoping for .  The biggest key factor is that the two sides are nations without diplomatic relations .  Therefore , future Taiwan-US military exchanges will continue to be low key , but they will be conducted in an essentially advancing way .  
Facing the US advances at every step , Beijing 's reaction in recent years was relatively low key .  This was considered by Communist China 's strategic circles as a " serious failure " of the diplomatic work .  The United States has long considered Beijing as its opponent and has made deployment of its forces beforehand , while the CPC Central Committee has not made ideological and material preparations in return .  
China and Malta are situated far from each other , and they are different in terms of national situation , size , population , and historical background .  However , their relations over the nearly 30 years after they established diplomatic ties can be held up as an example of equal treatment , mutual respect , and peaceful coexistence between a big country and a small nation .  
The questions set in the polls of the " Ministry of Foreign Affairs " did point out that " the existing system and way of life will be retained . "  However , keeping in mind the fact that Taiwan is an island and its people are afraid of losing their freedom of external connections , they emphasized that " Taiwan will not have any diplomatic power from now on , " which was also intended as a threat .  
Shi Guangsheng said that China and Pakistan are intimate , friendly neighbors , and have had close and very fruitful cooperation in international affairs and on individual construction projects since the two countries established diplomatic ties .  
Given this , in order to divert public attention from domestic economic issues , allow himself a breathing spell , and win more time for working out new economic policies , Junichiro Koizumi deemed it necessary to create some political , diplomatic , and military news , and this is nothing but an old trick favored by some Japanese politicians .  
Jiang Zemin said that since diplomatic ties were established 26 years ago , Sino-Thai relations have throughout that time maintained a healthy and stable development , regardless of any changes in the international situation , and that this can be regarded as a model for friendly relations and mutually beneficial cooperation between neighboring countries with different social systems .  
In the early days of his office , Bush put on the airs of a supercilious " global overlord " on the diplomatic front and met with extensive opposition from the international community .  It landed the United States in a very isolated state , incurring more and more criticisms and worries from within the United States . As a result , the support rate for Bush in the opinion polls kept falling .  
Today , Chinese Ambassador to Japan Wu Dawei said here that in the past few months of this year , with the occurrence of such events as the historical issue , Lee Teng-hui 's visit to Japan , and the Japanese prime minister 's action of paying homage at Yasukuni Shrine , Sino-Japanese relations have been bogged down in the most difficult condition over the past 30 years since the normalization of diplomatic relations .  The Japanese side should create favorable conditions for getting Sino-Japanese relations out of this predicament by resolving the current existing problems .  
Tang Jiaxuan says China will take an active part in multilateral diplomatic activities of international organizations , firmly safeguard the objectives and principles in the UN Charter and universally-acknowledged norms governing international relations , and work hard with all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world in pushing for the construction of a just and rational international political and economic new order so as to play our part in building a peaceful , safe , prosperous , and stable new world .  
The article stresses : As the " Taiwan Security Enhancement Act " bill has directly undermined all the efforts of China and the United States in improving and developing bilateral relations since they established diplomatic relations in 1979 , violated the " one-China " principled stand , and directly interfered in China 's internal affairs .  In reality , not only can Taiwan 's security not be ensured , but it will also intensify the situation in the Taiwan Strait and regional arms race and further push Taiwan toward war .  
Based on China 's own interests , joining G-8 will give China more opportunities to express its views and exert influence on important economic , political and diplomatic affairs and other global issues and will have an additional place to deal with international affairs and a mechanism to coordinate foreign affairs and maneuver among major western countries .  
The Chinese Government has stood all kinds of rigorous tests in the complicated changing situation and scored remarkable achievements in the political , economic , social , science and technology , cultural , and diplomatic fields .  
In accordance with the agreement on trade relations signed soon after China and the United States established diplomatic ties in 1979 , the two sides should mutually grant " MFN treatment " to each other .  However , the United States adopted the annual appraisal system for the " MFN treatment " for China in accordance with its relevant domestic law .  It further attached some conditions related to " human rights " in the process of implementation .  
Sun Yuxi said : President Jiang 's upcoming visits will be an important diplomatic move made by China at the turn of the century .  The purpose of the visits are to step up high-level exchange between China and the aforementioned six countries , ensure further development of bilateral relations , and exchange views with them on the current international situation and the situations in regions of concern , in order to enhance mutual understanding and step up cooperation on international and regional affairs .  
President Jiang 's current visits to the six countries is China 's important diplomatic action at the turn of the century aimed at strengthening high-level contacts between China and the above-mentioned six countries to further develop their bilateral ties and exchange views on the international and relevant regional situation .  The visits will increase their mutual understanding and enhance their cooperation in international and regional affairs .  
China 's diplomatic policy is to develop friendly ties of cooperation with all countries in the world based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence , Zhu stated .  China is willing to further develop cooperation with Iran in the political , economic , and cultural fields .  
Tang Jiaxuan says China will take an active part in multilateral diplomatic activities of international organizations , firmly safeguard the objectives and principles in the UN Charter and universally-acknowledged norms governing international relations , and work hard with all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world in pushing for the construction of a just and rational international political and economic new order so as to play our part in building a peaceful , safe , prosperous , and stable new world .

These pioneering measures which " stress " maintaining good relations with Taiwan were followed by all succeeding foreign ministers .

When talking about his government 's foreign policy in his administrative policy speech , Yoshiro Mori said : In the first half of the 21st century , Japan 's basic diplomatic strategy in the Asia-Pacific region will be based on its alliance with the United States and oriented to strengthening the friendly ties with the ROK , its neighbor , and maintaining a stable pattern in the Asia-Pacific region through building up mutually trusted and harmonious relations with China and Russia .  
As a matter of fact , this time it was even more unjustified for Yoshiro Mori to use the same excuse as Putin did , because what the boat capsize incident involved are not limited simply to technical problems such as searching for the survivors , but also political and diplomatic issues of crucial importance to Japan such as relations between Japan and the United States . As the Prime Minister , how could he use the excuse " not right to intervene " ?  
Since the founding their diplomatic relations almost 30 years ago , particularly over the last few years , the two countries ' relations have developed and they have conducted fruitful cooperation in the political , economic , trade , cultural , and educational fields as well as in international and regional affairs .

( 3 ) Compared with his economic achievements , Clinton was weak and inept in diplomatic strategy .  Since it is very difficult for Bush to demonstrate his economic aptitude within a short period of time , he has to use underhand method to score some points first in foreign affairs .

It is common knowledge that the Tiananmen area is an important venue where the party and the state hold major state and diplomatic events and a high-profile mecca for Chinese and foreign tourists .

After entering the 21st century , the deepening of interdependence between nations has surpassed the limit of human historical experiences , and a " global community " has dimly appeared in an embryonic form .

Q : Now that the R . O . C has severed diplomatic relations with Nicaragua , it is rumored that Uruguay may establish ties with the Mainland . In the face of international political realities , it is very difficult for the R . O . C to appeal to " morality " and limited agricultural and economic aid as a basis for diplomacy . How should we deal with this situation ?  
Foreign Minister Lien Chan expressed his desire to use " realistic , flexible , and forward-looking methods " to break through the current reliance on substantive foreign relations and to " establish formal diplomatic relations with ever country in the world " as well as to improve substantive relations .  
However , although formal diplomatic ties have been severed between the United States and our country during the last ten years , substantive relations have not only been maintained , but enhanced immeasurably . This is mainly due to interests shared by the two nations , along with broad support from the American and Chinese people .  
Some countries have formal diplomatic relations with us and some do not , but the countries that do not all have a number of substantive relations with us , such as economic and trade ties , scientific and technological cooperation , athletic and cultural exchanges , a whole host of them .  
Despite his special fondness for the garden , he actually spent more of his time away from home involved with exhibitions and such during his 20 years there ( from 1953 to 1973 , when he immigrated to the United States ) - - except for a time after France established diplomatic relations with Communist China ( his main overseas market was Europe ) , when he stayed holed up at home and did n't care to travel about much .  
The 2:1 exchange rate of the Belize dollar to the U . S . dollar has held steady for many years , and inflation has been kept firmly under control - - a big relief when you consider the astronomical inflation and plummeting exchange rates of its neighbors . Immigrants from Taiwan also find it reassuring that Belize and the R . O . C . have diplomatic relations and that the economic assistance we are providing them has made us well liked by the government and public alike . "  
Opening International Doors : In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , situated on a quiet section of Chieh Shou Rd . , the phones in the international organizations department are constantly ringing , the staff is busily poring through documents , and officials involved in major diplomatic initiatives are streaming in and out , swinging open the thick wooden door .  
But the detailed contents - - whether or not in the future an agency specially responsible for foreign aid will be established , exactly what the foreign aid ratio should be , whether diplomatic or economic considerations should be predominant - - have not yet been determined .  
Those days of Williamsport and the " Triple Crown " surely give us some warm memories : the whole family up in front of the TV in the wee hours of the morning to cheer on the team overseas , watching the children coming through the screen from the other side of the world winning the title " world champions " even as those in Taiwan were straining away to get the economy to take off and the country was meeting diplomatic setbacks in the 1970s - - what adult was n't moved to tears ?  
Especially in 1981 , just three years after the United States broke off diplomatic relations , and with a sensitive atmosphere still lingering two years after the riots of the Kao-hsiung Incident . Although her parents had never filled her with any kind of political consciousness , Hsin Chi-ming had still , from a young age , got a fuzzy stereotyped idea that anyone who had anything to do with the 228 Incident was a thoroughly bad person , so you can imagine how she panicked .  
After the R . O . C . lost its UN seat , its international position gradually became more and more shadowy , as one country after another broke off diplomatic relations , navigational rights were rescinded , the R . O . C . was forced to withdraw from international organizations , and R . O . C . passport holders faced obstacles wherever they went .  
The policy of actively returning houses has only been going on for the past five years . Many overseas Chinese are scattered abroad , and have only heard about the program in a roundabout fashion before coming to investigate . Also , for example , in 1990 after the PRC established diplomatic relations with Indonesia , a large group of overseas Chinese from there came forward to apply . "  
There has never been a case of a country which establishes a public school in a geographic location belonging to a foreign power . And furthermore Taiwan does not have official diplomatic relations with Indonesia . Chaoalso notes that the overseas schools of America and Japan , although partly subsidized by their respective governments , remain nevertheless private schools . "  
Chen Yu-chun , the director of the Institute of American Studies at Chinese Culture University , points out that when the US had formal diplomatic ties and a mutual security treaty with Taiwan , the US stated repeatedly that the treaty applied only to Taiwan and the Pescadores , not to Kinmen and Matsu ( the latter two islands being right on the coast of mainland China , as opposed to the former , which are more distant from the continent ) .  
An incoming middle school teacher earned about NT $ 4000 per month ( or less than US $ 100 at then-current exchange rates ) . It was a time of political and diplomatic crises . President Chiang Kai-shek had died less than a year before ( in April , 1975 ) , and citizens accustomed to following a strong leader were at a loss . With little international room to maneuver following the ROC 's withdrawal from the United Nations , Taiwan 's only asset was economic growth .  
This pragmatic approach may be the model for the future presence in Hong Kong of the countries which maintain diplomatic ties with Taipei . The loss of a major diplomatic partner is a blow to the ROC 's hopes for " dual recognition , " and also reveals the cruel and unsentimental nature of international politics .  
Wang Chen-tai notes that early on there were factional conflicts , reducing the religion 's impact . Fortunately , he says , learned elders like Hsieh Sung-tao and Ting Chung-ming wrote inexhaustibly . Also , because of the importance of diplomatic ties with Islamic countries , the ROC government has strongly supported Muslims . The Taipei mosque , which has been the main spiritual and practical resource for Muslims in Taiwan for many years now , was built with government money in response to strong and far-sighted efforts by Ambassador Yeh Kung-chao .  
The combined effects of ROC foreign policy and cross-strait relations make this stage of ROC foreign relations extremely unusual . How does Chang , an old foreign-affairs hand , who studied international politics and entered the diplomatic corps nearly 30 years ago , and who bears the high expectations of the people , plan to steer the ROC diplomatic ship through these troubled times ?  
Following the economic development of Taiwan 's diplomatic partners , the number of cooperative programs the new Agricultural Technology Missions are involved in has steadily increased . In addition to growing grain and vegetables , the scope of the missions has also come to include animal husbandry work-raising pigs and chickens ; marine technology-fishing techniques and the breeding and raising of marine animals ; handicraft work-bamboo weaving , wood carving ; and such areas of work as flood prevention and water conservation projects among others .  
This building , which is located on Taipei 's Chungshan North Road , was built in 1901 . In the period of Japanese colonial rule it was the US Consulate . After the US and ROC broke off diplomatic relations it was left unattended and after almost two decades of neglect it was in a parlous state , with trees growing through the walls and holes in the roof .  
Through long-term arrangements by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and overseas representative offices , Vice President Lien Chan conducted his second visit to Europe under the low profile of a " holiday " and " private visit . " He made substantive , face-to-face contact with a nation with which the ROC does not have diplomatic ties , and established the critical beginnings of friendship and progressive exchange . The incessant actions of Beijing are additional proof of the barriers which the ROC currently faces in foreign relations .  
The visit has undoubtedly helped to promote a deeper understanding of Taiwan on the other side of the Taiwan Strait . In the midst of these positive signs , however , China surprised Taiwan by resuming diplomatic relations on 23 April with Guinea Bissau . This development was a slap in the face for Taiwan , which has lost diplomatic relations with yet another country . This naked reminder of China 's unflagging campaign to isolate Taiwan internationally makes a mockery of budding hopes for improved cross-strait relations .  
Lee could hardly have told us much of anything new in his memoirs , for he had already devoted a tremendous effort during 30 years in office to the task of recounting the events that preceded the founding of the republic . Furthermore , Singapore has been deeply influenced by its long years under British rule . The Singaporean government maintains copious records concerning all its domestic and foreign affairs . Political statements over the years have drawn upon a large body of diplomatic documents , parliamentary reports , private letters , and government proclamations .  
During Premier Siew 's visit to Belize however , many overseas Chinese reported threats to their personal safety and property , or discrimination when passing through immigration . Premier Siew reported this to Prime Minister Musa , and instructed the ROC embassy to take care of local overseas Chinese . At the same time he emphasized that all embassies and consulates should give equal treatment to Chinese from the mainland in those countries with diplomatic ties to the ROC .  
In 1978 , the legislative elections were canceled after the US announced it would switch diplomatic ties to the PRC . Many in the opposition camp ( represented by the newly published magazine Formosa ) favored working for change through street demonstrations , as opposed to the traditionally safer line of " reform through the system . " On December 10 , 1979 , the Kaohsiung riot occurred , and most of Formosa 's leaders were imprisoned . Democratization and the multi-party system were thus postponed .  
In recent years , all the countries that recognize the ROC have been small and medium-sized developing nations . Many of these nations receive long-term foreign aid , in the form of both technical missions and material assistance . This has resulted in frequent criticism about " checkbook diplomacy . " Since the ROC is an international trading powerhouse with excellent de facto relations with many nations , some people have even wondered why it is necessary to pursue formal diplomatic relations at all .  
The waves stirred up when the ROC established formal ties with the Marshall Islands and Macedonia are but one example of the ROC 's and PRC 's diplomatic wrangling . Yet they illustrate clearly the ROC 's current situation in regard to its allies . The most feasible way for the ROC to maintain or expand the number of nations with which it has formal ties is to engage in an economic - and trade-based diplomacy that provides these nations with Taiwan 's ample experience in economic development .  
This approach of marrying outside capital and technology with the rich local marine resources is one of the more feasible models by which the Taiwanese fishing industry , faced with limited opportunities at home , can develop overseas operations . The RMI , which has just established diplomatic relations with the ROC , is an ideal place for such investment .  
There has also been criticism voiced over the decision-making process . Wei Yung , director of a public policy think tank , contends that the president has neither constitutional nor legal authority to make foreign policy decisions or conduct diplomatic operations . Also , the meeting at which the decision was reached was not a meeting of the National Security Council nor of the Cabinet , so it is uncertain how binding this decision is .  
Taiwan is working hard to attain diplomatic and economic breakthroughs and hoping to gain a deeper understanding of the West . Beset with ethnic and environmental problems , popular culture reigns supreme .  
The Hsinchu Science-Based Industrial Park , which was being planned at that time , included provision for bilingual schools and American-style residential communities . This was also the period when diplomatic ties with the US were cut , which aroused resentment in Taiwan and led some Taiwanese abroad to return home as an expression of solidarity .  
Many Taiwan business people saw the establishment of formal diplomatic relations as a green light for investment in Palau . The foreign ministry delegation that visited Palau in March included private sector firms involved in tourism , textiles , electronics , and fishing , who went to investigate the investment environment .  
While she was in the US , it became clear that the United States would soon sever official diplomatic relations with the Republic of China . This event was to have enormous impact upon Taiwanese politics , and Lu was spurred to get involved in politics herself in order to use political power to correct the ills of society . In order to struggle for women 's rights and democracy , she cut her studies short and returned to Taiwan in 1978 to run for the National Assembly .  
On a large antique-style cabinet in the waiting area , Sung arranged over 20 pieces of Chinese porcelain . These were imitation antiques which he bought in Taiwan 's pottery town of Yingko , but shortly after the restaurant opened they were all stolen by thieves who mistook them for genuine antiques . Convincing imitations Of all the Chinese restaurants Peter Sung has designed , a particular favorite of his is the Tse Yang Restaurant in the diplomatic quarter of Paris , close to the Champs Elysees .  
However , WTO regulations require that exemptions be declared prior to application for entry . Given Taiwan 's current weak diplomatic position , unless the PRC agrees to the exemption , it will be difficult for Taiwan to get the required support of two-thirds of the 137 WTO member states for this escape clause . In sum , Kinmen people remain optimistic that the arguments in favor of the little three links will win out .  
" National sovereignty " is reflected in a country 's ability to engage in diplomatic relations , but in this most critical area for national survival , Taiwan has long been suffering from PRC efforts to undercut Taiwan 's international status . Indeed , as Levi C . Ying , an overseas Chinese legislator from the New Party , says , mainland China is the only real obstacle and enemy to Taiwan 's foreign relations .  
" Although you can argue that it is vital to maintain formal diplomatic relations with as many countries as possible until such time as there is a tacit diplomatic cease-fire with Communist China , today , when Taiwan 's budget faces growing constraints and the island has not yet recovered from the recent earthquake , it is not acceptable for the government to be spreading such a huge amount of money abroad . "  
Lo says that the main countries that will be at the center of future diplomatic work , besides the ROC 's existing diplomatic partners , will be the nations of North America and Europe . " The academic community is a major source of staff people for the executive branch , while congressmen set the direction of legislation and executive officials determine how it is implemented . In the future more emphasis will be placed on contacts at these three levels with European and North American countries , " he says .  
With regard to foreign aid , he said that helping diplomatic partners is Taiwan 's right and also its duty . Though these countries are not rich or powerful , " you ca n't measure everything by the same yardstick . " Though the economies of some diplomatic partners are too weak , and their democracies are immature , Taiwan must be willing to share its experience , in which economic takeoff spurred political democratization , and work together with diplomatic partner states to " stand up and move on out . "  
However , given the trend of globalization of firms , there are growing economic opportunities in ROC diplomatic partner states . New Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi , a successful entrepreneur himself , was a key member of the delegation that accompanied President Chen Shui-bian abroad in mid-August . He devoted particular attention to the local investment climate in each country , and came up with a few suggestions of his own .  
Q : Taiwan firms have always been cooperative , and overseas investment has been very helpful to the ROC 's diplomatic work . But today the government is putting political considerations first in encouraging Taiwan firms to invest in friendly countries . From an economic point of view , how effective is this ?  
Moreover , environmental protection work touches on things like community consciousness , the livelihood of farmers and fishermen , and aboriginal culture . Often the main obstacle to environmental protection work is the attitudes of people who live in the mountains and depend on the resources there . Thus environmental protection is not simply the responsibility of a few social elites , but includes economic , social , transportation , and even diplomatic and political aspects .  
The PRC is reported to be the main cause of the diplomatic rupture . Macedonia has been beset in recent years by both internal and external threats . Fighting connected with the separatist movement in neighboring Kosovo has generated a mass exodus of refugees into Macedonia , while the Macedonian government has been unable to quell a domestic rebellion by ethnic Albanians .  
The situation is also problematic in Africa , another major diplomatic base for Taiwan . Domestic turbulence is rife in Liberia and other countries that maintain formal ties with Taiwan , and see-saw struggles between opposing camps pose a big threat to our diplomatic relations . It is said that diplomacy is the extension of national power .  
In seeking to answer this question , we poured our energies into building our economy , developing the so-called folk literature , and finding strength in the land where we live . In the process , we developed self-confidence . The severing of official diplomatic ties with the US in 1978 left us even further isolated from the international community , but we responded by redoubling our efforts and pulling together . A national consciousness began to take shape .

Regarding the organization and the direction of the Olympic Movement , a pivotal role is being played by His Excellency Mr . Juan Antonio Samaranch , who , through his policy of engaging in personal contacts and through the prestige which he enjoys throughout the world , within the most varied of political and diplomatic circles , has succeeded in making the Olympic Movement an interlocutor of the most representative and the largest world forum , the United Nations .  
Furthermore , Member States ' willingness to assume the onerous responsibilities inherent in permanent membership of the Security Council , and thereby bolster its capacity to fulfil its mandate , should have been convincingly demonstrated by their contributions to the promotion of regional peace and global security through successful diplomatic initiatives in the prevention and resolution of conflicts , as well as by participation in peace-keeping operations over a period of time .  
An extremely able and activist Secretary-General ` s Special Representative was supported by a well-organized and tightly coordinated donor community willing to apply leverage at key points , by intense diplomatic activity on the scene by a handful of influential countries with long-standing relations with the parties , and by a strong and supportive community of non-governmental organizations .

Beyond these diplomatic efforts at the international level , however , the most critical requirement is for the parties directly concerned to bridge the political chasm by engaging in candid and open-minded dialogue .

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation requests the heads of diplomatic missions and the representatives of international and non-governmental organizations to report objectively about what they have seen to the Governments , nations or organizations that they represent and give them an accurate account of what is taking place in Burundi : recognized crimes against innocent populations , women , children and defenceless patients can not be mistaken for a struggle for democracy or the liberation of an ethnic group , or presented simply as inter-ethnic confrontation or fighting between the army and the rebels .  
Iraq also submitted several requests to the Committee with regard to the partial release of its frozen assets for various purposes , such as paying its dues to international organizations , including the United Nations , financing the publication of the Holy Koran in Iraq , covering the cost of its pilgrimage programmes , meeting legal expenses for court actions outside the country , maintaining Iraq 's diplomatic missions abroad and purchasing humanitarian and other supplies from other countries .

The veto power , flawed in principle as it was and remains , may have had a useful purpose during the cold war era , but with the improved international environment and , indeed , the increase of diplomatic avenues to resolve differences , the continued existence of the veto is as undemocratic as it is irrelevant .  
Such prohibitions , whether they involved the principle of non-use of force ( subpara . ( a ) ) , avoiding extreme political or economic coercion ( subpara . ( b ) ) , respect for the inviolability of diplomatic or consular agents , premises , archives and documents ( subpara .

Moreover , and this point has been stressed by several speakers today , the experience of the Tribunal for Rwanda , like the experience of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia , is to be considered as one of the key elements for the future establishment of a permanent international criminal court , a project that is well under way and for which Italy has offered to host , in 1998 , a diplomatic conference to adopt a statute for such a court .

the three topics mentioned in paragraph 249 of the Commission 's report - diplomatic protection ; ownership of wrecks ; and unilateral acts of States - should be topics of study , although he did not agree with the views outlined in note 9 of addendum 2 of the annexes , since the jurisdiction of the coastal State beyond its territorial sea and contiguous zone was guaranteed by the residual competence granted to it under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea .  
Moreover , at a time of increasing demand but decreasing resources within the United Nations for international action , the potential of regional groups to contribute political , diplomatic , financial , material and military resources has taken on even greater importance .

Apart from this lacuna in humanitarian law ( which can be remedied by the application of the doctrine of state responsibility with regard to breaches of jus cogens rules ) , it is apparent that assertive international diplomatic measures are required to ensure that territorial settlements which prohibit forcible transfers of population and the implantation of settlers are respected by the parties to the agreements .  
The International Monitoring Committee to supervise the implementation of the Bangui Agreements , acting on behalf of MISAB and / or on its own behalf , maintains regular contacts with international organizations , including UNDP and foreign diplomatic missions based in Bangui , with a view to requesting their diplomatic , financial and material support for mediation initiatives in the Central African Republic .

However , the United Nations faced a choice between the widespread use of economic , diplomatic and other sanctions as a standard approach to the conduct of international relations , and their more considered use in exceptionally serious circumstances , when they would be applied in a spirit of openness for a fixed , renewable period to achieve results clearly identified in advance .  
I also take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the entire international community for their immense political , diplomatic and material support to Sierra Leone , and to my Government and people in these difficult times .  
During the discussion , it was stated that machinery should be established that does not require diplomatic action , that sufficient publicity should be given to existing means of defence and that closed investigations should be made public or open so that they will be more effective .  
This is a test of our collective responsibility , made even more pressing by the terrible massacres that have characterized recent ethnic conflicts , and Italy confirms its strong support , pledges its active contribution to this endeavour , and is prepared to host in Rome the diplomatic conference to adopt the statute for the international criminal court .

I am convinced that your rich and profound experience in diplomatic relations , together with your personal qualities , will facilitate the constructive work of this General Assembly session and make it an outstanding international event .  
Our own position , as presented to the Council in the open debate that took place on 21 May under the presidency of the Republic of Korea , can be summarized as follows : if the Security Council is to be expected to play a more active role in guaranteeing safe conditions for humanitarian assistance , our preference is for such endeavours to be attempted in parallel with multilaterally defined diplomatic agendas and within the realm of the possibilities offered by Chapter VI that of the pacific settlement of disputes .  
However , we believe it is fitting to express our thanks for the support and cooperation of the United Nations , the friendly countries that directly supported the peace processes in Guatemala , Nicaragua and El Salvador , and the cooperating community , whose technical and financial assistance complemented the political and diplomatic efforts to achieve peace in the region .  
The promotion of the Portuguese language , spoken today by more than 200-million people , the new modalities of institutional cooperation which have been established and the coordination of the diplomatic and political positions of the founder countries in the many international forums involved , have made this organization , despite its youth , an attentive participant within the international community .  The problems associated with the many components of the drug phenomenon are among the biggest challenges faced by our societies today .  
At the same tie , however , the legitimate wishes of many States to combat international terrorism were being held hostage by the double standards of powerful countries that preached against terrorism even as they impeded the negotiations on the draft Convention on the matter with all the diplomatic means and political pressure at their disposal , thus blocking the adoption of the clear and all-inclusive definition of terrorism that was needed and an unequivocal and impartial condemnation . 
With regard to diplomatic protection by international organizations , her delegation believed that since the number of international , regional and governmental organizations had grown immensely in the past decade , the functional diplomatic protection of those organizations formed an important part of contemporary diplomatic protection .  
At least at the current stage of the Commissions work on the topic , the functional protection extended by international organizations towards their agents should be considered along with diplomatic protection per se , since the initial results would supply the clarification needed for the subsequent adoption of a final decision on the inclusion of functional protection .  
The agreed conclusions on women in power and decision-making placed an emphasis on conflict resolution , peace and security matters , and the promotion of gender balance at all levels of national diplomatic service , including the ambassadorial level . 4 For example , Governments and the United Nations system were called upon to promote women 's active and equal participation as governmental and non-governmental representatives , special rapporteurs and envoys in all of their initiatives and activities , including as mediators for peacekeeping and peace-building . 
In fact , it should be evident that in our forum , political realism and a diplomatic approach constitute the fundamental essence of any aim and , consequently it would be advisable , albeit without denying the full respect of each national position , that adequate room be left for a free comparison of different theses in order to find a minimum common denominator on which the best solution for the successful attainment of our endeavours can be arrived at . 
The Ministers acknowledged the actions undertaken by the organs of the Community to implement the decisions and recommendations that had emanated from the Conference of Heads of State and Government and from the Council of Ministers , in conformity with the general guidelines contained in the Constitutive Declaration and the Statutes , in order to promote cooperation in the cultural , economic , social , scientific and legal / institutional fields , as well as to enhance political and diplomatic coordination .

The International Monitoring Committee to supervise the implementation of the Bangui Agreements , acting on behalf of MISAB and / or on its own behalf , maintains regular contacts with international organizations , including UNDP and foreign diplomatic missions based in Bangui , with a view to requesting their diplomatic , financial and material support for mediation initiatives in the Central African Republic .  
In the light of these facts , the Government of Cuba issued a denunciation , through the diplomatic channel , with a view to alerting the international community and international public opinion to what it considered to be a new campaign , developed in complete silence and complicity and aimed at tightening even further the iron-clad and criminal economic , commercial and blockade which the United States has maintained against Cuba for 37 years . 
The few cases where licences have been granted to supply certain drugs , under the sponsorship of the International Committee of the Red Cross or a diplomatic mission , have been handled on an individual basis , and not for the whole shipment but for partial shipments , after a complex and lengthy process lasting on average about seven months , which has discouraged the initiative of some organizations that were planning to donate medicine to Cuban hospitals .

In accordance with that objective , Mexican diplomatic and consular offices have a set of legal powers under both domestic and international law for carrying out their protective functions .

A long-standing request for an additional airport permit , required to collect the diplomatic pouch , was granted to an international driver during the reporting period , bringing the total of such permits held to two .  
The remark was also made that the topic of diplomatic protection involved a series of complicated theoretical and practical questions and had an unfortunate history , having been regarded as an extension of colonial power or a system imposed by powerful States on weak States .  
The view was also expressed that international human rights instruments limited the scope of national jurisdiction by guaranteeing uniform standards of protection , whereas diplomatic protection functioned exclusively in relations between States and after domestic remedies had been exhausted .  
Moreover , juridical bodies for the protection of human rights , unlike those concerned with diplomatic protection , were well established in both the internal legal order and the international system ; that was a matter that the Commission should consider .  
As a future venue and a focal point for the Mine Ban Convention and the various activities in the field of mine action that it will produce , Geneva would offer a wide variety of diplomatic and technical expertise , a broad representation of diplomatic missions and humanitarian agencies and relevant non _ governmental organizations , including ICRC , WHO , UNHCR and the newly established Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining .  
I would emphasize here , without wanting to be too critical , an occasional lack of understanding in the implementation of adopted policies ; a pernicious role played by local personnel ; supporters of those in power being recruited by the international organizations ; a perceived lack of sensitivity on the part of those who were in charge of certain political and diplomatic aspects ; and perhaps too frequent personnel turnover .  
There is an impressive amount of expert knowledge and diplomatic skills concentrated in this room , and time and again our deliberations , which approach the subject matter from different , even opposing , viewpoints , have produced new and valuable insights and helped to clarify and develop national positions in no insignificant way .
