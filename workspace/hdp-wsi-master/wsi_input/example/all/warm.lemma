Gbeho ( Ghana ) : I am happy and privileged to participate in this crucial Security Council debate on the situation in Africa , and I wish to begin by joining in the warm sentiments expressed to you , Sir , and to other members of the Council by previous speakers .  I must also highly commend the Secretary-General for the comprehensive progress report ( S / 1999 / 1008 ) on the implementation of the recommendations contained in his earlier report ( S / 1998 / 318 ) .  
This public meeting is an ideal opportunity for my delegation to pay a warm tribute to the Special Representative , all the staff of UNTAET and all the Members of the East Timor Transitional Administration for the steps they have taken in the political process leading to the national and international sovereignty of East Timor and the emergence of an independent East Timorese Government .  
While warm thanks were due to the Government of Germany for its growing understanding of the needs of the UNFCCC secretariat and to the City of Bonn for its unfailing hospitality , he believed that the over-all United Nations presence in Bonn had not yet reached the critical mass of activity that would provide an attractive base for career development and allow United Nations institutions to recruit , motivate and retain competent staff .
