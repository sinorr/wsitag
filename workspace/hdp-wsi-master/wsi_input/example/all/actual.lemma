Company officials feel that another important reason that returned students left the company is because they " failed to perform well . " According to one high level manager at Nan Ya Plastics , the professional knowledge and ability the returned students possessed were very good , but " studying is one thing and actual work is another . " The failure to perform well hurt their prospects for promotion and the returning students themselves lost interest and were not willing to stay on .  
We should accelerate the implementation of the reforms initiated by late Chairman Chiang Ching-kuo with an even more active and responsible attitude . From central to local government , from representative bodies to the administrative agencies , all should make a thorough self-review , based on actual needs , and strengthen and improve where required , to fortify the substance and function of democracy .  
Because of many years of a stable social environment and many years in the role of ruling party , a trend of " party bureaucratization " was inevitably formed . From now on , we must choose cadres from among the general public , and evaluate cadres on the basis of their actual service work , correct misconceptions on the part of cadres , and set cadres with incorrect attitudes straight .  
And if you make windfall profits on speculation , then that 's just smart planning . " But the two main public policies for returning price rises to the public - - buying land up according to assessed value and taxes , also based on assessed value - - are not able to fulfill their function because of the huge gap between the standard - - assessed prices - - and the actual market prices .  
Chung Chin explains that she used data for 1991 because it made calculations relatively simple . In 1991 the PRC was strongly encouraging foreign firms to go all out to export goods and earn foreign exchange , and Taiwan firms were given little access to the domestic market . Therefore using total Taiwanese investment in the economic formula to calculate the contribution made to mainland Chinese exports would give a close approximation to the actual figure .  
Because economic activity was more vigorous at the beginning of 1994 than had been expected , many international economic institutions revised their mid-year estimates of total growth for 1994 upward , yet " actual growth was higher than even the revised estimates . "  
When the various conflicts surrounding the health insurance system became a hot topic of discussion , most people probably overlooked one basic fact : The universal health care plan is actually only a financial design , and its goal is to eliminate " loss and waste " from the vast health care system . As for actual medical service , one still must look to the same health care network of medical centers and personnel that is already in place .  
That 's why it is necessary to have reserve electric power . But many scholars believe that Taiwan has always had adequate electrical power capacity . The problem lies in management shortcomings at Taipower . For example , poor maintenance and an excessive shutdown rate lower electrical supply , creating a situation in which actual supply can not meet the demands of users , thus creating the need for occasional rationing .  
After having seen many such examples , NGO leaders are not unaware that criticizing is easier than doing the actual work . " The government is n't going to ask me to come serve in the public sector . If they did ask me , I 'm afraid it would n't be easy to do a good job , " admits one leader of an educational reform group . Once he switched roles from offense to defense , it would also be hard for him to escape " being vulnerable to attack . "  
As Chinese know from their own books , " The Chinese armed forces held Shanghai amidst bitter fighting from August to November , and even then the Japanese were unable to completely rout the Chinese . " But in the relevant Japanese film , the viewer only gets two images - - " Fighting has spread to Shanghai , where our forces are heavily engaged , " and " Valiant naval airmen who gave their lives " - - that gloss right over actual events .  
But most of them filled up as soon as they were built , and " almost the only one still functioning as a silt trap is the Junghua Dam , " says Chen Hsin-hsiung . Scholars estimate that the 133-meter-high Shihmen Dam has an actual depth of water today of less than 40 meters , and the effective storage capacity above the dam 's outlet is less than half its original size . The torrential rain of tropical rainstorms washes the upstream sand and gravel over the silt traps , through the reservoir and down to the plains .  
However , because these organizations are all run by private individuals or civic groups , and are constantly being changed in response to social problems , to date no complete statistical survey has been done which would accurately reflect the actual resources which can be provided by Taiwan 's halfway houses .  
The average political commentators at the time seemed to be engaged in political discourse , admonishing the leaders of the country and serving as a mouthpiece for the people but , in actual fact , they were passing judgment based on some simple Confucian ideas of morality .  
However , many artists are unwilling to let this 800-year-old Chinese folk tradition wither and die . In 1985 the Council for Cultural Planning and Development began an annual competition to select the best New Year 's prints . Each year many creative submissions combining tradition and contemporary styles are received , reflecting today 's actual mass culture .  
Of course , there is much in these " new age " books that looks ridiculous , that is mere wishful thinking , or that is just opinion . But they make apparent the great desire of human beings to seek truth , goodness , and knowledge . People have always been dissatisfied with , dubious about , or willing to challenge actual experience , and have sought a better world .  
In making these works of art , one must use the exact same materials for the exterior and interior that would be used in making an actual architectural structure . The piano inside Rose Mansion is made of the same materials as a real piano , and the oil painting was carefully painted by an artist who made constant reference to the original painting . Even the trivets on the tabletops are made of real porcelain and stoneware !  
But it is only actual governing that tests one 's true staying power . Scholars have stated that the 2000 election in Taiwan has three special characteristics : For one thing , this is the first time the opposition has a very real possibility of taking the reins of government . Secondly , the three leading candidates are so close it is impossible to tell who will win . And third , whatever the outcome , this is the beginning of Taiwan 's post-strongman era .  
This naturally makes local governments very reliant upon , and vulnerable to control by , the central government . Although the actual amount of the tax redistribution is limited , local governments have to shoulder most of the burden of maintaining infrastructure , social services , education , cultural activities , and more . Local finances are very strained as a result .  
For instance , the course content offered by his college 's Graduate Institute of Technology and Innovation Management is only suitable for postgraduate work . " But due to the regulations imposed by the Ministry of Education , if you set up only a graduate school the educational resources available from the government do not compare with those for a combined undergraduate department and graduate school . " Wu says that this results in institutions having to make a choice between " actual need " and " winning more resources . "  
Information sent on wireless communication systems , including mobile phone platforms , satellite TV , and broadband Internet access , may very well be in a digital format , but in the actual process of transmission , the data must first be converted using an analog transponder from digital to mid frequency signals , and thereafter be switched to high frequency . Only in this way can it get on to the high frequency information superhighway . When it arrives at the receiving end , it must go through the same steps in reverse .  
In fact , Taiwan Advocates was established in response to President Chen 's idea of a trans-party " national security alliance , " bringing together many political figures as well as social and academic elites . Taiwan Advocates aims to be " the brains of the national security alliance , " and also to link together different political forces in the Legislative Yuan . Taiwan Advocates has held few public activities , so its actual impact remains to be seen .  
The e-Generation 's predilection for image-based reasoning is causing their patience for serious reading and logical writing to gradually erode . Their writing is incoherent and even in spoken language they show a tendency towards the abbreviated , partially formed language favored by commercials ; in the end , their actual meaning evaporates in a flash of fragmented information .  
Chen feels that leaving white space is more difficult to master than the actual artwork , because all that space can easily end up looking excessive , or even downright vacant . That is why he is so careful about blank space . Besides , white and black are two of his favorite colors .  
In a coffee shop smelling of stale cigarette smoke and pipe tobacco , Lin reflects on his new film . Not only was it the most expensive of all his previous works , but the actual filming was also the most painstaking . Each day , as work began , two to three hours were spent on setting up lighting alone , in an attempt to bring out the essence of middle-class urban life . The Cruise of Robinson portrays a real-estate agent who makes his home in a hotel .  
The dialogue in Hero was superficial and too modern sounding , and the film laid greater emphasis on form than the actual storyline . Moreover , director Zhang Yimou overextended himself attempting to confine so heavy and broad a theme within a two-hour format . As a result , the entire story comes off as a stiff and unnatural . Lacking in vitality , the characters are merely functional .  
" When the sky lanterns themselves only account for 5% of an NT $ 6 million budget , I think the organizers are leaning in the wrong direction , " says Hu Min-shih . Adding singing and dancing may make the celebration more festive , but Hu wishes that the responsible county agencies would spend more on the actual construction and release of sky lanterns , since they are after all the true leading lights of the festival .  
It is a great pity , but as the number of graduation credits required to graduate from the vocational system has declined over the years , and with no rules indicating the minimum number of credits to be earned from practical work , related classes have come under pressure . As a result , many private schools have chosen to cut subjects that involve physical work or extra financing , which ensures students are given fewer and fewer opportunities to familiarize themselves with actual physical operations .  
Wen Shih-jen , deputy CEO of computer manufacturer Inventec , has likened the importance of cooperation between technical and vocational education and industry to laying the " last mile " in establishing the Internet : " The final section needed to ensure the Internet is linked with actual users is known as the ' last mile . ' Without this section users would be unable to get online and the Internet would be a wasted opportunity . "  
" They are always so happy , though , just because I 'm doing the shopping and preparing meals for them , " Day says . Filial piety is n't difficult ; one just needs to cater to another 's pleasures . His father , for example , loves to eat a traditional salted pork dish , so Day practiced until he learned the techniques for making it , mastering each step , from choosing the right cut of meat to the actual cooking and dressing of the meat .  
the session decided to approve the inclusion of the project in the ten year program for national economic and social development , and authorize the state council to carry it out at an appropriate time , in light of the actual development of the national economy and the country 's financial and material force  
The collector system , to be operational in a highpressure and lowtemperature environment while operating on soil of poor strength , demands special equipment components and material which need to be tested in the actual deep seabed environment .  
The development of an integrated mining system that would be operational in an actual deep seabed environment on a sustained basis is demanding both in terms of time and effort and requires substantial financial inputs .  
In section three , the actual and prospective development opportunities are considered , especially those that accrue from expanded and more effective regional cooperative and integration arrangements in selected key areas .  
With a downward trend in global military spending and an increased reliance upon lighter arms in situations of actual conflict , the technological base for more sophisticated weapon systems is getting narrower .  
The first involved more efficient prevention , especially to address the problems of victims of internal conflicts , actual or potential victims of the situation in States that have recently emerged from authoritarian rule , and citizens of developing countries in flight from inhuman poverty or socio-economic instability .  
Our people find it astonishing that in an era of such developed mass communication , which leaves no distance between different corners of the globe , the apparently insurmountable difficulties in particular , the actual causes of the continuing imposed war are not understood .  
Owing to insufficient consultations and negotiations at the Conference , reasonable views and opinions of some States that have major interests in marine fisheries failed to be duly reflected in relevant provisions .  The actual implementation of these Articles may encounter many difficulties and may increase the differences and disputes between States with conflicting interests .  
Only consistent respect for the right of free choice can ensure that the new or modified arrangements will be tailored to respond to the actual security needs and genuinely shared common interests .  
The participation of youth groups in gathering environmental data and in understanding ecological systems and actual environmental action should be encouraged as a means of improving both their knowledge of the environment and their personal engagement in caring for the environment .  
The participation of youth groups in gathering environmental data and in understanding ecological systems and actual environmental action should be encouraged as a means of improving both their knowledge of the environment and their personal engagement in caring for the environment .  3 .  Strengthening participation of youth in the protection ,  
It is recommended that the reports should not be confined to mere lists of legal instruments adopted in the country concerned in recent years but should also include information indicating how these legal instruments are reflected in the actual economic , political and social realities and general conditions existing in the country .  
We can , however , agree to the six-month initial period proposed in the current draft , but only on the understanding that the United Nations is not about to terminate its presence in Angola after only six months , rather , that it is prepared to undertake additional periods of extension , based on actual performance , to enable the political process to take root .  
The Committee suggests that the State party take steps to ensure the effective coordination between the existing institutions involved in the areas of human rights and children 's rights with a view to establishing a monitoring mechanism for the implementation of the Convention at the national , regional and local levels , which may assess the actual situation of children and narrow the gap between the law and its practice .  
The travel of international civilian personnel to the mission area has been calculated at an average cost of $ 5,800 per person per round-trip ( basic air fare $ 3,500 and 100 kilograms of unaccompanied baggage $ 2,300 ) , based on actual recent expenditures .  
National legal systems allowing for punitive or exemplary damages usually do so only where there has been a deliberate misdeed or gross negligence ; in such cases , the proper course of action for the Organization would be to bring disciplinary charges against the offending staff member or recovery action from him or her of the damages paid by the Organization for the actual loss suffered by the victim . 
A proposal be considered by the General Assembly to reimburse the actual cost of inland transportation of major equipment from its normal operating location to an agreed port of embarkation , subject to the presentation of validated claims ;  
When the United Nations is unable to provide accommodation to an equivalent standard and the unit rents a suitable structure , the unit will be reimbursed the actual rental cost on a bilateral special case arrangement between the troop-contributing country and the United Nations .  
Periodic internal reports have been instituted for the following items , as stated in paragraph 59 of document DP / 1995 / 33 : income and expenditure including administrative costs ( monthly ) ; outstanding advances to executing agencies ( monthly ) ; resource availability by source of funds ; current and future commitments ; pledges ; actual contributions and receivables by source of funds , donor and by projects ( quarterly ) .  
Comparisons of findings with written texts and subsequent modifications to the texts based on the students ' individual and collective experiences with the actual situations not only encourage reality-based interaction with those outside the school environment , but also encourage students to treat texts as modifiable entities instead of final authorities .  
The realization at the political and decision-making level of the actual magnitude and complexity of organized transnational crime may serve as a basis for elaborating improved forms of international cooperation , drawing on the pool of knowledge and experience in the scientific community .  
National legal systems allowing for punitive or exemplary damages usually do so only where there has been a deliberate misdeed or gross negligence ; in such cases , the proper course of action for the Organization would be to bring disciplinary charges against the offending staff member or recovery action from him or her of the damages paid by the Organization for the actual loss suffered by the victim . 
And to offer it as evidence of a global-level saving shortage , one would have to calculate a global real interest rate that embodied the expectations of inflation in a variety of currencies over an indefinite future , and would also have to take account of actual interest rates in each of the relevant markets : all in all , a formidable research task .  
The Committee welcomes the financial management model of UNOPS by which administrative expenditures are planned and monitored based on a continuous review of the demand for services , as well as the actual programme delivery figures and resulting support income earned ;  
This crisis has two sides : the negative one , which brought the war with all its repercussions , and the other side , which forced international public opinion and world diplomacy to accept some of the fundamental causes of the crisis of the Balkans , be they historical or actual , as well as the main party responsible for this crisis , that is the Serbs , with their medieval policy in the Balkans .  
Upon inquiry , however , the Committee was informed that , based on past experience , it was expected that the actual ratio of recurrent administrative costs to the actual total pensionable remuneration would be in the neighbourhood of 0.18 per cent of the pensionable remuneration , in line with the provision estimated for administrative costs in the actuarial valuation of the Fund since the 1986 valuation .  
NULLThe participation of youth groups in gathering environmental data and in understanding ecological systems and actual environmental action should be encouraged as a means of improving both their knowledge of the environment and their personal engagement in caring for the environment .  
The actual size of the two buildings and the link is evident from the south , where sweeping reinforced concrete piers buttress the buildings set diagonally into the steeply sloping hillside .  
The travel of international civilian personnel to the mission area has been calculated at an average cost of $ 5,800 per person per round trip ( basic air fare $ 3,500 and 100 kilograms of unaccompanied baggage ( $ 2,300 ) ) , based on actual recent expenditures .  
The participation of youth groups in gathering environmental data and in understanding ecological systems and actual environmental action should be encouraged as a means of improving both their knowledge of the environment and their personal engagement in caring for the environment .  
Upon inquiry , the Committee was informed that contractual arrangements with the military supplier of helicopters proved to be more economical than budgeted ; instead of contracting for a minimum number of hours per month , plus making provisions for additional hours , payments were made on the basis of actual helicopter hours used . 
The revised annex 6 was amended , limiting the testing of the system to include only the functional and performance tests and deleting the final acceptance tests originally provided for ( i.e . to run the system under actual operating conditions for a minimum of 60 days ) ;  
The Advisory Committee was informed , upon inquiry , that the revised requirements for contractual services of $ 8.3-million , which reflects a decrease of $ 11.7-million compared with the original estimates of $ 20.0-million , are based on the actual terms of the contract signed in July 1995 between the United Nations and the logistic support services contractor .

The civil service is trying to provide specific answers to this popular concern through transparent processes that are available to ordinary citizens , who in this way can find out not only how , why and for what purpose a particular civil servant was hired , but also how much this costs the State and , above all , what that person 's actual contribution is in measurable terms of quantity , quality and cost-effectiveness .  
This commitment must be proven by the actual , unconditional implementation of all relevant agreements thus far concluded , to enable the Palestinian people to exercise their legitimate rights , including their right to self-determination and to the establishment of their own independent State , with Jerusalem as its capital .  
Provision of adequate social services and facilities , improving and rationalizing urban planning and shelter design to cope firmly with the actual needs of communities , as well as provision of technical and other relevant assistance to the inhabitants of unplanned settlements are essential for the improvement of living conditions .  
An explicit admission of the right of passage for space objects , as long as the passage is innocent , i.e . not prejudicial to the peace , good order or security of the subjacent States , and a more detailed regulation of the exercise of this right should be considered as a way for legalization of the actual practice .  
It is recommended that the reports not be confined to mere lists of legal instruments adopted in the country concerned in recent years , but should also include information indicating how those legal instruments are reflected in the actual economic , political and social realities and general conditions existing in the country .  
Therefore , even if the formula percentage can be revised upwards sufficiently at this time to generate enough income for the support account to finance the estimated expenditure requirements for backstopping for the 12-month period from 1 July 1996 , it is the Secretary-General \ x { e5b8 } conclusion that based on past experience it has been clearly demonstrated that the current funding methodology does not reflect the actual backstopping capacity required and does not provide an adequate and predictable annual level of resources to meet the minimum backstopping requirements at Headquarters .  
Review and approval of the budgetary requirements for backstopping activities at Headquarters in subsequent years would be based on actual workload experience of the backstopping requirements of the prior year and projected workload for the next year , taking into account the number , scope , scale and complexity of active , completed and closed peace-keeping missions supported .  
The former involves the need to clarify and strengthen the relationship between existing international instruments or agreements in the field of environment and relevant social and economic agreements or instruments ; the latter , the aim of identifying and preventing , or resolving , where necessary , actual or potential conflicts , particularly between environmental and social / economic agreements or instruments , with a view to ensuring that such agreements or instruments are consistent .  
That has required close coordination of macroeconomic policies among major industrial countries to prevent the harmful effects on national economies of any adverse market reactions to actual or perceived changes in national economic situations and associated policies . 
Japan is of the view that , although it is necessary to consider the formulation of extensive and comprehensive measures , including the preparation of legal norms , in order to standardize the systems of Member States against organized crime , it hardly appears that there is currently an adequate common understanding among Member States regarding the actual pattern of illegal activity in question .  
Other representatives stated that the congresses on the prevention of crime and the treatment of offenders , the status of which had been modified since they had begun acting as consultative body to the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme , should henceforth be better able to respond to the actual needs of Member States , but should nevertheless not fail to set precise objectives and reduce the number of resolutions adopted .  
" Linearity " ( usually measured in terms of non-linearity ) : maximum deviation of the actual characteristic ( average of upscale and downscale readings ) , positive or negative , from a straight line so positioned as to equalize and minimize the maximum deviations .  
In Kuwait , although actual oil revenues were about 25 per cent higher than projected , and expenditures about 15 per cent lower than their planned level , the budget deficit remained sizeable in fiscal year 1995 / 96 , owing mainly to supplementary allocations for autonomous governmental institutions .  
It may be noted that , at this stage , the average for the first four months of the biennium shows no variance between the actual and budgeted exchange rates for the largest currency involved ( Swiss franc ) vis - - vis the United States dollar but , as at the current date , that currency has significantly weakened relative to the dollar , a situation which , if it continues during the remaining course of the biennium , would be a positive factor .  
The Executive Board also decided that the allocation of resources should be based on a comprehensive assessment of the actual needs and requirements of countries , and should take fully into consideration coherent national programmes , plans and strategies on population and development and the need for external resources to complement national financial efforts in the area of population and development ; and endorsed the procedure for categorization of countries into three groups as outlined in the report and approved the relative shares of resources among them .  
It is recommended that the reports not be confined to mere lists of legal instruments adopted in the country concerned in recent years , but should also include information indicating how those legal instruments are reflected in the actual economic , political and social realities and general conditions existing in the country .  
Accordingly , with the aim of reconciling potential or actual conflicts in the event of the development of multiple uses and of providing for the optimum rational development of a common source to the benefit of each State in whose territory any part of the system is situated , it has become necessary to focus on the question of the concept of the drainage basin .  
Moreover , since there were wide variations in the actual vacancy rates in different duty stations , and the standard cost of each post differed in terms of post adjustment and the percentage attributable to common staff costs , the Board considered that the adoption of a uniform vacancy rate for formulation of budgetary proposals for staff costs was likely to give rise to significant inaccuracies ( A / 51 / 5 ( Vol . I ) , sect .  
Much more information is needed regarding the actual and potential costs on various alternative routes available to the Central Asian republics as a basis for regional and national decisions on transport priorities for investment in infrastructure , technical assistance , training , better management and improved cooperative arrangements .  More precise information , available to all parties , would result in far more effective cooperation concerning rates and conditions on existing or proposed alternative routes .  
The greatest pay-off in terms of increases in efficiency and lowered real costs of transport is likely to come about from a full-scale effort to improve a whole range of institutional , procedural , regulatory , managerial and other non-physical aspects of vital importance to the actual movement of goods to and from markets in the region or abroad .  
The sanctions secretariat has established working contacts and elaborated practical modalities for cooperation with other parts of the Secretariat , relevant programmes and agencies of the United Nations system and international financial institutions in order to provide better information and early assessments about the actual or potential effects of sanctions on third States .  
Although the Special Envoy received commitments from all the parties to attend talks , the new political environment resulting from developments in March-April ( presidential and legislative elections in the Sudan ; realignment of certain southern movements with the Government ) prevented their actual resumption owing to the absence of recognized , legitimate interlocutors among the parties concerned .  
For this reason , ACC considers that the existing daily subsistence allowance system should be maintained , as the proposed actual expense-based system of travel subsistence would contradict the system-wide emphasis on simplification of travel and other administrative procedures and would require that considerable additional administrative costs be devoted to checking the relevant documentary evidence .  
The press information officers , as well as many local staff members in the area of operation were exposed to actual or potential emergency situations and the need to assist and rehabilitate them in dealing with the after-effects of traumatic and stressful security-related experiences , in particular the incident in Qana village on 18 April , should not be overlooked .  NULLFinally , UNIFIL continued to make every effort to ensure security and protection of its staff :  
The recommendation in paragraph 50 of the Committee 's report , to the effect that in future scales of assessment , all Member States whose share of adjusted national income was less than the current floor of 0.01 per cent should be assessed at their actual share of adjusted income , subject to a minimum rate of 0.001 per cent , should be implemented as soon as possible .  
With regard to the minimum rate of assessment , Viet Nam supported the recommendation of the Committee on Contributions that in future scales of assessments all Member States whose share of adjusted national income was less than the current floor of 0.01 per cent should be assessed at their actual share of adjusted income , subject to a minimum assessment rate of 0.001 per cent , in order to reduce the number of developing countries affected .  
With regard to the requirement for a certified copy of the decision opening the foreign proceeding , the concern was expressed that the use of such an expression might exclude those cases in which the foreign representative was appointed , or the proceedings were commenced , without an actual decision or order of the court ( e.g . , by right pursuant to statutory authority , such as in a debtor-initiated voluntary proceeding ) .  
For that period the General Assembly had appropriated a total amount of $ 11,948,718 gross and the actual expenditure had been $ 9,978,000 gross : the unencumbered balance of $ 1,970,718 gross had resulted from a number of factors , in particular the release of fixed-wing aircraft earlier than had been anticipated , and savings on civilian personnel costs owing mainly to the fact that the vacancy rate had been higher than expected . 
It is acknowledged that the Fund of UNDCP requires an operating reserve to ensure the financial viability and integrity of the Fund and to cover : downward fluctuations or shortfalls in resources ; uneven cash flows ; increases in actual costs as compared with planning estimates or fluctuations in delivery ; and contingencies such as final expenditure ( including liquidating liabilities ) and unforeseen needs which may arise .  
Special attention will be paid to measures designed to improve the whole range of institutional , procedural , regulatory managerial and other non-physical aspects of vital importance to the actual movement of goods .  
Although the sciences of biology and law seem far apart and unrelated , being regarded as two distinct cultures , in actual fact the concerns of law are closely interlinked with those of biology , particularly after the tremendous achievements made by biological science in the modification , removal and replacement of human genes and the positive or negative improvement of offspring .  
The Panel emphasized that assessment of the actual and potential conditions of all types of forests is an [ essential ] [ important ] basis for sustainable forest management , and for a wide range of considerations related to forests [ and forest ecosystems ] at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
Upon enquiry , however , the Advisory Committee was informed that , based on past experience , it was expected that the actual ratio of recurrent administrative costs to the actual total pensionable remuneration would be in the neighbourhood of 0.18 per cent of the pensionable remuneration , in line with the provision estimated for administrative costs in the actuarial valuation of the Fund since the 1986 valuation .  
The representative of UNEP informed the Committee that the projected expenditures for 1998-1999 under those objects were based on anticipated contributions of $ 75-million , as approved by the Governing Council at its nineteenth session , while the amounts indicated under the same objects for 1996-1997 were based on reduced actual contributions amounting to $ 62.5-million .  
The press information officers , as well as many local staff members in the area of operation , were exposed to actual or potential emergency situations and the need to assist and rehabilitate them in dealing with the after-effects of traumatic and stressful security-related experiences , in particular the incident in Qana village on 18 April , should not be overlooked .  
While there has been an increased recognition of the importance of science and a considerable increase in international planning and coordination to provide the scientific basis for sustainable development , the actual amount of money being spent on scientific activities in a majority of both developing and developed countries has declined since 1992 .  
In actual fact the authorities were combating the development of a militant Sikh terrorist movement campaigning for a separate and autonomous Sikh state , which had first appeared in 1978 ; it was financed by the Sikh diaspora ( and even by Pakistan ) and was using religion to secure the support of Sikhs and as an easy means of whipping up their passions in favour of a purely political cause .  
The objectives of the work programme are , first , to promote the positive effects and mitigate the negative impacts of agricultural practices on biological diversity in agro-ecosystems and their interface with other ecosystems ; second , to promote the conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources of actual or potential value for food and agriculture ; and third , to promote the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources .  
Assessment of the actual and potential conditions of all types of forests is central to sustainable forest management and to a wide range of other considerations related to forests and forest ecosystems at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
In some cases , the allocation for TCDC is not separately identified from the budgetary allocation for the overall operations of the national focal point as an agency of the Government , and since there may not be a detailed system of accounting , it is difficult to determine how much is being dedicated to the actual promotion of TCDC .  
The view was expressed that in view of the special characteristics of the geostationary orbit , there was a need to establish a sui generis legal regime for regulating access to and use of that orbit , which was a limited natural resource , and that such a regime should guarantee actual and future equitable access to the geostationary orbit for all States , taking into particular account the needs of developing countries , including the equatorial countries , because of their special geographical characteristics .  
Thus , both international war and internal armed conflicts , just as states of tension or domestic disturbances caused by political , economic , social or cultural factors , when accompanied by clashes , acts of violence , vandalism , inter _ ethnic confrontations , terrorist attacks , etc . and provided they represent an actual or at any rate imminent threat to the community as a whole , constitute a public danger or public emergency in the meaning conferred on those terms by the international instruments referred to above .  
It is against this background of societies repeatedly traumatized by economic , social , cultural and other factors that such extreme situations develop , in which the breakdown of the institutional order opens the floodgates to widespread violence and massacres of the civilian population , frequently leading in the end to actual genocide .  
The United Nations should promote regional information-sharing among local and regional governments - e.g . , through regional United Nations workshops and seminars for regional government executives and through the actual involvement of financial managers in the budgetary process and simulation programmes .  Successful cases of programmes in which unregistered entrepreneurs are encouraged to migrate into the small-business sector , should be shared through the United Nations with other developing countries .  
The representative of UNEP informed the Committee that the projected expenditures for 1998-1999 under these objects were based on anticipated contributions of $ 75-million , as approved by the Governing Council at its nineteenth session , while the amounts indicated under the same objects for 1996-1997 were based on reduced actual contributions amounting to $ 62.5-million .  
First , at no stage previously had all the available information on the issue been assembled for comparison and review ; second , no thorough study of the applicable United Nations Staff Rules had been undertaken to assist in the determination of whether the case was one of an actual conflict of interest or rather an apparent conflict of interest reflecting a common-sense application of just and reasonable behaviour ; third , the report must be detailed and legalistic to allow the United Nations to understand the insufficient nature of the current conflict of interest rules .

With regard to the methodology for apportionment of medical costs , the Advisory Committee was informed that this provides for the share of each participating organization to be determined on the basis of statistics prepared by the Joint Medical Service on the actual usage of the Service by the different organizations broken down by items such as medical exams , x-rays and laboratory tests , vaccinations and nursing care and administrative work .  
Several primary needs should be met : to devise effective and coherent arrangements for information and assessment of the impact of sanctions on third States ; to ensure appropriate access by third States to the process ; to develop a method of assessing actual adverse impact ; to explore practical and innovative measures of assistance ; and to enhance coordination and cooperation among relevant institutions and organizations both within and outside the United Nations system .  
Success in the thematic area of environment and development will be measured by : ( a ) the relevance of the new knowledge and methods produced for policy decision ; ( b ) the actual participation of pertinent decision makers in considering the proposed alternatives ; and ( c ) the extent of involvement of interested parties in consensus-building for policy decisions and of partnerships forged , joint initiatives funded and programmes launched relating to the management of common natural resources .  
The first , entitled Masses in Flight : The Global Crisis of Internal Displacement , a provides a global and regional overview of the problem of internal displacement , examines the legal framework for addressing it , details intergovernmental efforts at both the international and regional levels , and non-governmental efforts and offers strategies for improving the response at the global , regional , subregional , national and local levels during the various stages of displacement , covering prevention , protection and assistance in actual situations and the promotion of durable solutions .  
It advocated that the scale should be based on gross national product , with a statistical base period of three years ; and that external debt relief should be based on actual debt flows ; and that the existing formula for the low per capita income adjustment should be retained .  
Based on relatively little actual experience to draw upon at that time , the updated budget , amounting to $ 276,898,300 gross ( $ 267,676,300 net ) , reflected only minor changes in monthly operating costs with new requirements for non-recurrent cost items that had been identified since the formulation of the original requirements in early 1996 .  
The Advisory Committee was informed that for 1996-1997 actual and projected assessments on Member States in respect of peacekeeping operations , excluding the costs for special missions covered under the regular budget , are expected to total $ 2.5-billion . 
In this connection , it will be recalled that , consistent with established practice , the revised appropriation for 1996-1997 reflects actual exchange rates experienced in the first year of the biennium ( 1996 ) and projected rates for the second year ( 1997 ) based on the rate realized in December 1996 .  
While progress in adopting and implementing policies and programmes to promote and facilitate the transfer and diffusion of ESTs is well documented , it has been extremely difficult to make reliable estimates on the actual transfer of ESTs to developing countries and the real size and growth of EST markets , or on the share of investments that can be clearly assigned to financing of the transfer and diffusion of ESTs .  
Identified technology transfer and capacity-building projects were tailored to the actual needs of the local beneficiaries in the developing countries concerned , and helped coordinate follow-up activities at the national level .  
While the need for improved information is recognized , the actual trend in the quality and quantity of data and information being gathered and exchanged is decreasing owing to the impact of economic constraints , particularly but not only in developing countries and countries with economies in transition , and , often , the lack of real priority accorded by Governments .  
Among the principles underlying the current methodology for calculating equitable geographical distribution are broad agreements regarding the desirability of relating the base figure to the actual number of posts subject to geographical distribution ; the inclusion of posts based on the population factor in the ranges allocated to Member States ; and the need for flexibility upwards and downwards from the mid-point of each Member State 's range .  
Some were of the opinion that there has not yet been sufficient support in space law to conclude that a right of passage for ascending or descending space objects has been recognized as a rule of customary international law , but that in practice , such passage occurred without protest , and that as long as the passage was innocent and not prejudicial to the peace and security of subjacent States , then it could serve as the basis for the legalization of the actual practice .  
The adoption of a protocol in respect of an instrument that contained civil and political , as well as economic , social and cultural human rights , would constitute an important step towards the actual realization of that principle .  
The mandate contained in the report of Ambassador Shannon indeed made no explicit reference to the existing stockpiles of fissile material , but it acknowledged that this issue to which many delegations attach great importance can not be isolated with the Conference starts actual negotiations .  
The reported unencumbered balance resulted from savings attributable primarily to ( a ) lower transportation costs than estimated in the budget in respect of repatriation of troops and military observers , civilian police and international staff ; ( b ) fewer rented vehicles and lower requirements for spare parts and maintenance of the vehicle fleet ; ( c ) lower hire / charter costs and aviation fuel charges ; and ( d ) lower actual charges for the shipment of ONUMOZ - and contingent-owned equipment .  
The Advisory Committee notes that at the time of preparation of the cost estimates for the period from 1 July 1995 to 30 June 1996 , the change in the status of locally employed civilians was not anticipated and budgetary provision for the 318 locally employed civilians was made based on contractual arrangements with the United Kingdom , while actual expenditures incurred were in accordance with UNFICYP local staff salary scales and common staff costs .  
It would be preferable to support the viewpoint that the prohibited participation by children in military operations should not be designated as direct participation since the actual practice in armed conflicts hardly allows any conclusions to be derived from the proposed distinction between direct and indirect participation by children in the conflict .  
Variances may occur to the actual physical distribution as a result of changes in cropping patterns , varying food demands , weather restrictions , location of weed , insect and disease infestations , future machinery malfunctions that were not foreseen , the number of contracts approved and / or blocked , plus seasonal machinery activities ( e.g . the majority of harvesters move to the south for the early harvest and migrate north as the crops ripen and become ready for harvest ) .  
The Advisory Committee was not satisfied with the explanation of the overrun of $ 462,500 under budget line " International contractual personnel " and was informed , upon inquiry , that although the actual deployment of such personnel in UNPF was lower than anticipated ( which resulted in savings of $ 1,788,100 ) , payments for overtime and commutation of leave resulted in additional expenditures of $ 1,857,400 , exceeding the saving by $ 69,300 .  
The unencumbered balance resulted mainly from delays in the deployment of civilian personnel , reduced rental requirements related to the deployment of the International Police Task Force ( IPTF ) , the cost of the use of government-provided helicopters based on actual use rather than commercially provided helicopters and the availability of some equipment and supplies from surplus stock .  
Although the Advisory Committee appreciated that the overall level of peacekeeping activity would decline as more and more missions were liquidated , it had concluded that there were a number of shortcomings in the Secretariat 's analysis of the workload of peacekeeping missions , for it had had difficulty relating the Secretary-General 's proposals for net additional posts to the actual or projected workload .  
The programme translated the goal of eliminating all nuclear weapons from a rhetorical objective into actual reality , setting forth requirements in terms of active efforts to identify specific measures for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons within a well-defined time-frame and under effective international control pending the achievement of the desired goals through negotiation .  
While the Working Group had noted with satisfaction the valuable efforts to implement the recommendations of UNISPACE 82 , it had identified four priority areas where further efforts should be made to promote the applications of space science and technology for development : stimulation and support of the growth of indigenous nuclei and an autonomous technological base in space technology in developing countries ; promotion of a greater exchange of actual experiences in space applications ; and funding of the Programme of Space Applications and voluntary contributions for its activities .  
It considered that the existing arrangements for the composition of , and elections to , the bureau of the Committee had played a positive role , but also had negative aspects , including the failure to reflect the actual situation of international relations and the lack of equitable regional representation .  
Under such circumstances , the DPRK long ago put forward to the United States side a proposal that senior military officers of both sides sit down face to face to negotiate the establishment of a new mechanism in conformity with the actual situation in order to deter dangerous situations from arising , and has been waiting with patience for positive response .  
The concept of coercive economic measures embraces a variety of issues related to : ( a ) identification of essential elements , distinctive features and limitations of a definition of such measures ; ( b ) specification and classification of motives and policy objectives of sender States in resorting to economic coercion against target States , in particular developing countries ; and ( c ) categorization or selection of specific types of relevant measures , as well as analysis of their anticipated and actual effects .  
To begin with , as international firms begin to operate in the world economy as if it were a single market and production space , the issue of competitive markets is now being posed in terms of the " contestability " of markets , i.e . not only actual trade competition in goods and services , but also potential competition resulting from the establishment of foreign firms through direct investment .  
Noting the importance of adherence to internationally accepted norms and principles as well as the need to promote , as required , national and international legislation to meet actual and potential humanitarian challenges ,  
Calls upon Governments and other actors to ensure strict adherence to accepted humanitarian norms and principles and to promote national and international legislation which is responsive to actual and potential humanitarian problems ;

The fact that Ethiopia started this current offensive and violated the United States-brokered moratorium on air attacks has been ascertained by all those who have followed and witnessed its final preparations and the actual launch and conduct of the current offensive contrary to its useless but usual attempt to deny it .  
The fact that Ethiopia started this offensive and violated the United States-brokered moratorium on air attacks has been contrary to its useless but usual attempt to deny it , ascertained by all those who have followed and witnessed its final preparations and the actual launch and conduct of its current offensive .  
In its final report , IPF emphasized that national inventories are an important basis for effective formulation of national forest programmes , and that assessment of the actual and potential conditions of all types of forests is central to sustainable forest management and a wide range of other considerations related to forests and forest ecosystems at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
Hungary attached great importance to the adoption of the convention , since it would provide an excellent basis for proactive international cooperation , and hoped that it would serve as a deterrent and that some of its provisions would not have to be invoked , especially article 2 , paragraph 1 ( b ) concerning the actual use of radioactive material by terrorists . 
Attention continued to be focused on disadvantaged persons in peasant and indigenous settlements , as well as on the improvement , during this period , of services in the outlying neighbourhoods of Asuncin , which were reorganized and rescaled because they were out of step with the actual demographic situation and the demand for services .  
Child pornography means any representation of a [ n actual ] child engaged in [ real or simulated ] explicit sexual activities [ or any representation of the body or part of the body of a child , the dominant characteristic of which is depiction for sexual gratification ] .  
This quite simple backbone or table of contents of issues to consider when drafting a competition law is then complemented in Part II of the Model Law with detailed commentary to the articles , in which a review is made of actual laws in both developed and developing countries , as well as countries in transition , with a view to determining the most recent trends and views on how best to treat each one of the issues considered in the elements for articles of the law contained in Part I .  
Such a categorical rejection would create more confusion in respect of the applicable law in case of actual damage or harm occurring across international borders or at the global level because of activities pursued or permitted by States within their territory or other areas under their exclusive jurisdiction and control .  
When a State declares an indigenous territory as protected area , any lands , territories and resources under potential or actual claim by indigenous peoples , conservation areas shall not be subject to any natural resource development without the informed consent and participation of the peoples concerned .  
Mr . Hughes ( New Zealand ) speaking on behalf of the delegations of Australia , Canada and New Zealand ( CANZ ) , said that commendable improvements had been made in the peacekeeping budgets for 19992000 : the use of budget techniques that placed more emphasis on actual field experience rather than standard or notional costings had led to significant reductions in the 19992000 estimates and should lead to a decrease in the large unencumbered balances characteristic of recent peacekeeping budgets .  
The Special Rapporteur further recommends State authorities not to take up or continue to engage in development projects that may impair the environment of indigenous lands and / or adversely affect their traditional economic activities , religious ceremonies or cultural heritage , without previously commissioning the appropriate ecological studies to determine the actual negative impact those projects will have .  
The Board of Auditors indicated that in its future audits , it would review the effect of the new currency adjustment policy formulated under the harmonized budget format and would monitor actual budgetary performance based on the principle of linking administrative costs to costs of country programmes , which had been established under the integrated budgeting system .  
In the area of geological map configuration , the combined working methods of remote sensing technology and large-scale multi-picture surveys have reduced the actual costs by one third and the length of field survey routes by about one half compared with conventional methods .  Remote sensing technology has also been applied in archaeology , prospecting , railway and highway construction and marine information services .  
In that context , and notwithstanding the view of some members that the overall level of debt itself constituted a significant burden , the Committee agreed that , should the adjustment be retained , it should be based on actual principal repayments ( what has become known as the debt flow approach ) rather than on an estimate of the repayment of total debt stocks ( what has become known as the debt stock approach ) .  
It is doubtful whether the distinction , although interesting from the theoretical point of view , affects the scope of draft guideline 1.5.1 : either the treaty will be considered to have two actual parties ( despite the number of those contracting ) , and that situation is covered by draft guideline 1.5.1 , or the statement is made by one constituent of the multiple party and is a conventional reservation within the meaning of draft guideline 1.1 .  
The introduction of high-capacity digital telephone lines ( the integrated services digital network , or ISDN ) brought about a significant lowering of communications costs and prompted consideration of remote interpretation as a possible means of increasing cost-effectiveness in the use of staff resources and improving the actual utilization of physical meetings facilities in different conference centres .  
The complementarity of civil and political rights to economic , social and cultural rights must be fully recognized if the latter are to be implemented in accordance with the needs of people and the actual economic potential of the State .  
Many small island developing States find it increasingly difficult to access concessional development finance due to the application of criteria by some members of the international community , which focus on their relatively higher per capita gross national product levels without taking full account of their actual levels of development , vulnerability or standard of living in real terms .  
These include : ( a ) a desire by State or non-State actors in conflict situations to disrupt humanitarian operations which they consider undermine their own political , strategic or military goals ; ( b ) a desire to remove actual or potential witnesses to human rights abuses and other violations of international law ; and ( c ) a general mistrust and suspicion of the motives and intentions of humanitarian organizations .  
All these initiatives have been carried out despite the climate of uncertainty prevailing throughout the country , characterized by potential and actual food shortages , a hard-to-reach population scattered throughout Katanga , and a volatile situation in Kasa hindering the effective distribution of humanitarian assistance ( scattered population , heavy military presence , etc . ) .

He outlined the legal issues that needed to be resolved before the undertaking of actual proceedings , including the definition of applicable laws , both national and international , and procedural questions such as the appointment of personnel , the mechanism for appeals and the requirements for evidence .  
He notes that low levels of disbursement , especially at the local level , continue to erode the already modest share of the national budget allocated to the health sector , and draws attention to the fact that the gap between the budget allocated and actual expenditure is highest for the operating expenses of rural health services , crucial for the well-being of the population .  
It is indeed very disturbing that , not only are external forces continuing to fuel the fighting inside Afghanistan with deliveries of ammunition and other war-making materials , but an increasing number of other nationals are taking part in the actual combat , as well as the planning of military offensives .  
Thus , one of the main objectives of the proposed mechanism should be to elaborate specific and appropriate measures conducive to the removal of actual inadequacies in the process and creation of a system of fair distribution of unavoidable economic and social costs of sanctions .  
Military service has been estimated to be more straining both physically and psychologically , the actual daily / weekly time of duty is longer , there are fewer financial benefits and freedom of movement and other aspects of personal freedom are more restricted .  
If the prospector wishes to claim expenditures for prospecting as part of the development costs incurred prior to the commencement of commercial production , the prospector shall submit an annual statement , in conformity with internationally accepted accounting principles and certified by a duly qualified firm of public accountants , of the actual and direct expenditures incurred by the prospector in carrying out prospecting .  
But the latter faced their own surprises , in the form of the contrasting effects of shock therapy on Poland and the Russian Federation , the actual importance of changes in formal rules ( legislation ) , the possibility of some types of holistic social engineering ( Ellman , 1997 ) , the general acceptance of transformation strains by the populations concerned and the frequent advocacy of gradualism as a veil for slowing down the exit process from socialism .  
Taking the assessment made to its logical conclusion , the Special Rapporteur finds it inherently unjust that , while the actual perpetrators of the attacks have been punished with the full severity of the law , those who recruited , trained and hired them , supplied the materials and explosives , provided them with papers and paid them , are still at large and enjoying full impunity in the countries where they live .  
The excesses of the so-called military justice , a regular cause of arbitrary detention and impunity for human rights violations , as demonstrated by cases brought before the Working Group , have prompted the Group , in its recommendations in previous reports , to underline the need for an international conference to analyse the subject and seek to limit the actual powers of the military justice system ;  
Indeed , it is in the best interest of the process that the procedural issues pertaining to the meetings be carried out in a swift and prudent manner to allow the actual meeting period to be dedicated to more substantive work.We further support the notion reflected in the draft resolution that , with regard to the appointment of the co-chairpersons , there needs to be representation from both developed and developing countries .  
With respect to the issue of categories and size of the Council , it is imperative that we ensure , on the one hand , that all Member States be given a fair opportunity to serve on the Council with reasonable frequency , commensurate with their capabilities actual and potential to contribute to international peace and security and their willingness to do so .  
Many small island developing States find it increasingly difficult to access concessional development finance due to the application of criteria by some members of the international community , which focus on their relatively higher per capita gross national product levels without taking full account of their actual levels of development , vulnerability or standard of living in real terms .  
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions , in paragraphs 37 and 44 of its report dated 3 April 1997 ( A 51-851 and Corr . 1 ) indicated that the actual amount to be approved by the General Assembly would depend on the decision it took on the financing of separation payments for locally employed civilians , bearing in mind that UNFICYP was funded on a voluntary basis prior to 16 June 1993 .  
The investigators must also establish the actual identity and nationality of the mercenary , go through the files , rule out altruistic voluntary enlistment , compile information on recruitment and training centres , follow the trail of covert operations , obtain reliable data on aspects relating to the payment and other benefits agreed upon and detect the simultaneous use of other nationalities and passports , etc .  
The additional requirement of $ 1 , 991 , 900 under this heading resulted primarily from paying an unbudgeted increase in local staff salaries by 61.8 per cent effective on 1 March 1997 and the delayed termination separation of individual local contractors under special service agreements and local staff hired as general temporary assistance based on their actual contract expiration dates , which were mostly in July or August of 1997 , rather than 30 June 1997 .  
The Bank has defined guidelines , has recommended good practices both for data collection and for calculating annual national average prices for ICP items , and has outlined actual operational procedures .  
Nonetheless , the Special Rapporteur is concerned that the potential for abusive withholding of transfer requests is present , irrespective of actual practice , and finds it desirable that such apparent gaps in protection be closed wherever possible , not least to guard against false allegations .  
Although lost profits are not usually regarded as actual damage , in exceptional circumstances , such as wrongful termination by the contracting authority , the current value of expected future profit may be included in the compensation due to the concessionaire ;  
Included under this heading are : ( a ) differences between actual average salary and common staff costs compared with the standards included in the revised appropriations ; ( b ) differences between realized vacancy rates compared with those assumed in the revised appropriations ; and ( c ) adjustments to objects of expenditure other than posts based on actual and anticipated requirements to the end of the biennium .  
In a letter dated 16 March 1999 , the United States Secretary of State , Madeline Albright , stated , The growing prevalence of HIV / AIDS , and its actual and potential deadly impacts , require us to revise our thinking about political and economic security .  
Military service has been estimated to be more straining both physically and psychologically , the actual daily / weekly time of duty is longer , there are fewer financial benefits and freedom of movement and other aspects of personal freedom are more restricted .  
Determining actual and reasonable costs is often difficult for troop contributors to do , especially when they move matriel and personnel by military means and can not therefore easily provide documentary evidence of an acceptable national commercial rate .  
It was recognized that building an effective reporting system , with an analytical focus on actual results achieved against planned objectives , required a gradual process and presented a common challenge shared by other agencies .  
The historical and , alas , still actual misuse of religions and moral philosophies with a universal intent for purposes of domination and control should not obscure the evidence that the sharing of a common humanity is fundamental to the human race .  
Monitoring is the process of comparing common selected indicators or targets against actual performance , whereas surveillance is not only the organized exchange of information but also the means of encouraging remedial policy action at the national level .  
Noting the importance of adherence to internationally accepted norms and principles as well as the need to promote , as required , national and international legislation to meet actual and potential humanitarian challenges ,  
The Sub-Commission , noting that actual or potential conflicts exist between the implementation of the TRIPS Agreement and the realization of economic , social and cultural rights in relation to access to patented pharmaceuticals and the implications for the enjoyment of the right to health , requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to undertake an analysis of the human rights impacts of the TRIPS Agreement .  
There continues to be no sustained rule of law in Equatorial Guinea ; rather , power is concentrated in the hands of the executive , which leads to continued arbitrary detention and torture designed to prevent actual or suspected coup dtat attempts , or in any case to prevent political parties or ethnic groups opposing the governing group from gaining power .  
The Secretary-General endorses the proposed formula for determining the number and salary levels of resident auditors that should be deployed to selected peacekeeping missions , on the understanding that the formula would be used as a guideline and the actual requirements in each case would be based on a detailed assessment of the related risks and other relevant factors .  
In addition to the national reports of Governments on the follow-up to individual conferences , the resident coordinators annual report , prepared in close collaboration with the entire country team , continued in 2000 to be an important source of information on actual inter-agency activities relating to conference follow-up at the country level .  
With regard to additional requirements under mission subsistence allowance , while the approved budget assumed that 10 per cent of international staff would be entitled to the higher rate established for Cape Sierra Hotel , the actual number of staff accommodated at the hotel was higher than the original projections .  
The $ 14.9-million level of net approvals reported under this category takes into account only actual payments received ; future year payments under trust fund agreements signed with donors in 2000 ( and therefore not included in net approvals ) amount to $ 7.9-million .  
Although the actual technology that will be used for some exploration activities , namely the one which will be embodied in the collecting systems and equipment , is not currently known , and current knowledge of the deep-sea environment is insufficient to predict the real impacts of tests of such technology , the environmental disturbances , based on the experience and knowledge gathered from previous activities carried out by the registered pioneer investors and by the scientific community , may be forecast to some extent .  
The main lesson to be drawn from past United Nations experience in this regard is that the earlier the root causes of a potential conflict are identified and effectively addressed , the more likely it is that the parties to a conflict will be ready to engage in a constructive dialogue , address the actual grievances that lie at the root of the potential conflict and refrain from the use of force to achieve their aims .  
For the purposes of effectively combating racism and racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance in the civil , political , economic , social and cultural fields , the World Conference recommends to all Member States that their national legislative framework in criminal , civil and administrative law should expressly and specifically prohibit discrimination on grounds of actual or presumed racial , ethnic or national origin , religion and belief and provide effective judicial and other remedies or redress , including through the designation of national , independent , specialized bodies .  
Takes note of the understanding concluded between the International Labour Office and the authorities of Myanmar regarding an objective assessment to be carried out by an International Labour Organization high-level mission with respect to the practical implementation and actual impact of the framework of legislative , executive and administrative measures reported by Myanmar within the overall objective of the complete elimination of forced labour in law and practice ;  
Support for the process of decentralization and devolution of environmental management takes various forms : strengthening of executive branch institutions involved in the process , and empowerment of local governments , as the main management bodies at the local level , as well as the actual communities to take over ongoing management of their natural resources .  
It was noted that the implementation of UR Agreements had not visibly improved their countries market access opportunities largely due to : high trade barriers remaining in the developed country markets ; increasing stringency of sanitary and phytosanitary measures and technical standards and erosion of preferential tariff margins , be it actual or the threat thereof .  
However , the actual benefits may be quite limited as the delivery of the main components of debt relief packages , including debt stock reduction from the Paris Club , remains conditional on the finalization and successful implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers ( PRSPs ) , which set out the countrys macroeconomic and structural reform policies , as well as concrete poverty-reduction goals .  
With regard to the role of international agreements , he pointed out that so far recognition of the importance of technology transfer for developing countries was only formal in nature , expressed solely through the existence of the relevant international and regional arrangements , but that further refinement of those arrangements was needed in order to facilitate the practical possibilities of their actual implementation .

It has correctly dealt with difficult problems such as helping officers and men transfer to civilian jobs , become decommissioned , and settle down , and assisting their family members find jobs .

" The actual timing of the implementation of the Advisory Committee 's recommendations , if accepted , remains the sole prerogative of the Government . I have no doubt that the Government will take into account relevant factors such as the projected fiscal position , the economic outlook , etc , before deciding on the timetable , " said Moses Cheng , Chairman of the Advisory Committee . 
( a ) whether the current specific arrangements and procedures for the allocation of places by computer programmes involve human factors or administrative procedures which may cause schools to admit fewer students than it should have admitted according to the actual choice of the parents , and thus resulting in these schools operating fewer primary one classes ;  
By the end of this financial year , the actual expenditure on the capital works programme is expected to be about $ 24.8 billion .  This slightly exceeds our original target of $ 24.5 billion as a result of the satisfactory progress of a number of major projects .  
In announcing the results , Professor Chan said , " These figures are the result of a survey of the pay trends in the private companies .  Pay adjustment for the civil service is , however , a separate matter ; the actual level of adjustment will have to be determined by the Administration in consultation with the four central staff consultative councils . "  
Regarding the details of the proposal , Mr Lam said in respect of GC and FC elections , the candidates who got elected or had received 5 % of valid votes or more would be given financial support .  The rate would be set at $ 10 per vote but capped at 50% of the actual declared election expenses of the candidate concerned .  
At the Legislative Council meeting today ( May 21 ) , the Secretary for Constitutional Affairs , Mr Stephen Lam , said that the Basic Law stipulated universal suffrage as the ultimate aim for constitutional development , and that the electoral methods should be specified in the light of our actual situation and the principle of gradual and orderly progress .  
This year , too , we are lowering personal and corporate income taxes , reducing tariffs , further relaxing restrictions on foreign investment , and increasing public investment , while the 14 major development projects will be moving from the planning stage into that of actual construction .  
Company officials feel that another important reason that returned students left the company is because they " failed to perform well . " According to one high level manager at Nan Ya Plastics , the professional knowledge and ability the returned students possessed were very good , but " studying is one thing and actual work is another . " The failure to perform well hurt their prospects for promotion and the returning students themselves lost interest and were not willing to stay on .  
We should accelerate the implementation of the reforms initiated by late Chairman Chiang Ching-kuo with an even more active and responsible attitude . From central to local government , from representative bodies to the administrative agencies , all should make a thorough self-review , based on actual needs , and strengthen and improve where required , to fortify the substance and function of democracy .  
Because of many years of a stable social environment and many years in the role of ruling party , a trend of " party bureaucratization " was inevitably formed . From now on , we must choose cadres from among the general public , and evaluate cadres on the basis of their actual service work , correct misconceptions on the part of cadres , and set cadres with incorrect attitudes straight .  
And if you make windfall profits on speculation , then that 's just smart planning . " But the two main public policies for returning price rises to the public - - buying land up according to assessed value and taxes , also based on assessed value - - are not able to fulfill their function because of the huge gap between the standard - - assessed prices - - and the actual market prices .  
Chung Chin explains that she used data for 1991 because it made calculations relatively simple . In 1991 the PRC was strongly encouraging foreign firms to go all out to export goods and earn foreign exchange , and Taiwan firms were given little access to the domestic market . Therefore using total Taiwanese investment in the economic formula to calculate the contribution made to mainland Chinese exports would give a close approximation to the actual figure .  
Because economic activity was more vigorous at the beginning of 1994 than had been expected , many international economic institutions revised their mid-year estimates of total growth for 1994 upward , yet " actual growth was higher than even the revised estimates . "  
When the various conflicts surrounding the health insurance system became a hot topic of discussion , most people probably overlooked one basic fact : The universal health care plan is actually only a financial design , and its goal is to eliminate " loss and waste " from the vast health care system . As for actual medical service , one still must look to the same health care network of medical centers and personnel that is already in place .  
That 's why it is necessary to have reserve electric power . But many scholars believe that Taiwan has always had adequate electrical power capacity . The problem lies in management shortcomings at Taipower . For example , poor maintenance and an excessive shutdown rate lower electrical supply , creating a situation in which actual supply can not meet the demands of users , thus creating the need for occasional rationing .  
After having seen many such examples , NGO leaders are not unaware that criticizing is easier than doing the actual work . " The government is n't going to ask me to come serve in the public sector . If they did ask me , I 'm afraid it would n't be easy to do a good job , " admits one leader of an educational reform group . Once he switched roles from offense to defense , it would also be hard for him to escape " being vulnerable to attack . "  
As Chinese know from their own books , " The Chinese armed forces held Shanghai amidst bitter fighting from August to November , and even then the Japanese were unable to completely rout the Chinese . " But in the relevant Japanese film , the viewer only gets two images - - " Fighting has spread to Shanghai , where our forces are heavily engaged , " and " Valiant naval airmen who gave their lives " - - that gloss right over actual events .  
But most of them filled up as soon as they were built , and " almost the only one still functioning as a silt trap is the Junghua Dam , " says Chen Hsin-hsiung . Scholars estimate that the 133-meter-high Shihmen Dam has an actual depth of water today of less than 40 meters , and the effective storage capacity above the dam 's outlet is less than half its original size . The torrential rain of tropical rainstorms washes the upstream sand and gravel over the silt traps , through the reservoir and down to the plains .  
However , because these organizations are all run by private individuals or civic groups , and are constantly being changed in response to social problems , to date no complete statistical survey has been done which would accurately reflect the actual resources which can be provided by Taiwan 's halfway houses .  
The average political commentators at the time seemed to be engaged in political discourse , admonishing the leaders of the country and serving as a mouthpiece for the people but , in actual fact , they were passing judgment based on some simple Confucian ideas of morality .  
However , many artists are unwilling to let this 800-year-old Chinese folk tradition wither and die . In 1985 the Council for Cultural Planning and Development began an annual competition to select the best New Year 's prints . Each year many creative submissions combining tradition and contemporary styles are received , reflecting today 's actual mass culture .  
Of course , there is much in these " new age " books that looks ridiculous , that is mere wishful thinking , or that is just opinion . But they make apparent the great desire of human beings to seek truth , goodness , and knowledge . People have always been dissatisfied with , dubious about , or willing to challenge actual experience , and have sought a better world .  
In making these works of art , one must use the exact same materials for the exterior and interior that would be used in making an actual architectural structure . The piano inside Rose Mansion is made of the same materials as a real piano , and the oil painting was carefully painted by an artist who made constant reference to the original painting . Even the trivets on the tabletops are made of real porcelain and stoneware !  
But it is only actual governing that tests one 's true staying power . Scholars have stated that the 2000 election in Taiwan has three special characteristics : For one thing , this is the first time the opposition has a very real possibility of taking the reins of government . Secondly , the three leading candidates are so close it is impossible to tell who will win . And third , whatever the outcome , this is the beginning of Taiwan 's post-strongman era .  
This naturally makes local governments very reliant upon , and vulnerable to control by , the central government . Although the actual amount of the tax redistribution is limited , local governments have to shoulder most of the burden of maintaining infrastructure , social services , education , cultural activities , and more . Local finances are very strained as a result .  
For instance , the course content offered by his college 's Graduate Institute of Technology and Innovation Management is only suitable for postgraduate work . " But due to the regulations imposed by the Ministry of Education , if you set up only a graduate school the educational resources available from the government do not compare with those for a combined undergraduate department and graduate school . " Wu says that this results in institutions having to make a choice between " actual need " and " winning more resources . "  
Information sent on wireless communication systems , including mobile phone platforms , satellite TV , and broadband Internet access , may very well be in a digital format , but in the actual process of transmission , the data must first be converted using an analog transponder from digital to mid frequency signals , and thereafter be switched to high frequency . Only in this way can it get on to the high frequency information superhighway . When it arrives at the receiving end , it must go through the same steps in reverse .  
In fact , Taiwan Advocates was established in response to President Chen 's idea of a trans-party " national security alliance , " bringing together many political figures as well as social and academic elites . Taiwan Advocates aims to be " the brains of the national security alliance , " and also to link together different political forces in the Legislative Yuan . Taiwan Advocates has held few public activities , so its actual impact remains to be seen .  
The e-Generation 's predilection for image-based reasoning is causing their patience for serious reading and logical writing to gradually erode . Their writing is incoherent and even in spoken language they show a tendency towards the abbreviated , partially formed language favored by commercials ; in the end , their actual meaning evaporates in a flash of fragmented information .  
Chen feels that leaving white space is more difficult to master than the actual artwork , because all that space can easily end up looking excessive , or even downright vacant . That is why he is so careful about blank space . Besides , white and black are two of his favorite colors .  
In a coffee shop smelling of stale cigarette smoke and pipe tobacco , Lin reflects on his new film . Not only was it the most expensive of all his previous works , but the actual filming was also the most painstaking . Each day , as work began , two to three hours were spent on setting up lighting alone , in an attempt to bring out the essence of middle-class urban life . The Cruise of Robinson portrays a real-estate agent who makes his home in a hotel .  
The dialogue in Hero was superficial and too modern sounding , and the film laid greater emphasis on form than the actual storyline . Moreover , director Zhang Yimou overextended himself attempting to confine so heavy and broad a theme within a two-hour format . As a result , the entire story comes off as a stiff and unnatural . Lacking in vitality , the characters are merely functional .  
" When the sky lanterns themselves only account for 5% of an NT $ 6 million budget , I think the organizers are leaning in the wrong direction , " says Hu Min-shih . Adding singing and dancing may make the celebration more festive , but Hu wishes that the responsible county agencies would spend more on the actual construction and release of sky lanterns , since they are after all the true leading lights of the festival .  
It is a great pity , but as the number of graduation credits required to graduate from the vocational system has declined over the years , and with no rules indicating the minimum number of credits to be earned from practical work , related classes have come under pressure . As a result , many private schools have chosen to cut subjects that involve physical work or extra financing , which ensures students are given fewer and fewer opportunities to familiarize themselves with actual physical operations .  
Wen Shih-jen , deputy CEO of computer manufacturer Inventec , has likened the importance of cooperation between technical and vocational education and industry to laying the " last mile " in establishing the Internet : " The final section needed to ensure the Internet is linked with actual users is known as the ' last mile . ' Without this section users would be unable to get online and the Internet would be a wasted opportunity . "  
" They are always so happy , though , just because I 'm doing the shopping and preparing meals for them , " Day says . Filial piety is n't difficult ; one just needs to cater to another 's pleasures . His father , for example , loves to eat a traditional salted pork dish , so Day practiced until he learned the techniques for making it , mastering each step , from choosing the right cut of meat to the actual cooking and dressing of the meat .

The collector system , to be operational in a highpressure and lowtemperature environment while operating on soil of poor strength , demands special equipment components and material which need to be tested in the actual deep seabed environment .  
The development of an integrated mining system that would be operational in an actual deep seabed environment on a sustained basis is demanding both in terms of time and effort and requires substantial financial inputs .  
In section three , the actual and prospective development opportunities are considered , especially those that accrue from expanded and more effective regional cooperative and integration arrangements in selected key areas .  
With a downward trend in global military spending and an increased reliance upon lighter arms in situations of actual conflict , the technological base for more sophisticated weapon systems is getting narrower .  
The first involved more efficient prevention , especially to address the problems of victims of internal conflicts , actual or potential victims of the situation in States that have recently emerged from authoritarian rule , and citizens of developing countries in flight from inhuman poverty or socio-economic instability .  
Our people find it astonishing that in an era of such developed mass communication , which leaves no distance between different corners of the globe , the apparently insurmountable difficulties in particular , the actual causes of the continuing imposed war are not understood .  
Owing to insufficient consultations and negotiations at the Conference , reasonable views and opinions of some States that have major interests in marine fisheries failed to be duly reflected in relevant provisions .  The actual implementation of these Articles may encounter many difficulties and may increase the differences and disputes between States with conflicting interests .  
Only consistent respect for the right of free choice can ensure that the new or modified arrangements will be tailored to respond to the actual security needs and genuinely shared common interests .  
The participation of youth groups in gathering environmental data and in understanding ecological systems and actual environmental action should be encouraged as a means of improving both their knowledge of the environment and their personal engagement in caring for the environment .

It is recommended that the reports should not be confined to mere lists of legal instruments adopted in the country concerned in recent years but should also include information indicating how these legal instruments are reflected in the actual economic , political and social realities and general conditions existing in the country .  
We can , however , agree to the six-month initial period proposed in the current draft , but only on the understanding that the United Nations is not about to terminate its presence in Angola after only six months , rather , that it is prepared to undertake additional periods of extension , based on actual performance , to enable the political process to take root .  
The Committee suggests that the State party take steps to ensure the effective coordination between the existing institutions involved in the areas of human rights and children 's rights with a view to establishing a monitoring mechanism for the implementation of the Convention at the national , regional and local levels , which may assess the actual situation of children and narrow the gap between the law and its practice .

Comparisons of findings with written texts and subsequent modifications to the texts based on the students ' individual and collective experiences with the actual situations not only encourage reality-based interaction with those outside the school environment , but also encourage students to treat texts as modifiable entities instead of final authorities .  
The realization at the political and decision-making level of the actual magnitude and complexity of organized transnational crime may serve as a basis for elaborating improved forms of international cooperation , drawing on the pool of knowledge and experience in the scientific community .  
National legal systems allowing for punitive or exemplary damages usually do so only where there has been a deliberate misdeed or gross negligence ; in such cases , the proper course of action for the Organization would be to bring disciplinary charges against the offending staff member or recovery action from him or her of the damages paid by the Organization for the actual loss suffered by the victim . 
And to offer it as evidence of a global-level saving shortage , one would have to calculate a global real interest rate that embodied the expectations of inflation in a variety of currencies over an indefinite future , and would also have to take account of actual interest rates in each of the relevant markets : all in all , a formidable research task .  
The Committee welcomes the financial management model of UNOPS by which administrative expenditures are planned and monitored based on a continuous review of the demand for services , as well as the actual programme delivery figures and resulting support income earned ;  
This crisis has two sides : the negative one , which brought the war with all its repercussions , and the other side , which forced international public opinion and world diplomacy to accept some of the fundamental causes of the crisis of the Balkans , be they historical or actual , as well as the main party responsible for this crisis , that is the Serbs , with their medieval policy in the Balkans .  
Upon inquiry , however , the Committee was informed that , based on past experience , it was expected that the actual ratio of recurrent administrative costs to the actual total pensionable remuneration would be in the neighbourhood of 0.18 per cent of the pensionable remuneration , in line with the provision estimated for administrative costs in the actuarial valuation of the Fund since the 1986 valuation .

Upon inquiry , the Committee was informed that contractual arrangements with the military supplier of helicopters proved to be more economical than budgeted ; instead of contracting for a minimum number of hours per month , plus making provisions for additional hours , payments were made on the basis of actual helicopter hours used . 
The revised annex 6 was amended , limiting the testing of the system to include only the functional and performance tests and deleting the final acceptance tests originally provided for ( i.e . to run the system under actual operating conditions for a minimum of 60 days ) ;  
The Advisory Committee was informed , upon inquiry , that the revised requirements for contractual services of $ 8.3-million , which reflects a decrease of $ 11.7-million compared with the original estimates of $ 20.0-million , are based on the actual terms of the contract signed in July 1995 between the United Nations and the logistic support services contractor .

Therefore , even if the formula percentage can be revised upwards sufficiently at this time to generate enough income for the support account to finance the estimated expenditure requirements for backstopping for the 12-month period from 1 July 1996 , it is the Secretary-General \ x { e5b8 } conclusion that based on past experience it has been clearly demonstrated that the current funding methodology does not reflect the actual backstopping capacity required and does not provide an adequate and predictable annual level of resources to meet the minimum backstopping requirements at Headquarters .  
Review and approval of the budgetary requirements for backstopping activities at Headquarters in subsequent years would be based on actual workload experience of the backstopping requirements of the prior year and projected workload for the next year , taking into account the number , scope , scale and complexity of active , completed and closed peace-keeping missions supported .

Japan is of the view that , although it is necessary to consider the formulation of extensive and comprehensive measures , including the preparation of legal norms , in order to standardize the systems of Member States against organized crime , it hardly appears that there is currently an adequate common understanding among Member States regarding the actual pattern of illegal activity in question .  
Other representatives stated that the congresses on the prevention of crime and the treatment of offenders , the status of which had been modified since they had begun acting as consultative body to the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme , should henceforth be better able to respond to the actual needs of Member States , but should nevertheless not fail to set precise objectives and reduce the number of resolutions adopted .  
" Linearity " ( usually measured in terms of non-linearity ) : maximum deviation of the actual characteristic ( average of upscale and downscale readings ) , positive or negative , from a straight line so positioned as to equalize and minimize the maximum deviations .  
In Kuwait , although actual oil revenues were about 25 per cent higher than projected , and expenditures about 15 per cent lower than their planned level , the budget deficit remained sizeable in fiscal year 1995 / 96 , owing mainly to supplementary allocations for autonomous governmental institutions .

Moreover , since there were wide variations in the actual vacancy rates in different duty stations , and the standard cost of each post differed in terms of post adjustment and the percentage attributable to common staff costs , the Board considered that the adoption of a uniform vacancy rate for formulation of budgetary proposals for staff costs was likely to give rise to significant inaccuracies ( A / 51 / 5 ( Vol . I ) , sect .  
Much more information is needed regarding the actual and potential costs on various alternative routes available to the Central Asian republics as a basis for regional and national decisions on transport priorities for investment in infrastructure , technical assistance , training , better management and improved cooperative arrangements .  More precise information , available to all parties , would result in far more effective cooperation concerning rates and conditions on existing or proposed alternative routes .  
The greatest pay-off in terms of increases in efficiency and lowered real costs of transport is likely to come about from a full-scale effort to improve a whole range of institutional , procedural , regulatory , managerial and other non-physical aspects of vital importance to the actual movement of goods to and from markets in the region or abroad .

For that period the General Assembly had appropriated a total amount of $ 11,948,718 gross and the actual expenditure had been $ 9,978,000 gross : the unencumbered balance of $ 1,970,718 gross had resulted from a number of factors , in particular the release of fixed-wing aircraft earlier than had been anticipated , and savings on civilian personnel costs owing mainly to the fact that the vacancy rate had been higher than expected . 
It is acknowledged that the Fund of UNDCP requires an operating reserve to ensure the financial viability and integrity of the Fund and to cover : downward fluctuations or shortfalls in resources ; uneven cash flows ; increases in actual costs as compared with planning estimates or fluctuations in delivery ; and contingencies such as final expenditure ( including liquidating liabilities ) and unforeseen needs which may arise .

In some cases , the allocation for TCDC is not separately identified from the budgetary allocation for the overall operations of the national focal point as an agency of the Government , and since there may not be a detailed system of accounting , it is difficult to determine how much is being dedicated to the actual promotion of TCDC .  
The view was expressed that in view of the special characteristics of the geostationary orbit , there was a need to establish a sui generis legal regime for regulating access to and use of that orbit , which was a limited natural resource , and that such a regime should guarantee actual and future equitable access to the geostationary orbit for all States , taking into particular account the needs of developing countries , including the equatorial countries , because of their special geographical characteristics .  
Thus , both international war and internal armed conflicts , just as states of tension or domestic disturbances caused by political , economic , social or cultural factors , when accompanied by clashes , acts of violence , vandalism , inter _ ethnic confrontations , terrorist attacks , etc . and provided they represent an actual or at any rate imminent threat to the community as a whole , constitute a public danger or public emergency in the meaning conferred on those terms by the international instruments referred to above .  
It is against this background of societies repeatedly traumatized by economic , social , cultural and other factors that such extreme situations develop , in which the breakdown of the institutional order opens the floodgates to widespread violence and massacres of the civilian population , frequently leading in the end to actual genocide .  
The United Nations should promote regional information-sharing among local and regional governments - e.g . , through regional United Nations workshops and seminars for regional government executives and through the actual involvement of financial managers in the budgetary process and simulation programmes .  Successful cases of programmes in which unregistered entrepreneurs are encouraged to migrate into the small-business sector , should be shared through the United Nations with other developing countries .  
The representative of UNEP informed the Committee that the projected expenditures for 1998-1999 under these objects were based on anticipated contributions of $ 75-million , as approved by the Governing Council at its nineteenth session , while the amounts indicated under the same objects for 1996-1997 were based on reduced actual contributions amounting to $ 62.5-million .  
First , at no stage previously had all the available information on the issue been assembled for comparison and review ; second , no thorough study of the applicable United Nations Staff Rules had been undertaken to assist in the determination of whether the case was one of an actual conflict of interest or rather an apparent conflict of interest reflecting a common-sense application of just and reasonable behaviour ; third , the report must be detailed and legalistic to allow the United Nations to understand the insufficient nature of the current conflict of interest rules .  
VIII . 168 .  With regard to the methodology for apportionment of medical costs , the Advisory Committee was informed that this provides for the share of each participating organization to be determined on the basis of statistics prepared by the Joint Medical Service on the actual usage of the Service by the different organizations broken down by items such as medical exams , x-rays and laboratory tests , vaccinations and nursing care and administrative work .  
Several primary needs should be met : to devise effective and coherent arrangements for information and assessment of the impact of sanctions on third States ; to ensure appropriate access by third States to the process ; to develop a method of assessing actual adverse impact ; to explore practical and innovative measures of assistance ; and to enhance coordination and cooperation among relevant institutions and organizations both within and outside the United Nations system .  
Success in the thematic area of environment and development will be measured by : ( a ) the relevance of the new knowledge and methods produced for policy decision ; ( b ) the actual participation of pertinent decision makers in considering the proposed alternatives ; and ( c ) the extent of involvement of interested parties in consensus-building for policy decisions and of partnerships forged , joint initiatives funded and programmes launched relating to the management of common natural resources .  
The first , entitled Masses in Flight : The Global Crisis of Internal Displacement , a provides a global and regional overview of the problem of internal displacement , examines the legal framework for addressing it , details intergovernmental efforts at both the international and regional levels , and non-governmental efforts and offers strategies for improving the response at the global , regional , subregional , national and local levels during the various stages of displacement , covering prevention , protection and assistance in actual situations and the promotion of durable solutions .  
It advocated that the scale should be based on gross national product , with a statistical base period of three years ; and that external debt relief should be based on actual debt flows ; and that the existing formula for the low per capita income adjustment should be retained .  
Based on relatively little actual experience to draw upon at that time , the updated budget , amounting to $ 276,898,300 gross ( $ 267,676,300 net ) , reflected only minor changes in monthly operating costs with new requirements for non-recurrent cost items that had been identified since the formulation of the original requirements in early 1996 .  
The Advisory Committee was informed that for 1996-1997 actual and projected assessments on Member States in respect of peacekeeping operations , excluding the costs for special missions covered under the regular budget , are expected to total $ 2.5-billion . 
In this connection , it will be recalled that , consistent with established practice , the revised appropriation for 1996-1997 reflects actual exchange rates experienced in the first year of the biennium ( 1996 ) and projected rates for the second year ( 1997 ) based on the rate realized in December 1996 .  
While progress in adopting and implementing policies and programmes to promote and facilitate the transfer and diffusion of ESTs is well documented , it has been extremely difficult to make reliable estimates on the actual transfer of ESTs to developing countries and the real size and growth of EST markets , or on the share of investments that can be clearly assigned to financing of the transfer and diffusion of ESTs .  
Identified technology transfer and capacity-building projects were tailored to the actual needs of the local beneficiaries in the developing countries concerned , and helped coordinate follow-up activities at the national level .  
While the need for improved information is recognized , the actual trend in the quality and quantity of data and information being gathered and exchanged is decreasing owing to the impact of economic constraints , particularly but not only in developing countries and countries with economies in transition , and , often , the lack of real priority accorded by Governments .  
Among the principles underlying the current methodology for calculating equitable geographical distribution are broad agreements regarding the desirability of relating the base figure to the actual number of posts subject to geographical distribution ; the inclusion of posts based on the population factor in the ranges allocated to Member States ; and the need for flexibility upwards and downwards from the mid-point of each Member State 's range .  
Some were of the opinion that there has not yet been sufficient support in space law to conclude that a right of passage for ascending or descending space objects has been recognized as a rule of customary international law , but that in practice , such passage occurred without protest , and that as long as the passage was innocent and not prejudicial to the peace and security of subjacent States , then it could serve as the basis for the legalization of the actual practice .  
The adoption of a protocol in respect of an instrument that contained civil and political , as well as economic , social and cultural human rights , would constitute an important step towards the actual realization of that principle .  
The mandate contained in the report of Ambassador Shannon indeed made no explicit reference to the existing stockpiles of fissile material , but it acknowledged that this issue to which many delegations attach great importance can not be isolated with the Conference starts actual negotiations .  
The reported unencumbered balance resulted from savings attributable primarily to ( a ) lower transportation costs than estimated in the budget in respect of repatriation of troops and military observers , civilian police and international staff ; ( b ) fewer rented vehicles and lower requirements for spare parts and maintenance of the vehicle fleet ; ( c ) lower hire / charter costs and aviation fuel charges ; and ( d ) lower actual charges for the shipment of ONUMOZ - and contingent-owned equipment .  
The Advisory Committee notes that at the time of preparation of the cost estimates for the period from 1 July 1995 to 30 June 1996 , the change in the status of locally employed civilians was not anticipated and budgetary provision for the 318 locally employed civilians was made based on contractual arrangements with the United Kingdom , while actual expenditures incurred were in accordance with UNFICYP local staff salary scales and common staff costs .  
It would be preferable to support the viewpoint that the prohibited participation by children in military operations should not be designated as direct participation since the actual practice in armed conflicts hardly allows any conclusions to be derived from the proposed distinction between direct and indirect participation by children in the conflict .  
Variances may occur to the actual physical distribution as a result of changes in cropping patterns , varying food demands , weather restrictions , location of weed , insect and disease infestations , future machinery malfunctions that were not foreseen , the number of contracts approved and / or blocked , plus seasonal machinery activities ( e.g . the majority of harvesters move to the south for the early harvest and migrate north as the crops ripen and become ready for harvest ) .  
The Advisory Committee was not satisfied with the explanation of the overrun of $ 462,500 under budget line " International contractual personnel " and was informed , upon inquiry , that although the actual deployment of such personnel in UNPF was lower than anticipated ( which resulted in savings of $ 1,788,100 ) , payments for overtime and commutation of leave resulted in additional expenditures of $ 1,857,400 , exceeding the saving by $ 69,300 .  
The unencumbered balance resulted mainly from delays in the deployment of civilian personnel , reduced rental requirements related to the deployment of the International Police Task Force ( IPTF ) , the cost of the use of government-provided helicopters based on actual use rather than commercially provided helicopters and the availability of some equipment and supplies from surplus stock .  
Although the Advisory Committee appreciated that the overall level of peacekeeping activity would decline as more and more missions were liquidated , it had concluded that there were a number of shortcomings in the Secretariat 's analysis of the workload of peacekeeping missions , for it had had difficulty relating the Secretary-General 's proposals for net additional posts to the actual or projected workload .  
The programme translated the goal of eliminating all nuclear weapons from a rhetorical objective into actual reality , setting forth requirements in terms of active efforts to identify specific measures for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons within a well-defined time-frame and under effective international control pending the achievement of the desired goals through negotiation .  
While the Working Group had noted with satisfaction the valuable efforts to implement the recommendations of UNISPACE 82 , it had identified four priority areas where further efforts should be made to promote the applications of space science and technology for development : stimulation and support of the growth of indigenous nuclei and an autonomous technological base in space technology in developing countries ; promotion of a greater exchange of actual experiences in space applications ; and funding of the Programme of Space Applications and voluntary contributions for its activities .  
It considered that the existing arrangements for the composition of , and elections to , the bureau of the Committee had played a positive role , but also had negative aspects , including the failure to reflect the actual situation of international relations and the lack of equitable regional representation .  
Under such circumstances , the DPRK long ago put forward to the United States side a proposal that senior military officers of both sides sit down face to face to negotiate the establishment of a new mechanism in conformity with the actual situation in order to deter dangerous situations from arising , and has been waiting with patience for positive response .  
The concept of coercive economic measures embraces a variety of issues related to : ( a ) identification of essential elements , distinctive features and limitations of a definition of such measures ; ( b ) specification and classification of motives and policy objectives of sender States in resorting to economic coercion against target States , in particular developing countries ; and ( c ) categorization or selection of specific types of relevant measures , as well as analysis of their anticipated and actual effects .  
To begin with , as international firms begin to operate in the world economy as if it were a single market and production space , the issue of competitive markets is now being posed in terms of the " contestability " of markets , i.e . not only actual trade competition in goods and services , but also potential competition resulting from the establishment of foreign firms through direct investment .  
Noting the importance of adherence to internationally accepted norms and principles as well as the need to promote , as required , national and international legislation to meet actual and potential humanitarian challenges ,  
Calls upon Governments and other actors to ensure strict adherence to accepted humanitarian norms and principles and to promote national and international legislation which is responsive to actual and potential humanitarian problems ;

The fact that Ethiopia started this current offensive and violated the United States-brokered moratorium on air attacks has been ascertained by all those who have followed and witnessed its final preparations and the actual launch and conduct of the current offensive contrary to its useless but usual attempt to deny it .  
The fact that Ethiopia started this offensive and violated the United States-brokered moratorium on air attacks has been contrary to its useless but usual attempt to deny it , ascertained by all those who have followed and witnessed its final preparations and the actual launch and conduct of its current offensive .  
In its final report , IPF emphasized that national inventories are an important basis for effective formulation of national forest programmes , and that assessment of the actual and potential conditions of all types of forests is central to sustainable forest management and a wide range of other considerations related to forests and forest ecosystems at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
Hungary attached great importance to the adoption of the convention , since it would provide an excellent basis for proactive international cooperation , and hoped that it would serve as a deterrent and that some of its provisions would not have to be invoked , especially article 2 , paragraph 1 ( b ) concerning the actual use of radioactive material by terrorists . 
Attention continued to be focused on disadvantaged persons in peasant and indigenous settlements , as well as on the improvement , during this period , of services in the outlying neighbourhoods of Asuncin , which were reorganized and rescaled because they were out of step with the actual demographic situation and the demand for services .  
Child pornography means any representation of a [ n actual ] child engaged in [ real or simulated ] explicit sexual activities [ or any representation of the body or part of the body of a child , the dominant characteristic of which is depiction for sexual gratification ] .  
This quite simple backbone or table of contents of issues to consider when drafting a competition law is then complemented in Part II of the Model Law with detailed commentary to the articles , in which a review is made of actual laws in both developed and developing countries , as well as countries in transition , with a view to determining the most recent trends and views on how best to treat each one of the issues considered in the elements for articles of the law contained in Part I .  
Such a categorical rejection would create more confusion in respect of the applicable law in case of actual damage or harm occurring across international borders or at the global level because of activities pursued or permitted by States within their territory or other areas under their exclusive jurisdiction and control .  
When a State declares an indigenous territory as protected area , any lands , territories and resources under potential or actual claim by indigenous peoples , conservation areas shall not be subject to any natural resource development without the informed consent and participation of the peoples concerned .  
Mr . Hughes ( New Zealand ) speaking on behalf of the delegations of Australia , Canada and New Zealand ( CANZ ) , said that commendable improvements had been made in the peacekeeping budgets for 19992000 : the use of budget techniques that placed more emphasis on actual field experience rather than standard or notional costings had led to significant reductions in the 19992000 estimates and should lead to a decrease in the large unencumbered balances characteristic of recent peacekeeping budgets .  
The Special Rapporteur further recommends State authorities not to take up or continue to engage in development projects that may impair the environment of indigenous lands and / or adversely affect their traditional economic activities , religious ceremonies or cultural heritage , without previously commissioning the appropriate ecological studies to determine the actual negative impact those projects will have .  
The Board of Auditors indicated that in its future audits , it would review the effect of the new currency adjustment policy formulated under the harmonized budget format and would monitor actual budgetary performance based on the principle of linking administrative costs to costs of country programmes , which had been established under the integrated budgeting system .  
In the area of geological map configuration , the combined working methods of remote sensing technology and large-scale multi-picture surveys have reduced the actual costs by one third and the length of field survey routes by about one half compared with conventional methods .  Remote sensing technology has also been applied in archaeology , prospecting , railway and highway construction and marine information services .  
In that context , and notwithstanding the view of some members that the overall level of debt itself constituted a significant burden , the Committee agreed that , should the adjustment be retained , it should be based on actual principal repayments ( what has become known as the debt flow approach ) rather than on an estimate of the repayment of total debt stocks ( what has become known as the debt stock approach ) .  
It is doubtful whether the distinction , although interesting from the theoretical point of view , affects the scope of draft guideline 1.5.1 : either the treaty will be considered to have two actual parties ( despite the number of those contracting ) , and that situation is covered by draft guideline 1.5.1 , or the statement is made by one constituent of the multiple party and is a conventional reservation within the meaning of draft guideline 1.1 .  
The introduction of high-capacity digital telephone lines ( the integrated services digital network , or ISDN ) brought about a significant lowering of communications costs and prompted consideration of remote interpretation as a possible means of increasing cost-effectiveness in the use of staff resources and improving the actual utilization of physical meetings facilities in different conference centres .  
The complementarity of civil and political rights to economic , social and cultural rights must be fully recognized if the latter are to be implemented in accordance with the needs of people and the actual economic potential of the State .  
Many small island developing States find it increasingly difficult to access concessional development finance due to the application of criteria by some members of the international community , which focus on their relatively higher per capita gross national product levels without taking full account of their actual levels of development , vulnerability or standard of living in real terms .  
These include : ( a ) a desire by State or non-State actors in conflict situations to disrupt humanitarian operations which they consider undermine their own political , strategic or military goals ; ( b ) a desire to remove actual or potential witnesses to human rights abuses and other violations of international law ; and ( c ) a general mistrust and suspicion of the motives and intentions of humanitarian organizations .  
All these initiatives have been carried out despite the climate of uncertainty prevailing throughout the country , characterized by potential and actual food shortages , a hard-to-reach population scattered throughout Katanga , and a volatile situation in Kasa hindering the effective distribution of humanitarian assistance ( scattered population , heavy military presence , etc . ) .

He outlined the legal issues that needed to be resolved before the undertaking of actual proceedings , including the definition of applicable laws , both national and international , and procedural questions such as the appointment of personnel , the mechanism for appeals and the requirements for evidence .  
He notes that low levels of disbursement , especially at the local level , continue to erode the already modest share of the national budget allocated to the health sector , and draws attention to the fact that the gap between the budget allocated and actual expenditure is highest for the operating expenses of rural health services , crucial for the well-being of the population .  
It is indeed very disturbing that , not only are external forces continuing to fuel the fighting inside Afghanistan with deliveries of ammunition and other war-making materials , but an increasing number of other nationals are taking part in the actual combat , as well as the planning of military offensives .  
Thus , one of the main objectives of the proposed mechanism should be to elaborate specific and appropriate measures conducive to the removal of actual inadequacies in the process and creation of a system of fair distribution of unavoidable economic and social costs of sanctions .  
Military service has been estimated to be more straining both physically and psychologically , the actual daily / weekly time of duty is longer , there are fewer financial benefits and freedom of movement and other aspects of personal freedom are more restricted .  
If the prospector wishes to claim expenditures for prospecting as part of the development costs incurred prior to the commencement of commercial production , the prospector shall submit an annual statement , in conformity with internationally accepted accounting principles and certified by a duly qualified firm of public accountants , of the actual and direct expenditures incurred by the prospector in carrying out prospecting .  
But the latter faced their own surprises , in the form of the contrasting effects of shock therapy on Poland and the Russian Federation , the actual importance of changes in formal rules ( legislation ) , the possibility of some types of holistic social engineering ( Ellman , 1997 ) , the general acceptance of transformation strains by the populations concerned and the frequent advocacy of gradualism as a veil for slowing down the exit process from socialism .  
Taking the assessment made to its logical conclusion , the Special Rapporteur finds it inherently unjust that , while the actual perpetrators of the attacks have been punished with the full severity of the law , those who recruited , trained and hired them , supplied the materials and explosives , provided them with papers and paid them , are still at large and enjoying full impunity in the countries where they live .  
The excesses of the so-called military justice , a regular cause of arbitrary detention and impunity for human rights violations , as demonstrated by cases brought before the Working Group , have prompted the Group , in its recommendations in previous reports , to underline the need for an international conference to analyse the subject and seek to limit the actual powers of the military justice system ;  
Indeed , it is in the best interest of the process that the procedural issues pertaining to the meetings be carried out in a swift and prudent manner to allow the actual meeting period to be dedicated to more substantive work.We further support the notion reflected in the draft resolution that , with regard to the appointment of the co-chairpersons , there needs to be representation from both developed and developing countries .  
With respect to the issue of categories and size of the Council , it is imperative that we ensure , on the one hand , that all Member States be given a fair opportunity to serve on the Council with reasonable frequency , commensurate with their capabilities actual and potential to contribute to international peace and security and their willingness to do so .  
Many small island developing States find it increasingly difficult to access concessional development finance due to the application of criteria by some members of the international community , which focus on their relatively higher per capita gross national product levels without taking full account of their actual levels of development , vulnerability or standard of living in real terms .  
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions , in paragraphs 37 and 44 of its report dated 3 April 1997 ( A 51-851 and Corr . 1 ) indicated that the actual amount to be approved by the General Assembly would depend on the decision it took on the financing of separation payments for locally employed civilians , bearing in mind that UNFICYP was funded on a voluntary basis prior to 16 June 1993 .  
The investigators must also establish the actual identity and nationality of the mercenary , go through the files , rule out altruistic voluntary enlistment , compile information on recruitment and training centres , follow the trail of covert operations , obtain reliable data on aspects relating to the payment and other benefits agreed upon and detect the simultaneous use of other nationalities and passports , etc .  
The additional requirement of $ 1 , 991 , 900 under this heading resulted primarily from paying an unbudgeted increase in local staff salaries by 61.8 per cent effective on 1 March 1997 and the delayed termination separation of individual local contractors under special service agreements and local staff hired as general temporary assistance based on their actual contract expiration dates , which were mostly in July or August of 1997 , rather than 30 June 1997 .  
The Bank has defined guidelines , has recommended good practices both for data collection and for calculating annual national average prices for ICP items , and has outlined actual operational procedures .  
Nonetheless , the Special Rapporteur is concerned that the potential for abusive withholding of transfer requests is present , irrespective of actual practice , and finds it desirable that such apparent gaps in protection be closed wherever possible , not least to guard against false allegations .  
Although lost profits are not usually regarded as actual damage , in exceptional circumstances , such as wrongful termination by the contracting authority , the current value of expected future profit may be included in the compensation due to the concessionaire ;  
Included under this heading are : ( a ) differences between actual average salary and common staff costs compared with the standards included in the revised appropriations ; ( b ) differences between realized vacancy rates compared with those assumed in the revised appropriations ; and ( c ) adjustments to objects of expenditure other than posts based on actual and anticipated requirements to the end of the biennium .  
In a letter dated 16 March 1999 , the United States Secretary of State , Madeline Albright , stated , The growing prevalence of HIV / AIDS , and its actual and potential deadly impacts , require us to revise our thinking about political and economic security .  
Military service has been estimated to be more straining both physically and psychologically , the actual daily / weekly time of duty is longer , there are fewer financial benefits and freedom of movement and other aspects of personal freedom are more restricted .  
Determining actual and reasonable costs is often difficult for troop contributors to do , especially when they move matriel and personnel by military means and can not therefore easily provide documentary evidence of an acceptable national commercial rate .  
It was recognized that building an effective reporting system , with an analytical focus on actual results achieved against planned objectives , required a gradual process and presented a common challenge shared by other agencies .  
The historical and , alas , still actual misuse of religions and moral philosophies with a universal intent for purposes of domination and control should not obscure the evidence that the sharing of a common humanity is fundamental to the human race .  
Monitoring is the process of comparing common selected indicators or targets against actual performance , whereas surveillance is not only the organized exchange of information but also the means of encouraging remedial policy action at the national level .  
Noting the importance of adherence to internationally accepted norms and principles as well as the need to promote , as required , national and international legislation to meet actual and potential humanitarian challenges ,  
The Sub-Commission , noting that actual or potential conflicts exist between the implementation of the TRIPS Agreement and the realization of economic , social and cultural rights in relation to access to patented pharmaceuticals and the implications for the enjoyment of the right to health , requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to undertake an analysis of the human rights impacts of the TRIPS Agreement .  
There continues to be no sustained rule of law in Equatorial Guinea ; rather , power is concentrated in the hands of the executive , which leads to continued arbitrary detention and torture designed to prevent actual or suspected coup dtat attempts , or in any case to prevent political parties or ethnic groups opposing the governing group from gaining power .  
The Secretary-General endorses the proposed formula for determining the number and salary levels of resident auditors that should be deployed to selected peacekeeping missions , on the understanding that the formula would be used as a guideline and the actual requirements in each case would be based on a detailed assessment of the related risks and other relevant factors .  
In addition to the national reports of Governments on the follow-up to individual conferences , the resident coordinators annual report , prepared in close collaboration with the entire country team , continued in 2000 to be an important source of information on actual inter-agency activities relating to conference follow-up at the country level .  
With regard to additional requirements under mission subsistence allowance , while the approved budget assumed that 10 per cent of international staff would be entitled to the higher rate established for Cape Sierra Hotel , the actual number of staff accommodated at the hotel was higher than the original projections .  
The $ 14.9-million level of net approvals reported under this category takes into account only actual payments received ; future year payments under trust fund agreements signed with donors in 2000 ( and therefore not included in net approvals ) amount to $ 7.9-million .  
Although the actual technology that will be used for some exploration activities , namely the one which will be embodied in the collecting systems and equipment , is not currently known , and current knowledge of the deep-sea environment is insufficient to predict the real impacts of tests of such technology , the environmental disturbances , based on the experience and knowledge gathered from previous activities carried out by the registered pioneer investors and by the scientific community , may be forecast to some extent .
