The project panel set up a deaf club , with its four key members responsible for collecting , unifying and standardizing the natural sign language used by the deaf in daily life .  
Li Jing said that wetlands in the northwest not only account for a large proportion of China 's wetlands but were mainly located in sensitive areas like headwater areas , oases , riversides and inland lakes .  Under natural and human influences , they are not easily recoverable once damaged .  
With regard to ecological protection , the law stipulates : The destruction of public welfare forests , mangrove forests , wetlands , and natural scenery resources protected by law by any unit and individual is prohibited .  The engagement in activities that endanger the survival of rare ocean species of Xiamen and species inside state-level reserves by any unit and individual are prohibited .  
These procedures mainly involve issues with regard to national security , public safety , macro manipulation , environmental protection , development and use of limited natural resources , public resource deployment , public health and interests and safety of lives and property , for which administrative licenses can be granted in line with the Administrative Licensing Law of the People 's Republic of China .  
Mount Wutai is renowned worldwide for its Buddhist culture of a long tradition , unsurpassable exquisite ancient architectural art , as well as the magical and beautiful natural scenery .  It has been nearly 2,000 years since temple construction started in the 11th year of Yongping , Donghan Dynasty ( AD 68 ) .  It has developed into the world 's only Buddhist center where the blue Buddhism ( Chinese Buddhism ) and yellow Buddhism ( Lamaism ) coexist on one mountain and deliver sermons together .  
Among them , natural gas companies in Sichuan and Chongqi regions have respectively signed with US companies such as Texaco , Enron , Mobil , etc . for risk exploration contracts in the Ya'an and Leshan areas ; contracts for improving recovery ratios in the central north of Sichuan , and feasibility joint research agreements on natural gas up and downstream integrated projects in the area of Wenhuangduo in east Sichuan .  
By further increasing cooperation with overseas , and actively introducing foreign capital , technology and management experience , it accelerated the development and utilization of China 's limited oil and natural gas resources in order to make it meet the developing needs of China 's national economy .  
Currently , the natural gas resources found along the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River are mainly distributed in Sichuan Province , the Chongqing Municipality and the northwestern area of Hubei Province , among which Sichuan Province and the Chongqing Municipality 's natural gas resources are the richest .  Oil exploration area has reached 180,000 square kilometers , with a total resource magnitude of 7-trillion cubic meters .  
In recent years , China has been paying close attention to development of the natural gas industry , and has drafted a development strategy for the land-based petroleum industry of " stabilizing the east , developing the west , and increasing oil and gas " .  
It was learned that , China has planned to take advantage of the rich oil gas resources in this area during the " ninth five-year plan " ( 1996 to 2000 ) , through methods such as introducing foreign investment , jointly raising funds with the locality , etc . to build a large-scale combination project of the natural gas industry and the salt industry , which will be capable of producing 120,000 tons of PVC , 100,000 tons of caustic soda , 200,000 tons of synthetic ammonia , and 300,000 tons of carbamide .  
When a reporter asked whether the fact that now a large number of Chinese citizens overstay short-term visas after entering Russia will become a factor in tense relations between China and Russia and how this problem should be solved , Zemin Jiang expressed that with the continuous development of friendly , neighborly relations between China and Russia in recent years , the two countries are no longer isolated from each other , and relations between them have expanded , with rapidly increasing staff contacts .  This process is very natural .  
He holds that according to the experience of Asian energy market development , liquefied natural gas has become the main material of clean fuel used for electricity generation .  When the gross national product per capita reached 3000 US dollars in Japan , South Korea and Taiwan , etc . , environmental protection awareness generally rose , and all began to obviously increase usage of electricity generated by liquefied natural gas .  
He said China was in a critical period of building up a socialist market economy system and increasing the pace of its modernization build-up , but a huge , overwhelming growth in population was still restraining the social and economic development , affecting the further improvement of the living standard of the people , and has also brought about heavy pressure on the natural resources and the natural environment .  
At the same time , when we intensify our efforts in the implementation of the natural forest protection project , we should also experiment with the practice of gradually returning the grain plots to forestry and husbandry in a well-planned way , do a good job in protecting and building a sound ecological environment , clothe barren mountains and wasteland with greenery , restore the vegetation cover , and bring gradual changes to the deteriorating ecological environment in the western region .  
Just as an article published recently by " Renmin Ribao " stated , quickening China 's " entry into WTO " negotiations and enabling China to accede to WTO on an earlier date is at once a natural choice for China in developing a socialist market economy and a need for China in furthering her reform and opening up .  
Purbu Zhoima said : In view of the unique natural , historical , social , and economic background of the population development in Tibet and its specific evolution process , Tibet 's Provisional Management Procedures on Family Planning stipulate : " Tibet pursues on a trial basis a principle of adherence to spreading propaganda on birth control , quality service , and voluntary choice . "  
Wen Jiabao noted : The CPC Central Committee and the State Council have attached great importance to the management of national land and resources ; have set up a number of systems for the unified control of natural resources , including land , mineral , and marine resources ; and have made it clear that same as family planning and environmental protection , the protection and a rational use of natural resources is also considered a basic national policy of our country .  
We should increase our support of expenditures in the public welfare area to ensure that science and technology , education , social security , agriculture , ecological conservation , and other key areas and fields have the necessary funds to meet their expenditure needs .  We should increase our financial support for the establishment of a disaster prevention system , for projects designed to protect natural forests and to return grain plots to forestry , for poverty relief work , and for raising the peasants ' income .  
Wen Jiabao pointed out : From now on , the stress of aiding the poor through development should be laid on the western region , areas inhabited by minority nationalities , old revolutionary base areas , and utterly destitute area with very poor natural conditions .  It is necessary to take effective measures to step up the work of aiding the poor and to change their straitened circumstances .  
He said that although Ningxia is situated inland and its natural conditions are not excellent , its ancient irrigation works , splendid Xixia civilization , and unique customs and cultures are wholly capable of attracting tourists at home and abroad to bring along local economic developments .  
Qinghai is rich in petroleum , natural gas , salt , and nonferrous metal deposits , and it has special climatic conditions for the development of special agriculture and animal husbandry .  There are prospects for attaining development in a leaping-forward way [ kua yue shi de fa zhan 6421-6390-1709-4104-4099-1455 ] in a relatively short period of time , provided that we seize the opportunity , accelerate the progress of reform and opening up , enhance our concept of the market , and pay attention to the scientific and technological content in the exploitation and utilization of resources .  
People-owned enterprises which got rich ahead of others " thought of the sources for their wealth , " actively made contributions back to society , participated in the activities of supporting the poor , supported the Hope Project , gave donations to assist elderly people who lived alone without help , and performed positive functions in the struggle against floods and other natural disasters and providing relief for people in the disaster-stricken areas .  
In socialist construction , areas inhabited by minority nationalities in our country have scored achievements attracting worldwide attention .  Owing to the limitations of natural conditions and for historical reasons , however , there is still a certain gap between the minority-nationality regions and the more developed inland and eastern coastal areas in the levels of economic and cultural development .  
1 .  The fifth natural paragraph of General Program shall be amended as : " Our country shall remain at the primary stage of socialism for a long time to come ( at present ) and be faced with a main contradiction between people 's growing material and cultural needs and backward social production .  Owing to domestic factors and international influence , the struggle waged by our country 's people against hostile forces or hostile elements at home and abroad shall be a long-term one .  
Sometimes , a disease is cured by chance .  It is simply because the illness is not so severe and the patient recovers without any medical treatment due to the fact that he still has a natural resistant power in himself .  In ancient times , people also had a wishful thinking to live a long life .  
Deputy Huang Ju said : Our country is comparatively short of natural resources in terms of per capita quantities .  After economic development reaches a certain level , when facing the rapid scientific and technological progress in the world and the accelerating process of economic globalization , we may take the initiative in moving out of our national boundary and participate in international economic division of work and cooperation at a higher level .  
The outlay of the National Natural Sciences Foundation , in every field of natural science , has subsidized more than 40,000 projects in the more than ten years since 1986 .  In addition , recent financial support has seen a rather large increase , which has brought important functions into play , such as raising the level of the entire system of China 's basic scientific research ; promoting China 's scientific and technological innovation ;  
[ Shi Guangsheng ] Because of historical reasons and natural conditions , the economic foundation of the western region is quite weak .  The overall development level there is evidently much lower than that in the eastern region .  The gap between the two regions in the scale and level of the development of foreign trade and economic cooperation is also quite big .  
First , the western region has obvious advantage in natural resources , such as energy , minerals , tourism , and land .  At present , of the 140 kinds of proven mineral deposits of the country , over 120 are in the central and western region and the deposits of some rare metals there rank first in the country .  
It is necessary to make full use of the unique natural and humane scenic spots and the rich tourist resources with prominent characteristics of the western region to develop tourism for increasing foreign exchange income to promote the development of foreign trade and economic cooperation .  
In the event of their failure in delimitation through consultation , the environmental protection department of the provincial , autonomous regional , or municipal people 's government , in conjunction with the water resources , land and natural resources , health , construction , and other relevant departments of the same level , shall propose a delimitation plan to be submitted to the provincial , autonomous regional , or municipal people 's government for approval .  
Therefore , to stabilize the birthrate , we must persistently focus our attention on people ; under the general situation of the country 's social and economic growth , devote great efforts to eliminate those economic , social , and natural conditions which may affect people 's concept on child birth ; and provide a sufficient material guarantee and a strong spiritual driving power for the change in people 's concept on child birth .  
To be sure , Tibet 's falling behind by far the country 's average development standard is due to both historical and natural factors .  However , we must not lay the blame on objective factors alone .  After all we need to calmly and realistically analyze subjective and operational factors as well .  
Shi Guangsheng : There are many comparative advantages for foreign economic and trade development in the central and western regions .  1 ) They have noticeable advantages in the areas of natural resources including energy , minerals , tourism , land , and so on ; in some areas , they even have unique advantages that other regions do not possess .  
Rich in natural resources , China 's northwestern region enjoys a considerably high manufacturing and technological level , as well as a fairly strong ability in scientific research and development ; and some of the region 's products have proved fairly competitive in the international market .  All these advantages should be brought into better play through reform and readjustment .  
Over the past several years , the CPC Central Committee centered on Comrade Jiang Zemin has been able to grasp the overall situation , engaged in scientific decision-making , and led the entire party and people of all nationalities nationwide in making efforts , resulting in the overcoming of political , economic , and natural difficulties and risks .  
Meanwhile , some national and religious conflicts and some problems left over by history have yet been solved ; the conflicts over territorial land , territorial seas , and natural resources have risen one after another ; and some countries have even attempted to bring in foreign forces to take a hand in the interference in others ' internal affairs .  
Chen Yaobang said : Due to various reasons , such as natural and historical reasons , agricultural and rural economic developments in the western region have been lagging behind and the average per capita income of peasants is quite low .  
Tian Fengshan said : The Ministry of Land and Natural Resources has initially formulated an " outline for development and utilization of land and natural resources in the western region " to ensure that the tapping of minerals and use of underground water will be handled in coordination with the work of ecological protection and returning grain plots to other uses in an orderly manner .  
Tian Fengshan finally told this reporter : In the foreseeable future , the Ministry of Land and Natural Resources will strengthen work in four fields to cope with the needs of large-scale development of the western region : First , we will strengthen the investigation and evaluation of the situation of land and natural resources in China 's western region so as to provide information for economic construction in the western region , especially the rational planning of infrastructure facilities , and to support the harnessing of major rivers , protection of ecological environment and prevention of disasters . 
Replacing an old regime by a new one while the main body of international laws remained unchanged , China 's sovereignty and original territorial borders did not change either .  It is therefore logical and natural that the PRC fully owns and exercises China 's sovereignty rights , including the sovereignty right over Taiwan . At the same time , Taiwan 's Kuomintang authorities no longer have any right to represent China in exercising the right of national sovereignty .  
Our stand of opposing " Taiwan independence " has won the support of all the Chinese people , including the Taiwan compatriots , and met with general approval in the international community .  It has also hit the sore point of " Taiwan independence " elements .  Therefore , some diehard " Taiwan independence " elements are not willing to see the cross-strait relations developing in the direction of the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation because of their natural instinct of " Taiwan independence . "  
When many people regarded " globalization " as an inexorable " objective trend , " a German academic soberly analyzed that the " close connection of the global economy is by no means a natural result , but the result of an intentional practice of a policy to chase the set objectives . "  
Marx pointed out in " Critique of the Gotha Program " that in future society , some of total social output should be set aside for replenishing exhausted means of production , for expanding reproduction , for common needs such as ordinary management expenses , schools , and public health facilities , and for use as reserve or guarantee funds for dealing with unfortunate accidents and natural disasters , and for establishing a fund for people who have lost their laboring ability , and so on .  
Liu Jing said : In the process of implementing the " declaration on the rights and obligations of individuals , groups , and social organizations in enhancing and protecting generally-acknowledged human rights and basic freedom , " which was passed in 1998 , it is natural to encounter various questions .  This is an inevitable fact .  The concern of the international community in this respect is understandable .  
Such practice of using the human rights issue as a political tool to create ideological confrontation and promote hegemonism epitomizes politicization of the human rights issue , utterly violates the purpose and principles of the UN Charter and runs counter to the trend of the times , in which the international community calls for dialogue and cooperation .  It is only natural that the resolution was rejected by a majority of the members of the UN Human Rights Commission , and opposed by the just world opinion .  
Wang Yusheng said : Among all the biological events on earth , the most striking and most sensational events of biological extinction are actually not frightening and are very normal as far as the natural process of biological succession is concerned , because the new superseding the old is a general law of organic evolution .  
With a high forest acreage and abundant hydroelectric resources , it has favorable natural conditions and resources for economic development .  Its annual average agricultural output is three times the residents ' total demand .  It is June now , and waves of golden wheat can be seen everywhere in fields of rich black soil .  
( 9 ) Development of human society from low level stage to higher level is a kind of " natural history process " .  And transiting from socialism to communism is the ultimate goal and necessary result for developing modern social productive forces , which is also the supreme social ideal of communists .  
Taiwan 's armed forces believe that they are bound to lose in any " decisive battle on their beaches and shores " because Taiwan Island is small , shallow in strategic depth , and lacking a room for maneuver , and with the development of modern weaponry , the Taiwan Strait is becoming less and less effective as a natural defense for Taiwan .  
The ice slabs , ice tunnels , and ice trenches in a certain defensive zone were natural obstacles that delayed our tactical movements in the past .  This time , our infantry detachments , which followed the armored cars , were imbued with heroism and forged straight ahead .  Their combat capability has obviously increased .  
The method of citing examples as a proof and the functional method are both scientific methods for studying a problem .  If we can comprehensively use various advanced methods for the studies of social sciences and natural sciences , then we certainly will have more innovative and advanced elements in our research .  We can avoid the tendency of " paying more attention to the studies of military arts than to the scientific and technology foundation " .  
The input into the construction of ecological construction has been noticeably increased .  The engineering projects of returning grain plots to forestry and protecting natural forests and the projects of harnessing " three rivers " ( Huaihe River , Liaohe River , and Haihe River ) and " three lakes " ( Taihu Lake , Dianchi Lake , and Chaohu Lake ) have obtained phased achievements .  The environmental quality in urban areas has improved and the sense of environmental protection among the whole people has noticeably enhanced .  
The state has increased the intensity of investment in the ecological construction , carried out the natural forest protection project in a comprehensive way , activated the experimental project of returning land unfit for cultivation to forestry , prevented and controlled desertification , engaged in the work of soil and water conservation vigorously , controlled the water pollution in some major rivers to reach the targets within the time limit , and took the perpetual use of natural resources and the coordinated development of economy and environment more seriously than ever before .  
In recent years , given the complicated circumstances where international struggles changed tremendously and domestic reforms constantly intensified , and in the face of severe economic , political and natural tests , the united front promoted a united and stable political situation and also created a vigorous and vital democratic atmosphere .  It has relied most on Deng Xiaoping Theory , and united front theory for the new period , in particular .  
As a result , agriculture was generally regarded as an " inferior " industry .  After liberalized reforms , although agriculture and the rural economies have developed rapidly , the issue of " inferiority " has not been fundamentally solved .  In addition to insufficient inputs into agriculture by the government , agriculture was restricted by both natural and market risks , and agricultural conditions increasingly deteriorated .  
Professor Yu frankly admitted that as a developing country with a population of 1.2-billion , China 's per capita natural resources are comparatively scant , its current economic and cultural development is imbalanced , its legal system is not complete , and , in the process of law enforcement , some laws are not strictly abided by and some laws are not strictly enforced - - all these contribute to the non-perfect human rights situation in China .  
He said that , in line with the international trend and existing domestic precedent , using high-tech principles to mix electronic sound with natural sound could unite the opera house and concert hall into one .  That would mean building only an opera house and a Beijing Opera playhouse , or one cultural square with two structures , which would save much investment .  
Over the past 100 years , the world underwent untold tribulations caused bywars , diseases , hunger , crises , and disasters ; but more importantly , the peopleof various countries carried out momentous social and natural struggles on amagnificent scale , and thus made unprecedented progress in the political , economic , ideological , cultural , scientific , technological , education , military , and medical aspects .  
The frozen river had begun melting , and the grass had begun sprouting , for the weather had turned warm .  However , after leaving their barracks , the recruits had no time to watch the natural scenery , for they knew that countless hardships and difficulties were waiting for them on their way forward .  
Yunnan Province has rich tourism resources as it has beautiful natural scenes and pleasant weather .  There are many scenic spots and a rich variety of cultural features and customs of minority ethnic groups .  All this is huge economic potential to be tapped .  
Jiang Zemin said : Venezuela is a country with beautiful mountains and rivers and rich natural resources .  The diligent and courageous Venezuelan people are endowed with glorious historical traditions .  At present , under the leadership of President Chavez , the Venezuelan Government and people are making vigorous efforts to push forward political , economic , and social reform ;  
For instance , our per-capita natural resources are lower than the average global level , insufficient education among our people contrasts with the rapid growth of economic and social management and scientific and technological knowledge , and these kinds of restrictions deny China either a resource advantage or a technological advantage for international economic cooperation .  
At a commendation meeting held today for the national elementary and high school student " Protect the Earth , Love our Home " composition contest , CPC Central Political Bureau member and Vice Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee Jiang Chunyun called for profound and sustained development of natural resources educational activities to allow elementary and high school students to learn about our nation 's basic situation and to establish the idea of protecting natural resources and loving our home from an early age .  
All sectors of the society , all cadres and the masses must adopt the perspective of the strategy of a strong nation , prosperous people , and peaceful world and fully recognize the extreme importance of protecting and reasonably utilizing natural resources .  Furthermore , protecting natural resources and optimizing the ecological environment must become conscious actions .  
Jiang Chunyun emphasized that during the " 10th 5-Year Plan " sustainable development must be made more of a priority and propaganda efforts on the situation of national resources , and the basic national policies , laws , and regulations on protecting natural resources must be greatly intensified in order to strengthen people 's resource hardship consciousness and environmental protection consciousness .  
Land and natural resources management departments must mobilize the power of the entire society to participate in and support the protection and reasonable utilization of natural resources , intensifying education on the national situation of natural resources , national policies and national laws , fully utilizing all forms of media , developing propaganda activities in a variety of formats with abundant contents , strengthening the entire society 's resource hardship consciousness , and forming good habits of cherishing , protecting , and conserving natural resources .  
It is only right and natural that such an action is unacceptable to them .  As to Falungong 's plan to have Falungong elements from overseas gather in Hong Kong to repeat what they did during a previous international gathering , it is another sinister attempt to transform Hong Kong into an anti-Chinese base targeting at the central government .  
National model workers Li Huangxi , Bao Qian , Wang Yiqiang , Sun Haijun , Zhang Ruimin successively spoke on such subjects as striving to be new-type industrial workers in the new era , carrying forward the spirit of doing pioneering work against difficult conditions , rebuilding beautiful natural environment , and enhancing the enterprise 's international competitive power .  
Featured columns on the website , such as " wonderful natural landscapes , " " cultural treasures , " " urban sights , " and " inside Taiwan , " depict famous mountains and rivers and cultural relics and ancient ruins on both sides of the strait , describe the customs and traditions of various ethnic groups , display the long history and splendid culture of China , and provide first-hand accounts of the enormous changes and developments in China today .  
In order to ensure the smooth enforcement of the government and military orders in a special natural , political , and social environment in Tibet , the Tibet Military District CPC Committee spelled out the following requirement in no uncertain terms : " Though there is a forbidden zone for life on the roof of the world , there is no special zone for enforcing the government and military orders here , " thus enhancing a sense of " unconditional submission " among the officers and men .  
Shan Jie has also spared no effort to mobilize the local masses to collect and purchase Wulingzhi , Yizhihao , Hongjingtian , and other natural medicinal herbs which grow on the plateau , and has set up Tibet Kangda Medicines Company Ltd . as the first " joint venture enterprise on the plateau . "  As a result , the county 's annual financial revenue has risen by 6 million yuan .  
According to the regulations of the Constitution and the regional national autonomy laws , after the establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region , Tibet enjoys autonomy in many aspects like legislation , use of its national languages , personnel management , management and development of natural resources , and so on .  Therefore , the cultural traditions , customs and habits , languages , and so on of the people of all nationalities in Tibet have been fully respected and the political , economic , social and all other rights have been reliably safeguarded .  
Li Liguo noted : On 23 May 1951 , the Central People 's Government and the former local government of Tibet signed a 17-clause " Agreement on Procedures Concerning the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet " ; and the People 's Liberation Army entered Tibet , drove out imperialist forces , and brought true both the peaceful liberation of Tibet and the unification of the mainland motherland .  This was a major event in China 's modern and contemporary history , and a natural and epoch-making turning point in the historical development of Tibet .  
Except for a small number of social security objects , an exceptionally poor population living in areas with harsh natural conditions , as well as a certain number of the disabled , we have now basically resolved the problem of insufficient food and clothing for the poverty-stricken population in rural areas across the country , and have basically fulfilled all anti-poverty targets set by the central authorities .  
Asia is the world 's most populous region where most developing countries are situated , which have numerous newly rising markets , various natural resources , and investment effect with unlimited potential .  
To put it another way , we believe that like the natural world , the world of mankind is rich and colorful in nature , and the layout of world political and economic systems and order [ based on ] legal principles of international relations must fit and promote the realization of this diversity .  
We have made brilliant achievements in aiding and developing poverty-stricken areas , however , we should be aware that the production means and living in the poor areas have not yet been basically improved .  These poor areas are hardly capable of resisting natural disasters , their levels of production and social growth are comparatively low , and the gap between them and coastal developed areas keeps expanding .  
It critically incorporated British and French utopian socialism 's theory on fairness and justice in human society , the rational cores of dialectics of Germany 's classical philosophy and materialism , British classical political economy 's method for dissecting the capitalist economy , and intellectual pith in the latest achievements of natural sciences .  
Thus it is very natural for the Chinese people bullied and humiliated by superpowers from Western countries and domestic reactionary forces over the past 100-plus years ? to look forward to the socialist ideal - expect their country to be prosperous , rich and strong , but without the phenomena of a huge gap between the rich and the poor and the weak being bullied by the strong .  
During a recent inspection tour of Sichuan , Zhu Rongji , member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and premier of the State Council , pointed out that the implementation of the project to protect natural forests and the experiments on returning farmland land to forests at selected points have progressed smoothly and remarkable results have been obtained .  In particular , this has further speeded up the economic development of areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups .  
He said that party committees and governments at all levels in Sichuan have seriously implemented a series of central principles and policies to strengthen the protection and improvement of the ecological environment , taken the lead in launching the project to protect natural forests and making experiments on returning farmland to forests , taken prompt actions with a resolute attitude , done solid work and adopted effective measures .  They have enabled the people to consciously implement the party 's policies , accumulated much successful experience , and attained remarkable achievements .  
In particular , it should attach great importance to , and earnestly speed up , the development of tourism .  Sichuan has rich and colorful tourist resources .  It particular , it has cultural sites of historic interest , world-famous natural heritage , unique and fantastic natural scenery , and unique local ethnic customs and practices .  
We should strive for diversification of property rights through multiple forms , such as standard public listing of companies , mutual purchase of shares by legal persons , domestic natural person investment , foreign investment , conversion of bank credits rights to equity , market share subscription , stock right transaction , and the holding of shares by employees of a company , and gradually establish and improve a standard system of corporate governance .  
The mainland resident journalists have reported in objective fashion on Taiwan 's political , economic , and social situation and its natural conditions and social customs .  Their reports have been welcomed by compatriots on both sides of the strait , increased mainland people 's understanding of the state of affairs in Taiwan , and played a positive role in strengthening cross-strait understanding and contact .  
The two parties will cooperate in protecting and improving the environment , in preventing cross-border pollution , in the fair and rational use of biological resources in waters in the border area and in the north Pacific and border river courses , and will work together to protect rare plants and animals and the natural ecological system in the border areas , and cooperate in preventing natural disasters and major accidents arising from technical causes and in eliminating their consequences .  
Protecting and improving the environmental conditions , making fair and rational use of waters in the border region and biological resources in the north Pacific and in border river courses , and protecting plants and animals and preventing natural disasters in the border regions - - all these are new fields in which the two countries can cooperate .  
In the first 10 years plus since the implementation of reform and opening up , the gap between the level of Tibet 's economic and cultural development with the inland and the inland as well as the coastal developed areas in the east showed a trend of further widening instead of shrinking because Tibet was restricted by natural conditions and because of historical reasons .  
Although technology objectively has a negative impact on the environment , this negative viewpoint is basically a flimsy excuse .  With the economic development and the people 's understanding being raised to a higher and higher level , the people will make a higher and higher demand for a quality life and a healthy , comfortable environment .  This will basically restrict the living space of the technology featuring excessive exploitation of natural resources and will help promote the development of environmentally friendly technology .  
Answer : As " The Regulations " protects only the oil and natural gas pipelines and facilities owned by the whole people , faced with such a new situation that foreign investors will get involved in building pipelines and facilities in the future , we have decided to make " The Regulations " applicable to all the oil and natural gas pipelines and facilities within the PRC . 
In particular , irregular school fees for primary and secondary school pupils , irregular fees for rebuilding power grids and power supply facilities , irregular fees for housing construction , coercive subscription of newspapers and journals , and fees collected for unrealistic upgrading activities must be stopped .  The local authorities must not be allowed to raise funds in violation of the established policies for various purposes and under various excuses .  This year , some areas were seriously afflicted by natural disasters , and the masses there encountered difficulties in their production and daily livelihood .  
The Japanese prime minister 's brazenly paying his respects shows that Yakusuni Shrine is a symbol of aggressive war ; it has overtones of a public and official provocation , and indicates contempt for the people of those countries which suffered from that aggression .  It recalls for those people the pain they suffered , so is it not something natural , a matter of course , for the Chinese people to express their strong indignation and firm opposition ?  
In making plans , therefore , we should base ourselves on the present and have our eyes on the future , and combine the solution of the current outstanding problems with the realization of the long-term development objectives .  Our plans should both reflect the spirit of emancipating the mind and positively forging ahead , and conform to the principle of seeking truth from facts and following the objective laws .  In particular , adequate considerations should be given to the natural and geographical conditions and the actual circumstances of various localities .  
The total accumulated known deposits of natural gas in China 's western region is 1,500 billion cubic meters and the annual production capacity has reached 18 billion cubic meters , which far exceed the actual local need .  
Owing to the historical , geographical , natural conditions , and other reasons , it has generally formed into three regions , i.e . , eastern , central , and western regions in terms of economic development level , of which the eastern region is the highest , the western region is the lowest , and the central region is in between .  
This is because the natural conditions in some areas are abominable , the distance between cities in the region is very long , and that between the western cities and the eastern developed areas is even longer , and the infrastructure , economic foundation , and social and human conditions are relatively weak .  The development of the western region needs a huge amount of input , but the return rate of some input items is low in the short time .  
Although quite a few areas in the western region have rich resources , owing to the abominable natural conditions such as shortage of water , extremely poor transport facilities , harsh climate , and others , it needs serious exploration into how they should exploit their favorable conditions to the full and avoid the unfavorable ones .  
In the future , the eastern region should more positively explore the modes of cooperation for mutual benefits in light of the market economic rules by way of , for example , going to make investment in the western region for the exploitation of natural resources , participating in some companies there through shareholding , transferring some commodities to the western region in which there are greater benefits in producing such commodities , and so forth . 
The Chinese Government 's strategy of a large-scale west development is a long-term system project which has a vital importance to the country 's overall situation ; therefore , its development pattern will differ from that of a traditional regional development .  What is more , instead of being just a simple exploration of natural resources , the large-scale development of the western region aims to bring about a comprehensive and well-coordinated economic and social development to the western region through a series of capital , technological , and manpower inputs .  
In recent years , the state has increased the implementation intensity of the project for the protection of natural vegetation ; at the same time , it has adopted such policies and measures as " returning grain plot to forestry , closing hillside to facilitate afforestation , relieving people in disaster areas by giving them grain instead of outright grant , and introducing a contractual operation on individual household basis . "  Meanwhile , the state has also incorporated the work of environmental protection into the legal system .  
The foreign environmental protection enterprises ' natural link with the market economy enables them to gain advanced experiences in operational mechanism , market concepts , innovation awareness , personnel and distribution system , and others which are suited to the market economy .  These are useful experiences that the domestic environmental protection enterprises can use for reference in their development , reform , and transformation of operational mechanism at a faster pace so as to suit the major development trend of the environmental protection markets all over the world .  
Tian pointed out : The western regions are rich in natural resources but have a rather fragile ecological environment .  In particular , they are short of river resources and have suffered from serious soil erosion .  Thus the scientific and technological units and scientific and education personnel should directly participate in the work of harnessing soil erosion and building the ecological environment .  
In making plans , therefore , we should base ourselves on the present and have our eyes on the future , and combine the solution of the current outstanding problems with the realization of the long-term development objectives .  Our plans should both reflect the spirit of emancipating the mind and positively forging ahead , and conform to the principle of seeking truth from facts and following the objective laws .  In particular , adequate considerations should be given to the natural and geographical conditions and the actual circumstances of various localities .  
The total accumulated known deposits of natural gas in China 's western region is 1,500 billion cubic meters and the annual production capacity has reached 18 billion cubic meters , which far exceed the actual local need .  
Owing to the historical , geographical , natural conditions , and other reasons , it has generally formed into three regions , i.e . , eastern , central , and western regions in terms of economic development level , of which the eastern region is the highest , the western region is the lowest , and the central region is in between .  
This is because the natural conditions in some areas are abominable , the distance between cities in the region is very long , and that between the western cities and the eastern developed areas is even longer , and the infrastructure , economic foundation , and social and human conditions are relatively weak .  The development of the western region needs a huge amount of input , but the return rate of some input items is low in the short time .  
Although quite a few areas in the western region have rich resources , owing to the abominable natural conditions such as shortage of water , extremely poor transport facilities , harsh climate , and others , it needs serious exploration into how they should exploit their favorable conditions to the full and avoid the unfavorable ones .  
In the future , the eastern region should more positively explore the modes of cooperation for mutual benefits in light of the market economic rules by way of , for example , going to make investment in the western region for the exploitation of natural resources , participating in some companies there through shareholding , transferring some commodities to the western region in which there are greater benefits in producing such commodities , and so forth .

As more and more people have moved into new homes in urban high-rise buildings , they have inevitably missed the natural environment of the countryside . To overcome this sense of loss , many apartment dwellers have turned to artificial gardens , complete with trees , flowers , hills , pavilions , bridges , ponds and flower pots usually based on the style of the Chinese traditional garden .  
Lin pointed out that as a precious Chinese cultural legacy , the art of flower arrangement was popular in the Sui and Tang dynasties ( 589-907 A . D . ) , when it was first introduced to Japan . Wild flowers and natural raw materials are endowed with new vitality when they are arranged artistically , giving an elegant and refined look to the most mundane surroundings .  
About 300 years ago , the first migrations of Chinese to Taiwan began . The new arrivals struggled to make a living , but faced many unexpected natural calamities . Taiwan is on the earthquake belt , it is also afflicted by typhoons , and because its climate is tropical or subtropical , disease was more rampant .  
The red skin of the gourd 's seeds are the ingredient of a very popular natural dye . According to medical research reports , the bitter gourd has cancer inhibiting properties . Says Lin Jong-yao , professor of biochemistry at the National Taiwan University , " Certain elements in bitter gourd seeds have been found effective in controlling the spread of cancer in guinea-pigs . "  
If we do not push hard for advanced development , how can we compete with other industrial countries ? For people who assumed nature 's resources to be infinite , the energy crunch of the 1970 ' s was a rude awakening , an indication of impending environmental crises stemming from careless spoiling and waste of natural resources .  
The rapid reduction in the sweet potato crop reflects two phenomena : First , the movement of the rural population to the cities . Even though the sweet potato does not require much care , its planting and harvesting still require lots of manpower . Second , although many poor-land fields were left unused , in rice-growing areas some paddy fields are used for both rice and sweet potatoes to make the most of natural conditions . Sweet potatoes can be grown between the two growing periods of paddy rice , getting full use out of a field .  
He told the Executive Yuan that large-scale investment and planning should be effected to make the region a protected area . In 1981 , the Home Administration invited experts in park and environmental planning to assist in organization of the national park scheme . The team spent one year investigating the plant and animal life in the area , as well as the geology , climate and natural ecology of the entire peninsula .  
People must be educated to appreciate the importance of environmental protection , Shih Meng-hsuing stressed , if the ideals of the national park concept are to be realized . People in Taiwan , he explained , lack concern for preservation of natural resources ; both tourists and local residents indiscriminately pocket shells and coral and carry off rare plant and animal life . The thoughtless littering of park and beach areas is also a serious problem which could lead to serious damage , especially to those more sensitive areas like the fragile coral reefs .  
Situated at the confluence of three rivers in the southwest corner of Taipei County , Sanhsia is an area rich in both history and natural scenery . Once a flourishing agricultural trade center and forty years ago a booming coal-mining town , Sanhsia has over the years been supported by the local tea industry and the commerce which the rivers bring . Today , one of the few places where Ching dynasty architecture and a traditional tea market ' can still be seen , Sanhsia offers much of historical significance to the visitor .  
A thin rind , a slightly powdery feel and a soft fresh stem are all recognizable signs of a good melon . A summer cooler , a natural , nutritious , medicinal fruit and the subject of popular lore - - the watermelon is a flavorful treat enjoyed by one and all . ( Gerald Hatherly )  
As elsewhere in Taiwan , land is used to its best advantage in Chuolan . The verdant mountainsides provide a suitable and scenic setting for fruit cultivation and the area 's inherent features - - such as its excellent natural drainage - - are fully exploited by the local farmers .  
Its renown is further enhanced by lovely , natural scenery highlighted by green , cool , forestclad hills , while its fertile fields produce choice blends of soothing teas and the flavorful chestnut .  
Located in the southern portion of Nant'ou County , Chushan is bordered on the east by Luku Township and to the south by Yunlin County 's Kuk'eng . The natural topography of the area has helped to shape Chushan 's unique character . The rugged , majestic peaks of the Central Mountain Range bisect the area and two sparkling rivers , the Ch'ing Shui Hsi and the Cho Shui Hsi meander through its borders .  
Limited land and natural resources creates real problems for directing future industrial development of the nation 's economy . This , however , is offset by a fabulous pool of human resources reflected in a highly educated population and proportionally high percentage of skilled engineers .  
Later the action of plate tectonics ( based on the theory of continental drift ) caused the island to separate . During the recurring periods of glaciation ( from 10,000 to 25,000 years ago ) the waters receded from the Taiwan Straits leaving a natural land bridge which provided a corridor for numerous bird and animal species .  
The Taoist ideal of being one with nature , escaping the confines of daily life to a solitary existence among the forests and mountains has long played an important part in the general appreciation and popularity of traditional landscape painting . But long before this artistic appreciation became prominent , the natural forms of the mountain and the river were held in great esteem by the early Chinese . The ancient Chinese had a deep interest in the mystic form of mountains .  
This added to the fact that Soochow is blessed with an abundance of water , fertile soil and a favorable climate , helped to produce some of the most breathtaking scenery in China . The intellectual pool that was present in Soochow combined with the natural conditions to mold the limited space into a realm of boundless beauty .  
" Taiwan 's economic progress over the past thirty or more years has raised living and educational standards and increased the desire of the populace to participate in politics . This , together with other changing objective conditions , has made ' lifting martial law ' and ' opening up the formation of new political parties ' a natural decision , " says government spokesman Chang King-yuh .  
In the rapidly changing industrial society of today , where values are constantly changing , youths are especially ready and willing to accept all kinds of fresh things and events . With the addition of the all-pervasive modern mass media , it is only natural that young people should have concepts and ways of doing things which are different from those of their elders in the preceding generation .  
The majority of Ch'en Keng-pin 's photos are of natural scenery , where his employment of crystal-clear priorities and a delicate , quality feel took the place of the typically obscure , artificial beautification of other photographers . These attributes provided a more direct and powerful expression to the essential face of his photography .  
These observations coincide closely with records concerning saris in the Buddhist scriptures . " The article went on to explain that " the reasons for the formation of gallstones can be hereditary , or one 's natural physical constitution , while the majority stem from a lack of physical excercise , a build-up of bile in the gallbladder , or irregular eating habits . . . . The late Hsin Jung vanished into monastic life at the age of sixteen and spent 32 years living as a monk .  
Even after mounting the more than seventy steps to arrive at the cottage , the callers must be prepared for another climb . For , inside the cottage , the floor is laid more or less in line with the natural incline of the hill side . Callers may be surprised at the sloping floor , but as for me , familiarity breeds callousness - - I am now scarcely aware of the fact . Going from my study to the dining room is up-hill work .  
No wonder an eminent architectural scholar describes these ancient craftsmen as " singers of nature " : profoundly versed in the natural world and steeped in culture , they used their rich spirit to create such a lovely , harmonious work of art .  
Currently R . O . C . agriculture has major weaknesses . First , natural agricultural production can not compete with mechanized industrial production , leading to an outmigration of labor , which affects the ability of agriculture to continue to develop ; Second , small farm operations lack economy of scale , leading to a low return on resources , which in turn influences the raising of real incomes of farmers .  
The goal of national park management is to conserve treasured natural scenic areas in Taiwan which are judged to be of national or international significance . Besides pursuing conservation goals , park administration is aimed at providing sites for scientific studies , educational training , and recreational activities .  
In view of the greater access to improved modes of travel , the Tourism Bureau intends to transform the Yueh-mei Farm in Taichung County into an amusement complex with varied functions . The complex is designed to reflect traditional Chinese culture and yet present the natural sciences and modern science and technology . The Bureau will also promote private investment in tourist hotels and recreational facilities in the area .  
One type of entertainment we discovered back then - - which had both aural and visual appeal - - was watching the quilt man fluff up the cotton for the inside of quilts . Tbe big quilt-beating bow suspended from his back and the wooden mallet he held in his hand made a low , reverberating noise that at times rang out sharp and clear . The sound had a natural rise and fall to it , a complex yet orderly melody that was quite pleasant to hear .  
Its white walls were not adorned with wall-paper , but instead with a few small , exquisite , framed pictures that were casually put there . The whole shop is not very large , but the high staircase and the soft music fit the pace of the fifties , which resembles a natural , unforced pulse beat .  
In the 1950s and ' 60s people began searching for natural and manmade causes for continued poor growth of forests in Scandinavia . Many countries with stunted forest growth discovered that their rain was very acidic , some with an acid-base value as low as 4 . Since tree growth is closely dependent on water and soil quality , acid rain was suspected to be the principle cause of sluggish forest growth and a major acid rain research effort was launched .  
This year local commodity prices , which caused enough complaint before , have been affected by a " bad year " in terms of both natural and man-made disasters . Since the middle of August when Typhoon Yancy struck , Taiwan has weathered typhoons Abe and Dot in quick succession , causing enormous losses in farm produce .  
For many Taiwan businessmen , these conditions are lax and lenient , not to mention such advantageous factors as the countries ' spacious living environment , their rich natural resources , temperate climate and relative proximity to Taiwan . According to a survey by the Institute of Ethnology at Academia Sinica , Australia now stands even with the United States as the most alluring land of milk and honey for potential emigrants from Taiwan , and New Zealand ranks number five .  
Brazil was an attractive enough place for immigrants then . With excellent public facilities , a free open economy and plentiful natural resources , it was a paradise offering unlimited opportunities for the immigrant with energy to spare . "  
Five years ago , a major battle was fought in the media between the natural ecology and communications construction . The result was that the " egg " ( the environment ) defeated the " stone . " The New Central Cross-Island Highway had originally been planned to cut across the Central Mountain Range to Yuli in Hualien . But because Yushan National Park was " a single man able to hold a narrow mountain pass against an army , " the plan was shrunk so that the road became the park 's " scenic highway . "  
Though studying this or that ever since I was a child , I maintained a playful attitude and was always looking for something to throw myself into with all my heart , " Tsai recalls . After a teacher discovered that he had natural talent for the high jump in junior high school , he began to compete . At one time he had the junior high school record in the event , and he was crowned district champion . " And so I started thinking my life would be in track and field , " he says .  
Chen Er-nan , a planner / designer at Hong Jian Industries , which accounts for half of the domestic market in man-made polyesters , says that natural silk is colder to the touch , that it is more rough and textured when rubbed , and that real silk lets air pass through , making it more comfortable to wear . Fake silk is warmer , and tends to be more smooth and shiny .  
The period of tsarist conservatism at the end of the nineteenth century emphasized study of the classics and intellectuals were not allowed to delve into the natural sciences . Because Moscow was far removed from the center of power - - then in St Petersburg - - it became the hotbed of developments in the natural sciences and established a solid scientific structure .  
It was not long before they came to accept this as natural - - if you wanted to get ahead then you had to actively take part in the League , national mass study organizations and social work . Moreover , there could be no questioning of communist thinking ; otherwise one would be seen as a rebel and expelled from the League , making further study impossible .  
A Young Forty : It 's a natural human instinct to love singing . Although some criticize Taiwan 's KTV culture as being vulgar , and there are even more people who loudly complain that you have to go to supplementary school even for karaoke , for the vast majority of those who love to sing , whatever the cost in time and money , it 's worth it for that moment of joy of singing a song well , and soaking up the sounds of applause .  
Even on clear days it is still a bit cloudy , and thus the Taiwanese downstream called it " the murky river . " But the natural color of the Lele River did not detract from its great beauty . The two rivers flowed between the grandiose mountains with a steady flow of water and abundant water resources as if to announce the eternity of nature . . . .  
It certainly was n't that the river lacked natural resources - - the middle and upstream stretches of the Lele abound in precious lumber , and the Taiwan Provincial Bureau of Mines discovered abundant deposits of white marble in Walami , along the middle stretches of the river . Thirteen companies applied to mine there and were itching to go .  
Casual and easygoing in real life , she came to the studio dressed in a house robe and slippers , just like the character she played , which was down-home , offbeat and outspoken . Even though hers was only a supporting role , her natural , unaffected style of acting won over audiences and made the show a hit , boosting her career to new heights .  
" Shuishalien : Originally the name of the local aboriginal tribes in the Puli - - sun Moon Lake area ; surrounded on four sides by mountains at an altitude of about 500 meters , it is the geographic center of Taiwan with many natural springs and a moderate climate ; the tea produced there has a unique flavor and its water is perfect for tea . "  
At a time of limitless expectations about a prosperous future , we have no way to avoid the heavy costs of technology : environmental pollution , the rapid depletion of natural resources , and even human vulgarity .  
They need more care : Of course , these children would n't need extra guidance if they did n't have problems . Every teacher is aware that very few children are able to make decisions of their own about their course in life . Assailed from every direction - - their natural talents , family environment , educational level , social status and so forth - - children who did n't have a very firm grasp on the tiller to begin with may easily wind up shaken and at a loss . "  
There is still much room for discussion about whether zoos should be closed , but those trying to maintain a little conventional dignity must be careful in censuring others as inhumane . Children may not be grateful to us for closing zoos , but if zoos use destroying the natural environment as an excuse to exist , then the next generation will be even less grateful , I 'm afraid !  
China 's ancient books have been through human and natural disasters with countless numbers having been destroyed and lost . There are no certain statistics concerning just how many still survive in the world today . Moreover , with there being much space for dispute over how antique works should be carefully determined and compared , it is even more difficult to put numbers on them .  
Besides the hardware and shape , traditional ho-yuan also extolled a natural , layered and shifting spacial notion . Could this be applied in a vital , living way to modern architecture ?  
The natural distribution of heavy metals has been disturbed and they have been dispersed from their originally secure ecological position . In the course of life and industrial production people lack any real sense of alarm about all this . With the failure to take precautions the situation has gradually become harder to contain .  
Water comes from heaven . " In agricultural societies , things which are filtered out with water are all organic matter that can be broken down and returned to the natural cycle . Thus , in several places in north Taiwan which are relatively short of water , the agricultural irrigation system and the town or village drainage system were linked together , so that water could be circulated and reused , thus saving water resources .  
The tropical climate of heavy rains and high temperatures typical of the Indochina Peninsula is a natural hothouse for banana growing . Vietnam 's land , ten times larger than Taiwan 's , provides broad spaces to roam , and Pan Viet chairman C . F . Chang moved quickly to seize the investment opportunity .  
In 1988 , which was the second year after Vietnam began to permit foreign investment , Chang came by himself to Ho Chi Minh City . Upon inspecting local conditions , he discovered that the natural surroundings in southern Vietnam closely approximate those in the banana growing areas of central and southern Taiwan .  
Besides the consideration of low land costs , the concept of " bringing Taiwan 's experience in agriculture together with Vietnam 's natural resources " is just right for what the Vietnamese government - - stuck with backward local production methods and an urgent need to close the gap between city and country - - wants and needs . It has thus won their strong support .  
Before the discovery of the microscope , and before " ecological observation " became popular , when our ancestors saw these insects emerge from soft earth and light up , they imagined that the firefly was a metamorphosis from rotting leaves or decaying bamboo . The saying , " On summer nights , rotting grass turns into fireflies , " was a natural result of observing transformations as the weather changed from season to season .  
Wang Chen-yi , secretary-general of the Association of Taiwanese Ballads , who has been to the mainland many times , contends that as ko-tzai-hsihas been developing for less than 100 years , it has the special characteristic of being thoroughly plain and simple . For example , singing is done in a natural voice , with the transitions gentle . Movements are smoother , more suave , closer to the style of southerners .  
What Lin calls " knowing the earth " involves becoming familiar with different geographical environments . High mountains , rivers and marine islands all have their different appearances and their own special types of plants and animals ; tropical , temperate and frigid zones have their own natural conditions that can not be confused .  
Since people 's environments ( both natural and social ) are extremely variegated and complex , preventing people from having firsthand knowledge of all of the people , matters and things in the world , sociologists have theorized that people by necessity simplify things , making people who share one characteristic - - such as old people or poor people conform to a single mold .  
Taoist doctrine was originally developed from the thinking of the Taoist masters . These masters actually preached passive inaction and following nature , but Taoist doctrine turned this basic naturalism into a different kind of reasoning which affirmed that various " natural " methods , such as alchemy and controlled breathing , could actually resist the limitations of nature and extend life without limitation .  
She is well aware that as an emigrant returning to her native land to work , although she has various natural advantages such as knowing English , making friends easily , and being more easily forgiven if she speaks out of line , on the other hand she has to become accustomed to things which other people are already used to , learn the demands of the local market , and overcome the difficulties of communicating in a language which she only half understands .  
But tidal land after all is n't like ordinary land . Although it escapes environmental protests and other social complications , there are a lot of " natural complications " that can arise by developing tidal lands : soft and muddy soil , erosion from the waves , climatic changes , and flooding . The difficulty of overcoming these challenges is no less than the other challenges on terra firma .  
Perhaps he concentrated too intently on the glottal , natural style of traditional singing . When receiving Western style vocal training at the Institute of Art , for a while Buhe could not sing at all . The contradictions made him ponder whether it was not impossible to express traditional songs using the abdominal singing techniques of the West .  
Early on in the era of Japanese occupation , Chihpen was an aboriginal dwelling place . The Japanese discovered , in the Chihpen stream between southern slopes of a mountain and the river bed , a natural hot spring , gushing out warm water . The water 's temperature was moderate ( between 45and 56 ) ; it had a dense concentration of hydrogen ions ( 7% to 8% ) . This was a very good spring , colorless , odorless , and only slightly salty .  
The cloud leopard 's den : Auvini 's work is multi-faceted , and it mainly involves publishing newspaper articles about his interviews and research , which focus on traditional customs , tribal history , myths , legends , taboos , etc . He has discovered rules that anthropologists overlooked governing how the Haocha people placed their dead in their own homes . For example , men who died from natural causes were buried in front of the central pillar , whereas women were placed beneath a platform by the window .  
Actually this is partly because since people feared vicious dogs , it was only natural for them to compare them jestingly with the even more ferocious tiger , as in this joke about an " illiterate dog " : In olden times legend had it that the written character for tiger , or the character for the tiger 's associated Earthly Branch yin , had the power to subdue a dog . There was once a dog which liked to bite people , and everyone was afraid of it and did not dare to pass it .  
The " seed bank , " which is seen by Horticulture Department researchers as " top secret , " is similar to any other greenhouse except that it has two locks on the door . Inside are collected 29 natural varieties of moth orchids ( there are a total of 45 natural varieties worldwide , with two native to Taiwan ) , as well as 837 improved strains .  
In the 1990s , the focus for travel is on " fresh and natural , nostalgic and nativist , fixed locations to pass a holiday . " Many new natural scenic spots , such as national parks and forest recreation areas have become the new darlings of the travelling population .  
Generally speaking , the local buildings are in fresh , bright colors , and the walls and masonry , set against the natural background of green and blue , are quite eye-catching .  
In the 1950s , Taiwan received a great deal of aspirations to escape from the post-war hardships and to catch up with advanced Western civilization , young artists organized the " Orient " and " May " art associations . These sought a liberation of images , and declared total war on traditional ink painting and on natural realism . They argued that art must inevitably progress from the concrete to the abstract ; in their view " abstract expressionism , " with only basic shapes and colors , was the only end point of artistic development .  
In recent years the many new galleries springing up in the south have stressed natural subject matter , and bright and intense colors , quite different from the cool style of northern Taiwan .  
Swatting a fly with a hammerThe ingredients for Chinese medicine are taken from the natural world , and are limited by such factors as geographical spread . Unlike the supply of Western medicine , which is determined by factory production , the supply for Chinese medicine is not stable . Supply problems for ingredients used in Chinese medicine are nothing new , but over several thousand years , numerous plants have been found to have similar effects to those in short store .  
His works are first baked unglazed at 1200 . Such a temperature is perfect for effecting a warm , smooth , touchable quality . lf the temperature were higher , the clay would be far too hard ; at a lower temperature , the clay would crumble . After his pottery is fired unglazed , it is smoked with firewood . Then he chooses a complementary material derived from a natural element , such as metal , wood , stone or glass ( representing water ) to combine with the pottery .  
From these everyday natural ingredients he completes a work of art . The hues of the glaze are restrained , serene and firm ; they are the colors of Lungteng Village , colors whose power pours forth from the inside , reflecting its master 's wild head of hair and spirited eyes . Earth and man draw near to each other !  
In a photograph , a concrete model animal , of a kind which can be seen anywhere in Taiwan , is pictured in the most natural , realistic style ; it looks so false - - and yet so real .  
Professor B . J . Habibie , Indonesia 's State Minister for Research and Technology , has said publicly : " At some stage Singapore , with its limited natural and human resources but rapid economic growth , is certain to reach a critical pressure , just like a balloon ; and Batam , 20km south of Singapore , is ready to catch the balloon which will be squeezed out of Singapore 's balloon . "  
The explanation is very simple : the ancients gathered their knowledge completely from nature ; they inferred a direct relation between the waxing and waning of the natural world and the birth and death of every human being . When would the fish swim up to the water 's surface through the broken ice ? When would the swallows arrive ? When would the crops bloom and wither ?  
Although Lisa studied opera with her mother and godfather , her mother discouraged her from seeking a career in the field , emphasizing that in addition to strict training , Peking opera singers also needed natural talent - - a sonorous voice , refined features and a strong and vigorous figure . "  
On the next outdoor shoot he was confronted with another group of indigenous people who were facing an even more pessimistic , miserable fate than the city 's construction site aborigines . They live in illegal buildings which are soon to be torn down . This time , he put aside his natural feelings of sympathy for his compatriots , and conducted his story carefully with a cool heart . Although still in a terrible mood , he shed no more tears .  
In an extreme example of the principle of natural selection , only the strongest could survive the journey home , thus maintaining the durability and health of the whole species . However , when the ice receded , many brook masu salmon were left stranded , unable to return to the sea . They had no choice but to become " landlocked " salmon .  
Previously salmon had taken advantage of different types of topography to adapt to natural disasters . Today there are no pools for them to escape to , and when heavy rains come the fish are washed downstream . No fish , no matter how strong , can overcome the meters-high dams to get back upstream , so they are left to die from the higher water temperatures downstream .  
In the earliest days , mankind 's power to fend off natural dangers was very weak , and people were terrified of the strength and ferocity of the tiger . This fear gave rise to respect , and a certain degree of mystification . The stone carvings and bronzeware of the Shang and Chou dynasties all emphasize the tiger 's sharp claws and fierce countenance . " At the dawn of civilization , this was humankind 's main impression of the tiger , " believes Lin Po-ting , curator of painting and calligraphy at the National Palace Museum .  
To make redbraised beef noodle soup , generally the meat is fried with chilli and broad bean paste , then simmered with such spicy and aromatic ingredients as chopped garlic , coriander and ginger . The strong flavor naturally tends to mask any rankness in the beef , but it also covers the meat 's own flavor . But a clear broth brings out the natural flavor of the beef , so the meat 's selection and preparation require particular care .  
Twelve years ago the first book in the ROC to promote ecological conservation , We Only Have One Earth , was published . From that time until today , a rich selection of publications focusing on the natural environment has been produced in Taiwan , following the progressive development of environmental consciousness here . Recently a publishing house has even been established specializing in books about nature .  
In response to the human culture and natural environment of the Lanyang Plain , Wang Chen-hua incorporated many features often seen in old Ilan houses into the Chung home , such as turtle-shell pattern windows , and openings in walls in the shape of peaches and pomegranates , which symbolize good fortune . To cope with the local climate of fierce sunshine and abundant rainfall , the roofs have very broad eaves . In the central courtyard one can watch the rain and listen to its melody .  
Another example is monitoring of changes in forested areas . Keeping up with destructive exploitation or natural disasters ( like forest fires ) by using traditional survey techniques is time-consuming yet not timely , because of the huge extent and frequent inaccessibility of forested land ( which is often concentrated in remote mountain areas with no roads ) . Satellite surveys , on the other hand , cover huge areas and can be collected regularly , making them an invaluable tool .  
In recent years , wild animals raised in captivity have been given more living space and more natural surroundings . Still , says Marcus Phipps of TRAFFIC , there are still some extremist animal rights groups overseas who wish to close all zoos and sea-world theme parks , with the goal of returning the animals to their natural habitats .  
The reason there is still such a dazzling array of species on Earth today , with all the " natural wonders " they display , is because since life took its first steps , animals have shown a resilient capacity to face the challenges of all kinds of environmental pressures , by every imaginable means . Although the process has been a bloody one in which many species have bowed out into history , new species have continuously stepped forward onto the stage .  
Whether in terms of their right to exist or their value to the ecosystem , an elephant and an ant are equal . From an evolutionary perspective , every wild species alive on Earth today is a repository of genes which have passed the test of natural selection . Only if " genetic diversity " is maintained can these genes come into play to respond to sudden changes in the environment .  
The panda , the focus of world attention , may have difficulties getting pregnant and generally weak propagation abilities , and its powers of adaption may have declined and its population aged ; but man , by threatening the bamboo forests and destroying its natural habitat so that it has less space to forage , is even more the cause of its demise . The Formosan landlocked salmon , regarded as a national treasure , lives only in the upper stretches of the Tachia River , where the temperature is low and water quality high .  
To implement conservation work , one subject must be selected as a first objective . The environmentalist community can deliberate for a lifetime , but the disappearance of animal species from the natural world is like a raging fire , and we must quickly throw the fire alarm . In the midst of all the rush , errors naturally occur . People should learn from mistakes and move ever closer to the ideal .  
One reason was because the discovery found its way into newspapers all over the world , and many people knew that now Puli had more than picturesque natural beauty and such special local products as rice noodles and shaoxing wine . The citizens of Puli also possessed a glorious treasure - - cultural property left behind by people of an age long passed .  
Anyone holding an outdoor activity in rainy northern Taiwan has to depend on fate to make any money . So the main reason for choosing Taoyuan for the inauguration was the venue 's special feature : The transparent " sky tent " that can keep out the elements while allowing natural sunlight in , thus insuring that the event would not be rained out or blown off course .  
Nevertheless , after modern obstetrics was developed , women 's birthing territory was moved from the home to the hospital . Those who assisted delivery changed from female midwives to OBG physicians , who are predominantly male . The natural process of birth also changed into a high-tech medical procedure .  
Wu Banghua expresses the view that although many researchers are applying themselves to analyzing the chemical structure or researching the physiological effects of substances from Taxus species , few are researching their botanical characteristics . However , " inappropriate exploitation of this valuable natural resource has already reduced the worldwide population reserves of Taxus species to very small numbers . "  
Seed boxes recreate the natural environment with artificial day and night and corresponding temperature changes , after which " winter " arrives , and the seeds are stored at low temperatures . The process can not be hurried , and it demands far more patience of the silviculturists than propagating the Taiwan red cypress or Taiwan cypress , whose seeds ' dormancy can be broken in a week or two given adequate water and light .  
With repeated visits came deepened understanding , more mutual trust , firm friendships all the more relished for their regular renewals . Gradually I find myself striving to take on more of the traits I admire among my friends in Yunnan-a warm view of hospitality , a greater appreciation of natural surroundings , a resilience to ill fortune and calamities beyond one 's control and more inclination to enjoy to the fullest the good times that inevitably follow .  
Former EPA director Jaw Shau-kong recently drew up a list of " seven major problems " behind the Shihmen Reservoir 's poor water quality and heavy silting . But only one-the adverse natural geology-is a " congenital defect . " The rest are all " acquired dysfunctions . "  
Chinese have long understood how to listen to the natural music of the soughing pines . This is especially so for those ancient literati who learned that it was their duty to serve their nation , but who could find no ruler who would listen to their criticisms of official corruption and inefficiency . Disappointed by the mundane world , these literati found in pines a salve , admiring how , even in the most remote places , they grew strong .  
But from the point of view of international goodwill and the natural reaction most people have toward anything nuclear , it might have been best to give more attention to the issues raised by concerned observers . For example , Michael Kau , a scholar at Brown University in the US , and Fang Chien , a well-known environmental activist , pointed out that no one wants nuclear waste in their back yard , and disregarding the sentiments of a neighbor does not conform to Chinese ethics .  
Porter pointed out that previous ideas about national power and competitive advantage focused on countries with vast territory and abundant natural resources , which ideally were backed up by military strength .  
Over the years the HUF has prepared guided introductions to six trails , with the most popular being the Chihshan Rock Trail in Shihlin , which combines natural scenery with Class Two historic cultural artifacts . And since Mayor Chen Shui-bian declared that this trail would be made part of the city 's high school entrance exams , many dedicated parents have come here to collect informa - tion for their kids .  
Five years ago , because he had to look after his children , he could not go too far from home , so he decided to embark on extended observation of a small , nameless earthen mountain next to the Wanfang residential development . He christened it " Little Green Mountain , " and produced a series of notes and articles describing the natural scenery and plant and animal life through the four seasons on the southern rim of the Taipei basin .  
For instance , the limitless rebirth of life forms exists within cultural change and natural cycles of waxing and waning and rising and falling . And I have connected the symbols and visual vocabulary employed in each of these twelve works to the twelve signs of the zodiac , which represent the rhythmic relationship between Heaven and Earth .  
According to his study of the subject , the patterns on Damascus swords are the natural crystal patterns formed when steel is cast , and those on Japanese swords are lines of temper color left by partial quenching of the blades . But the patterns on Chinese hundred-beaten steel are the grain patterns which result from repeated folding and hammering of the metal .  
On the maritime extreme of Europe , England had always been saturated by the arts of Italy and France . It was not easy to work out how to create a " natural garden " and it was hardly desirable to give half the credit to the far-away Chinese .  
In the 1720s Burlington 's garden became something that had never been seen before . Its eastern section was in the formal classical style , with three radiating shaded avenues leading in straight lines to classical monuments . In the western part , though , Kent had created an irregular natural style , with groups of small trees and winding paths !  
Their attack on the formal palace garden was used to express their discontent with tyranny . Yet the natural garden , established as it was on the ideal of liberty , could also be used as their safe retreat from the world .  
Vargas says that damage to the environment has awakened the consciousness of Costa Ricans , and there is a consensus to protect nature . In 1990 , after the government established a ministry for natural resources and the environment ( whose Spanish acronym is MINAE ) , 50,000 square kilometers of land-a full quarter of all remaining forest-was made into ten protected areas , and 24 national parks . More than 700 conservation officers do wildlife surveys and park protection on a full-time basis ( please see the accompanying article ) .  
In traditional thinking , the bearing and raising of children is a woman 's natural occupation . Most mothers give their all in caring for their husbands and raising their children . Even women who are gradually moving out of the house and into the working world do everything they can to meet the demands of both house and job .  
After the PPI mapped out hunting grounds , it was discovered that these covered less than one-fifth of Wutai Rural Township . Also , because of forbidding topography or traditional taboos , some untouched areas were left between the hunting grounds . This fits right in with theories of effective management of natural resources .  
" I hope in the future we can trek once per year , passing through traditional lands and places of historical importance , to understand how the West Rukai spread . We will also survey the natural resources . " Sasala says that elders told him many things he did not know-about things that happened long ago , and that place names were often derived from commonly used plants . Creating a foundation of shared knowledge among the generations marks the beginning of transmission of the tribal culture .  
An official at the Council of Agriculture , the governing body for wildlife protection , notes that " the Wildlife Conservation Law was targeted at the needs of a specific moment . All law is open to change , and in the future we might permit planned hunting , and also trade in game . " Today 's comprehensive ban on using natural resources does not meet the needs of the current environment , nor do the arguments behind the ban convince those worried about the survival of aboriginal culture .  
In the 1980s , among all the social movements , the environmental protection movement found the most resonance around the world . This , coupled with the rise of the aboriginal rights movement , caused environmentalists , in the wake of modern man 's overdevelopment of land , to begin to reexamine methods of living and urge a return to natural , simple lifestyles . As a result , the complete set of cultural ceremonies and behavior that aborigines have as a result of hunting have once again been embraced .  
Many scholars are happy to see that traditional Rukai tribal hunting is being allowed under resource-management controls in order to achieve sustainable economic use of natural resources . " Only when tribal people are economically independent can they rediscover their cultural identity , " they argue . " It 's a good way for them to regain their self-respect . "  
Every two years , Dr . Lai Chiu-nan , originator of the " total natural health " lifestyle , based on a " living foods " diet , comes to Taiwan to promote her method for maintaining a healthy body , mind and spirit . Her talks always draw thousands of people . In March of this year , she came to Taiwan again to hold a workshop , leading 600 people in physical and mental training in the mountains of Shuanghsi in Taipei County .  
As the southern weather turns hot and stuffy , the ducks , missing the spring breezes which they need for their breeding season , grow bored and their hormones subside . At the same time , spring is gradually spreading across the north , melting the Earth 's icy veil . With natural enemies there few in number but food plentiful , one after the other the ducks and geese start to return home .  
Wu Wu-tien says that by presenting only positive role models , current moral education deliberately obscures the darker side of life and the reasons for it . The theoretical background to this is a belief that children are not mature enough to make proper judgements . To prevent the " bad " element in children 's natural character being awakened and tempted , some people sincerely believe that " if one does n't let children come into contact with bad people and bad things , they will not turn bad . "  
Chien Chun-an notes that extramarital affairs entail enormous risks . A third party becomes involved in the family life of others , the people having the affair face a moral challenge , and after the most romantic initial stage passes , pressure grows to bring the affair to an end . Having chosen a path of love that is by nature misguided and tragic , it is natural that it leads to serious problems .  
This use of space not only lets in plenty of light , but also makes for good ventilation , because the sun shining into the central courtyard makes it warmer than the surrounding rooms and covered walkways , and so creates a natural flow of air which draws in a cooling breeze . This made the courtyard the perfect place for clan members to stay in friendly contact with each other : here the women cleaned the vegetables , made glutinous rice pastries and chatted about family affairs , and here the children did their homework and played .  
" I keep mulling over this thought : Has this natural , simple , non-calculating character of the common man been lost under the capitalist system with its private ownership of property ? When these three people begin to specialize , they will become more adept at running the restaurant and become more calculating . Will the three of them be as happy then as they are now ? "  
In the waters off Korea a Ming dynasty wreck has been found whose cargo of lacquer ware came up looking brand new after sitting at the bottom of the salty sea for 400 years . And an experiment with two pieces of iron exposed to aqua regia have shown that the lacquer-treated piece still looks as good as new when the untreated piece has wholly disintegrated . Hence , most of the tables in chemical laboratories are coated with this natural substance .  
Recently natural wild plants have become popular foods in Taiwan , and aboriginal edible plants have become well-known in the process . However , edible plants account for only one-quarter of the plants used in daily life in Taniao village . Besides the necessities ( food , shelter , clothing ) , plants are essential materials for a huge number of other uses-medicine , landmarks , all kinds of tools used for outdoor work , rope , packaging , sandpaper , and cloth .  
In particular , Daoists ' choice of places to identify as fairy grottoes , apart from being suitable places to refine elixirs in the hope of transcending death , also responded to the mood of the times and to practical needs . Hence rich , fertile soil suitable for growing rice , and locations out of reach of natural disasters and human wars and turmoil , became essential requirements for the blessed abodes .  
" When we look at things from the perspective of the fairy realm , that is to say on a large scale , the smaller scale of the mortal world becomes unimportant , " says Ke Ching-ming . He feels that imagining fairy realms is a way of observing the basic nature of the world from a unusual angle , in order to defuse problems . It provides a relativistic perspective , breaking down blind insistence on the absolute nature of values , and this enables humans to be more relaxed and natural in many ways .  
From Laozi it borrows the concepts of non-action , clear understanding , and acting in harmony with nature . From Zhuangzi come the concepts of total freedom and life-for-the-fun-of-it . Combining these concepts , religious Daoism holds that in order to become an immortal , one must be free of joy and anger , eliminate desire , live in quietude and non-action , maintain primitive simplicity , and act in harmony with the natural laws of the universe .  
It is precisely this use of synergistic combinations of natural substances-both from animals and plants-as opposed to the use of individually active chemical substances , " says Chang , who holds a doctorate in chemistry and is certified as a doctor of Chinese medicine . If only individual active components from herbal medicines are extracted and used , then the special synergistic character of herbal medicines will be lost .  
" In researching Chinese medicine , both developing new medicines and respecting the ancient Chinese medical principles are essential , " argues Chen Chieh-pu . Synthesizing chemical components or extracting new drugs from natural herbal , mineral or animal substances has long been an important process in mainstream medicine . Quinine , which is used to treat malaria ; the cardiotonic rehmannin ; the painkiller morphine ; and antibiotics , which are widely used and have saved so many ; were all discovered in natural herbal medicines or fungi .  
" Maybe the conditions for seed germination are very specific and furthermore , they are unknown , " says Jose Luis Leon de la Luz , a botanist affiliated with the CIB . No matter how the plant manages to pass through the eons , its natural proliferation is not sufficient to sustain massive cutting for a hungry market . One fact should be borne in mind : If damiana products are to be used in large quantities , damiana plants should be plentiful .  
Although investigation of the relationship between climate and infectious diseases is still at a preliminary stage , excessive human development of jungles and rainforests has increased people 's chances of coming into contact with the microorganisms which live there , and with their natural hosts .  
In fact , some experts feel that since most enterovirus cases in Taiwan are in rural areas , it is still the result of poor hygiene . Nonetheless , it is also true that children today live too cleanly : they lack natural sources of infection in their environment , so that when they do meet with a virus they are quite unable to fend it off .  
" We ca n't know if this was right or not , " admits Wu Tsung-neng . No one knows if the slowing of the epidemic was due to human effort or was a natural trend . However , from the fact that over the same time period other communicable diseases also were reduced , it can be assumed that the preventive measures taken against the enterovirus were effective .  
There are many different kinds of oolong tea , including lightly cured Shanlin River high mountain , medium-fired smokey dongding , Ali Mountain variety , and even yancha ( dried , then set aside for five years , then cured the traditional way , over a charcoal fire-as opposed to the modern methods of natural gas flame or electric heat curing ) . There are also all manner of aromas-dark , robust or sweet-and of flavors . The variety of grades of Taiwan oolong shows how far its manufacture has progressed .  
But in natural forests , every creature has its natural enemies , and the insect fungus Beauveria bassiana and parasitic flies are ready and waiting for M . basalis pryeri . Furthermore , in the wild the inchworms prefer trees over two meters tall , and by the time trees have reached this size they are strong enough for a few caterpillars not to pose them any threat .  
" Her paintings amalgamate various techniques , including glue-and-color-on-silk and water-and-ink . On the surface is the coordination of realism , symbolism and surrealism , reflecting a sort of natural , balanced and fresh effect , attained after traditional art has been baptized by modern civilization , " opines art critic Huang Hsiao-shih .  
" Actually , controlling aging does n't mean rejecting aging . It means healthy , successful aging . " Dr . Wang says , " Aging is a natural , gradual , lifelong process . It is not the complete loss of one 's health and beauty within a very short period .  
Banded coral shrimp , known in the Far East as " cherry blossom shrimp " for their bright pink color , breed only in Japan 's Surugawan Bay and in the sea off Tungkang , Taiwan . Because the Japanese regard these shrimp , which are rich in calcium and phosphorus , as a natural national treasure , the Taiwanese have started to catch them as well .  
For instance , the subsided coast of northern Taiwan is studded with beautiful eroded bays and promontories ; the sandy and muddy coast of the western alluvial plain is rich in human culture and is a paradise for migratory birds , a place where they can rest and feed as they pass through on their southward and northward journeys ; the coral reefs of the south coast are a rare natural treasure ; and the eroded escarpments of Taiwan 's east coast bear witness to the tectonic movements which have shaped our island over millions of years .  
But over recent years , in the pursuit of economic growth , Taiwan has heavily exploited its natural resources . For example , coastal land reclamation and the development of new industrial zones have destroyed valuable wetlands , and when the wetlands are lost the birds ' paradise is lost with them .  
And taiji means " the natural way " - standing erect and centered , being impartial and unbiased , neither lacking nor in excess , adhering to one position-in other words the way of the natural world , and the way of the human being . Or in short : moral cultivation , the very purpose of human life .  
Beginning in 2001 , English will become a required course in elementary schools . " Now the English parts of both the college and high-school joint entrance exams are growing trickier . Whether one is talking about written tests or oral tests , they both require excellent English , " says Chang Yu-heng senior staff editor for Landmark English . It 's only natural that students need English magazines to bolster their efforts to learn the language .  
Written as a conversation among three people , in poking fun at the nobility and the emperor who spent all day hunting rather than in affairs of state , it also depicted a vast and colorful world : Sima exhausted his imagination to describe natural wonders , strange creatures and bizarre plants , presenting a dazzling and awesome spectacle .  
During the time of Fan Kuan , artists were neither too close nor too estranged from nature . They neither made dull and painstaking objective facsimiles of the natural world , nor showered their work with their own subjective feelings . Cun and dian brushwork , which were born out of naturalism , would-after Fan Kuan 's day-be employed in works that were more and more subjective and abstract .  
In China , a country founded on farming , there has always been a tangible link between seasonal changes and the pattern of agricultural production . As this link was absorbed into people 's lives it gave rise to the rituals of rural existence , the most prominent of which marked the conclusion of the natural cycle at the end of every year . Thus New Year became the most important of all traditional festivals , symbolizing endless rebirth and the continuation of the natural cycle .  
Besides her natural vocal quality , the key to A-Mei 's success has been that her songs reflect feelings and aspirations of her era . In fact , when you look back at the history of popular cultural interchange between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait , all the most successful singers and hit songs have been connected in some way to the hopes and feelings of the times .  
Nevertheless , it was hard to resist . Souls locked up for the decade of the Cultural Revolution had lost interest in so-called revolutionary songs that " put politics in command . " Some mainland Chinese with overseas connections brought Teresa Teng 's music into the PRC . Her delicate and warm voice radiated feelings of intimacy , love , and nostalgia , touching the natural feelings that had been suppressed for so long .  
The straightforward , confident , and unrestrained A-Mei has made quite a splash in the Chinese-speaking world . Perhaps it is not surprising that someone with such a distinctive personality would elicit strong feelings both positive and negative . Wang Dong is not alone in his views , for many in the mainland have asked how long A-Mei will continue her spectacular run of success . Hopefully she will always " speak " straight from the heart , and can keep that natural verve that set her apart from the crowd in the first place .  
I do n't have any plans to pose for a racy photo album . If I were in a movie and they wanted me to do a scene in the nude , it would n't be a problem . But I do n't think that a photo album would a way to express the ideal of male beauty . Maybe the Japanese pop idol Miyazawa Rie can express her own pure esthetic appeal through a photo album , but for a man to convey that kind of natural feeling through still photos is not an easy thing .  
" Palliative care , " or " natural death , " as it is often referred to , means that in accordance with a patient 's expressed free will , medical staff will refrain from using cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) , artificial respirators , heart stimulants and other invasive medical technologies to prolong the dying process of patients with untreatable conditions .  
Whenever some people get ahead , others will follow , and no amount of calls for simpler lifestyles or new value systems can stop them . The reason is very simple . " The money management fever is a natural product of changing times . " According to Liu , individualism and the rise of urban commercial society have broken down the support networks of traditional agricultural society .  
They often pop up in rice paddies , and the toad-which because of the keratinization of its skin is at home away from the water-is also a frequent visitor to inhabited areas . But other species are confined to specific areas or are only active in particular seasons . So unless you traipse across countless rivers and endless mountains , you are n't likely to ever see them in their natural state .  
Furthermore , the Kuroshio current and the mainland coastal current converge here , the upwelling current off Taiwan 's eastern rift valley brings up organic salts from the ocean depths , and a seabed valley forms a natural barrier . Under these conditions , many organisms have developed into unique species , and the sea off Ilan contains a cornucopia of marine life .  
" Crab doctor " Wu Shu-he , who is cooperating with the museum on a research project , explains why its specimens have attracted so much attention . In the three to four centuries since natural history museums were first established , there were no significant advances in the preparation of crustacean specimens . The pigments responsible for crabs ' coloration are not very stable , and the preservatives usually used have a corrosive effect . Thus prepared crab specimens generally look as if they have been boiled .  
The book is filled with conflict between old and new values . As Chu explains : " If we take the status of the ' desolate man ' - a homosexual role-as a metaphor , it hints that if a culture has already developed to the point where people do not want to reproduce , to create a next generation , sex becomes elevated to an end in itself , and the natural drive to reproduce becomes expended in sexual consumption , in pursuit of sensual extremes . . . .  
Holding that meditation will , along with natural science and behavioral science , emerge as one of the three most important educational disciplines , WLEF has designed a Zen leadership program that emphasizes state of mind . Students are encouraged to probe their inner selves during moments of solitude and thereby cultivate self-discipline , increase their wisdom and potential , and improve their physical endurance and ability to handle pressure . They learn both how to get involved in the world and how to morally transcend it .  
Yeh Wen-chi emphasizes that the natural history of each dragonfly species is unique , and it is hard to generalize . For instance , the protected giant spiketail only breeds once in three years . It does not fit the general pattern of insects which live fleeting lives and may produce several generations a year .  
The devastating 21 September earthquake of 1999 left Taiwan 's landscape covered in scars , but researchers discovered that the places least damaged by the quake were areas of natural forest . In mountain regions where the rainfall is most abundant , the geology most fragile and erosive forces most powerful , the false cypresses , with their massive trunks and mighty root systems , cling tightly to the frail earth .  
Large-scale logging of false cypresses continued right up to 1989 . With forestry earning no profits , and in response to energetic lobbying by civic groups , the Executive Yuan finally banned the cutting of natural forests , at last giving a respite to the giant trees which protect Taiwan 's land .  
Says Lin , " Because of the way the pieces are selected and the fact that most online readers are students , almost all the online works that get published in book format offer very realistic descriptions of school romance . I think these novels give young authors a chance to achieve a sense of closure in real-life romances gone wrong , and to use their experiences as a source of creative energy . " Lin feels that the popularity of such works is natural , since both the authors and readers are everyday people .  
But just as with other natural resources , the greatest microbiological riches are concentrated in developing countries , and these poor countries do not have the means to screen their own resources and develop useful biological agents . But the major pharmaceutical companies of Europe and North America have long been gathering rich pickings from these countries , by collecting large quantities of soil , humus and plant samples to use in the search for new drugs . This has brought them substantial profits , but in the past the countries owning the resources benefited little .  
Kuanshan Township is located in Taitung County , in the flat bottom of the East Longitudinal Valley . The Hsinwulu River runs through the township , and there are high mountains to either side . The majority of the residents are involved in farming , in particular growing Kuanshan rice , which is especially tasty because of the pristine local water . Such industrial activity as there is is of a low-polluting kind , allowing Kuanshan to retain its good natural environment .  
In addition to plentiful sunshine and ample rains , the area abounds in natural resources . It is also a virtual second home to many species of migratory bird . Throughout its history-from its aboriginal days as Orchid Village , to its Qing dynasty incarnation as Hengchun ( " Eternal Spring " ) , and even to its present form , complete with national parks and farms providing tourist accommodations-Heng-chun has always pricked the interest of visitors .  
Fully grown maroon orioles are fierce birds with few natural enemies , and they generally feed in mixed flocks with other bird species . But in the breeding season their chicks are much coveted by snakes , squirrels , crows and sparrowhawks , and an attack will often prompt the sensitive parent birds to abandon the nest they have built .  
The growing importance attached to the practical application of college courses has also spread to colleges of foreign languages and natural science , where academic research has traditionally been a priority . This is particularly the case among technical colleges and universities that have been upgraded or newly established during the past decade , where the word " applied " appears in the title of virtually every course and where the teaching approach differs from that of the more traditional universities .  
Beijing 's grand scale is truly dumbfounding . The speed of its coming economic growth poses challenges to its water and power supplies , air quality , and natural environment , as well as the well-being of its ancient buildings and cultural artifacts , which date back thousands of years .  
Liu Chia-lang , head of the office of civil affairs , also has strong feelings on the future of development and industry in Tungkang : " Only Japan and Tungkang produce banded coral shrimp , which is one of the main seafood products of the town . And Tapeng Bay abounds in natural resources . Tungkang has what it takes to develop . But Taiwan 's entry into the WTO is going to be a heavy blow to Tungkang 's fishing industry . "  
He filmed 20 60-minute tapes and produced the first edited version of the documentary , which was full of sadness . Laway admits his own mood made it difficult for him to get past tragic facts : " Afterwards , I realized this is not the natural temperament of the Amis people , so I re-edited it , creating this more optimistic version . " Laway immediately took the finished product to share with the Amis of Talu-an .  
Huang Yi-nung asserts , " Our astronomers were first-rate observers , and they had an encyclopedic mastery of the natural sciences , social sciences , and humanities . " Huang notes that astronomy is a comprehensive science that is intimately connected with our lives and , as such , is not separate from nature as a whole . Zhang Heng is also noted for inventing the world 's first seismic detector , and was an accomplished painter and writer .  
When applied to oceanography , the natural sound waves produced by the wind and currents create ambient noise , which is comparable to ambient light . An underwater target will perturb this ambient noise to produce " noisy " signals , just as ambient light reflects off objects in a room . Even though the ambient noise does not come from a specific source as in conventional sonar imaging , it can still " illuminate " objects .  
But Liu 's father by no means encouraged Arthur to go into this field , and so he studied agricultural chemistry at National Taiwan University . But it proved impossible to resist his natural inclinations , and he ended up in the broadcast world anyway . Liu attended National Taiwan Normal University Affiliated High School , which had a relatively lively , open atmosphere .  
" The natural environment is always changing . Even if the number of monkeys has been increasing in the short term , there are so many uncertain factors that it is very hard to say that their populations will grow in the long term . " Wu Hai-yin is the first biologist to have written a doctoral thesis about Formosan rock monkeys .  
Residents , on the other hand , want a casino . But , casino or no , Hsiao Liuchiu is already rich in natural assets . It is a coral island surrounded by azure seas and possessed of sparkling beaches , all of which are potential tourist attractions .  
This was the observation of Tsai Hsin-hsin , executive director of the Liao Chiung-chih Taiwanese Opera Foundation . According to Tsai , mainland Chinese actors alternate between falsetto and their natural register . They incorporate various techniques from Peking Opera and Western opera . The mainland Chinese vocal and acting styles are very standardized .  
But what many people do not know is that in 1941 Kukeng experienced another major earthquake , which struck the Chiayi-Tainan area . The western face of a 1200-meter high mountain collapsed and fell into the Chingshui River . It formed a natural dam 100 meters high , and created a new lake , Lake Tsaoling , with a volume of 12.86 million cubic meters .  
Looking out from Tachien Peak ( the " great peak " mentioned in the rural township song ) , you discover your field of vision dominated by a sheet of green formed by natural vegetation as well as cultivated betelnut , and tea trees . In addition , after the 921 earthquake , layer upon layer of fossilized marine life , dating back 150 million years , has resurfaced . When you add to this the local sedimentary rock , it is clear that the Huashan area is rich in interesting topography .  
" Huashan lies at the juncture of the Philippine tectonic plate and the Eurasian plate . After serious earthquakes , the crust is loosened and altered , and the topography shows very obvious changes , " says Chiu Tsun-lung , director of the " Lake Bottom Culture Association , " and now a member of the 921 community reconstruction committee . He says that Huashan also has a rich cultural atmosphere . The historic artifacts left behind by pioneers combined with the natural environment provide valuable resources for " mountain education " in Taiwan .  
Early flowering seasons in Yang - mingshan , mullet failing to swim south after the winter solstice , dengue fever crossing the Tropic of Cancer , unusual butterfly migrations , coral bleaching . . . . Global warming is blamed for rising sea levels , freak weather and frequent floods , but is it also responsible for some of the unusual phenomena in Taiwan 's natural world in recent years ?  
Two years back Taiwan experienced a major earthquake . Last year there were landslides and massive flooding here , and also the horrific 911 incident in New York . And most recently Taiwan has faced a drought . Some of these are natural disasters , some are man-made , and some are natural disasters made worse by human action .  
It was n't until consumption reached 150% of replacement levels in May that it finally issued a completely unexpected warning . Part of the problem is that three of Taiwan Power 's liquefied natural gas storage tanks have never been put into use because of technological defects unresolved by their Japanese contractor . The power shortage has also led to widespread suspicions that Taiwan Power is technologically inept and unable to handle crises . As a result , its chairman Lin Wen-yuan tendered his resignation .  
In 1972 , UNESCO , considering the damage that war , natural disasters , and industrial development have been doing to precious cultural and natural assets , adopted the " Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage . " This set out rigorous and comprehensive conditions for determining what places are qualified to be deemed World Heritage sites ; it also encouraged signatories to apply to have the assets within their territories that are " of outstanding universal value " included on the World Heritage list .  
" The false cypress forests that survive in this mountainous island with its wet maritime climate are rare relics of an ancient forest type that today only remains in parts of East Asia and North America . It well deserves to be called a world-class natural heritage site , not just a national one . " This is how the Ilan County Cultural Affairs Bureau 's brochure confidently describes the Chilan cypress forest .  
By 1989 , when the Executive Yuan ordered a ban on further logging of natural forests , only isolated patches were left of the great swathe of 20 million gigantic yellow and red cypress trees that once stretched the length and breadth of Taiwan . The yellow cypresses of Mt . Chilan in Ilan County form one of the last remaining relatively untouched forests of giant trees in Taiwan .  
" The growth of the false cypress forests represents a process of stabilization of the rolling mountain rivers . The false cypress trees are the living deities of the process of natural restoration of the land , " writes Chen Yu-feng in his book The Flora of Taiwan . In particular , the medium-elevation cloud forests are unstable zones of heavy rainfall and powerful erosion , and when mighty false cypress trees spring up along the lines of collapse they mend the gashes in the forest and bring new life to the broken ground .  
The false cypress forests which bear the heavy responsibility of stabilizing Taiwan 's fragmented earth , also form a safety valve for the Shihmen Reservoir , Tanshui River and Lanyang River on which the people of northern Taiwan depend for their drinking water . The band of cypress forest that runs from Mt . Chilan to Mt . Lala forms a huge natural reservoir that soaks up heavy rainfall and releases it in gentler flows while keeping the soil firmly in its grasp , in a way that no human engineering project could replicate .  
Unlike the austere limestone topology surrounding Mayan settlements in Mexico , many of the Mayan remains in Guatemala are buried within lush tropical forests . Mayan culture fused human culture with the natural environment , achieving tremendous prosperity that can be seen today in the remains of colossal pyramids , temples , sport arenas , and in the network of roads that connected them all . These achievements reflect the golden age of Mayan Culture .  
" She successfully captured the mysteriousness of weird folk tales , and threw in a lot of stuff about ghosts-Ghost Festival ceremonies , the wandering of lonely ghosts without living descendants , and the mischief committed by evil spirits , " writes the critic Wen Tien-hsiang . " She showed how a small boy would identify with his grandmother and all the traditions and tolerance that she symbolizes , and from there went on to develop an atmosphere of equality and mutual respect between the natural and the supernatural , and between the living and ghosts .  
At a symposium on the control of environmental hormones held in April , Professor Liu Li-lian , director of the Institute of Marine Biology at National Sun Yat-sen University in Kaohsiung , described the results of a coastal survey in southern Taiwan . The natural ratio of males to females in oyster drills is about one to one , " so when I noticed that the Thais clavigera we were catching had all turned male , I knew something was wrong , " said Liu with alarm .  
The applications for refined CHM can be extended considerably . Already a number of manufacturers in Taiwan are adding raw materials from Kingstone to all kinds of products , including yogurt and ice cream . These raw materials can also be put to use in natural colorings and flavorings , edible fibers , cosmetic masks , bandages , and more . These uses are already common overseas , with the production value of such products increasing year in and year out , but in Taiwan there is still vast room for R &amp; D and promotion .  
Ku enthusiastically consults with people from all areas , and has done his utmost to assist domestic research in fields related to welding . Ku also contributes by " resuscitating " expensive machinery damaged by human errors or natural disasters , thus helping industry and educational institutions reduce the massive financial losses that can result from such events . While his work has guaranteed that machinery works , he has helped even more people by passing the torch of his knowledge on to his students .  
There are records of the medicinal uses of alcohol in China even on ancient tortoise shells dating back to the Shang and Zhou dynasties . " Alcohol is a good natural solvent , enabling one to get a higher proportion of the therapeutic content out of the raw materials of Chinese medicine , " Chen Chun-che says .  
Everyone is connected to their family and the caring between two generations is natural . The givers now will one day receive . This kind of filial piety , which is built around basic feelings of human nature , is not exclusive to Chinese society . Yeh Kuang-hui , who is still researching the topic of filial piety , has lots of friends doing research on this subject in the United States and Australia .  
Lin Ku-fang , director of the graduate institute of arts at Fo Guang University , makes the point that using one 's mother tongue springs from a natural emotional link to a locality and its history . It should n't be blown up out of proportion , and there is no need for special classes to teach it . Others have questioned whether local language education has turned into an ideological tool utilized by the state , and suggested that in the long run its use as a political tool will undermine the learning of local languages .  
For one thing , he says , the raw material for lacquer ware is made from the sap of any of various species of lacquer tree and is poisonous in its natural form . Contact with the skin or ingestion will , in mild cases , cause swelling and extreme itchiness of the arms . Persons with a low tolerance level will experience general swelling and suffer from symptoms akin to poison ivy . If scratching leads to infection , the victim will puff up all over like a big balloon .  
While the raw lacquer is toxic , once it dries it is insoluble to all chemicals ; and its toxins are trapped inside . Thus there are no health worries , and lacquer ware is impervious to humidity , heat , acids , and alkalis . It is a natural insulator , and remains perfectly preserved even when buried underground for ages . Few other art objects can compare .  
Chen says that in Guangdong , where strict quarantine measures have not been taken and public health resources are inadequate , the epidemic has apparently begun to naturally slow down on its own . Does this mean that most people have been mildly infected and their bodies have produced antibodies , so that the virus can not find any " fresh " victims without natural defenses , and therefore is retiring from the field ?  
Thus by the second half of the twentieth century , thanks to an apparently invincible medical science , humanity seemed to have become the absolute master of the natural world . So much so , that it began to let down its guard against viral disease-until 1981 .  
My point is that the word " modern " is used in opposition to the classical period in the West . It has arisen as a natural continuation of the trajectory of Western culture . Because Western cultured is the world 's dominant culture , many non-Western cultures have adopted Western concepts regarding modernity while forgetting that our own cultural milieus are not completely the same as that of the West . Modern artists often treat Western ideas as if they were universal in their application , which is very dangerous .  
Like many Taiwanese agricultural towns , Kungkuan has an excellent natural endowment but has struggled to remain competitive and has lost many of its young people to jobs in urban areas . Agriculture and the once vigorous ceramics industry have been greatly weakened .  
Chu Ching-i , a scholar at Academia Sinica , thinks that a child should not be forced to enter brutally competitive streaming before he has an understanding of his own subjective , natural disposition and objective , outside choices . Only by experiencing culture as far as possible in all its facets and richness can a student discover his own real interests and talents-and then make his own decisions .  
" It 's the plainness of rice straw that attracts people to it , " says Kao Hsi-lin . " It gives rise to a desire for a natural , rustic life . " Kao is a vibrant man who builds installations , paints and studies creative media . After several years spent working on community building , he is now giving new life to rice straw , a material that the people of Jenju had previously thought of as a waste product .  
Lin Chin-chu explains that some people in the area want to develop hot springs along the river , but often when hot springs areas are developed , large financial groups rush in and the tribal peoples lose control . As a result , not only do local people not reap benefits , but in the process the natural environment on which they depend for their living is damaged .  
Most people feel that they have to dress up to enjoy art in traditional municipal galleries , and they have to make a special trip to get to them . But railroad art centers are bustling with life and allow people to experience cultural and artistic events in a natural and unplanned way . Art has been confined to museums and temples for too long : let it hop on a train and be carried from station to station around Taiwan !  
In 1994 , led by teachers Lu Hung-wen and Huang Kuei-kuan , a group of students from the Peitou Elementary School investigated the natural resources of their local area . They sought out documented information on the " Peitou Hot Springs Public Baths , " which have close ties with the development of Peitou itself . From this information , they discovered that the long-forgotten , overgrown , and run-down " haunted house " was in fact the site of that very same pool complex , Southeast Asia 's largest and most luxurious public pool in its day .  
" These women and children have no support at all from friends or the bride 's family . When they run into problems they are lost , " says Sister Therese Tang , executive director of the Good Shepherd Sisters Social Welfare Services Foundation . The language barrier often means they have no clue about how to seek help , to the point where they even accept violence as a natural part of their daily life , as their unalterable fate . This is the reason foreign brides suffer a high level of domestic violence .  
When combined with the growing leisure farming industry , this restoration takes on even more importance . All along the 9.6-kilometer Niutou-Sanhsing section of the Taipingshan railroad , a variety of beautiful natural vistas greet the eye-soaring mountains , creeks and valleys , fields , villages , and small towns . All this has great tourism potential , and aside from spurring the growth of peripheral industries such as accommodation and food service , it also has a great historical importance .  
With its beautiful natural scenery , Ilan County has a strong environmental consciousness . As early as 1977 , the county began experimenting with and promoting the recycling of kitchen waste . Natural Environmental Protection Foundation chairperson Liu Shu-hui and National Ilan Institute of Technology jointly developed a simple composting method suitable for use by families and neighborhoods .  
The completion of National Highway No . 3 bears witness to tremendous changes in Taiwan . During the period of its construction , the island experienced rapid economic , social and political changes , and the heroes who built the road had to face a host of challenges , including waves of citizens ' protests , meddling from elected officials and organized crime , and investigations by judicial agencies , as well as natural disasters such as the 921 earthquake . The difficulties of construction included record-setting bridges , tunnels and challenges of all kinds .  
Rising almost 4000 meters above sea level , Yushan is not only the tallest peak on Taiwan , it is also the source of the three major river systems that provide water for the island , has the most intact ecological system , verdant forests , varied flowers and fauna plus the nearby historical relics of Patungkuan and the rich cultural history of the Aborigines . " It is natural that this area is a topographical symbol of Taiwanese identity , just like Mt . Fuji in Japan or the Alps in Switzerland , " says Professor Tai .  
There is something dramatic about Wu 's fascination with butterflies : he was born with red-green color blindness , but is besotted with lovely butterflies of every color . Like a deaf musician , Wu arouses a natural curiosity in people who wonder whether the world he sees can really be as beautiful as theirs .  
The writer Chen Fang-ming lauds The Butterfly Trail for " saying a great deal by examining the small . " According to Chen , Wu 's meticulous and profound exploration of the world of butterflies draws on encyclopedic knowledge and the most authoritative texts . As it shuttles back and forth , Wu 's narrative is always illuminating , and enables his readers to accompany him as he discovers natural history and experiences a rich and strange universe .  
Wu Se-hwa states that capital for cultural creative industries includes the following : copyrighted music , literature , fine arts and animation ; locations that can serve as the background for creativity , such as historic sites and natural scenery ; creative talent ; and language or customs that reveal the special flavor of an area .  
The mountain Karen still make a living through such traditional methods as swidden farming , fishing , hunting and gathering , working hard to eke out an existence each and every day . However , as their numbers have increased , the limited availability of agricultural land and the impact of modernization and natural disasters have meant that they now lack adequate resources to meet their daily subsistence needs , and have been reduced to penury and perpetual shortage .  
Since the 1990s ecotourism has exploded , especially in developing nations in Latin America , Africa and Asia where there are rain forests . These nations have established numerous nature preserves and national parks , and their outstanding natural resources and unique cultures have attracted growing numbers of tourists from the developed world .  
" To get that outside money , they accommodated more and more tourists , ripping up the mountains to lay large parking lots , trails and pavilions , " says Lai Peng-chih , who previously served as secretary-general of the Taiwan Ecotourism Association . " They replaced their original structures built out of natural materials with concrete buildings . " This development had a major impact on the environment , Lai says , disturbing the growth of plants and animals .  
Furthermore , modern people may lack ecological and environmental knowledge . Or they may know that natural resources are limited and that biodiversity is important , but be unable to refuse materialistic temptations , lack the time to recycle , and be powerless to refuse their children 's requests for the fashionable pet of the moment . More knowledge does not necessarily help in easing environmental deterioration .  
Now , that land is more than just a " natural classroom " for the 11 classes on ecology , flora , and fauna at the college ; it 's also been opened to the public , becoming a well known place for the people of Yungho and Chungho-particularly local elementary and junior high school kids-to come and get in touch with nature . The college also trains volunteer guides for the garden to meet the huge demand from the local community to visit it .  
The thrifty gene theory hypothesizes that because of harsh living conditions in Asian countries during ancient times , individuals with a genetic endowment that enabled them to more efficiently store fat as a hedge against times when food was scarce were more likely to survive the natural selection process to reproduce . Now , though the environment has improved and food is no longer difficult to obtain , the thrifty gene continues to exert its effect , with the result that the person easily accumulates body fat and becomes obese-an important risk factor for diabetes .  
They noted : " Two successive years of poor harvests brought about by natural calamities , coupled with economic crises and the disrupted farming in some areas , have reduced the food production and supply in this region , resulting in one of the gravest agricultural disasters in a decade in southern Africa . "  
Helanshan Mountain , extending more than 250 kilometers to the north and south , is situated in the border area of Ningxia and Inner Mongolia , two large autonomous regions .  It is an important natural and geographical border , a water resource conservation forest and a natural ecological defense for the attacks of Tenggeli desert and Siberia cold wave .  
Mt . Helan , stretching 250 kilometers from south to north and located between Ningxia and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Regions , is the most important geographic line and water conservation forest region in China 's western areas .  It is also a natural ecological fence to prevent the eastward encroachment of Tengger Desert and the cold waves from Siberia .  
The Helan Mountain Range , about 250 kilometers long , extends from south to north along the common border of Ningxia and Inner Mongolia . It is an important natural geographical demarcation line in northwestern China as well as a water conservatory forest area .  The mountain range is also a natural protective shield , which stops the Tenger desert from expanding to the east and the inroad of Siberian cold current .  
Mt . Helan , stretching more than 250 km from south to north , is situated on the juncture of Ningxia and the Inner Mongolia , the two large autonomous regions .  An important natural geographical boundary as well as home of water-source nourished forests in western China , it also serves as a natural shield against the eastern invasion of Tengeli Desert and the onset of the Siberian cold current .  
The Sudan has very favourable natural conditions for its economic development , Qian said adding that in developing economy , a peaceful international environment and a stable domestic political order are very important  
The Asia Pacific region is densely populated , is rich in natural resources , and has rapid economic development At the same time , the area is susceptible to natural disasters due to its complex geological structure and abrupt geological movement It is hit frequently by volcanic eruptions , oceanic forces , and earthquakes  
noting that russia is rich in natural and human resources , li said he believed that the russian people will overcome the temporary difficulties china wishes to see a stable russia with a growing economy , he added  
despite a busy daily schedule for him at the party central committee secretariat , wen jiabao has retained a strong interest in natural sciences and economic matters , following developments closely , collecting relevant data and producing analytical reports  
Income adjusted for changes in national wealth is defined as national income minus the interest cost of investments needed to replace capital assets damaged or lost as a result of natural or man-made disasters .  
Despite the presence of rich natural resources , Africa 's chief attraction , the continent 's slow economic growth , which remains well below the average for all developing countries , offsets even this considerable advantage .  
The root causes of population movements and refugee flows continued to be both natural and man-made , with combinations of political , military , economic , climatic and environmental factors varying from situation to situation .  
One of the main endeavours of the least developed countries is to achieve an optimum balance between human needs and the natural resources base in order to maximize their ability to meet these demands on a sustainable basis .  
The cumulative effects of natural disasters , civil war and economic crisis have made the situation untenable and thus made Nicaragua a deserving candidate for concerted international support and assistance .  
The recent dramatic increase in natural and man-made disasters and civil and ethnic strife has made an effective and coordinated response by the international community absolutely essential .  
To these we must add size and strategic location , economic power - both present and potential - pace of industrial growth and technological progress as well as human and natural resources .  
The Committee stressed the need to build a cooperative spirit of work , based on a natural division of labour shaped by the respective areas of activity of the different bodies involved and leading to a system of mutual assistance and sharing of information .  
To this precarious picture we must add the resurgence of social problems , such as juvenile delinquency , illicit trade in drugs and narcotics , unemployment , the AIDS pandemic and the deleterious effects of persistent drought and other natural disasters .  
Recognition is now emerging that conventional economic analysis methods , as applied to agricultural projects that do not take into account the degradation of the natural resource base , do not provide a suitable measure of longterm sustainability .  
If properly designed and operated , national environmental funds can play a catalytic role in improving environmental management , biodiversity conservation , and sustainable and equitable use of natural resources .  
Training has focused on the legal and economic aspects of individual natural resource industries and provided comparisons of the main contractual forms and contract terms used in recent negotiations worldwide .  
The Programme of Action , the major outcome , is based on an explicit recognition of the peculiar characteristics of Small Island Developing States , notably their fragility and extreme vulnerability to natural disasters and international economic shocks .  
Improvement of the quality of life in the ESCWA region , encompassing material and nonmaterial aspects , is closely correlated with proper management of natural resources and economic development .  
That approach seeks to ensure that the basic needs of the poor , disadvantaged and vulnerable are addressed , that communities are empowered and that natural resources are managed and used in an optimal manner .  
In the same context , environmental degradation and its negative implications for longterm development must be addressed by improving and enhancing national capacities for the environmentally sound management of the natural resource base ;  
The sustainable management of natural resources and the improvement of environmental quality are mechanisms for protecting the ecological processes and the genetic diversity essential for the maintenance of life .  
The continent remained highly vulnerable to inequitable international economic policies , it was a frequent victim of natural disasters and it had an overwhelming debt burden at a time when financial flows were drying up and commodity prices remained low .  
Reiterates that any administering or occupying Power that deprives the colonial peoples of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reiterates that the exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a grave threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
The problems threatening international peace which arouse natural fears , create anxiety , work against the people 's well-being , cause enormous losses of human life and bring about an immense deterioration of social and economic development are no doubt the gravest problems , and they call for action for peace by all means possible . 
After engaging in broad contacts within the system of Asian States , we have once again become convinced of the correctness of the conclusion drawn at the beginning of this century that Asia , with its enormous human , natural and intellectual resources , had every possibility of becoming the most prosperous region in the world .  
Just a few years ago , at the Rio Conference , we , the Member countries of the United Nations , established as a primary concern the need to ensure a rational balance between realizing legitimate national goals and safeguarding the well-being of future generations through the protection of the world 's natural resources .  
A look at the political configuration of the United Nations reveals a strange paradox : at a time when hotbeds of tension are concentrated in Africa , at a time when poverty there has broken every record and at a time when natural and man-made disasters are proliferating , many international forums are seeking to reduce our continent to the status of a poor relative .  
It is regrettable that today , as the United Nations celebrates its fiftieth year since the signing of the Organization 's Charter in San Francisco , many people in Africa continue to live under even harsher conditions of poverty , hunger , disease , civil war and natural disaster .  The plight of the African continent remains a major challenge for the emerging world order .  
Such developments have been accompanied by a natural yearning for the achievement of development in both its economic and social domains , while developments on the negative side have generated a wider cycle of racial , national and religious disputes in some regions of the world that have led to a noticeable retreat from respect for human rights and basic freedoms of the human individual , as well as regression of development both in the economic and social spheres .  
This fiftieth anniversary might also have been a time to rejoice that the countries that 50 years ago were poor and dominated , especially those on the African continent , now find themselves today among the prosperous nations of our planet , a natural position , given their boundless natural resources .  
Indeed , it is critical to the preservation of the heritage of all art-rich nations that their cultural properties be preserved in their geographical and natural surroundings and be available for scientific and archaeological studies in their proper context .  
This is linked primarily to the absence of a clear international treaty and legal bases , procedures and documents regulating the actions and powers of the relevant international institutions and also national organizations , for securing a timely and effective reaction to emergency situations of a natural and technical origin .  
But it is clearly a temporary stimulant that must be tied to gradually increasing efficiency in our ability to build our economic institutions , our taxation and customs systems , to utilize our natural resources in reconstructing our economic infrastructure , and to encourage Palestinian and foreign capital investment in our economy so that we may be able to build an open and strong economy . 
The delegation of Madagascar takes this opportunity to congratulate the Secretary-General on his concise and accurate report on the special geographical conditions in Madagascar and this region of the Indian Ocean , which is continually exposed to the ravages of tropical cyclones and to the widespread damage caused by these natural disasters .  
This relates , above all , to attacking on a priority basis the structural factors hindering its development , namely : inadequate infrastructure ; weak institutions ; poor use of human resources ; high vulnerability to natural and climatic disasters ; unfavourable fluctuations in the terms of trade ; the enormous debt burden ; unchecked population growth ; and environmental degradation .  
To achieve this , Africa 's partners must transcend their previous ideas about cooperation with the continent and must overcome the accompanying donor fatigue , and must count on Africa 's natural determination to develop a dynamic of progress by which it will gain its proper place in the vast movement of international cooperation that is beneficial for all .  
As I have said on other occasions , this state of affairs is aggravated by armed conflicts , civil wars , the AIDS pandemic added to other devastating or debilitating endemic illnesses , such as malaria and by emergency situations , such as famine , drought , natural disasters , desertification and so on .  
We see nothing controversial about requesting the administering Powers not to violate the Charter by exploiting the natural resources of the inhabitants of the Non-Self-Governing Territories or in any way subordinating their rights and interests to foreign economic and financial interests .  Is it really wrong to urge these Powers to ensure that acceptable working conditions prevail in these Territories ?  
Nuclear tests pose a potential risk to the health and security of the people of coastal States and to their natural resources and environment , contrary to the precautionary principle on international environmental law contained in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development , the Convention on Biological Diversity , the United Nations Framework Convention on Climatic Change , the Treaty of Maastricht and other international instruments .  
Recognizing the increasing need for humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to humanitarian and natural disasters and other emergencies , both for relief and for the continuum to development ,  
Recognizing , in the light of the increasing number and growing magnitude and complexity of natural disasters and other emergencies , the need to utilize fully the national potential of countries in providing the United Nations , on a stand-by basis , with support for its activities in the area of humanitarian emergency assistance , as well as in the promotion of a smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and development ,  
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts .  
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts . 
Adopting integrated management systems , particularly for the management of natural resources ; traditional or indigenous methods should be studied and considered wherever they have proved effective ; women 's traditional roles should not be marginalized as a result of the introduction of new management systems ;  
Programmes to support and strengthen equal employment opportunities and equitable remuneration for women in the formal and informal sectors with adequate economic , political and social support systems and services , including child care , particularly day-care facilities and parental leave , and equal access to credit , land and other natural resources ;  
Countries should take urgent measures to avert the ongoing rapid environmental and economic degradation in developing countries that generally affects the lives of women and children in rural areas suffering drought , desertification and deforestation , armed hostilities , natural disasters , toxic waste and the aftermath of the use of unsuitable agro-chemical products .  
Establish procedures to incorporate children 's concerns into all relevant policies and strategies for environment and development at the local , regional and national levels , including those concerning allocation of and entitlement to natural resources , housing and recreation needs , and control of pollution and toxicity in both rural and urban areas .  
Reaffirming that sustained economic growth and sustainable development are essential for the prevention of and the preparedness against natural disasters and similar disasters with an adverse impact on the environment , and that special attention should be given to disaster prevention and preparedness by Governments concerned as well as by the international community ,  
Unless a significantly more effective approach to land resources management is adopted now , a possible scenario could include a large increase in poverty , hunger , social instability , war , greatly increased migration from resource-poor environments to more favourable ones , together with almost complete destruction of the remaining natural environment and possibly modifications to the world 's climate which will cause social upheaval and political unrest on a vast scale .  
Certain countries have developed systems of ecological zoning , which they are using as a basis for identification of threatened ecosystems and development of ecological modelling at various levels , from the regional and national to the level of individual natural habitats . 
It seeks to foster development of sustainable agricultural production systems and to ensure that the following elements of sustainability are incorporated in the formulation and implementation of Bank-financed projects : increased and stabilized productivity ; rational use of natural resources ; enhancement of the quality of life and the environment ; and intergenerational equity .  
A productive agriculture is an essential prerequisite of SARD , with its multiple objectives of reducing poverty and improving livelihoods while conserving and protecting the natural resource base .  
In all countries , policies oriented towards promoting food and agricultural production and rural development and raising or maintaining farm incomes , while protecting the natural resource base , need to be coherent , consistent and mutually supportive ;  
The initiative aims to design sustainable natural resource management options to combat land degradation using indigenous and modern scientific principles integrated into improved production technologies .  
At the Paris ceremony , AfDB committed itself to play an active part in implementing the Convention , in line with the important role assigned to it under the provisions of the Convention , particularly in terms of integrated activities in key areas such as improving national economic environments , the sustainable use of natural resources , efficient energy use , capacity-building and sensitization .  
The main priorities of the programme on natural resources address issues relating to knowledge , the utilization and conservation of biological resources and diversity , the assessment of standing vegetation and its present and potential contribution to agricultural productivity , and the establishment of sustainable farming systems .  
sustainable use at various levels : the ecosystems / biogeographic realms level ( forests , arid zones , oceans , freshwater etc . ) ; the species level ( wildlife ) ; genetic resources level ( plant , animal and microbial resources , and natural resources economics ) ; the processes level ( biotechnology ) ; the monitoring and assessment level ; and the legal level .  
ECA provides advisory services and support to its member States on agriculture and rural development policies , planning and programming , with a focus on measures for the conservation of natural forests and their biodiversity , desertification and the related conservation of biodiversity , the rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems and green belts in targeted countries , and the strengthening of regional cooperation programmes for the optimum and sustainable use of inland and marine fisheries .  
Today these plantations and the remaining more or less natural forests suffer from lack of silvicultural interventions , overmaturation and inadequate control of excessive wildlife populations ( which , in addition to being a generally uneconomical activity , is not appreciated by the general public ) , and new environmental conditions such as air pollution and the threat posed by climate changes .  
A major development in government policy concerning mountain communities is the increased understanding of the importance of local control over natural resource management and security of resources , especially land tenure , as the main incentives for investment in environmentally sound technologies and improved land husbandry .  
Approximately 1.4-billion ha are temperate , boreal and sub-temperate forests in industrialized countries ; these are broadly stable or increasing , although there is still pressure on primary 6 / and natural stands , as well as damage from pollution and fires that reduce forest quality .  
It holds promise for increasing the yield , quality , efficient processing and utilization of products ; for decreasing reliance on agro-chemicals and other external inputs ; and for improving the conservation and use of genetic and other natural resources .  
The main issue in increasing productivity and sustainability in rain-dependent areas is how to maximize conservation and utilization of the natural rainfall , coupled with the development and adoption of technologies to promote integrated soil , water , crop and livestock management consistent with environmental sustainability at the farm household level .  
Governments should promote the active involvement of the local community in all stages of planning and management of natural resource use for productive activity , through a grass-roots approach , including the encouragement of user groups , particularly for women ; delivery of new technologies should be carried out using a participatory systems approach , with special attention to targeting investment on intended beneficiary groups , where appropriate .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , exploitation , illiteracy , hunger and disability , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Stress was also laid on the growing importance which should be attached to the promotion of the rational use of renewable natural resources and environmental protection through participatory strategies which can strengthen communities and facilitate the sustainability of the achievements made .  
She endorsed the view expressed in the commentary that the principle of optimal utilization did not necessarily mean the " maximum " use of a watercourse , but the most economically feasible and , if possible , the most efficient one , since an international watercourse was not an inexhaustible natural resource .  
The economic and social assistance rendered by the specialized agencies and international institutions of the United Nations system should be increased and redesigned to create special programmes of assistance to those Territories , bearing in mind their specific characteristics , such as their small areas and populations , their remoteness , their limited resources and internal markets , their dependence on imports , and their vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards .  
By including this programme area in chapter 35 of Agenda 21 , the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) recognized that development and natural resources management will be sustainable only if it is based on sound science , using the best scientific knowledge available and with continued research to improve the knowledge base .  
A problem shared by developing and industrialized countries alike is that most current training programmes and institutional structures are sectoral and disciplinary and do not address the complex interactions among people , natural resources , technology , environment and development .  
The concept of sustainable development is based on the conviction that it should be possible to increase the basic standard of living of the world 's growing population without unnecessarily depleting our finite natural resources and further degrading the environment in which we live .  
Other types of policies are needed for promoting economic growth and trade , changing demographic behaviour , developing human resources , alleviating poverty , promoting the transfer to developing countries of environmentally sound technology and financial resources , and managing natural resources .  
The reports identify five major causes of increasing urbanization , all of which are about the search for better living conditions : rural unemployment and underemployment ; poor rural social services ; lack of arable land ; natural disasters , particularly drought ; and civil unrest .  
For example , the UNCTAD Standing Committee on Commodities decided that there was considerable scope for financial and technical cooperation between developed and developing countries for improving the environmental advantages of natural products .  
Particular attention and recognition should be given to the role and the special situation of women living in rural areas and those working in the agricultural sector , where access to training , land , natural and productive resources , credit , development programmes and cooperative structures can help them increase their participation in sustainable development .  
Even though reliable statistics on the exact numbers of disabled persons in the region have yet to be compiled , indications are that in recent years cases of disability have increased dramatically in a number of African countries as a result of natural disasters , protracted internal armed conflict , famine and malnutrition , and the resurgence of once-controlled diseases such as tuberculosis .  
In the fifth subparagraph , after the words " an effective commitment to global , coordinated action " , add the words : " on mitigating and overcoming the consequences of natural disasters and major technological and anthropogenic catastrophes , such as that at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and their like , as well as on . . . " ;  
Reiterates that any administering or occupying Power that deprives the colonial peoples of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reiterates that the exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , are a grave threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
Taking into account the main development objectives established by the Territory 's Executive Council , namely , the improved management of the economy through a more efficient public sector , the strategic development of human resources through the reform of the educational and training systems , and the development of integrated policies of physical infrastructural improvements , as well as the preservation of the natural environment ,  
The Division is also entrusted with the follow-up activities related to major regional and global programmes and provides advisory services on the administrative mechanisms for environmentally sound exploitation and utilization of natural resources , population policies and programmes and environmental conservation management .  
Substantive and technical services will be provided to ( a ) the Committee on Energy , the working parties on coal , gas and electric power , and the Steering Committee of the Energy Efficiency 2000 Project ; and ( b ) meetings of experts on energy efficiency standards and labelling systems ( 2 ) , financial engineering of energy efficiency projects ( 2 ) , renewable sources of energy , natural gas statistics , and public acceptance and environmental aspects of major regional energy programmes .  
The sectoral advisory services cover programmes relating to human rights , global development issues and policies , energy , human settlements , trade and development , population , natural resources , social development , public administration and finance , crime prevention and criminal justice , statistics and emergency humanitarian assistance .  
The exercise analysed the current state of human development in the countries and identified broad development strategies that take into account the specific socio-economic characteristics , fragile ecosystems and limited natural resource base of these island economies .  
The Pacific island countries and the donor community are now faced with the challenge of translating these strategies into concrete action at the country level , with a need to generate broad-based economic growth while making judicious , sustainable use of the limited natural resource base and ensuring a balance of the fragile ecosystems .  
In order to ensure an integrated approach to the complexity of mountain ecosystems and the socio-economic issues at stake , the Commission recognizes the need for strengthening the existing institutional mechanisms as well as the knowledge base about mountain ecosystems through research , database development , pilot projects and information exchange , along with support for training in-country of scientific and technical experts and local natural resource managers .  
The Commission requests the organizations of the United Nations system and other relevant organizations to organize , within existing resources , regional workshops to explore , discuss and further develop methodological approaches to integration based upon , for example , work being done in environmental economics , valuation , natural resource accounting and integrated economic and environmental accounting .  
The concept of sustainable human development marks an important advance in the global search for a new way of ordering human affairs - a way that is equitable to both current and future generations in all parts of the world , one that will ensure that future generations inherit a natural resource base at least as viable as that of earlier generations .  
The activities under this subprogramme will aim at strengthening the capability of ESCAP members and associate members in environmental and natural resource management ; integration of environmental considerations into economic policy decision-making ; transfer of environmentally sound technologies ; sustainable rural and urban development ; population and sustainable development ; and natural disaster reduction .  
The objective of the Decade remains , as originally stated , " to reduce through concerted international action , especially in developing countries , the loss of life , property damage and social and economic disruption caused by natural disasters " .  
The main reasons included a shortage of resources , both domestic and external , the lack of an appropriate macroeconomic framework in several countries and , in some cases , various crises - political and / or natural - that interrupted economic activity .  
The envisaged cooperation aims at supporting efforts of the member States of the two organizations to promote regional cooperation and sustainable human development through programmes and activities designed to mobilize and enhance human resources , to promote the environmentally sound use of natural and mineral resources and raise the living standards of the peoples in the countries concerned .  
These included : empowerment of women as an overall concept ; mass media ; statistics and indicators on gender issues ; natural resources and sustainable development : water , waste management and sanitation ; renewable energy ; and issues related to different groups of female population such as the ageing , displaced ; refugees and migrants .  50 .  The Board decided that INSTRAW should introduce the following in its new programme , among other subjects :  
Particular areas in which regional cooperation requires strengthening by both the Territories concerned and international agencies : preservation and protection of marine and other natural resources from over-exploitation ; transport and communications ; higher education ; research and development ; regional pooling arrangements for sharing special skills and expertise ; and assistance in the public health area ;  
Countries may experience disruption of their governmental systems from at least three major sources : massive natural disasters , such as earthquakes , cyclones , or volcanic eruptions ; internal civil strife ; or external conflict / war with neighbouring States .  
Whereas all peoples have the right of self-determination and by virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic , social and cultural development and may , for their own ends , freely dispose of their natural wealth and resources without prejudice to any obligations arising out of international economic cooperation , based upon the principle of mutual benefit and international law ;  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the people of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
In this regard , Earthwatch is exploring the potential to use schools , non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , the media and other groups in building a more complete picture of the status of species , land uses , development activities , pollution problems and other characteristics of the human and natural environment as inputs for state-of-the-environment reporting and as a basis for selective continued monitoring of national and global trends and for filling data gaps .  
In that resolution , the General Assembly decided that the major activities for the observance of the Year should be concentrated at the local , regional and national levels and assisted by the United Nations and its system of organizations , with a view to creating among Governments , policy makers and the public a greater awareness of the family as the natural and fundamental unit of society .  
This has facilitated the monitoring of borders , coastlines , territorial and international waters , space and natural resources by means of powerful , ultra-precise radar networks , instead of by land , sea and air patrols , thereby freeing up human , material and temporal resources so as to secure borders against enemy infiltration and guaranteeing the repulsion of any violation of the integrity , security and stability of States or entire regions .  
Cooperation in the context of subregional and regional action programmes includes agreed joint programmes for the sustainable management of transboundary natural resources , scientific and technical cooperation and strengthening of relevant institutions .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the people of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
In the developing countries as a whole , the share of manufacturing in GDP rose from 17 per cent in 1960 to 21 per cent in 1990 , and the share of agriculture fell from over 31 per cent to a little more than 18 per cent , but in the least developed countries , manufacturing is still less than 10 per cent of their GDP and consists largely of food processing and natural fibre textile industries , which can not expand vigorously without a strong agricultural sector .  
Provide financial and institutional support for research on safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods and technologies for the reproductive and sexual health of women and men , including more safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods for the regulation of fertility , including natural family planning for both sexes , methods to protect against HIV / AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases and simple and inexpensive methods of diagnosing such diseases , among others .  
Particular attention and recognition should be given to the role and the special situation of women living in rural areas and those working in the agricultural sector , where access to training , land , natural and productive resources , credit , development programmes and cooperative structures can help them increase their participation in sustainable development .  
In certain regions , women are generally the most stable members of the community , as men often pursue work in distant locations , leaving women to safeguard the natural environment and ensure adequate and sustainable resource allocation within the household and the community .  251 .  The strategic actions needed for sound environmental management require a holistic , multidisciplinary and intersectoral approach .  
The impact on women of environmental and natural resource degradation , deriving from , inter alia , unsustainable production and consumption patterns , drought , poor quality water , global warming , desertification , sea-level rise , hazardous waste , natural disasters , toxic chemicals and pesticide residues , radioactive waste , armed conflicts and its consequences ;  
The origin of social exclusion is often to be found in racism and racial discrimination , phenomena which many Governments believe should be written off as things of the past , denying their persistence or describing as " natural " the economic and social conditions of ethnic , racial and religious minorities and indigenous populations .

NULLCooperation between the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) and the League of Arab States continued during 1994-1995 in technical fields of mutual interest in the areas of agriculture and rural development , natural resources and environment protection , human resources training and global economic and social development .  
The mechanism , an open-ended interdisciplinary and inter-agency working process , would provide a collective operating framework to direct a credible and effective application of early warning within disaster management at all levels , in particular in support of local communities at risk from natural and similar disasters ;  
Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island States and land-locked countries ,  
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts .  
The Division is responsible for establishing policies for environmentally sound and sustainable multi-sectoral development plans , the integration of environmental imperatives into the development process , the development of energy and natural resources and the reduction of natural disasters , taking into account technological and economic and demographic development .  
NULLIn recent years , the frequency and magnitude of major disasters , whether of a natural , technological or ecological origin , have made the world community aware of the immense loss of human life and economic resources that are regularly caused by such calamities .  
38 The growing awareness and consideration of these societal issues together with advances in spaceborne technology mean that effective , affordable and global mobile satellite communications and remote sensing capabilities that should significantly reduce the devastating effects of natural disasters should soon be implemented .  
It involves the transmission of knowledge and the affirmation of values that emphasize peaceful coexistence , responsibility , tolerance , solidarity and justice and that promote the development of individuals who show social solidarity and who are active and tolerant in the political sphere , productive in the economic sphere , respectful of human rights and aware of the value of the natural environment .  
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts .  
For example , a cooperative program was undertaken examining commercial cotton fields in the San Joaquin Valley of California , aimed at developing integrated tools to produce crops that maximize economic return , support efficient use of natural resources , and minimize detrimental impacts on the environment .  
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the people of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,

Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , exploitation , intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger and disability , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,

dense traffic includes the transport of noxious , dangerous and hazardous cargoes ( 011 , liquified natural gas ( LNG ) , liquefied petroleum gas ( LPG ) , chemicals , other explosive and environmentally hazardous substances ) .  
With regard to the subprogrammes on food and agriculture , economic and social planning , industrial , scientific and technological development , international trade and development finance , natural resources and energy , and social development , it would be misleading to state that any of them duplicated work done by other bodies and that ECLAC should not be involved in such activities .  
concerned at the fact that the recent natural disasters that have occurred in Nicaragua , the burden of the foreign debt , despite its reduction and renegotiation achieved with the collaboration of the international community , and the harmful effects on its economy of the prolonged periods of drought followed by excessive rain and floods that have afflicted the Central American region impede the efforts being made by Nicaragua to overcome the consequences of war within the framework of a democracy and under the macroeconomic conditions already achieved ,

In this forum I will limit myself to recalling the significant role of His Majesty King Moshoeshoe II and the natural and constructive approach he had towards existing problems in the African continent , as well as his personal commitment towards charitable organizations with the purpose of raising funds for special social and development projects and programmes .  
This makes us hopeful that the Assembly will be able to do so as a permanent part of its daily work , not having to deal with tragic events such as these , but in a healthy and natural way playing its role as the universal , supreme and sovereign organ of the United Nations .  
The heads of Government adopted a package of recommendations aimed at reducing the vulnerability of the region to the impact of natural occurrences , improving and expanding the region 's risk acceptance capacity , the development of strong and effective insurance regulation and regulatory capacity , and at strengthening the institutional base for national disaster mitigation , forecasting and assessment .  
The ever-dwindling natural resource base , global warming , persistent droughts and desertification are eloquent reminders that humankind 's current destructive processes of growth are pushing our planet towards the precipice .  
On this occasion , I wish to express my deep gratitude to the Governments of various countries , the affiliated organs and specialized agencies of the United Nations system , including the Department of Humanitarian Affairs , non-governmental organizations , and individuals for their moral , material and humanitarian assistance and encouragement to our people , which have been provided in the hope of removing , as quickly as possible , the damage caused in recent years by successive natural disasters .  
Every State has the right to choose its political , economic and social system , to preserve its natural resources and to resort to peaceful negotiations as a means of settling disputes within the context of bilateral , regional and international initiatives and endeavours .  
Although the international community has succeeded , by dint of serious negotiations , in resolving many difficult problems and has achieved important results in many sensitive areas through the establishment of the World Trade Organization , we are still concerned by the continuing practice of trade protectionism , which runs counter to our belief in the importance of allowing market forces to play their natural role in economic affairs .  
Its objectives responsible management , food security , development of human resources , the proper and effective use of natural resources , cooperation and economic regional integration are ambitious but feasible .  
ECLAC has rendered valuable service through subprogrammes on economic development , social development , international trade , development financing and transport , industrial , agricultural , and technological modernization , environment , natural resources and human settlements , statistics and economic projections , the integration of women into development , regional integration and cooperation , economic and social planning and population .  
Thus , we are in no way , and to no degree , inhibited with regard to addressing inviting profound reflection on the issue of the special circumstances of small island developing States particularly those in the Caribbean region , where prominent among the features characterizing our special circumstances is the ever-present vulnerability to natural disaster and the widespread devastation resulting therefrom .  
While in the beginning of this partnership large amounts had to be contributed towards emergency measures , today the extensive bilateral development cooperation focuses mainly on the consolidation of structural adaptation processes , the rehabilitation of social infrastructures , the promotion of private enterprises ( including vocational training ) , agricultural development , and the protection of the environment and natural resources .  
Looking back over the recent past , we are very much aware that the cumulative impact of natural disasters and economic crises has combined to produce an untenable situation clearly deserving concerted international support and assistance .  
Consistent with agreements reached at the regional level , Papua New Guinea has adopted a comprehensive code of logging practice designed to promote the sustainable use and in-country processing of a rich renewable natural resource .  
We have developed , in close cooperation with the countries of the Caribbean region , a strategy based on three main priorities : support for the process of economic transition ; promotion of sustainable development of the Caribbean region with particular emphasis on human resource development , the protection of natural resources and combating socio-economic threats , including the fight against drugs ; and the promotion of increased economic cooperation leading to fuller integration in the world market .  
It should be unconscionable that financial flows to Africa remain so low despite renewed commitments by the international community to the contrary , and even more so when the majority of African countries have undertaken difficult and unpopular structural adjustment programmes that have marginalized the poor further , depleted natural resources and degraded the environment .  
In our endeavours to face the challenges of humanitarian assistance in emergency situations , the role of the United Nations is of utmost importance in providing a proper framework for effective coordination when the international community is called upon to address difficult problems emerging from natural disasters or other phenomena of a complex nature .  
The Republic of Belarus deeply appreciates the efforts made by all the programmes , funds and specialized agencies of the United Nations system towards providing increased , speedier and better quality assistance to the various countries and regions suffering from armed conflicts , natural disasters , industrial ecological catastrophes and other emergency circumstances .  
Concerned by the increasing suffering of millions of victims of natural disasters , emergency situations and armed conflicts and by the attendant loss of life , flows of refugees , mass displacement of populations and infrastructure devastation , the United Arab Emirates declares its support for international efforts to assess and enhance the capacity of the United Nations and its specialized agencies to address these grave international humanitarian problems and to strengthen the participation of the international community .  
It is precisely because of our recognition of the specific and peculiar problems faced by the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories , most of which are small island Territories that suffer from impediments created by the interplay of such factors as economic and geographic size , isolation , vulnerability to natural disasters , lack of technological and financial resources and so on , including problems of accessibility to international credit and markets , that the international community should give specific priority and attention to the process of decolonization affecting the peoples of those Territories .  
The draft resolution before the Assembly recognizes the increasing need for humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development .  
Endorses the need for a global knowledge base on mineral resource potential , in terms of potential source areas , to be developed so that it can be integrated with other land-use information as an essential part of an integrated approach to the planning and management of natural resources ;  
Most of the efforts are directed towards the strengthening of operational capability of existing regional or national institutions involved in environmental management for sustainable development , natural resource monitoring or land-cover mapping .  
30 ECA , through its education and training programme in 1996 and 1997 , will continue to focus on developing and strengthening institutional , technical and human capabilities in the application of cartography and remote sensing techniques in data collection for natural resource and environmental management , while organizing expert meetings to enhance policies and design legislative guidelines for the use of cartography and remote sensing in social and economic planning ( see also paragraphs 129-131 below ) . 
As far as the energy-deficient developing countries are concerned , to meet this challenge and to arrest their ever-increasing dependence on imported energy , mainly oil , it will be necessary to accelerate exploration and development of indigenous energy resources and to develop greater capacity for producing commercial primary energy : oil , natural gas , coal , hydropower and other new and renewable sources of energy .  
The outlook for natural gas consumption in developing countries is for continued steady growth , given that many of these countries have indigenous gas resources that can be developed or expanded for domestic use , and considering their high electricity demand growth and the economic and environmental benefits of additional gas use ( see figure X ) . 
Deeply concerned at the fact that the recent natural disasters that have occurred in Nicaragua , the burden of the foreign debt , despite its reduction and renegotiation achieved with the collaboration of the international community , and the harmful effects on its economy of the prolonged periods of drought followed by excessive rain and floods that have afflicted the Central American region impede the efforts being made by Nicaragua to overcome the consequences of war within the framework of a democracy and under the macroeconomic conditions already achieved ,  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
[ Depending on local conditions in the housing sector and the availability of legal protection guaranteeing equal access to resources and opportunities , ] vulnerable groups include the poorest groups , some of the older persons , street children , youth , [ documented ] migrants , internally displaced persons , inhabitants of disadvantaged communities , people affected by natural and human-caused disasters , households headed by women , persons with disabilities and some indigenous people .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the people of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
In improving natural and human-made disaster prevention , preparedness , mitigation and response , Governments at the appropriate level , including local authorities , and in close consultation and cooperation with such entities as insurance companies , non-governmental organizations , community-based organizations , organized communities , the academic , health and scientific community , should :  
In addition , such human settlements provide equal opportunity for a productive and freely chosen livelihood ; equal access to economic resources , including the right to inheritance , the ownership of land and other property , credit , natural resources and appropriate technologies ; for personal , spiritual , religious , cultural and social development ; for participation in public decision-making ; for equal rights and obligations with regard to the conservation and use of natural and cultural resources ; and equal access to mechanisms to ensure that rights are not violated .  
The sustainability of the global environment and human life will not be achieved unless , among other things , human settlements in both urban and rural areas are made economically buoyant , socially vibrant and environmentally sound , with full respect for cultural , religious and natural heritage and diversity .  
The raising costs of urban land and other factors prevent the poor and other vulnerable and disadvantaged groups from gaining access to suitable land , whose location does not pose economic , environmental or health risks to the residents because of its proximity to industrial facilities or susceptibility to natural disasters .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , exploitation , intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger and disability , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island States and land-locked countries ,  
Commending all countries and intergovernmental and regional organizations that have actively engaged in regional and subregional assessments of vulnerability to natural hazards and have consequently initiated regional and subregional cooperation in the field of disaster reduction , including the exchange of data and technology , as well as the development of joint administrative , technological and scientific approaches for applied disaster reduction ,  
Reaffirming that sustained economic growth and sustainable development are essential for the prevention of and preparedness for natural disasters and similar disasters with an adverse impact on the environment and that special attention should be given to disaster prevention and preparedness by the Governments concerned as well as by the international community ,  
Because industrial and agricultural activities on the Earth 's environment have reached such a level that their effects are clearly observed on a global scale , continuous and sustainable development action and policies should be carried out for the protection and maintenance of Earth 's natural environment .  
In addition to their direct social and local economic consequences , natural disasters affected the macroeconomic standing of countries , increasing debt , reducing foreign income due to loss of exports and reducing overall production outputs .  
It was stated that pure scientific , applied and experimental research relevant to natural hazard management was required .  
To avoid alarmist or misleading awareness campaigns , they need reliable and representative information - e.g . , on various forest types ( boreal , temperate , tropical , wet , dry , natural , plantations , monocultures ) ; ( e ) The general public and media . 
The internationally accepted definition of a protected area is given as an area of land and / or sea that is especially dedicated to the protection and maintenance of biological diversity , as well as of natural and associated cultural resources , and that is managed through legal or other effective means .  
Fiscal regimes applied to natural resources have a long way to go in discouraging the excessive extraction and harvesting of natural resources and / or mobilizing substantial additional budgetary resources for sustainable development .  
In practice , the ongoing reform of natural resource fiscal regimes in various countries has a long way to go in mobilizing substantial additional budgetary resources and at the same time discouraging excessive extraction and harvesting of natural resources .  
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
The domestic factors include : civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some LDCs and the resulting social and economic burdens , political instability , macroeconomic imbalances , manifested in large fiscal and balance-of-payments deficits , in many cases the unfavourable short-term impact of macroeconomic policy adjustments on specific areas , in particular the most disadvantaged and vulnerable sections of the population , and poor performance of the productive sectors including lack of adequate physical infrastructure .  
In this programme the United Nations University Institute for Natural Resources in Africa ( UNU / INRA ) addresses the continent 's urgent needs for human resources development and institutional capacity-building in order to achieve more effective conservation , management and rational utilization of natural resources for sustainable development .  
Whatever their geographical scope , however , issues such as depletion of natural resources , declining food production , and declining availability and quality of water were linked with issues such as income generation , literacy , health care , unsustainable patterns of production and consumption in the developed world , privatization and the effects of structural adjustment programmes , international trade patterns , and the foreign debt burden .  
Commends the efforts of the Institute to address all levels of poverty that hamper so dramatically the advancement of women , through the coordination of research and training activities in the areas of economic and political empowerment of women ; statistics and indicators in gender issues ; communications ; women , natural resources and sustainable development ; water , sanitation and waste management ; renewable sources of energy ; and issues related to different population groups , such as the girl child , older women , displaced women , refugee and migrant women and women in rural areas ;  
Article 44 of the amended Constitution stipulated that in using frequency bands for radio services , member administrations should bear in mind that radio frequencies and the geostationary-satellite orbit were limited natural resources which must be used rationally , efficiently and economically , so that countries or groups of countries could have equitable access to both , taking account of the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries .  
43 His delegation considered that any draft text prepared by the Subcommittee on the utilization of the geostationary orbit should mention chapter VII , article 44 , No . 196 , paragraph 2 , of the Constitution of ITU , which indicated that the geostationary-satellite orbit was a limited natural resource and must be used rationally , efficiently and economically , and that countries or groups of countries must have equitable access to it , taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries .  
For geographical reasons Ecuador had demonstrated great interest in the geostationary orbit , which was a limited natural resource with special characteristics , and for which there should be a sui generis legal regime regulating access to and utilization of the orbit and guaranteeing equitable access to it , with account being taken of the relative disadvantages of the developing countries .  
As a result of the decentralization of activities and resources in the fields of natural resources and energy as discussed in the report of the Secretary-General of this subject ( see document A / C . 5 / 48 / 76 of 31 May 1994 ) , technical and professional posts were decentralized from the Department for Development Support and Management Services to the regional commissions in order to strengthen their ability to provide technical assistance and policy advice in the area of mineral resources at the regional level .  
The multidisciplinary mission team consisted of 10 members and included a development economist , a mineral resources expert , an industrial economist , an environmental lawyer , a sustainable agriculture analyst , a fisheries adviser , a natural resources adviser , an institutional adviser , an education adviser and a people 's participation adviser .  
It should be possible to quadruple the goods and services that could be produced with a given quantity of natural resources and energy , which would enable developing countries to quadruple their production and consumption without increasing their environmental impact , while the developed countries could maintain their standard of living while greatly reducing their environmental impact .  
To the extent that hazardous wastes exported to developing countries result in the contamination of soil and adjacent waters , they may reduce future productivity and economic uses of those natural resources , besides endangering human , animal and plant life .  
Those who considered that the question deserved prompt consideration by the Commission stressed that rules concerning the nationality of legal persons might be more common in State practice and customary law , thus lending themselves more easily to systematization , in contrast to the striking absence of specific provisions on the nationality of natural persons in the context of State succession in the legislation of the majority of States .  
Create awareness among policy makers of women 's role in the conservation and regeneration of natural resources , including access to the required legal , scientific and technological means , and of their participation in environmental research by documenting and promoting women 's indigenous knowledge base ; advocate the increase of women 's participation and their perspectives in environment , science and technology research , policy and programmes , and more ethical science and technology ( UNIFEM , DAW / DPCSD , UNEP , Division for Science and Technology / UNCTAD , ECE , UNICEF ) .  
" Micro-organisms " : bacteria , viruses , mycoplasmas , rickettsiae or fungi , whether natural , enhanced or modified , either in the form of " isolated live cultures " , including in dormant form or in dried preparations , or as material , including living material , which has been deliberately inoculated or contaminated with such cultures .  
Most of the developed countries draw on large shares of crude oil and natural gas in their primary energy consumption ; some regions have substantial contributions of nuclear energy and modern renewable sources . 
Potential carbon dioxide utilization , disposal , and storage options include enhanced oil recovery , storage in depleted natural gas fields and other underground reservoirs , chemical feedstocks and other basic material , and finally disposal in the deep ocean .  
The Board recognizes that the transportation and provision of controlled drugs needed for humanitarian aid in acute emergencies of natural or human origin constitute a genuine justification for non-application of the normal , regular control requirements .  
Endorses the need for a global knowledge base on mineral resource potential , in terms of potential source areas , to be developed so that it can be integrated with other land-use information as an essential part of an integrated approach to the planning and management of natural resources ;  
This audience-oriented approach focuses on rural young men and women , the key players in a global programme aimed at ensuring increased agricultural production that conserves our natural resources to the greatest extent and sustainable rural development that reduces the push of rural poverty that exacerbates the current high levels of rural to urban migration in many of the developing countries .  
Thus , the rapid demographic growth of some cities and the movements of landless farm workers in hot , rainy ecosystems are extreme examples of the critical links that exist between demographic dynamics and the natural environment .  
The Board stated that the Institute 's programme of work should continue to focus on and establish priorities in areas where INSTRAW has already acquired expertise - areas such as the political and economic empowerment of women ; statistics and indicators in gender issues ; natural resources and sustainable development ; water and waste management ; renewable sources of energy ; access to credit ; women and the media ; and , issues relating to different population groups , especially the elderly and displaced , refugees and migrant women .  
The subprogramme , which is implemented by the Division for Environment Management and Social Development , provides assistance in conceptualizing , formulating and implementing action-oriented , people-centred programmes at the national level emphasizing the interface between natural resources , environmental management and social development through operational projects and substantive contributions to relevant global conferences and intergovernmental bodies .  
To strengthen the institutional , human resources and policy-making capabilities of Governments and communities in order to foster the effective planning and management of natural resources ; to promote an iterative and multisectoral approach to water resources management that integrates technological , socio-economic , environmental and human health considerations and involves local initiatives and participation in such development efforts ; and to formulate policies on mineral resources that encourage environmentally sound production practices ;  
To strengthen the institutional capacity of Governments and communities for the development , utilization and commercialization of new and renewable energy sources ; to develop national and indigenous capacity in assessment and management of energy resources and services ; to introduce changes in energy consumption patterns , focusing on conservation measures and demand-side management ; to facilitate international and interregional connections for the transmission of electric power and transport of natural gas ; and to promote technology transfer to different levels of government , civil society , community institutions and entrepreneurs .  
In relation to natural resources and energy , it focused on addressing issues of institutional management , defining the roles of the State , particularly in regard to privatization and regulation , contributing to the design and application of public policies for integrated natural resources management and providing support for the regional implementation of international environmental agreements that relate to natural resource management .  
Population density , availability of key natural resources , per capita income and urban and agricultural conditions differ between the crowded coastal plain and the less densely populated West Bank .  
Concerning agriculture , United Nations assistance will follow a multi-track approach aimed at strengthening the institutional capacity of the Palestinian Authority for agricultural development ; supporting sustainable natural resources management policies and practices ; revitalizing support services to agricultural entrepreneurs ; developing the sector 's human resources and encouraging the competitiveness of agricultural products ; and supporting the rehabilitation of essential rural physical infrastructures .  
Since its creation in 1992 pursuant to General Assembly resolution 46 / 182 , the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of the Secretariat has grown into an effective facilitator for the coordination of both natural and complex emergencies , and has increased its capacity to act as an advocate of humanitarian assistance in the context of both political and humanitarian policy discussions , and with respect to resource mobilization for humanitarian emergencies . 
The secretariat for the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction has continued to support and coordinate the implementation of the Decade 's targets and its overall objective of reducing , through concerted international action , the loss of life , material destruction , and social and economic disruption which occur as a consequence of natural disasters .  
There has been substantial progress in the establishment of a physical planning unit to direct natural resource management and in the preparation of an environmental profile of the island and an inventory of its historical , archaeological , cultural and natural resources .  
In 1993 , the President of the Republic of Kalmykia , K . Ilyumzhinov , declared an ecological state of emergency owing to the rapid deterioration of the ecological situation in the territory of the Republic as a result of the increased impact in recent decades of the anthropogenic burden on the environment combined with the region 's extreme natural conditions .  
This policy statement , intended as a contribution by the world 's farmers to the World Food Summit , emphasized that in order to increase food production while at the same time assuring sustainable relationships with the natural environment and maintaining stable rural societies , farmers acting through their own organizations needed to take a central role . 
This degree of importance becomes even more obvious as one realizes that water is a natural resource which is scarce and limited and whose quality has repercussions in the ecosystems of which it is the core , thus capable of harming the living conditions of both present and future generations .  
The traditional approach to funding ECE / FAO work on temperate and boreal forest resource assessment has been a cooperative approach in which member countries and certain organizations have provided major contributions , mostly in kind , and a very small secretariat team has played a coordinating and assembling role with a limited amount of analytical and validation work ; this is a natural and justified approach in a region where most counties have rather well-developed forest inventory capacity .  
The Forest Principles , chapters 11 and 12 of Agenda 21 and the Convention to Combat Desertification together provide a substantive framework which could support , guide and monitor national and international efforts to assess , manage and conserve fragile dryland ecosystems , including forests , wooded lands and trees , natural or planted , of dry areas .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
While they have evolved a holistic , traditional scientific knowledge of their land , natural resources and environment , their ability to practise sustainable development of their lands has been limited by economic , social and historical factors .  
Although Africa is faced with enormous problems , it also has a great potential , both in human and natural resources , for sustained economic growth and sustainable development .  
Since it may be easier to negotiate and implement , country certification may not only lay the groundwork for more comprehensive international forest product certification agreements but also buy time , by initiating immediate incentives for action on sustainable forest management while the details of more complicated agreements on certification for all global forest products from natural and plantation forests are concluded .  
In the face of this paralysing economic strangulation , decreed unilaterally by our neighbours , which should be cultivating natural human solidarity more than ever with a Burundi immersed in a state of distress , we are once again threatened with genocide , the causes of which everyone is seeking to eradicate , but which could re-emerge owing to those measures that run counter to legal and humanitarian principles .  
The Council , in paragraph 2 of the resolution , " Commends the work of the Institute on the issue addressing the process of the economic and political empowerment of women ; statistics and indicators in gender issues ; women , natural resources and sustainable development ; water , waste management and renewable sources of energy ; and issues related to different groups , such as the elderly , displaced , refugees and migrant women " .  
The eradication of poverty can not be accomplished through anti-poverty programmes alone but will require democratic participation , and changes in economic structures in order to ensure access for all to resources , opportunities and public services , to undertake policies geared to more equitable distribution of wealth and income , to implement social protection for those who can not support themselves , and to assist people confronted with unforeseen catastrophe , whether individual or collective , natural , social or technological .  
Participants in the high-level segment recognized that , in future work , more attention should be paid to addressing the driving forces that impacted on the sustainable management of natural resources while at the same time giving more attention to the economic and social dimensions of sustainable development , including combating poverty .  
Periodic natural and man-made disasters and other adverse situations , including political instability and civil strife and problems of refugees and their attendant negative consequences , continue to imperil the fragile socio-economic conditions in many least developed countries .  
It is to be hoped that the scientifically advanced nations will effectively control the use of scientific progress by their nationals or public authorities and prevent any use detrimental to the natural wealth and the human , genetic and biological resources of the less developed nations or to the individual freedom and privacy of their citizens , especially with respect to trade in and management of waste materials .  
However , he questioned the wisdom of having one treaty body that was extremely well funded , while other treaty bodies had inadequate resources and administrative support with possibly no natural outside agencies to provide additional funding that could lead to increased effectiveness and more optimal functioning .  
UNESCO 's efforts through programme implementation are centred on the training of human resources in fields of vital importance for their development , such as access to mother-tongue education , revitalization of components of their cultural heritage , development of traditional skills relating to the protection and use of natural resources , promotion of crafts and encouraging systematic mechanisms of dialogue with member States . UNESCO 's policy in the area of indigenous issues is a long-term task based on regular and progressive consultation with indigenous partners .  
The project consisted of an inter-agency mission by the Department for Development Support and Management Services , FAO , UNIDO , and UNESCO to provide an integrated package of policy advice to the Government on : ( i ) integrating environment and development at all levels of the decision-making process ; ( ii ) an integrated approach to the management of renewable and non-renewable natural resources ; ( iii ) strengthening mechanisms for effective indigenous people 's participation in decision-making ; ( iv ) capacity-building for villages , communities , and grass-root non-governmental organizations .  
" The inhuman Israeli practices include the various material , political , cultural and social situations of the Arab citizens in the occupied region of the Syrian Arab Golan , not to mention the continuity of settlement policy , advancing to the Arab territories , destruction of building , theft of antiquities , investment and seizure of lands , natural resources and water sources . "  
Deeply concerned at the fact that the recent natural disasters that have occurred in Nicaragua , the burden of the foreign debt , despite its reduction and renegotiation achieved with the collaboration of the international community , and the harmful effects on its economy of the prolonged periods of rain and floods that have afflicted the Central American region impede the efforts being made by Nicaragua to overcome the consequences of war within the framework of a democracy and under the macroeconomic conditions already achieved ,  
The proposal was made by the Commission in its report on its forty-seventh session in 1995 , 1 / in which the Commission notes that the topic could be considered as part of its long-term programme of work and could , inter alia , cover the content and scope of the rule of exhaustion of local remedies , the rule of nationality of claims as applied to both natural and juristic persons , problems of stateless persons and dual nationals , and the effect of dispute settlement clauses on domestic remedies and on the exercise of diplomatic protection .  
The Parties consider that the delimitation of the Caspian Sea between the littoral States in one form or another is fully consistent with international practice and the principles and rules of international law and will facilitate their cooperation on the basis of equal rights and mutual advantage and help to attract investments and modern technology for the purpose of the effective , rational and safe use of the natural resources of the Caspian .  
It was mentioned that the Centre was also committed to protecting and maintaining the historic , cultural and natural heritage of indigenous and other people , and that Governments , as enabling partners , should create and strengthen effective partnerships with vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities .  
In addition , given the natural cycles of drought and floods in the region , weaknesses of rural and urban infrastructure , shortage of food stocks and seeds , generalized poverty , and vulnerability of the majority of the economic agents , the country will inevitably continue to face future emergency situations , at the local level or nationwide , arising from natural calamities .  
Expressing its solidarity with the people and countries that suffer as a result of natural disasters and expressing also the deepest sympathy to all victims of the natural disasters that have struck in various parts of the globe , Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island States and landlocked countries ,  
Reaffirms the need to support the implementation of the Yokohama Strategy and its Plan of Action with particular regard to improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , for the purpose of capacity-building and human resources development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , as well as least developed , small island and landlocked countries ;  
According to Indonesia , the proposed axis lines are the result of years of careful study of various factors , such as : the need of international transportation and aviation in transiting Indonesian waters ; the hydrographic and natural marine conditions in and near the relevant axis lines ; the intensity of coastal and inter-island navigation and overflight ; the intensity of fishing activities , particularly of local artisanal fishermen ; the existence of oil and gas exploration and exploitation ;  
His delegation particularly welcomed the inclusion of crimes against United Nations and associated personnel and the use in armed conflict of methods and means of warfare calculated to cause widespread , long-term and severe damage to the natural environment , particularly in the light of their emergence as crimes under customary international law .  
The Bank viewed land ownership and natural resources management ; technical assistance and training ; basic investment in education , health and other aspects of human capital that were adapted to indigenous peoples and their cultures ; and better access to goods and services , including financial resources , as closely related factors which warranted special attention in tackling the poverty and marginalization of Latin America 's indigenous people .  
Deeply concerned at the fact that the recent natural disasters that have occurred in Nicaragua , the burden of the foreign debt , despite its reduction and renegotiation achieved with the collaboration of the international community , and the harmful effects on its economy of the prolonged periods of rain and floods that have afflicted the Central American region impede the efforts being made by Nicaragua to overcome the consequences of war within the framework of a democracy and under the macroeconomic conditions already achieved ,  
Each national legislation established its own rules concerning natural persons , with the sole obligation of observing international custom and generally recognized legal principles , particularly the 1993 Hague Convention concerning specific questions relating to conflicts of laws on nationality .  
The Heads of State again emphasize the special importance of developing and extracting the rich natural resources of their countries , in the first instance natural gas , petroleum and hydro-energy resources , and called for urgent measures to conduct joint projects for laying pipelines and electricity transmission lines to deliver energy to world markets , with the involvement in these projects of the States concerned , international financial institutions and State and private structures .  
In November 1995 , the Committee approved , on an exceptional basis , taking into account prevailing humanitarian conditions in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , the export of 186.5-million cubic metres of natural gas per month from the Russian Federation for an initial period of two months , on condition that it would revert to the matter in the case of interruptions or delays in the delivery of natural gas to Sarajevo for other than technical reasons .

In all cases where the responsibility of a corporate body is engaged , the maximum fine applicable to such a body is equal to five times that provided for natural persons by the statute punishing the offence ( art . 131 _ 41 of the new Penal Code ) .  
Respect for fundamental human rights was deeply embedded in what was called the " Pacific way " , a sort of unspoken mutual understanding that meant that respect for the basic rights of all came naturally to the peoples of the Pacific islands and that it was natural for them to seek out dialogue , in other words , to practice democracy , a fact of which they were quite proud .  
The purpose of the present report , which has been prepared in response to that request , is to provide an objective review and appraisal of the current conditions and trends in the exploitation and consumption of natural resources in human settlements , with a view to identifying imminent threats to sustainability , and to provide options for strategic interventions that could put current consumption patterns on to a sustainable track .  
Noting that the unfavourable situation of the Comoros , which is on the list of least developed countries , is aggravated by several important factors , including its physical distance from its trading partners , the scarcity of natural resources , the diminutive size of the domestic market , the fall in prices of its export products and the poverty of its soil ,

The question of Palestine can not be resolved simply through the redeployment of Israeli forces , but only through complete withdrawal of the occupation forces from all the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967 , including Jerusalem ; through the dismantling of the Israeli settlements , which have been declared illegal by the international community , as is evident in Security Council Resolutions 465 ( 1980 ) and 478 ( 1980 ) ; and through the exercise by the Palestinian people of their right to sovereignty over their land and natural resources .  
The Trade and Development Report had gone beyond the traditional argument put forward by the World Bank in various respects : first , by emphasizing the need to establish a dynamic interaction between exports and investment ; secondly , by showing the importance of mobilizing and making full use of natural resources and abundant , unskilled labour and of continuously upgrading industries and moving up the technological ladder ; and thirdly , by pointing to the challenges for government policies involving new forms of intervention to support a dynamic process of development .  
In view of the acute external financial constraints and low levels of domestic savings in most African countries , there was a pressing need to improve their capacity to attract foreign investment , in the process drawing investors ' attention to the considerable opportunities existing in all major economic sectors , namely natural resources , agro-industry , other manufacturing , tourism , other services , and infrastructure .  
In spite of all these setbacks , African countries had pressed ahead with efforts to facilitate the effective development and utilization of human resources , harness their vast natural resources , mobilize both domestic and foreign financial resources for development and strengthen regional and subregional cooperation and integration .  
In view of the enormous negative effects of natural disasters on the economic and social development of countries , national , regional and international programmes for sustainable development should always take into consideration activities for disaster prevention , preparedness and mitigation .  
MANOR ( Israel ) , speaking in explanation of vote before the voting , said that the draft resolution was superfluous because the issue of rights over natural resources had been covered in the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement signed on 28 September 1995 , and should be settled within the framework of the direct negotiations on permanent status already under way .  
Today , the infrastructure in remote and rural areas can be significantly improved through satellite remote sensing , particularly with respect to natural disaster warning and mitigation , management of water , forest and food resources , planning and operation of transport systems and other supporting activities relating to social and economic development .  
" Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,

Recognizing the need for coordinated humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for immediate relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , which are not necessarily sequential and often proceed at the same time ,  
Encourages Governments to ensure coherence in the direction given to the governing bodies of relevant organizations , funds and programmes of the United Nations system , and to thereby promote the development and strengthening of the cooperation between these organizations and the Department of Humanitarian Affairs , drawing on the mandate , expertise and respective strengths and available capabilities of each , to improve the system-wide capability for a quick and coordinated response to complex humanitarian emergencies and natural disasters ;  
This enhanced capacity is already going beyond the provision of such data as natural attrition rates , by working to introduce analysis of projected staffing and organizational structures at the macro , organizational level , and skill and staff needs required at the micro , departmental level .  
Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General , [ 1 ] in particular of the attention paid by the Secretary-General to effectiveness , accountability and transparency in humanitarian assistance under increasingly complex operational environments and the need for further efforts to identify and support the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , Taking note of the establishment , within the Department of Humanitarian Affairs , of Reliefweb , for the dissemination of reliable and timely information on natural disasters and other emergencies ,

The participants of the Second United Nations Regional Conference on Space Technology for Sustainable Development in Africa noted that , as it has been proven in other parts of the world , space technology has tremendous potential for contributing to the economic and social development of countries in Africa , particularly through the improved management of the environment , improved communications , enhanced food security , delivery of services in health care and education , and the mitigation of natural disasters , just to name a few .  
The environmental policy sought to reconcile economic development with natural resource conservation and to make the high quality of the environment a key element in supporting the country 's economic and social development .  
In conclusion , the FAO report entitled " World Agriculture : Towards 2010 " addressed many issues related to Agenda 21 , in particular the technical and environmental challenges to sustainable agricultural development and the potential for future agricultural growth ; studies of technology reviews ; the natural resource base ; prevailing agricultural policies ; trade liberalization ; the trade-offs between the environment and agricultural development ; and implications for the future .  
According to article 31 , such law includes Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) , in which the Security Council determined , acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter , that Iraq is liable under international law for any direct loss , damage , including environmental damage and the depletion of natural resources , or injury to foreign Governments , nationals and corporations , as a result of Iraqs unlawful invasion and occupation of Kuwait . 
The Global Conference on Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States , held at Bridgetown , Barbados , in 1994 , noted that small island developing States are prone to extremely damaging natural disasters , primarily in the form of severe weather , volcanic eruptions and earth-quakes ( A / CONF . 167 / 9 ) .  
Humanitarian emergency situations have become more frequent , more widespread , more complex and long lasting , combining interstate and internal conflicts , large-scale displacements of people , mass famine , disruption of economic , political and social institutions , and , in some cases natural disasters .  
The adoption of this theme highlighted the emphasis given by the international community to voluntary repatriation as a durable solution and asserted that a natural extension of that emphasis is the increased importance attached to the prevention of forced displacement .  
In response to that suggestion it was observed that in legal systems that recognized insolvency proceedings of natural persons , such as individual traders or merchants , it would sometimes be difficult to establish a clear distinction between the debtors business and personal affairs , and that proceedings apparently falling in the latter category might well have influence on the debtors assets and liabilities .  
Barbados shares the anxiety of small developing States , which are highly vulnerable to marginalization in this fiercely competitive environment given our sparse natural and human-resource base and limited administrative and technical capacity .  
It is our earnest desire to take maximum advantage of the rich potential of our natural resources and to use them in a sustainable and balanced manner with a view to creating wealth and a better future for our people .  
It has paid special attention to external humanitarian assistance issues and has provided unparalleled assistance to many developing countries , particularly those which have suffered natural disasters and civil and regional wars .  
Taking full advantage of historical affinities , cultural ties and religious bonds and sparing no effort to utilize in an efficient and coordinated manner the human and natural potential and resources of the region constitute the single best long-term guarantee of security and tranquillity .  
The concept of sustainable development as a mean between the imperatives of development and the protection and conservation of the physical environment , including our natural resources , calls for the promotion of an international economic environment that is conducive to and supportive of the development efforts of all countries , particularly those of the developing world , many of which are still grappling with the provision of basic social services for their populations .  
Where Stockholm adopted an issue-oriented approach to pollution and non-renewable resource depletion , Rio emphasized integrated strategies to promote human development through economic growth based on sustainable management of the natural resource base .  
In 25 years , the population debate has evolved dramatically from a narrow focus on population size and growth rates to a more integrated agenda embracing demographic structures , distribution patterns and urbanization , levels of exploitation of natural resources , and creation of viable agricultural and industrial infrastructures .  
Small island developing States possess unique characteristics , including fragile ecosystems , small land area and limited natural resources , which make them significantly more vulnerable to environmental degradation and human health problems resulting from inadequate management of wastes .  
For instance , there is need to identify ecologically endangered areas where overexploitation of natural resources and rapid population growth create serious problems : forested uplands , coastal fishing areas , small-holder agriculture in lowland areas , arid grazing lands and tropical forests .  
Environmentally induced migrations are caused by natural disasters , such as earthquakes , flash flooding , typhoons , and volcanic eruptions ; by nuclear and hazardous waste contamination ; by agricultural and rural decline , resource pollution , chronic water shortages ; or by dam construction and other large-scale development projects .  
Very often , large-scale and sudden movements into areas of already declining environmental and socio-economic conditions lead to a reduction in migrants ' well-being ; damage to the natural resource base on which the local economy depends ; economic and political difficulties for the host areas ; and erosion of efforts made by Governments and the international community to support sustainable development in both areas of origin and host areas .

In the case of small island developing States , as for developing countries as a whole , the percentage of bilateral and multilateral commitments of ODA has risen for environmental protection and natural resource management and for basic social services ( see tables 7 and 8 ) .  
UNCTAD also maintains close relations with , and participates as required in meetings of , a wide range of international commodity bodies , including the organizations for cocoa , jute , natural rubber , olive oil , sugar , tropical timber ; the International Cotton Advisory Committee ; and the study groups for copper , lead and zinc , and nickel .  
In the context of the discussion of paragraph ( 3 ) , a question was raised as to whether the reference to keys of natural and legal persons provided sufficient guidance in situations where cryptographic keys were issued directly to electronic devices , or used by such devices , in the absence of direct human intervention .  
It was decided that the general definition of certification authority should be based on the text of paragraph ( 3 ) of draft article B . It was agreed that the reference to natural and legal persons should be complemented by a reference to electronic devices , which should be placed between square brackets , pending future consideration by the Working Group .  
The Trust Fund so established is open to voluntary financial contributions from States , inter-governmental organizations , regional economic integration organizations , national institutions and non-governmental organizations as well as natural and juridical persons .  
Other important factors in many regions include illegal logging ; illegal land occupation and illegal cultivation ; grazing pressures ; unsustainable agriculture ; the demand for fuelwood and charcoal to meet basic energy needs ; refugee-related problems ; mining and oil exploitation in forested countries not conducted in accordance with appropriate national legislation ; and natural climatic events and forest fires .  
While recognizing that forest land rehabilitation would be required in many areas and that that would need international assistance , including financial resources and technology transfer to support local and national efforts , the Panel emphasized the need for prevention , rather than mitigation and restoration , wherever practicable , with emphasis on improved and sustainable management of existing natural forest and other vegetation .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,

All relevant actors should be encouraged to work in partnership with adolescent girls and boys , utilizing both formal and non-formal educational training activities , inter alia , through sustainable consumption patterns and responsible use of natural resources .  
The view was expressed that in view of the special characteristics of the geostationary orbit , there was a need to establish a sui generis legal regime for regulating access to and use of that orbit , which was a limited natural resource , and that such a regime should guarantee actual and future equitable access to the geostationary orbit for all States , taking into particular account the needs of developing countries , including the equatorial countries , because of their special geographical characteristics .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , economic and sexual exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance and disability , and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,

The main objectives of the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources Development will be to promote regional and subregional cooperation for sustainable development and to strengthen national capacities in the field of the environment , including integration of environmental concerns into development strategies , in line with the provisions of Agenda 21 and other subsequent decisions ; development and management of natural resources , including water , mineral and energy resources ( excluding infrastructural aspects of electric power ) ; diffusion and management of environmentally sound technologies ; space technology applications ; and natural disaster reduction .  
Recognizing the respect for the environment accorded by the cultures of indigenous peoples of the Americas , and considering the special relationship between the indigenous peoples and the environment , lands , resources and territories on which they live and their natural resources .  Recognizing that in many indigenous cultures , traditional collective systems for control and use of land and territory and resources , including bodies of water and coastal areas , are a necessary condition for their survival , social organization , development and their individual and collective well-being . . .  
The role of the geospatial framework was recognized as critical for economic and sustainable development and the integration of the " 3S technologies " ( remote sensing , GPS and GIS ) was seen as essential for efficient management of natural resources .  
An appeal by the special session to the Governments of the Russian Federation and the United States of America to consider the rational employment of their missile and nuclear potential as a contribution of these two countries to common efforts to ensure sustainable development and preservation of the natural environment of this earth ; to start - should the response of the two Governments be positive - developing relevant international programmes and projects ensuring respect for the regime of non-proliferation of nuclear and missile technologies and for intellectual property rights ;

Recognizing that United Nations organs and Member States have increasingly acknowledged that lands and natural resources are essential to the Economic and cultural survival of indigenous peoples , and that some States have enacted legal measures that uphold indigenous land rights or have established procedures for arriving at legally binding agreements on indigenous land _ related issues ,  
During the FAO regional conference for Latin America and the Caribbean , held in Paraguay in July 1996 , it had been determined that , based on available natural , human and technological resources , the region could set two complementary goals for the year 2010 : to reduce malnutrition from 15 per cent in the period 1991-1992 to 6 per cent , and to ensure that the nutrition supply should be no less than 2,700 calories per person per day in any country .  
Legacies to future generations are a collective responsibility of todays citizens be this the legacy of natural capital ( the environment ) , physical capital ( infrastructure , plant and equipment ) , financial capital ( savings ) , social capital ( institutions and structures ) and cultural capital ( the values , principles and concepts that are handed down ) . 
Countries need to systematically increase the use of renewable energy sources according to their specific social , economic , natural , geographical and climatic conditions and cleaner fuel technologies , including fossil fuel technologies , and to improve efficiency in energy production , distribution and use and in other industrial production processes that are intensive users of energy ;  
These initiatives focused on increased use of alternative transportation fuels ( e.g . , natural gas ) , support for urban public transport , and improved transportation planning and regulation .  
That Constitution included clear provisions concerning collective land ownership , the management of natural resources , recognition of indigenous forms of government and administration , protection of the identity and cultural heritage of the indigenous peoples , the official status of the languages and dialects they used and the creation of special electoral districts ensuring their representation in Congress .  
Humanitarian emergency situations have become more frequent , more widespread , more complex and longer lasting , combining inter-State and internal conflicts , large-scale displacements of people , mass famine , disruption of economic , political and social institutions and , in some cases , natural disasters .

The efficient work of the IDNDR national committees of France , Germany and the United Kingdom must be commended , especially in relation to the planning and organization of relevant central events of the final phase of the Decade , such as the conference on early warning systems with regard to natural and similar disasters scheduled to take place at Potsdam , Germany , in 1998 ;  
The IDNDR secretariat successfully completed its current work programme for early warning , with regard to natural disasters , in response to Assembly resolution 50 / 117 B . Six international expert groups were convened to examine scientific knowledge and public practices that could contribute to more accurate and timely short-term forecasting and warning applications for natural and similar disasters . 
In its resolution 51 / 185 , the Assembly recognized the paramount importance of a well-structured and coherent process towards the conclusion of the Decade , and requested proposals concerning the shape and form of natural disaster reduction activities in the twenty-first century and regarding the format , substance and timing of a closing event for the Decade with a view to enabling a forceful launching of the preparatory process as early as possible in 1998 .  
It focuses on the implementation of crucial activities that exemplify the Decade 's objective to reduce through concerted international action , especially in developing countries , the loss of life , property damage , and social and economic disruption caused by natural and similar disasters that have an adverse impact upon the environment .  
According to these targets , by the year 2000 all countries should have in place , as part of their national plans to achieve sustainable development , ( a ) comprehensive national assessments of risks from natural hazards integrated into development plans , ( b ) mitigation plans of practical measures for application at national and local levels to address long-term disaster prevention , preparedness and community awareness , and ( c ) ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems .  
A second pre-requisite for effective warning is both the understanding by a vulnerable population of the hazards to which it may be exposed and an appreciation of the natural forces that can destroy elements of their economic livelihood and social well-being .  
These existing arrangements demonstrate the feasibility of international and regional agreements to practical institutional arrangements , which could have wider application for the sustained monitoring of continuing natural hazard risks .  
An important outcome of the World Conference on Natural Disaster Reduction was the recognition of the close linkages between disaster losses and environmental degradation , as emphasized in Agenda 21.2 More specifically , the Conference reaffirmed Principle 18 of the Rio Declaration , 3 which stressed the need for the international community to assist States afflicted by natural disasters and other emergencies that are likely to produce sudden harmful effects to the environment . 
Technologies associated with space-based and terrestrial remote sensing , geographic information systems , satellite observation and communications , mathematical modelling of event scenarios , and the entire field of global communications have revolutionized the ability to monitor , analyze and disseminate accurate and timely information about natural hazards .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , poverty , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , racism and all forms of intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger , disability , and drug abuse , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Success in the thematic area of environment and development will be measured by : ( a ) the relevance of the new knowledge and methods produced for policy decision ; ( b ) the actual participation of pertinent decision makers in considering the proposed alternatives ; and ( c ) the extent of involvement of interested parties in consensus-building for policy decisions and of partnerships forged , joint initiatives funded and programmes launched relating to the management of common natural resources .  
All RCF programmes for Asia and the Pacific are based on one or more of the following regional criteria : sharing and / or pooling resources ( including intellectual and natural resources ) ; addressing trans-boundary issues ; addressing a common need or common problem ; and developing or promoting agreed upon regional regimes , norms or policies .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , poverty , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , racism and all forms of intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger , disability , and drug abuse , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
It was suggested that such opportunities may be found in the sectors where developing countries have ( i ) natural and geographical advantages ; ( ii ) an education and training basis to provide skilled workers ; ( iii ) the competitive advantage provided by lower wages ; and ( iv ) the possibility to cut the cost of services further , utilizing the communication and transport technology .  
For example , the parties involved in the projects conducted geological studies and a national inventory of natural resources in Madagascar , established a forest inventory in Tunisia , created an agricultural land information system in Egypt and an action plan for flood control in Bangladesh , controlled resettlement of refugees in Cambodia , and prepared a demographic census in Nigeria , a dam site impact study in Cameroon , erosion studies in Chile and a cartographic survey of mine dumps in South Africa .  
Recognizes that the White Helmets , as an operational partner of the United Nations Volunteers , are an efficient and viable mechanism for making pre-identified and trained homogenous teams available to the United Nations system , in support of immediate relief , rehabilitation , reconstruction and development activities , in the light of the increasing number and growing magnitude and complexity of natural disasters and other emergencies ;  
First , it should be noted that some replies do not correspond to the request for information made by the Secretary _ General , but they have nevertheless been included because they provided material for discussion on the realization of economic , social and cultural rights with regard to social measures at the national level , the right to self-determination and the right of countries to sovereignty over their natural resources .  
Its major commercial applications included coastal zone and environmental monitoring , marine navigation , offshore oil and gas operation , natural disaster mitigation and coastal and deep ocean fishing .  
In addition , information is provided on the serious problems facing the Cuban economy resulting from the severance of economic relations with the former Soviet Union and the countries of Eastern Europe , which were Cuba 's main trading partners ; the effects of the almost 40-year economic , commercial and financial blockade of Cuba ; problems affecting its principal exports , especially cane sugar ; and natural disasters , including hurricanes and tropical storms and infestation by a new agricultural pest .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Noting also that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base , and recent natural disasters ,  
We , the United Nations Member States and observer States , have agreed to adopt the Agenda for Development , thus holding forth a global promissory note and universal hope for the millions of our people throughout the entire world who daily go without sufficient food and water , who battle diseases and natural disasters , who can not read or write , who lack shelter , who are jobless , whose entire lives are stunted and who are deprived of the simple pleasures of human existence because of poverty . 
Those included : exposures from natural sources of radiation ; exposures from man-made sources of radiation ; medical radiation exposures ; occupational radiation exposures ; dose assessment methodologies ; epidemiological evaluation of radiation-induced cancer ; deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) repair and mutagenesis ; hereditary effects of radiation ; combined effects of radiation and other agents ; models , mechanisms and uncertainties at low doses ; and local exposures and effects of the Chernobyl accident .  
Aware that global increases in population , rising levels of urbanization and unsustainable patterns of consumption and production , particularly in developed countries , are stressing the finite natural resource base , stressing fragile ecosystems and causing environmental degradation and adverse health effects ,  
Many countries , including Peru , are currently facing a cyclical , worldwide natural phenomenon known as El Ni �� , whose severe economic , environmental and social consequences are drastically changing the marine environment , which is a source of food and employment for broad sectors of humankind .  
Malta fully supports the efforts of the Organization in the promotion of environmental protection and the sustainable use of the world \ x { e5b8 } natural resources to ensure a more equitable distribution of wealth , and of an international trade regime free of restrictive or discriminatory practices .  
Albania has a peculiar history of chronic isolation , of almost total estrangement from the rest of the world , of great potential , human and natural wealth , while being , at the same time , underdeveloped and poor .  Our difficulties of growth are directly linked to the legacies of former rules and half a century of communism , of non-existent , non-functioning or malfunctioning democratic institutions , both during and after the collapse of communism and its structures , as well as with our mentality .  
We are therefore pursuing economic , social and infrastructural development in a sustainable way which avoids environmental degradation , conserves our natural resource endowment and helps to build and maintain a long-term national capacity to support rising standards of living for the population , as well as opportunities for self-actualization .  
The Democratic Republic of the Congo is among the few countries that from time immemorial , owing to its geostrategic placement and its vast human and natural resources , has borne the burden of a sombre history of suffering and outrageous violations of human rights and the rights of peoples .  
This integration is of great benefit to national and foreign investors thanks to the country 's economic and other potential such as its geographical location , in relation to major regional markets , its transit role , its role as a supplier of hydroelectric power to neighbouring countries and export producer , using the country 's raw materials , and its innumerable natural tourist attractions .  
For its part the Government of Benin , while awaiting the fulfilment of that hope , has developed the concept of a shared social minimum level in order methodically and effectively to take actions and measures aimed at eliminating poverty , hunger , disease and illiteracy , providing adequate housing , guaranteeing productive employment , improving standards and conditions of living and ensuring the sustainable use of natural resources .  
Today we are witnessing the emergence of new forms of transnational crime : money-laundering or the investment of capital generated by activities that are usually interconnected , including drug-trafficking , corruption , traffic in weapons , terrorism , traffic in nuclear and toxic material , traffic in protected natural resources , traffic in human beings , removal of organs , and more .  
However , if one were to consider these few achievements against the background of an extremely fragile economy deprived of natural resources , and a high dependency on tourism and fisheries both of which are susceptible to global economic change and environmental and other external factors the whole scenario could easily change from a happy and promising one to an obscure and insecure one .  
Among the key objectives of this policy are the sustainable development of the region , based on overcoming poverty , and the participation of organized civil society and the population in general , as well as environmental preservation and the rational and sustainable use of natural resources .  
An essential element in propagating a culture of peace is to refrain from implementing policies that would widen the gulf between the rich developed countries and poor third world countries , unable to ensure growth , to make the best use of their natural and human resources , with the resultant unemployment , financial deficit and indebtedness worsening year after year .  
However , the management of natural resources and human settlements , the provision of basic social services , the support required for targeted programmes for poverty alleviation , the correction of acute gender disabilities , social protection , employment generation and skill development , the improvements sought in public administration and governance all priorities defined by the global community are typically activities that require public resources spent through public entities .  
It is precisely because of our recognition of the specific and peculiar problems faced by the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories most of which are small island Territories that suffer from impediments created by the interplay of such factors as economic and geographic size , isolation , vulnerability to natural disasters and lack of technological and financial resources , including problems of accessibility to international credit markets that the international community should give specific priority and attention to the process of decolonization affecting the peoples of those Territories . 
It is also natural for Algeria to plead for a global and integrated approach to the security and development of the Mediterranean , convinced as it is that there can be no genuine security for all as long as serious and intolerable imbalances persist between the northern and southern shores of the Mediterranean .  
Reduction of poverty requires not just providing goods and services to people living in poverty but also improving opportunities for access to productive resources and capital accumulation , including human capital ( education , health ) , financial capital ( microcredit ) , physical capital ( appropriate technology ) and natural resources ( land , water , energy ) .  
The Government of Iraq noted its cooperation with States and international organizations and its solidarity with the endeavours of the United Nations and the humanitarian organizations , particularly in the field of human rights , with a view to establishing an early _ warning system to avoid the problem of mass exodus or to address it when it was brought about by causes such as natural disasters or regional or international armed conflicts forcing the population of a State to enter neighbouring States .  
Historical data on consumption of fuelwood are scarce but it is estimated that today some 1.8-billion-m3 , more than half of the total volume of wood produced , is consumed as fuel . 7 Fuelwood consumption is leading in some areas to deforestation , soil impoverishment and further hardship for the poor , who are dependent on the natural resource base for their day-to-day survival . 
The persistence of current trends in a number of critical issues , according to the Conventional Development Scenario and other leading " business-as-usual " projections , will lead to continuing poverty and declining quality of life in some developing regions , especially in urban areas , increasing competition over use rights to natural resources and worsening environmental degradation .  
As noted above , while there has been a rapid development of land-related information systems in those economies having access to adequate financial and technological resources , information systems in many developing countries have been severely limited by the non-availability of basic natural resource data and information , by undeveloped market infrastructure , and by a lack of institutional capability .  
The following important common policy approaches are emerging in the promotion of SARD : ( a ) the use of economic incentives to guide sustainable agricultural practices ; ( b ) education and information exchange for human development ; ( c ) the development and transfer of new and appropriate technologies ; ( d ) farm and off-farm employment for alleviating poverty ; ( e ) sound natural resource management leading to environmental protection ; and ( f ) focusing on men and women farmers themselves .  
Noting also that the unfavourable situation of the Comoros , which is on the list of least developed countries , is aggravated by several important factors , including its physical distance from its trading partners , the scarcity of natural resources , the diminutive size of the domestic market , the fall in prices of its export products and the poverty of its soil ,  
At the theoretical level , the Conference scientifically established the organic interrelationship between the natural state of mountains and climatic conditions arising in mountainous areas , on the one hand , and the disruption of the ecological balance and level of social and economic development of peoples living in mountainous areas , on the other .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
Recognizing the need for coordinated humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for immediate relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , which are not necessarily sequential and often proceed at the same time ,  
Encourages Governments to ensure coherence in the direction given to the governing bodies of relevant organizations , funds and programmes of the United Nations system , and to thereby promote the development and strengthening of the cooperation between these organizations and the Department of Humanitarian Affairs , drawing on the mandate , expertise and respective strengths and available capabilities of each , to improve the system-wide capability for a quick and coordinated response to complex humanitarian emergencies and natural disasters ;  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , poverty , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , racism and all forms of intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger , disability and drug abuse , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
By its own definition , Executive Outcomes is a company devoted to providing highly skilled and confidential military advisor services and to furnishing personnel , mainly military and highly skilled , to provide strategic and tactical training services in countries requiring sophisticated , effective support for the adequate control of their socio-political reality , to put an end to internal conflicts and to encourage the development of economic activities related to natural and mineral resource development .  
Most representatives agreed with the Commission 's proposed approach to separate consideration of the question of the nationality of natural persons from that of the nationality of legal persons and to give priority to the former , which , it was argued , involved human rights , while the latter raised problems of an economic order .  
All relevant actors should be encouraged to work in partnership with adolescent girls and boys , utilizing both formal and non-formal educational training activities , inter alia , through sustainable consumption patterns and responsible use of natural resources .  
The overall objective of the programme emergency humanitarian assistance , derived from these General Assembly resolutions , is " to ensure better preparation for , as well as a rapid and coherent response to , emergencies , natural and man-made , thus reducing the suffering and loss of human lives and material destruction ; promoting prevention and preparedness ; and ensuring smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation and development " . b  
In resolution 42 / 169 of 11 December 1987 , the General Assembly , " convinced that concerted international action for the reduction of natural disasters over the course of the 1990s would give genuine impetus to a series of concrete measures " decided to designate the 1990s as the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction .  
The Framework contained a set of practical targets to be achieved by the year 2000 : comprehensive national assessments of risks from natural hazards , with these assessments taken into account in planning for sustainable development ; mitigation plans at national and / or local levels , involving long-term prevention , preparedness and community awareness ; and ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems and broad dissemination of warnings .  
Unfortunately , there is no reliable comprehensive data on the economic aspects of natural disasters ; as a result policy makers can not base their decisions on documented facts , and cost-benefit analyses of specific natural disaster prevention or reduction measures are often questionable .  
Recommends that long-term public awareness and information programmes related to natural disasters , including those induced by El Ni �� and similar disasters with an adverse impact on the environment , be integrated into comprehensive national disaster management programmes that focus on preventive strategies for risk reduction and that those programmes be included as integral elements of United Nations support for social and economic development programmes ;  
That position seemed tenable and acceptable inasmuch as it satisfied the main objectives pursued , namely , to reduce to the maximum possible extent the cases of statelessness as a result of State succession and to find a balance between the legitimate interests of successor States in regulating a broad range of issues connected with the attribution of their nationality and the right of natural persons to opt for the nationality of one of the successor States .  
It was therefore deeply concerned about the situation in the occupied territories where the Palestinians continued to be deprived of their basic human rights such as access to education , natural resources and land ownership , further hindering a just and comprehensive settlement and seriously undermining the spirit of trust and cooperation vital to the success of the peace process .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Noting further that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , economic and sexual exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance and disability , and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Considerable efforts have been made everywhere in Africa to revitalize the social sector , minimize needless waste of human and natural resources , promote popular participation and democratic governance , focus world attention on the continent 's needs for a more supportive international economic environment , and reinforce efforts at conflict prevention and resolution .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , economic and sexual exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance and disability , and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
There are , however , signs that the successful implementation of this operation is threatened , primarily because the separatist leadership opposes their return , as is the phased restoration of the natural regional demographics which would be an inevitable consequence of an expanded peacekeeping mandate .  
The adoption of this theme highlighted the emphasis given by the international community to voluntary repatriation as a durable solution and asserted that a natural extension of this emphasis is the increased importance attached to the prevention of forced displacement .  
UNDP assistance under the fifth cycle country programme ( 1992-1996 ) to the Caribbean dependent Territories which includes the Turks and Caicos Islands , had as its principal focus the provision of support for human resource development , capacity-building , institutional strengthening and environment and natural resources management .  With this in view , the proposed strategy of UNDP at the start of the current sixth cycle has been to continue its emphasis on providing support in those areas , building upon the outputs of its previous interventions .  
In addition to general problems facing developing countries , those island Territories also suffer handicaps arising from the interplay of such factors as geographic isolation , vulnerability to natural disasters , the fragility of their ecosystems , constraints in transport and communications , isolation from market centres , limited internal market , lack of natural resources and serious gaps in technological capacities ( in human and material terms ) . 
The High Contracting Parties shall cooperate in the protection and improvement of the environment , the prevention of transboundary pollution , the rational and resource-conserving utilization of the natural environment , the elimination of the consequences of natural and technogenic emergencies and shall promote coordinated action in this area at the regional and global levels with a view to creating a comprehensive system of international environmental safety .  
Humanitarian emergency situations have become more frequent , more widespread , more complex and long lasting , combining interstate and internal conflicts , large-scale displacements of people , mass famine , disruption of economic , political and social institutions , and , in some cases natural disasters .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base , and recent natural disasters ,  
Through participatory action-oriented research methodologies , data have been collected on the most common practices of a number of indigenous peoples in the Philippines in a broad range of domains , including fishing , farming , traditional handicraft production , and land and natural resource management .  
In addition , recognizing the imperative of a conducive policy environment for participation of resource users in conservation and sustainable management of natural resources , the Fund has launched a comprehensive programme of studies to examine pertinent policy and institutional issues at the national and local levels .  
Countries need to systematically increase the use of renewable energy sources according to their specific social , economic , natural , geographical and climatic conditions and cleaner fuel technologies , including fossil fuel technologies , and to improve efficiency in energy production , distribution and use and in other industrial production processes that are intensive users of energy ;  
The sustainable management of natural resources , the combatting of pollution and environmental degradation , the development of human resources through the implementation of a population policy , education and health , regional integration , the creation of productive jobs in rural areas and through the development of the private sector in order to eradicate poverty all these represent the strategic framework which will make it possible to ensure human sustainable development in our country .  
The Commission on Human Settlements , in its resolution 16 / 24 of 7 May 1997 entitled " Special session of the General Assembly for the purpose of an overall review and appraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21 " , reaffirmed that sustainable development was essential for human settlements development and expressed the conviction that urban settlements , properly planned and managed , held a promise for human development and for the protection of the world 's natural resources through their ability to support large numbers of people while limiting their negative impact on the natural environment .  
In addition , such human settlements provide equal opportunity for a productive and freely chosen livelihood ; equal access to economic resources , including the right to inheritance , the ownership of land and other property , credit , natural resources and appropriate technologies ; equal opportunity for personal , spiritual , religious , cultural and social development ; equal opportunity for participation in public decision-making ; equal rights and obligations with regard to the conservation and use of natural and cultural resources ; and equal access to mechanisms to ensure that rights are not violated .  
That occupation represented one of the ugliest forms of occupation in contemporary history , involving expansionist policies and practices , especially in East Jerusalem ; illegal Israeli colonial settlements ; usurpation and exploitation of Palestinian natural resources ; and the building of infrastructure separate from that available to the Palestinian people , all of which represented a unique mixture of colonialism and apartheid-like arrangements .  
There had been thinly veiled attempts at altering the demographic composition and physical characteristics of the occupied Palestinian territory , incessant human rights violations , plundering of the territory 's natural resources and exploitation of its labour force .  
Recognizing that United Nations organs and Member States have increasingly acknowledged that lands and natural resources are essential to the Economic and cultural survival of indigenous peoples , and that some States have enacted legal measures that uphold indigenous land rights or have established procedures for arriving at legally binding agreements on indigenous land _ related issues ,  
The latter provides an incentive to market-based forms of technology and skills transfer both for industrial / infrastructural projects and resource management / preservation ( e.g . enhancing the carbon sequestration service rendered by tropical forests , natural rubber plantations and other commercial tree crops ) in developing countries .  JI projects , in particular in technical infrastructure , may also improve the living conditions of the poor or other disadvantaged groups in developing countries .  
Clear examples and opportunities exist for providing benefits to source countries as well as indigenous and local communities in terms of health improvement , resource management capacity , and sustainable use of natural resources .  The key to its success will be in the ability to provide near - and long-term benefits that effect changes in the behaviour of individuals , communities and private companies , as well as in natural resource policies of both developed and developing country governments .  
In addition to natural capital , physical or produced capital , and to the now widely accepted notion of human capital , social capital refers to the functioning of the various institutions that are critical to individual welfare and social integration .  
Mineral resource development may provide a boost to developing economies otherwise poor in natural and human resources and allow rapid economic growth , provided that the problems of macro-economic stability associated with mineral dependence , in particular the influence of mineral revenues on the real exchange rate and the effect of mining wage rates on overall wage levels , can be mastered .  
For example , the indicators of sustainable development , the impact of economic globalization on the global natural environment , the relationship between sustainable development and sustained economic growth and the monitoring of natural processes at the global level could be addressed under a separate item .  
The Forum recognized the region 's vulnerability to natural disasters , environmental damage and unlawful challenges to national integrity and independence and reaffirmed its commitment to take a comprehensive , integrated and collaborative approach to maintaining and strengthening current mechanisms for cooperation among members in dealing with threats to the security , broadly defined , of States in the region and of the region as a whole .  
Vicious circles of unsound policies , predatory politics , natural disasters , violent conflict and the neglect of the developed countries have isolated large parts of the continent from the mainstream of global development .  
This remains crucial for the economic development of small economies whose vulnerabilities are intensified by our limited access to markets , narrow resource base , small size , inadequate levels of human resource development and proneness to natural disasters .  
We equally recognize that sustainable development in coastal areas is dependent upon an adequate understanding of the interaction between natural assets and social and human capital .  
Although industry is a major user of natural resources and a direct or indirect source of pollution and other environmental impacts , business and industry must remain a key partner in the common endeavour to achieve sustainable development .  
The effects of natural disasters and bad weather on agricultural production notwithstanding , hunger and the lack of sustainable agricultural development were not solely the result of chance but rather of human choices and poor decisions .  
With the encroachment of agriculture on natural or quasi-natural ecosystems , plant and animal genetic resources are being lost , modern cultivars are replacing local ones and intensive livestock production systems are developing .  
Conflict , whether at the international , State , or community level , can be considered a natural , inevitable consequence of differing interests , goals or values which may be exacerbated by ethnic , racial , cultural and linguistic differences .  
In natural monopolies , regulation focuses primarily on the production of the socially desirable level of services at economic prices , in particular by limiting the opportunities for the public service provider to collect monopoly rents .  
Due to their size , most of these Territories are not endowed with natural resources and are subject to regular natural disasters , global warming , desalination of water sources , dependency on few commodities and a high level of emigration .  
This inalienable right invests colonized and dependent countries with the power freely to determine their political status , freely to pursue their economic , social and cultural development and freely to dispose of their natural wealth and resources .  
Ongoing civil and international conflicts , financial crises and natural disasters around the world ( including volcanic eruptions , hurricanes , tidal waves and floods ) have had severe impacts on the efficacy and efficiency in the delivery of social services .  
While habitual residence constituted a very close link between a natural person and a State , there were also ethnic , linguistic , religious , cultural , social and political factors which were often very important in the case of succession of States .  
The urbanization trends experienced by developed countries until the 1950s suggested that the increasing concentration of the urban population in ever larger urban centres was a natural concomitant of the rising proportion of people living in urban areas .  
Full bathymetric models in three dimensions may be required in order to gain a spatial understanding of natural prolongation and may be essential in selecting the full extent of the 2,500 m isobath relevant to the determination of the 100 M outer limit .  
Endowed with abundant natural resources , it is a promising continent with limitless potential in international economic development .  
The majority of the reports indicate social / cultural benefits , including active involvement of local communities , increased public awareness , and maintenance of natural heritage and historical sites , as well as cleaner air .  
Globalization phenomena should not be considered only for their impact on physical and financial capital flows , but also on human and natural capital , as well as on national sovereignty and cultural diversity , including at the local and community level .  
Added to these natural disasters are man-made catastrophes like widespread minefields , the dumping of radioactive and toxic wastes , the growing number of regional and internal civil wars and the ensuing problems of refugees and famine .  
The smallness of small island developing States means that natural disasters combine with other environmental , social , and economic processes , such as climate change , ozone depletion , sea level rise , freshwater shortages , deforestation , economic marginalization consequent to trade liberalization and globalization , and growing poverty , to compound the intensity of risks .  
The effects of the El Nio Southern Oscillation , the disastrous impacts of hurricanes George and Mitch , the rising costs of natural disasters to small island developing States and the growing impact on their fragile economies are sufficient reason to launch national , regional and global consultations on the necessity for strengthening disaster prevention and preparedness measures and policies to attenuate the impacts of natural disasters on an urgent basis .  
No one can deny that the negative trends of these last decades of the twentieth century are slow to reverse .  These include growing poverty , the marginalization of hundreds of millions of people , the precarious state of natural resources , the degradation of biological diversity , the destruction of forests , worsening pollution , rampant desertification , and so many other examples .  
We believe that economic policies must be better coordinated with environmental policies and that the sustainability of our natural resources is essential , today and in the future , if we are to eliminate poverty and achieve equitable , just and participatory development throughout the world .  
It was argued , moreover , that the text failed to embody important principles such as the sovereign right of States to exploit their own natural resources according to their own policies , the concept of common but differentiated responsibility and the international consensus on the right to development ; it was also considered unfortunate that none of the draft articles had been devoted specifically to the need for an overall balance between environmental and developmental imperatives .  
While it is estimated that only half of the total natural ( and semi-natural ) forest area is currently available for wood production as a consequence of economic and physical inaccessibility , there are no apparent constraints in production and consumption at the global level .  
Second , financial aspects , recognizing that it is very difficult to rely on mobilizing domestic financial resources in very poor and populous countries where natural resources are degraded , and international cooperation will need to play a very key role .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territorys deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
A protected area may be defined as an area of land and / or sea especially dedicated to the protection and maintenance of biological diversity , and of natural and associated cultural values , and managed through legal or other effective means .  
The way in which natural resources are managed at the national level expressed in explicit or implicit policies was also identified as a major underlying cause .  
But implementation of these policies will have little impact on long _ term sustainable development , sound management of natural resources , or on the reduction of poverty and inequality unless accompanied by fundamental transformation of unjust economic and political structures both at national and global levels .  
The legislation gives priority to countries which have demonstrated a sustained commitment to poverty alleviation or have recently suffered a major natural disaster , but it excludes countries with excessive military spending , gross violations of human rights , blatant drug trafficking or ethnic conflicts ;  
The unknown and unpredictable costs associated with such risks as contractual disputes , unfunded liabilities , business interruption or losses due to civil strife , natural disasters , etc . , make it difficult to use a strict formula to determine the protection needed .  
It was , therefore , discouraging to note that , in addition to suffering from long-standing problems , such as declining commodity prices and worsening terms of trade , the developing countries were also having to face new problems as a result of developments in the world economy , current international economic problems and even natural phenomena , the direct and indirect effects of which had exacerbated their problems . 
It made it more difficult for developing countries to make use of their traditional comparative advantages , such as cheap labour and abundant natural resources , since industrial and technological capacity with a solid infrastructural base , adequate human resources and business development were increasingly determinants of economic growth and sustainable development .  
The social , economic and environmental challenges extended far beyond the capacity of individual countries and required a global effort to protect the earths ecosystem and to promote social development and economic growth in a manner which would also preserve natural resources . 
In order to guarantee international security and stability , the United Nations must also , in the context of the current reform process , reassess and redefine its responses to current problems , particularly extreme inequalities with respect to international trade and capital flows , the continual deterioration of the terms of trade , external debt , population growth , the problem of migration , the depletion of natural resources and environmental constraints .  
The Anti _ Racism Information Service suggested that the following issues could provide input into recommendations : racial discrimination in the workplace ; migration and related questions ; neo _ Nazism ; Holocaust denial ; the caste system ; inclusion of anti _ racist thought in education ; negative consequences of international trade and globalization ; the despoliation of nature and the overexploitation of natural resources ; ethnocide , ethnic cleansing and violence against women in ethnic conflict .  
While it was true that financial mediation systems were needed , and that economic activity implied a certain degree of commercial activity , it should nevertheless be remembered that microcredit functioned at the level of the individual household , existed in a natural form and was not intended to transform poor women into economic agents like their counterparts in developed countries .  
At the national level , the causes of poverty in many developing countries included inadequate national economic policies , the insufficiency or lack of a natural resource base and external economic shocks such as external debt , unfavourable terms of trade and reduced official development assistance .  
Aid programmes are intended to consolidate the new constitutional system , as well as social programmes , the development of technical assistance projects , the supply of equipment , human resources development , strengthening of the productive sectors , improvement of the environment , conservation of natural resources and the modernization of public administration .  
Therefore , international efforts to bridge the gap between developing and developed countries should be intensified through the implementation of an information strategy on aspects of globalization relating to social justice and the understanding among peoples that strengthened assistance to developing countries , vulnerable population groups and the victims of armed conflicts , human rights violations and natural disasters . 
They highlighted the disadvantages that derive from their location and physical characteristics dispersion of islands over large areas in the case of archipelagic small island developing States ; recurrent damages inflicted on small island developing States located in the cyclonic belt by natural disasters , such as hurricanes ; overuse , rapid depletion and degradation of natural resources on account of their paucity relative to the demand for them .  
The article states that United States and British forces fired more than 1-million depleted uranium rounds , weighing 315 tons , and that this was the first time that the toxic metal , a waste product left when natural uranium is refined to make weapons or fuel , was used in war .  
Furthermore , labour-intensive public works can be effective for creating employment and productive infrastructure not only in situations linked to war , natural disasters or economic emergencies but also in a variety of regular investment programmes which can provide sustainable employment to those working in agriculture or in the informal economy .  
The main economic determinants are : the size of domestic market ; spatial distribution of natural and created resource endowments ; input prices , quality and productivity of labour ; international transport and communications costs .  
Enhanced national capacity for integrating environmental considerations into economic and social policies ; improvement of energy efficiency and conservation potentials ; wider application of renewable energy technologies ; formulation and implementation of integrated development and management policies in the water , mineral and marine resources sectors ; natural disaster preparedness and mitigation ; and application of space technology through human resources development activities ;  
Protocol I additional to the 1949 Geneva Conventions , relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts , article 35 , paragraph 3 : " It is prohibited to employ methods or means of warfare which are intended , or may be expected , to cause widespread , long-term and severe damage to the natural environment " .  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily _ indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
Tourism had the potential to make an important contribution to poverty alleviation and economic advancement , particularly through integrated plans with the inclusion of local stakeholders in planning and development and where a key objective remained the protection of the cultural and natural assets of the tourist locality .  
Protocol I additional to the 1949 Geneva Conventions , relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts , article 35 , paragraph 3 : It is prohibited to employ methods or means of warfare which are intended , or may be expected , to cause widespread , long-term and severe damage to the natural environment .  * E / 1999 / 100 .  
It might consider such issues as ( a ) financial leakages and how to maximize benefits for local communities , ( b ) preparing a joint initiative to improve information availability and capacity-building for participation , thus enabling communities to manage social and environmental change and ( c ) developing a plan to ensure indigenous peoples and other local communities their rights to land , water and other natural resources .  
The Trust Fund so established is open to voluntary financial contributions from States , inter-governmental organizations , regional economic integration organizations , national institutions and non-governmental organizations as well as natural and juridical persons .  
Actions were elaborated to target , inter alia , strengthening coordination between national and local support strategies and institutions ; strengthening institutional capacities for supporting small and medium enterprises in key agro-industrial subsectors ; and improving national capacities in the sustainable management of natural resources , with emphasis on the conservation of biodiversity and exploitation of its business opportunities .  
Recent global conferences have highlighted human-centred economic growth ; basic physical infrastructures ; fundamental social services ; access to work ; land and credit ; empowerment of women ; food security ; natural resources regeneration ; good governance ; and vulnerable groups as the priorities in efforts to achieve the overarching objective to eradicate poverty .  
It was the responsibility of the international community to ensure the maintenance of UNRWA services at acceptable levels , in terms of quantity and quality , as defined by the needs of the refugee community , and to ensure that service levels kept pace with the steady natural growth of the refugee population .  21 .  The Working Group expressed alarm at the continuing negative effects of five years of austerity measures .  
When a State declares an indigenous territory as protected area , any lands , territories and resources under potential or actual claim by indigenous peoples , conservation areas shall not be subject to any natural resource development without the informed consent and participation of the peoples concerned .  
The aggressor 's daily targets are national parks , nature reservations , monuments of cultural and natural heritage , rare and protected plants and animal species , among which are those of international importance .  
While pointing out that peace was a prerequisite for development , a number of delegations stated that , in recent years , armed conflict had exacted and was continuing to exact a heavy toll on human settlements and human settlements development and several called on the Centre to provide reconstruction assistance to countries and regions afflicted by armed conflict and natural and man-made disasters .  
In the field of natural gas , two projects technological and ecological norms , required for the design and operation of the gas distribution networks , and existing standards and regulations on permissible concentrations of harmful components in gaseous fuels and gaseous fuels combustion products have been launched .  
The group is helping to prepare case studies in rural and urban areas on the linkages between ecological factors , disaster preparedness and the level of damages sustained by natural phenomena , as well as to formulate regional projects for presentation to the international community .  
This is one of the most rapidly progressing and developing national sectors and signifies a major extension of satellite communication coverage , providing communities with a greater range of local telephone and radio services , which have been used , for example , for communications to and from regions hit by natural disasters , with a consequent improvement in the utilization of the resources assigned to disaster management .  
It has had the objective of reducing through concerted international action , especially in developing countries , loss of life , property damage and social and economic disruption caused by natural hazards , including earthquakes , tropical cyclones and other storms , tsunamis , floods , landslides , volcanic activity , wildfires , locust and similar infestations , drought and desertification , and other calamities of natural origin .  
The Framework stated several explicit goals that this broad range of collaborators should strive to accomplish during the Decade : build national capabilities to mitigate the effects of natural disasters ; develop guidelines and strategies for applying existing knowledge ; foster research to close gaps in knowledge ; disseminate information ; and develop measures to apply technical assistance and technology transfer , demonstration projects , and education and training .  
In the broad context of international development issues , Agenda 211 emphasized that sustainable economic growth and development can not be achieved without taking measures to reduce losses from natural disasters , further considering the close linkages between disaster losses and environmental degradation .  
Conditions of increasing social and economic vulnerability will almost certainly lead to unprecedented natural and related hazards in the future , so specific recommendations are made to ensure continued advocacy , the development of policies and the coordination of institutionalized abilities into the twenty-first century .  
A major success of the Decade has been a widespread acceptance of the fact that the growing risk of disasters associated with natural hazards , frequently compounded by uncontrolled or adverse human practices , must be mitigated .  
Abilities essential to the reduction of natural and similar disasters are increasingly being drawn from the public sector , professional and institutional organizations , commercial interests and local forms of community leadership . 
On the one hand , changes in the need for disaster reduction will be determined by the changing patterns of natural hazards , their future potential for association with technological disasters or political conflicts , and shifts in the socio-economic and demographic trends .  
Took note of the information provided by the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) on how to sign / ratify the Tampere Convention which provides a legal framework for the use of telecommunications in international humanitarian assistance ; ( i ) Noted that the considerable recent advances in seasonal weather and climate predictions , including of such phenomena as El Nio , enable improved preparedness of vulnerable communities against natural disasters .  
The focus of the programme is on areas related to satellite communications : satellite remote sensing for natural resources and environmental survey ; development of facilities for designing , assembly / fabrication and launching of communication satellites in geostationary orbit and light-weight satellites in near-Earth orbit for various scientific and applications purposes ; and study of natural and physical phenomena in the upper atmosphere and space through rocket launchings and other means .  
During the two phases , it is very important to obtain sufficient information from the potential mining sites ( commonly termed " baseline data " ) to document clearly the natural conditions which exist prior to mining , and to gain insights into the natural processes such as dispersion and settling of particles , and benthic faunal succession , and to gather other data which will make it possible to acquire the necessary predictive capability for accurate environmental impact prediction .  
Intensify efforts to implement legislative and administrative measures as well as to promote public education , with special attention to youth , about the need for sustainable production and consumption patterns ; foster sustainable natural resource use ; and work concertedly to prevent environmental degradation within their countries ;  
In view of the continuing need to protect humanity from the impact of natural disasters and of the fact that various national and international organizations and agencies have collected enormous amounts of data from space platforms and have successfully completed a number of related studies , it would be appropriate to initiate an integrated global effort as regards disaster management using space systems .  
Intensify efforts to implement legislative and administrative measures as well as to promote public education , with special attention to youth , about the need for sustainable production and consumption patterns ; foster sustainable natural resource use ; and work concertedly to prevent environmental degradation within their countries ;  
We understand sustainable development as a comprehensive and complex process with the objective of improving the quality of life for the whole population through productive growth , social development with equity and full participation by citizens under the precepts of conservation of natural resources and preservation of environmental quality .  
The comprehensive plan for economic and social development sets out as objectives and policies the easing of migratory movements , developing the urban periphery , rationalizing the use and management of natural resources , improving environmental quality , the gender perspective and reproductive health .  
In a globalizing world , island nations such as ours , with limited natural resources and human capital , urgently need the support and assistance of the international community in overcoming our inherent vulnerabilities and realizing the hopes and aspirations of our peoples for achieving lasting and meaningful development .  
In spite of temporary difficulties caused by the destruction of health and education facilities and industrial and agricultural infrastructure as a result of the natural disasters of recent successive years , our people are full of courage and are firmly convinced that under the Great Leader and our social system they can repair the damage in the shortest possible time and build a rich and strong country .  
First , political will for the advancement of the Cairo commitments in many developing countries has been weakened by the recent financial crisis and continued economic stagnation , as well as by frequently recurring natural disasters .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
Member States should cooperate , as a matter of urgency , to ensure that future space activities that would cause potentially harmful interference with the scientific research or natural , cultural and ethical values of other nations ( para .  73 ) are subjected to an environmental impact assessment and international consultations before approval ;  
That the historical piecemeal approach to natural disasters needed to be replaced with an integrated approach one that would cut across natural hazards and would include planning , preparedness , prevention , warnings , relief and rehabilitation , and that a broader appreciation of the positive relationship between disaster reduction and economic and social development goals was required .  
The positive impulses for pursuing cross-cutting issues of universal character , such as natural disaster reduction , created on the one hand by a division of labour between non-operational responsibilities for system-wide policy development , advocacy and coordination , and on the other hand , by distinct operational responsibilities for all relevant mandate bearers inside and outside the United Nations , in particular in the field of development .  
The African continent is subject to a wide range of natural hazards , and suffers constantly from natural and other disasters , which have serious adverse effects on societies and national economies as well as on scarce human and material resources .  
Technological and human-induced ecological hazards , such as accidental releases of chemicals in surface water catchments , dumping of toxic and radioactive materials in coastal zones or on the high seas , and hydrological and climatic problems created by excessive withdrawals from large water bodies etc . add to or complicate problems related to natural hazards , particularly in CIS countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia . 
Concentrations of population in major urban centres ( megacities ) , many of which are located in hazard-prone areas in developing countries , are highly vulnerable to natural and technological hazards due to dependence on complex infrastructures and the occupation of marginal land .  
We shall adopt and implement policy measures at the international , regional , subregional , national and local levels aimed at reducing the vulnerability of our societies to both natural and technological hazards through proactive rather than reactive approaches .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
Developing countries need to be encouraged to utilize space in support of their national developmental activities and to address the basic requirements of their people : education , pollution monitoring , health , telecommunications , environmental management , weather and climate applications , utilization of natural resources , food security , urban and rural infrastructure , land-use management and many other local-level resource problems ;  
Today , the most rapidly growing segment of the economy is information : spatial information derived from remote sensing and geographic information systems can help natural resource mangers , in both developed and developing countries , to improve food production and water management , decrease costs or reduce environmental degradation .  
With the advantage of providing synoptic coverage of large areas at regular intervals , coupled with the advances made in computer-aided digital analysis and data fusion , spaceborne multi-spectral measurements made by Earth observation satellites offer an immense potential for generating reliable , timely and cost-effective information on natural resources .  
Satellite data are used operationally to lessen the impact of natural disasters such as tropical cyclones , flash floods , heavy snowstorms , volcanic ash clouds , sea ice , toxic effects on coastal waters and harmful algal blooms .  
Noting with appreciation the concerted international efforts made , in particular through the Inter _ Agency Task Force on El Nio , in close cooperation with member agencies of the Inter _ Agency Committee on the Climate Agenda , to reduce the impact of natural disasters related to the El Nio phenomenon through improved scientific understanding , close monitoring and the dissemination of timely forecasts to communities affected ,  
Expressing concern that the world is increasingly being threatened by large-scale natural disasters which will have long _ term negative social , economic and environmental consequences on vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ,  
Reiterating that the promotion of economic growth and sustainable development can not be achieved without adequate measures to prevent and reduce the impact of natural disasters and that there are close linkages between losses owing to natural disasters and environmental degradation , as emphasized in Agenda 21-3 / and in the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 , 4 / adopted by the General Assembly at its nineteenth special session ,  
Recognizing the necessity for the international community to demonstrate the strong political determination required to use existing scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , bearing in mind the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Reiterating in that regard that natural disasters damage the social and economic infrastructure of all countries , although the long _ term consequences of natural disasters are especially severe for developing countries , including the least developed countries , and landlocked and small island developing States , as well as for countries with economies in transition , thus hampering their sustainable development processes ,  
Recognizing the importance of space science and space applications for the fundamental knowledge of the universe , education , health , environmental monitoring , management of natural resources , disaster management , meteorological forecasting and climate modelling , satellite navigation and communications , and the major contribution that space science and technology make to the well-being of humanity and specifically to economic , social and cultural development ,  
To implement an integrated , global system , especially through international cooperation , to manage natural disaster mitigation , relief and prevention efforts , especially of an international nature , through Earth observation , communications and other space-based services , making maximum use of existing capabilities and filling gaps in worldwide satellite coverage ;  
The debt overhang , inadequate external finance - exemplified by the decline in ODA - limited market access for exports , severe supply-side constraints , deterioration in human welfare and the increasing number of humanitarian and natural disasters have adversely impacted on the economic performance of LDCs . 
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
The eventual abandonment of this regime in favour of an independent Palestinian currency would be a natural conclusion of the transitional process , during which credibility is established , institutions are built up and financial markets mature .  
This cooperation is not confined to official endeavours undertaken by the Kuwaiti Government ; the State is also encouraging national institutions and individuals to provide aid and assistance to those in need thereof in other countries , regardless of the origin or cause of that need which might be attributable to poverty , natural disasters , human conflicts or other causes of human suffering which the State of Kuwait is endeavouring to combat and alleviate .  
National and regional sustainable development strategies allow for a more effective use of national and regional human , institutional , financial and natural resources , as well as cooperation at the regional and interregional levels .  
At its sixth session , the Commission recalled that a vulnerability index that takes account of the constraints arising from small size and environmental fragility , as well as the incidence of natural disasters on a national scale , and the consequent relationship of those constraints to economic vulnerability , would assist in defining the vulnerability of small island developing States and in identifying the challenges to their sustainable development .  
The combined effects of this and of ongoing armed conflicts and several devastating natural calamities had a disproportionate effect on the most disadvantaged groups of society , also contributing to increased feminization of poverty .  
The gender relationships associated with other characteristics of LDCs were also discussed : weak infrastructure , environmental degradation , low level of and access to technology , high of unemployment , a small tax base and restricted government revenues / expenditures ; inability to attract full FDI , problems of government , high rates of capital flight and the effects of exogenous factors , such as natural disasters .  
They highlighted the disadvantages that derive from their location and physical characteristics dispersion of islands over large areas in the case of archipelagic small island developing States ; recurrent damages inflicted on small island developing States located in the cyclonic belt by natural disasters , such as hurricanes ; overuse , rapid depletion and degradation of natural resources on account of their paucity relative to the demand for them .  
The continental shelf of a coastal State comprises the seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea throughout the natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer edge of the continental margin , or to a distance of 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured where the outer edge of the continental margin does not extend up to that distance .  
The natural resources referred to in this Part consist of the mineral and other non-living resources of the seabed and subsoil together with living organisms belonging to sedentary species , that is to say , organisms which , at the harvestable stage , either are immobile on or under the seabed or are unable to move except in constant physical contact with the seabed or the subsoil .  
Mercenarism occurs in inverse proportion to peace , political stability , respect for the legal and democratic order , the ability to exploit natural resources in a rational manner , a well-integrated population and a fair distribution of development which prevents extreme poverty .  
While mercenaries may be recruited , trained and financed from within solid , stable countries , they are in fact used chiefly in countries affected by political violence , internal armed conflict , insurrection or insurgency and lacking the necessary financial or technical capacity to exploit their natural resources on an industrial scale .  
The persistence of mercenary activities , the range and variety of the forms in which they are carried out and the hidden networks of complicity behind them suggest that States , particularly the smallest and weakest ones , the least developed , those forming archipelagoes , those with valuable natural resources but fragile political systems and those faced with armed insurrection and internal conflicts , are not adequately protected against mercenarism in its various forms .  
We in Saint Lucia strongly support the continued participation of these Territories in regional institutions as a natural function of our ongoing Caribbean integration process , and as a critical component of the economic , social and constitutional development of the Caribbean .  
GOOS aims to meet the need for : ( a ) forecasting climate variability and change ; ( b ) assessing the state of health of the marine environment and its resources ( including the coastal zone ) ; and ( c ) supporting an improved decision-making and management process which takes into account potential natural and man-made changes in the environment and their effects on human health and resources .  
A panel of technical experts held during the Consultative Group Meeting , which included representatives from UNICEF and other United Nations organizations , suggested that reducing ecological and social vulnerability to natural hazard is a core regional development issue and that the primary responsibility for reducing vulnerability lies with sectoral institutions and with local communities . 
Activities in the Paris Club in the second half of 1998 and the first half of 1999 were marked by continued restructuring of the debts of the poorest countries in the context of the HIPC initiative ; the return of middle-income countries to reschedule their official bilateral debts ; and special measures taken in support of countries affected by conflict or natural disaster .  
Hurricane Mitch and other natural phenomena of uncommon violence lay bare the physical vulnerability of our countries and highlight the absolute necessity of early and organized preventive measures .  
Arms transfers and trafficking , and the resulting armed conflicts which they feed , are having a devastating impact on social , political and economic life for Africa south of the Sahara , a region endowed with natural resources but which still has pockets in which live the poorest people in the world today . 
Alternative 2 : Calls on Member States to give priority to improving their emergency response capabilities and to increasing their participation in existing mechanisms to allow for a timely , effective and coordinated response to natural disasters and for containment of environmental damage in the Caribbean Sea in the event of an accident or incident relating to maritime transport ,

Alternative 2 : Calls upon Member States to give priority to improving their emergency response capabilities and to increasing their participation in existing mechanisms in order to allow for a timely , effective and coordinated response to natural disasters and for containment of environmental damage in the Caribbean Sea in the event of an accident or incident relating to maritime transport ;  
If we really want to find effective and lasting solutions we can not overlook the fact that the roots of the current problems are found in the centuries of colonial exploitation during which African economies were looted and distorted in order to turn them into providers of natural resources , raw materials and cheap manpower at the cost of the annihilation and enslavement of tens of millions of people . 
Nor can we overlook the fact that the current unjust and unsustainable international economic order continues to treat Africa as an economically undeveloped source of natural wealth , that serves the unsustainable consumption patterns of industrialized countries , among which are included the former colonizers .  
Recognizing that the combined effects of natural disasters , conflicts , entrenched poverty , diseases , especially the malaria and the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic , and lack of proper education affect the economic prospects of and efforts to eradicate poverty in the most severely affected countries , especially in Africa ,  
The United Nations serve as the framework for political , economic , cultural , environmental and moral dialogue and that full use be made of the regional commissions which were the natural link between global and national concerns .  
In that context , it was regrettable that Israel continued to apply inhumane practices against the Palestinian people of the occupied territories and to confiscate their land , water and other natural resources , in flagrant violation of the principle , based on the Charter of the United Nations and international law , that land and other resources could not legitimately be acquired by force .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,

Recognizing that the combined effects of natural disasters , conflicts , entrenched poverty , diseases , especially the malaria and the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic , and lack of proper education affect the economic prospects of and efforts to eradicate poverty in the most severely affected countries , especially in Africa ,  
Recognizing further that the combined effects of natural disasters , conflicts , entrenched poverty , disease , especially malaria and the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic , and lack of proper education affect the economic prospects of and efforts to eradicate poverty in the most severely affected countries , especially in Africa ,  
It had enacted a law on the sustainable use of Fijis limited renewable and non-renewable land and sea resources and readjusted its sectoral policies with a view to ensuring sustained natural resource utilization ; the development of human-resource-based industries ; the improvement of social services in the fields of health , education and housing ; poverty alleviation ; rural and urban development ; and disaster management .  
It was working throughout the developing world to fight land degradation and poverty ; in Asia , it had initiated a programme targeting very poor rural households in upland areas , which integrated natural resource management , economic diversification and the creation of local employment . 
Ms . Wong ( Singapore ) said that as a small island State with no natural resources , her country was acutely aware of the impact on its environmental well-being of external factors , and was committed to playing a proactive role in supporting regional and global initiatives to protect the environment .  
Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,  
Issues addressed with regard to the linkages between poverty and various vulnerable groups , including indigenous peoples , minorities , migrant workers and persons affected by AIDS , included social exclusion and marginalization , the exploitation of natural resources , transnational corporations and the impact of their activities on the enjoyment of the rights of communities concerned by such activities , as well as the overall policies of host Governments . 
Recognizing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
Emphasizes the urgent need to further develop and use the existing scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters , bearing in mind the particular needs of developing countries , and , in this regard , calls upon all countries to strengthen scientific research and training of experts in universities and specialized institutions and to promote the exchange of information ;  
In Africa , in particular , children were all too often the victims of armed conflict , a situation aggravated by natural disaster , disease , an adverse economic environment and the growing burden of foreign debt , while in Palestine and other occupied territories , children were being killed , tortured and imprisoned without having committed any crime .  
For many commodities exported by developing countries , there has also been substantial substitution by synthetic materials over the past two decades , while a shift away from traditional &amp; lt ; heavy = industries , such as iron and steel , has also limited the rate of expansion in demand for natural raw materials .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of girls and boys in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions in an increasingly globalized world economy , pandemics , natural disasters , armed conflict , displacement , exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance , discrimination and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,

The voluminous documentation on international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space that had been submitted to the Conference established the basis for the use of space for the purpose of environmental protection ; the rational utilization of natural resources ; the promotion of development ; education ; and the broader application of space technology in the interests of developing countries .  
While the conceptualization of national and other more specific benchmarks has generated a great deal of discussion within the human rights community , the setting of progressive development benchmarks has been a natural outcome of the follow-up to international commitments made to implement the education goals of successive world conferences and global summits organized by the United Nations since 1990 . 
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and property worldwide , in particular in vulnerable societies lacking adequate capacity to mitigate effectively long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences of natural disasters ;  
The main thrust of Namibias national action programme to combat decertification was that the social , economic , legal and political environment should be reconciled with the natural environment in order to enhance the sustainable use of natural resources .  
Mr . Rayani ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) said that UNISPACE III had emphasized the importance of providing the developing countries with opportunities to use the latest achievements of space science and technology for the purposes of economic development and for forecasting natural disasters , especially since outer space was not the exclusive property of any individual State but the common heritage of mankind .  
We have always said that Iraq is a great country with a rich cultural heritage , home to one of the oldest civilizations known , and that , by virtue of its abundant natural , mineral , human and other resources , it has huge potential to become an economic force to be reckoned with , not only in the Gulf region but also worldwide .  
The Government stressed that the people of the South required reparation and justice for impunity , neo-colonial wars , the extermination of populations and peoples , the defilement of their economic , cultural and natural heritage by countries of the North , the decapitalization of the developing countries charged with paying external debts and the dumping of toxic waste in their territories , to cite only a few examples .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Noting further that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territorys deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
Improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , through international assistance for the purpose of capacity-building and human resource development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , is also necessary for the successful implementation of national programmes .  
The Government of our Republic has consistently maintained a policy of providing jobs , free medical treatment and free education to all people , even amid serious temporary economic difficulties created by economic blockades of foreign forces and natural disasters which have recurred over a number of consecutive years .  
While emphasizing the imperative need for the political will on the part of States to facilitate the access of needy populations to assistance and cooperation , it seems to us equally valuable that the Secretary-General has included , as the first point in his annual report , a reference to the importance of developing a culture of prevention to deal with natural disasters . 
Can we really imagine modern international political and economic relations , trade , satellites , the Internet , aviation , technological and scientific activity , cultural exchanges , environmental protection , travel , the use of natural resources , exploration of outer space and other vital human activities without a solid international legal foundation ? 
Factors that have a direct or indirect impact on peace , such as the environment , natural resources , sustainable development , quality of life , technology and international relations , are studied in terms of their real impact on peace and not as isolated topics .  
Therefore we hope to continue to have the solidarity and the support of the United Nations system , as well as of international financial organizations and the donor community , especially those that pledged their commitment in the Stockholm Declaration , as their invaluable assistance is vital in order to overcome the structural problems underlying the effects of natural disasters .  
With its unsurpassed costs in terms of human and financial numbers , claiming some 50 , 000 victims and causing economic losses exceeding $ 90-billion throughout the world , 1998 was an annus horribilis , that clearly illustrated the extreme vulnerability of developing countries to natural disasters of all types .  
The basis for this conviction lies in our rich history and great culture , which has made an invaluable contribution to world civilization ; in our natural and intellectual potential ; in the high spiritual and moral values of our people ; in their enterprise , open thinking and desire to take their rightful place in the world society .  
The sponsors have included land as a natural resource in this operative paragraph because the Special Committee has been informed of a desire by petitioners from one particular Territory that all unused and excess land not required for military purposes be returned to the original landowners .  
Nonetheless , it is also natural , in a democratic international community based on the principles of equitable geographic representation and the sovereign equality of States , that changes to the collective security system be the result of a genuine general agreement , instead of being imposed .  
As a subregion that is extremely vulnerable to natural disasters resulting from violent tropical cyclones , El Nio , tsunamis , tidal waves , droughts , brush fires and earthquakes , we are committed to supporting the remarkable role played by the United Nations and its response system , including its engagement with many intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , in the delivery of much-needed relief assistance to our peoples .  
Mr . Ahmed ( India ) stated that the adoption of the treaty by the General Assembly would ensure the exploitation of natural resources of the Moon and other celestial bodies in an orderly and rational manner through the creation of an international regime to ensure that such resources , as the common heritage of mankind , were exploited for the benefit of all mankind .  
As a result of such an agreement , the use of the natural resources of celestial bodies and outer space , which might relieve some of the immense pressures now facing mankind due to the limited resources of the Earth , could take place in a predominantly peaceful environment , in an orderly fashion , in accordance with international law , on the basis of international cooperation and mutual understanding and in accordance with previously agreed procedures . 
Iraq was one of the pioneers in adopting organized scientific planning to mobilize and develop human and financial resources so as to achieve sustainable economic growth aimed at bringing about the prosperity of human beings and at maintaining their right to their natural resources and their environmental rights .  
National and regional sustainable development strategies allow for a more effective use of national and regional human , institutional , financial and natural resources , as well as cooperation at the regional and interregional levels .  
At its sixth session , the Commission recalled that a vulnerability index that takes account of the constraints arising from small size and environmental fragility , as well as the incidence of natural disasters on a national scale , and the consequent relationship of those constraints to economic vulnerability , would assist in defining the vulnerability of small island developing States and in identifying the challenges to their sustainable development .  
Following the adoption of Agenda 21 and the Barbados Programme of Action , the Government of Suriname acknowledged the necessity of strengthening its capacity for the sustainable management of its natural resources through , inter alia , the creation of appropriate institutional mechanisms to design and enforce sound environmental policies capable of countering the pressures and challenges arising from the promotion of economic development .  
The United Nations Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States , held in Barbados in 1994 , was aware of the enormous challenges facing these States when it adopted the Programme of Action , now considered the starting point for the sustainable development of small island developing States , whose ability to protect themselves against natural disasters is indeed limited .  
These States are confronted with major challenges , such as protecting the marine environment against various forms of pollution , the increasing scarcity of fresh water , ever more frequent and devastating natural disasters , adapting to climate change and to the rising sea level , integrating into the global economy , and the diversification of their exports .  
Indeed , the issues of climate change , soil erosion , global warming , sea level rise , coastal and marine resources , natural and environmental disasters , biodiversity resources , waste management and freshwater resources are among those that all developing countries face , in particular small island nations , in an increasingly competitive global economy .  
Many delegations stated that unsustainable consumption and production patterns include both adverse environmental impacts arising from the excess consumption of natural resources , particularly in the developed countries , and unemployment , poverty and underconsumption of basic goods and services , particularly in developing countries .  
It might consider such issues as ( a ) financial leakages and how to maximize benefits for local communities , ( b ) preparing a joint initiative to improve information availability and capacity-building for participation , thus enabling communities to manage social and environmental change and ( c ) developing a plan to ensure indigenous peoples and other local communities their rights to land , water and other natural resources .  
Tourism had the potential to make an important contribution to poverty alleviation and economic advancement , particularly through integrated plans with the inclusion of local stakeholders in planning and development and where a key objective remained the protection of the cultural and natural assets of the tourist locality .  
Among the cleaner transportation fuels , within a near-term horizon , natural gas appears to be the most likely and cost-effective significant alternative to motor gasoline and diesel , particularly for use in fleets , given its abundant resources , its possibilities as a high performance fuel , its clean burning qualities and its convenient commercial availability to end users , especially in the major transportation consumer nations .  
Such policies should be complemented by other measures for promoting efficient and clean energy that take into account the widely differing institutional , social , economic , technical and natural resource endowment in individual countries and regions .  
The Committee noted that barriers to the integration of economic , social and environmental objectives persist in current approaches to water management , but that solutions can only be found if clear integrated development frameworks are agreed at all levels of society and a long-term commitment given to the development of public health and natural resource policy , strategic planning and the mobilization of resources .  
The positive engagement with the natural resource base is essential not only to maintain local and national food security but also to offer opportunities for balanced rural development .  
The Committee considered that , since the EVI could give only a partial and approximate measure of the relative level of vulnerability of a country , a document to be called a country vulnerability profile should be prepared , for some countries , to provide a more detailed assessment of the impact of external economic and natural shocks on their economic performance and economic structure .  
National decisions and the capacity to manage land resources sustainably can also be constrained by external factors and the impacts of inappropriate development strategies pursued in the past , including unequal negotiations for rights to exploit natural resources by national and foreign companies , and poorly designed projects financed by donors which have been based on purely economic considerations .  
FAO has developed frameworks and guidelines for the implementation of the approach , including documents entitled Our land our future : a new approach to land use planning and management ( 1996 ) ; Negotiating a sustainable future for the land , structural and institutional guidelines on natural resource management in the twenty-first century ( 1997 ) ; and The future of our land : facing the challenge , guidelines for integrated planning for sustainable management of land resources ( 1998 ) .  
The experience is that these soft forms of tourism can be just as destructive as mass tourism , if they are not planned , developed and managed in a sustainable manner , so as to ensure that there are no adverse effects on the natural environment or the local sociocultural fabric , and that the local community is involved in all development and management phases .  
The main adverse impacts of tourism on the environment are connected to pressure on natural resources , harm to wildlife and habitats ( with associated loss of biological diversity ) , the generation of pollution and wastes , and social and cultural pressures related to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity .  
In Mauritius , a national environmental commission has been set up , chaired by the Prime Minister , with a broad membership , including ministers responsible for economic planning , finance , education , science and technology , energy and natural resources , tourism , industry , health and justice , and representatives of local government .  
A number of small island developing States have not yet accorded high priority to institution - and capacity-building ; some of them have had to deal with more pressing problems such as natural disasters and macroeconomic imbalances ; the recent economic crisis has had direct impact on some small island developing States where deteriorations in economic performance have further reduced scope for action for institutional and administrative capacity-building ;  
Most small island developing States would derive tremendous benefits from the introduction of environmentally sustainable technological innovations in the areas of the development of renewable energy , freshwater and marine resources ; telecommunications and information technology ; waste management and natural disaster mitigation ; and sustainable land resources management .  
The observer for the Indian Movement Tupaj Amaru stated that , while considering the draft declaration , special attention should be given to such notions as the recognition of the right of indigenous peoples to define themselves as peoples , the principle of self-determination , the exercise of collective ancestral ownership of land , the sovereignty over natural resources , the legal protection of cultural and intellectual property .  
Provide financial and institutional support for research on safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods and technologies for the reproductive and sexual health of women and men , including more safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods for the regulation of fertility , including natural family planning for both sexes , methods to protect against HIV AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases and simple and inexpensive methods of diagnosing such diseases , among others . . . .  
Tourism is a labour-intensive activity that does not require a high level of specialization , and if well managed and of the proper size , it may exert a strong attractive force on the rest of the islands economic system , including conservation of certain traditional activities , such as agriculture and fishing , and preservation of islands cultural heritage and natural assets .  
The fragile ecosystems of small island States and their generally more limited scope for pursuing alternative development strategies make concerns for the environmental impact of tourism very acute , particularly because the sector , which is almost totally dependent on the natural environment , is viewed by many small island developing States as a fast route to social and economic development .  
The introduction to the Principles contains a refinement of previous working definitions : internally displaced persons are persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence , in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict , situations of generalized violence , violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters , and who have not crossed an internationally recognized State border .  
Article 17 of the Criminal Code stipulates that persons who act as accessories after the fact for their spouse or legitimate relatives by blood or marriage , throughout the direct and collateral lines up to the second degree , as well as natural parents and children born out of wedlock , shall be exempt from the penalties imposed for concealment , unless they have profited from the effects of the crime or ordinary offence . 
That amendment also entitled any person , natural or juridical , to establish a periodical , a local radio station or a television studio , whereas the previous legislation recognized this right only for the State , social and economic organizations and for associations .  
Among the main concerns in the region are unsustainable exploitation and environmental degradation of those natural resources on which rural communities depend ; optimized use of land ; living conditions of coastal people ; insufficiently treated urban wastes , oil pollution and coastal erosion .  
New Zealand provided a variety of examples on technology innovations , including the use of wool booms in residual oil spill clean-ups , oil-eating microbes , development of captive breeding programmes for shellfish , experimental wave and tidal energy generation , and development of pharmaceutical and natural health products from marine sources , such as sponges .  
Losses in biodiversity and economic growth due to unplanned activities related to dredging , lack of clear property rights and control on natural resources , the low level of investments , and lack of participation in decision-making are conditions that have brought integrated coastal zone management onto the political agenda , and programmes are gradually being developed .  
For instance , problems of water supply in terms of both quantity and quality , environmentally sound management of solid and liquid wastes , adaptation to climate change and sea level rise , integrated management of coastal zones , prevention or minimization of natural and environmental disasters among others , all call for specific skills , without which small island developing States even with the highest level of political will can not hope to solve them .  
In view of their narrow natural resource base , their proneness to disruption by natural disasters , their small range of primary product exports and their limited local capital for productive investment , small island developing States need to join forces for their development , so that communication and exchange of information becomes vital .  
Stressing that any credible strategy for the reduction of the natural disaster effects of future El Nio occurrences must be based on effective dialogue and cooperation between the scientific and technological areas of the United Nations system and its operational responsibilities in the fields of disaster management , humanitarian assistance , sustainable development , technical cooperation and capacity-building , including data-collection , monitoring and early warning systems , at all levels ,  
At the start of the millennium , the growing concerns in the region for the environmental dimension of development will centre on the increasing demand for natural resources , the dominant role of the private sector in the development of such resources and the management of service concessions , the problems caused by pollution and land use and the need to comply with multilateral agreements on the environment , particularly under Agenda 21 , and international agreements on specific issues .  
The main users will be authorities and government officials concerned with environmental management and sustainable development , the programming , coordination and management of the use of natural resources and energy , human settlements , in particular ministries of housing and urban planning and local governments , and international and regional transport .  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily _ indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
Similarly , ICLARM , whose operating mission is geared to research and capacity-building in natural resources management , fisheries stock assessment and aquaculture , assisted in a South South training initiative among a number of scientists from the developing world in quantitative genetics and its application to select breeding .  
The development of more cost-effective mapping procedures based on satellite data will surely result in increased use of remote sensing data and consequently expand the market for such data , enabling developing countries to collect and update basic information on the topographic and thematic ( natural resource ) cartography of their territories .  
Recognizing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences on vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
Emphasizes the urgent need to further develop and use the existing scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters , bearing in mind the particular needs of developing countries , and , in this regard , calls on all countries to strengthen scientific research and training of experts in universities and specialized institutions and to promote the exchange of information ;  
Such a decision ignored the erosion of trade preferences , the CARICOM countries ecological and economic vulnerability and the fact that most of their economies lacked the resilience to recover quickly from natural disasters which could obliterate their physical infrastructure , industrial base and agricultural assets . 
Her Government was committed to fighting poverty , inter alia by promoting the education and health of girls , enhancing their participation in the management of natural resources , improving their living conditions , combating violence against women , increasing their participation in decision-making and improving synergy among the relevant mechanisms for advancing the status of women .  
Intensify efforts to implement legislative and administrative measures as well as to promote public education , with special attention to youth , about the need for sustainable production and consumption patterns ; foster sustainable natural resource use ; and work concertedly to prevent environmental degradation within their countries ;  
At the substantive session of the Economic and Social Council held in July 1999 Switzerland had stated that an effective coordination mechanism to promote the management of natural disasters should be established within the United Nations system as of the year 2000 . Such a structure should take account of the national and international dimensions of natural disasters .  
The representative of the National Aboriginal and Islanders Legal Services Secretariat considered that the working group should be guided by basic legal drafting principles in elaborating the text of the draft declaration and that the term self-determination should be given its ordinary and natural meaning .  
Reference was made to how the issue had been settled in Greenland and to the declaration made by the Government of Denmark at the time it ratified ILO Convention No . 169 , in which it had explained the unique land ownership situation in Greenland , where rights of ownership could not be acquired by either natural or legal persons but were divided between the State , the Greenland Home Rule authorities and the individual Greenlander . 
Recognizing that natural disasters constitute a major problem for development whose solution requires considerable resources and calls for efforts at the national level to be supplemented by international financial and technical assistance ,  
Our common objective is to meet the ever increasing needs of human development in the economic and social spheres , while not simply preserving , but gradually restoring natural ecosystems to conditions that will guarantee environmental sustainability .  
For relevant least developed countries in particular , including small island developing States , this may represent a considerable expenditure in the short term , while having a bearing on the future mapping of the natural resources of the continental shelf .  
In this era , when there are no natural enemies , and thus no natural allies , some seek to advance their political and military ambitions by playing on racial and religious fears to give life to the dangerous doctrine of an impending clash of civilizations .  
These setbacks can be attributed , inter alia , to a harsh natural environment , inadequate economic policies , recurring droughts and the low level of development of social sectors .  
That was especially true in view of the principal objective of the Decade , namely , to reduce the casualties , material damage and social and economic disturbances caused by natural disasters , particularly in developing countries .  
United by strong natural , historic , social and cultural ties , that community would offer a single focus for investment and tourism and a single market with a common external tariff and would facilitate the free flow of goods , services and people .  
Recognizing that natural disasters constitute a major problem for development whose solution requires considerable resources and calls for efforts at the national level to be supplemented by international financial and technical assistance ,  
Strategic options being considered include fostering human capital development and the creation of permanent rural jobs through public investments geared to conserving and restoring natural resources ;  
Understanding the natural , social , cultural , economic and political features of local and national environments , particularly their dynamics and interactions , is considered as one of the basic principles of the Convention to Combat Desertification .  
While Africa has a rich natural resource endowment , which should give it the comparative advantage in becoming a major producer of industrial raw materials and manufactures , its potential remains largely untapped .  
Market economies are neither reducible to actions that are obvious , natural and outside moral enquiry , nor made of abstract axioms such as free enterprise or free trade that are protected from testing and questioning .  
It was agreed that the organization should enhance its capacity to predict and respond to a changing global environment , marked by increased frequency and intensity of civil strife , armed conflict and natural disasters .  
Urged countries to engage in raising awareness of the ecological , social , cultural and economic roles that planted and natural forests might fulfil in the rehabilitation and sustainable management of forests in environmentally critical areas ;  
The major objective of SARD is to enhance food security ( defined as access to the food required for a healthy and productive life ) in an environmentally sound way so as to contribute to sustainable natural resource management .  
Formidable challenges arising from persistent poverty and widening economic and social disparities , humanitarian crises caused by armed conflict and natural disasters , and the growing HIV / AIDS pandemic provided the context for much of UNICEF work in 1999 .  
At present , it is obvious that the world needs sustainable economic and social development based on strategic approaches to balanced and rational use of natural and water resources .  
The collaboration with UNDP has continued along two main lines , supporting the socioeconomic aspects of governance in the region and the delivery of technical assistance at the national level , including the assessment of the impact of natural disasters .  
National and regional sustainable development strategies allow for a more effective use of national and regional human , institutional , financial and natural resources , as well as cooperation at the regional and interregional levels .  
If the political will is summoned to deny the ability of warring factions to sustain their illicit trade in natural resources , a vital lifeline that supports and sustains armed conflict will be degraded , if not destroyed .  
This vast territory which has immense natural ( mineral , agricultural , forestry , energy and other ) resources continues to have some of the lowest social indicators in the world and is classified among the poorest countries in the world . 
A deliberate action calculated to step up ethnic cleansing and genocide against the Serbs and other nonAlbanians in Kosovo and Metohija , it is a means of imposing neocolonialist control over the natural , material and human resources of a sovereign country .  
It is not an ethnic , tribal or religious conflict , but one born of greed and the desire by a handful of unpatriotic elements to control the strategic mineral and natural resources of the country .  
As is natural in a democratic international community , these changes must be the result of an authentic general agreement , and not of impositions based on artificial time limits , partial solutions or the socalled quick fix .  
Whether natural or caused by humans , crises often cross borders , draining resources away from essential public services , reducing development investments , and destroying physical , natural , institutional and social capital .  
The knowledge and wisdom of indigenous and local communities is critical to the conservation and management of much of the worlds biological diversity and natural resources and can add value to contemporary , scientific ways of thinking .  
Warnings of bad weather and natural disasters to remote areas and ships : satellite telecommunications offer increased reliability compared to the standard terrestrial maritime communications facilities that were used in the past ;  
It is on this basis that we have decided that there is a need for at least a partnership among Governments of affected countries , relevant humanitarian organizations and specialized agencies to promote training in , access to and the use of technologies , to strengthen preparedness for and response to natural disasters and to enhance the transfer of current technologies and corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on concessional and preferential terms , as may be mutually agreed .  
This has provided us with the opportunity , in the face of adversity , to redouble efforts to foster national unity and strengthen democratic institutions , and to promote activities aimed at the economic growth and social development of the country , which we had begun before this natural disaster struck , in order to preserve the political , economic and social stability that had been achieved .  
Finally , the increasing incidence and magnitude of natural disasters confirms the need for and importance of efficient coordination at all levels in disaster preparedness and emergency response ; information-sharing and early warning systems to mitigate the impact of natural disasters ; and , above all , a ready pool of resources , including financial resources that can be deployed and utilized immediately , thus minimizing human suffering .  
Those delegations expressed the view that such re-entry constituted a serious threat to human security and the economic activities of coastal States and threatened the marine environment and its natural resources .  
The Committee agreed that beneficial uses of space such as strengthening communications infrastructure , disaster management , education , agriculture , environmental protection and natural resource management had enormous relevance for human development , in particular in developing countries , and that the wider adoption of such beneficial applications would strengthen the goal of maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes .  
Some delegations reiterated the view that the geostationary orbit was a limited natural resource with sui generis characteristics that risked saturation , and that its utilization should be based on the principle of rational and equitable access for all countries , taking into account the special needs of developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries .  
It demonstrates that the false pretext of border insecurity is no longer tenable and that the real motive for the aggression is the systematic plundering and illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
We think that the nature of the Panels report is in sharp contrast to that submitted to the Council in January , as it contains numerous recommendations , including coercive measures , which are the result of the Panels review of the basic forms of illegal exploitation of natural resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and of the collection of extensive data on the structures engaged in such exploitation and their financial , commercial and transport activities .  
The second point is that my delegation wishes to express its deep concern about the humanitarian situation that the Democratic Republic of the Congo is experiencing , particularly caused by the massive displacement of people who are fleeing violence , the interruption of traditional sources of food supplies , the systematic plundering of the countrys natural resources and the impact of the war on childrens lives , as was eloquently presented by Mr . Olara Otunnu .  
Given that most of the conflicts on the Security Councils present agenda do not relate to conventional territorial disputes , but rather to ethnic reasons , religious intolerance , abject poverty , control over natural resources or systematic violations of human rights , an opportunity is created for the Economic and Social Council to cooperate with the Security Council through recommendations conducive to conflict prevention , an area which traditionally had seemed to be outside its sphere of competence .  
In the meantime , we reaffirm our firm condemnation of the ongoing pillage of the natural resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , which , according to credible sources , is the principal reason for the continuation of the conflict and for serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
The international community hopes for a return to peace and economic recovery in the Great Lakes region , especially in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , which is most unusual geopolitically , as it lies at the centre of the African continent , and which is exceptionally rich in a wide variety of natural resources , whose overexploitation by the belligerents without the least benefit to the people of the Congo is one of the leading causes of the conflict . 
It is our conviction that the solution to the problems of the Democratic Republic of the Congo undoubtedly lies in the implementation of the Lusaka Agreement and the additional protocols , as well as in the pertinent Security Council resolutions , which , once thoroughly observed , will provide the necessary conditions for a definitive settlement of the issues related to the illegal exploitation of the natural resources and other forms of wealth of the Congo in which the international community has a relevant role to play .  
While the Government of Burundi is satisfied by the conclusions of the Panel of Experts concerning charges pertaining to the alleged involvement of Burundi in the illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , the delegation of Burundi is , however , concerned by information contained in certain paragraphs of the addendum regarding assistance granted to the armed groups Forces pour la dfense de la dmocratie ( FDD ) and Forces nationales pour la libration ( FNL ) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . 
We note with interest the remark contained in paragraph 10 of the report that the history of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , regardless of the political system or governing authority in place , has been one of systematic abuse of its natural and human resources , such that a country noted for its vast natural resources was reduced to being one of the poorest and debt-ridden by the early 1990s . 
Mines and other sources of natural wealth are remote and heavily guarded , often located in areas subject to outbreaks of fighting or armed attacks against the local population .  
For its part , it had initiated a systematic study of the effects of continuous low level exposure at the cellular , molecular and clinical levels on the health of the population in high natural background radiation areas in the state of Kerala .  
In the light of the fact that lasting peace , independence and freedom were inextricably linked to social and economic development , there was a need to consider the unique circumstances prevailing in the Non-Self-Governing Territories , such as vulnerability to natural disasters , fragility of ecosystems , geographical isolation and the need to protect the cultural traditions of local populations .  
Adoption of the clean production strategy in its widest sense : This involves the prudent exploitation of natural resources ; avoidance of the use of hazardous substances ; increased efficiency of the design and production processes ; reduced emissions , runoffs and wastes , whether in production or end-use , to levels the environment can support ; environmentally sound waste management ; and consideration of the modification of patterns of consumption that have given rise to a societal demand for a particular commodity or service .  
Adoption of measures to ensure effective Arab participation in achievements in the field of advanced technology for the improvement of the Arab environment : Increasing efforts are today being made to achieve important and promising advances in addressing chronic environmental issues connected with meeting the natural resource requirements of development projects , and especially their renewable resource requirements , with reducing pollution levels in production and end-use , with improving the effectiveness of waste recycling and with safer waste disposal .  
The political instability and the natural resources of certain countries , by exciting the greed of foreign interests which had allies in the interior of the country , lay at the origin of the numerous armed conflicts in that continent .  
The European Union participated actively in space activities and carried out a variety of scientific projects , including for the development of the automatic satellite navigation system " Galileo " and a global monitoring system for environmental protection and safety which would have practical applications in a broad range of fields , including the prevention of natural and man-made disasters and the mitigation of their effects .  
Pakistan believed that in years to come the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee should devote special attention to the following issues : matters relating to remote sensing , use of nuclear power sources in outer space , means of and mechanisms for strengthening inter-agency cooperation and increasing the use of space applications and services within and among entities of the United Nations system , implementation of an integrated , space-based global natural disaster management system and the physical nature and technical attributes of the geostationary orbit and of its utilization and applications .  
His delegation wished to emphasize the importance of intensifying international cooperation with a view to implementing the Vienna Declaration , which set out recommendations in the following areas : protecting the environment and managing natural resources , using space applications for human security , development and welfare , advancing scientific knowledge of space and protecting the space environment , enhancing education and training opportunities and ensuring public awareness of the importance of space activities .  
Emphasis will be given to ensuring a more timely and better coordinated response to situations calling for humanitarian assistance in the event of natural disasters and complex emergencies , providing improved support to the resident or humanitarian coordinators and implementing field-based strategic planning for the common humanitarian assistance plans of the United Nations .  
During the biennium 2000-2001 , the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs established three regional disaster response advisory units in Asia , the Pacific and South America to assist disaster-prone countries in improving rapid response preparedness and support to Governments , national civil defence institutions and the United Nations resident coordinators and United Nations agencies during the emergency phase following the initial impact of natural disasters , as well as technological accidents and environmental emergencies .  
The Commission could emphasize that the Earths atmosphere must be considered , with the oceans and the land surface , as one of the three basic interacting domains that comprise the global life-support system , and that sustainable development is inextricably linked with the impact that variations in the atmosphere itself can have on human activity , ecosystems and natural disasters . 
Recall the historical fact that among the most hideous manifestations of racial discrimination the African continent and Diaspora have suffered , namely the slave trade , all forms of exploitation , colonialism and apartheid , were essentially motivated by economic objectives and competition between colonial Powers for strategic territorial gains , appropriation , and control over and pillage of natural and cultural resources ;  
Note with grave concern the negative effects on health and the environment of environmental racism suffered , in particular , by countries in Africa , including the illicit dumping of toxic wastes and substances , hazardous working and living conditions and dangerous methods of extracting natural resources .  
The Palestinian people continued to be subjected to the most gross , systematic and widespread violations of their human rights by Israel , which persisted in oppressing the Palestinian people and creating illegal de facto situations on the ground in an attempt to break the Palestinian peoples will and determination to realize their natural and inalienable rights , including the establishment of an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital . 
The LDCs are acutely vulnerable to a variety of natural shocks , including natural disasters , and severe structural handicaps , and are susceptible to global environmental phenomena such as the loss of biological diversity and adverse effects of climate change which inter alia exacerbates drought , desertification and sea level rise .  
Tribute should be paid to the organizations of the United Nations system , Governments and the international community , especially non-governmental organizations , for the work they were doing to help , at both the psychological and the physical level , millions of children living in abject circumstances because they were victims of poverty , a precarious economic or social situation , sickness , natural disasters , armed conflicts , exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance , disabilities or lack of legal protection .  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
The Panels recommendations revolve around six broad themes : ( 1 ) sanctions against countries and individuals involved in the illegal activities ; ( 2 ) preventive measures to avoid a recurrence of the current situation ; ( 3 ) reparations to the victims of the illegal exploitation of natural resources ; ( 4 ) design of a framework for reconstruction ; ( 5 ) improvement of international mechanisms and regulations governing some natural resources ; and ( 6 ) security issues . 
The list that follows is not exhaustive , but the Panels choice was based on the crucial roles played by these persons and their direct involvement in either providing support , entertaining networks or facilitating the exploitation of natural resources within the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
Good governance , according to article 9 of the Cotonou agreement signed by all 77 ACP countries and the EU , implies a political and institutional environment that upholds human rights , democratic principles , the rule of law , and the transparent and accountable management of human , natural , economic and financial resources .  
Recognition of the particular problems faced by small island developing States relating to their remoteness from major markets , modest natural resource and export bases , narrow skills bases , heavy reliance on costly imports , limited access to private capital , and vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental degradation .  
The trust fund so established is open to voluntary financial contributions from States , intergovernmental organizations , regional economic integration organizations , national institutions and non-governmental organizations , as well as to natural and juridical persons .  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of the persistence of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions in an increasingly globalized world economy , pandemics , in particular HIV / AIDS , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance , discrimination , disability and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
The programme of work under this section has been elaborated within the framework of programme 15 of the medium-term plan for the period 2002-2005 ( A / 55 / 6 / Rev . 1 ) , which identifies three major themes : ( a ) promoting regional economic cooperation ; ( b ) alleviating poverty in rural and urban areas ; and ( c ) protecting the environment , improving the management of natural resources and focusing on the development of infrastructure and information systems .  
Mindful of the fact that the Asian and Pacific region has two thirds of the worlds population living under the absolute poverty level and the imperative of integrating environmental considerations into economic and social development , the programme will highlight a stronger poverty alleviation thrust , particularly in the areas of social development , population and rural and urban development , and environmental and natural resources management .  
Others for different reasons , including domestic economic mismanagement , conflicts , natural catastrophes and external economic shocks , such as terms of trade changes , international interest rate hikes or contagion are faced with difficult or even unbearable debt burdens .  
Targeted effects : ( a ) helping to relaunch agro-land reform ; ( b ) helping to establish integrated and participatory management of catchment areas for a better use of space ; ( c ) contributing to the development of ( traditional and modern ) bio-food networks and to alternative energy production ; ( d ) facilitating access by vulnerable groups , particularly women , to private and public rural financial services ; ( e ) capacity-building in the area of State planning and monitoring-evaluation of rural development , food security and natural resources management .  
In 2000 , several set-backs and longstanding problems impeded progress for children , such as persistent poverty , high debt burdens of many developing countries ( despite some debt relief for heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPCs ) , the still-expanding HIV / AIDS pandemic , armed conflicts , and natural disasters in Afghanistan , El Salvador , India and Southern Africa .  
Acknowledging also the special economic and social importance of the Danube River and its tributaries as a major European river with multiple uses and functions , as well as its ecological significance and its value as a natural habitat for numerous wildlife species ,  
This approach requires a comprehensive and holistic framework to articulate needs , and generate effective strategies and efficient policies , covering a broad range of interactive determinants , including demographic dynamics , social and economic conditions and natural resource endowments .  
The development of an indigenous technological base will provide developing countries with the knowledge and skills necessary for the optimal use of their own human and natural resources and help in devising the production techniques relevant to their development strategies and cultural milieu .  
The objectives of third-country training , which takes place in a particular region where developing countries have a common base in terms of natural , social and cultural factors , are to transfer the technology and know-how of Japan in a form that is compatible with local conditions , and to promote TCDC .  
However , persistent political tension along Guineas southern borders and the resultant prolonged presence of refugees , especially in the rural areas , have been putting tremendous pressure on its natural resources .  
FAO also assists in the development of institutions for the management of common pool natural resources oriented towards reconciling conflicting interests in watersheds between upstream and downstream water users or in fish-producing areas between artisanal and commercial fishermen . 
These countries are characterized by their exposure to a series of vulnerabilities and constraints such as limited human , institutional and productive capacity ; acute susceptibility to external economic shocks , natural and man-made disasters and communicable diseases ; limited access to education , health and other social services and to natural resources ; poor infrastructure ; and lack of access to information and communication technologies .  
The LDCs are acutely vulnerable to a variety of natural shocks , including natural disasters , and severe structural handicaps , and are susceptible to global environmental phenomena such as the loss of biological diversity and adverse effects of climate change which inter alia exacerbates drought , desertification and sea level rise .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territorys deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
We recall the historical fact that among the most hideous manifestations of racial discrimination the African continent and Diaspora have suffered , namely the slave trade , all forms of exploitation , colonialism and apartheid , were essentially motivated by economic objectives and competition between colonial powers for strategic territorial gains , appropriation and control over and pillage of natural and cultural resources ;  
For example , reference may be made to losses attributable [ to the wrongful act ] as a proximate cause , [ 168 ] or to damage which is too indirect , remote and uncertain to be appraised , [ 169 ] or to any direct loss , damage , including environmental damage and the depletion of natural resources , or injury to foreign Governments , nationals and corporations as a result of the wrongful act . 
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,

Stressing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , which have resulted in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
This should include mechanisms for protection when third parties evict a vulnerable group from their bases of subsistence and mechanisms of punishment and compensation in evictions already effected ; the guarantee of security of land tenure and other productive resources ; effective regulation of workers rights ; the guarantee of non-discrimination against women , in the area of work as well as in relation to ownership of property and productive resources ; and the guarantee of traditional rights of indigenous communities in relation to their natural resources ; ( c ) Obligation to fulfil .

A State may not bring an international claim arising out of an injury to a national , whether a natural or legal person , before the injured national has , subject to Article 15 , exhausted all available local legal remedies in the State alleged to be responsible for the injury .  
In that connection they pointed out that States had an obligation to exercise control so as to prohibit security firms from participating in armed conflicts , creating private armies , engaging in illicit arms trafficking , being involved in the illegal extraction of natural resources and , in that context , employing mercenaries .  
But it has to be understood that the use of such professional services also extends to other unlawful acts such as the trafficking in persons , whether migrants or women , the trafficking in arms and munitions , drug trafficking , terrorism , acts of destabilization of legitimate Governments , acts to take forcible control of valuable natural resources , and even organized crime such as the seizure or theft of vehicles on a large scale .  
It is recommended that the General Assembly should reaffirm its full support for the self-determination of the African peoples and their right to live in peace , to benefit from the development that can result from the rational use of their own natural resources and to have their legitimate governments respected and stable , and in that regard it should condemn the mercenary activities frequently organized with the aim of undermining the rights of the African peoples .  
Those rights concern historical , cultural and ethnic identity , the juridical identity of indigenous communities , communal possession of traditional lands , bilingual and intercultural education , the preservation of indigenous heritage , measures to promote human development and participation in the management of their natural resources .  6 .  Argentina has established a National Institute against Discrimination , Xenophobia and Racism , a decentralized body within the framework of the Ministry of the Interior .  
Support for the process of decentralization and devolution of environmental management takes various forms : strengthening of executive branch institutions involved in the process , and empowerment of local governments , as the main management bodies at the local level , as well as the actual communities to take over ongoing management of their natural resources .  
The Ministry calls upon all concerned countries and specialized international organizations to strictly adhere to the legal regime and the constitution of Georgia , which stipulate that the Georgian supreme bodies have the exclusive right to administer a system of environmental protection , as well as legislation on land , minerals and natural resources for the whole territory of Georgia .  
Development partners committed to supporting the least developed countries in their development of energy resources , including renewable energy , natural gas and other clean energy sources , and to facilitating the transfer of technology for the development of clean energy technologies in accordance with relevant international agreements .  
He recognized that certain development activities in the past had had negative impacts on indigenous peoples such as involuntary resettlement , restricted access to natural resources and violations of basic human rights .  
The representative called for an investigation into the mining activities of the Peabody Western Coal Company , which had damaged the health of indigenous peoples , destroyed irreplaceable religious shrines , ancestral graves / burial sites and other sacred areas , caused the decline of the aquifers and contaminated natural springs and vegetation ; the mining had also caused forced relocation . 
Given the typically sudden character of natural disasters , and of the often total disruption of public telecommunication networks resulting from their impact , the provision of reliable , independent telecommunications links is a prerequisite for efficient assessment of damages , mobilization of resources , coordination of operations and acquisition of information for dissemination through information systems , such as ReliefWeb .  
We are fully aware of the close and complex link between terrorism , organized crime , drug-trafficking , the illegal exploitation of natural resources and the illegal trafficking and easy availability of small arms and light weapons .  
Noting with concern the devastating effects of difficult social and economic conditions , armed conflicts , wars , natural disasters , infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria , and of the HIV / AIDS pandemic on family life and stability ,  
New and more dangerous phenomena have emerged that affect the security of States and their citizens , such as international terrorism , drug trafficking , transnational organized crime , the illegal exploitation of natural resources and other factors that threaten the regional and international security balance of our contemporary world .  
In this framework , we also call for the discontinuation of all financial , technological and scientific aid used in developing Israels dangerous nuclear installations , which threaten not only the peace efforts and attempts to find a solution to the Palestine question and the Middle East problem , but also the security , stability and real interests of the peoples in the area and their natural , economic and environmental resources .  
The meeting recommended strengthening cooperation between the League of Arab States and the United Nations on humanitarian issues , particularly building capacity for monitoring emergencies and coordinating regional relief operations ; developing training and capacity-building programmes , with special reference to early warning and preparedness systems ; and convening a regional workshop on humanitarian emergency assistance for victims of natural disasters and complex emergencies .  
In that regard , the Union had identified the possible main themes for the Summit , which might serve as a preliminary basis for discussion in the future : protection of the natural resources that were the base of economic and social development ; integration of the environment and poverty eradication ; making globalization serve sustainable development ; and improving governance and participation .  
As the worlds largest democracy , with enormous potential and rapidly growing economic power , and being a major contributor to peacekeeping operations , India has a natural claim to a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council .  
The future convention should deal with the active and passive corruption of national and foreign public officials and provide for the liability of natural and legal persons .

Consideration needed to be given to issues such as space debris , the status of low near-Earth orbits as a limited natural resource , the use of nuclear energy sources in outer space , intellectual property protection in respect of space vehicles , use of space technology and legal aspects of global navigation systems .  
The first victims of whatever military actions are undertaken will be the billions of people living in the poor and underdeveloped world , with their unbelievably serious economic and social problems , their unpayable debts and the ruinous prices of their basic commodities ; their growing natural and ecological disasters ; their hunger and extreme poverty ; the massive undernourishment of their children , teenagers and adults ; their terrible AIDS epidemic ; and their malaria , tuberculosis and infectious diseases , which threaten whole nations with extermination .  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and property worldwide , in particular in vulnerable societies lacking adequate capacity to mitigate effectively the long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences of natural disasters ;  
Stresses the need for partnership among Governments of the affected countries , relevant humanitarian organizations and specialized companies to promote training in , access to and use of technologies to strengthen preparedness for and response to natural disasters , and to enhance the transfer of current technologies and corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed ;  
Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,

Recognizes that the White Helmets , in close cooperation with the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs of the Secretariat and as an operational partner of the United Nations system , are an efficient and viable mechanism for making pre-identified and trained homogeneous teams available to the United Nations , in support of immediate relief , rehabilitation , reconstruction and development activities , in the light of the increasing number , growing magnitude and complexity of natural disasters and other emergencies ;  
Recognizing that , in addition to the general problems of development , small island developing States experience specific problems arising from their smallness , remoteness , geographical dispersion , vulnerability to natural disasters , fragile ecosystems , constraints on transport and communication , isolation from markets , vulnerability to exogenous economic and financial shocks , limited internal markets , lack of natural resources , limited fresh water supply , heavy dependence on imports and limited commodities , depletion of non-renewable resources and migration ,  
Recognizing that , within the context of the challenges of development , small island developing States can experience specific problems arising from smallness , remoteness , geographical dispersion , vulnerability to natural disasters , fragile ecosystems , constraints on transport and communication , isolation from markets , vulnerability to exogenous economic and financial shocks , limited internal markets , lack of natural resources , limited freshwater supply , heavy dependence on imports and limited commodities , depletion of non-renewable resources and migration ,  
Recognize also that indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant to the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources constitute an important group for the sustainable production and consumption of goods and services , and that they should therefore participate in the design of policies and actions to achieve sustainable development ; that the use and enjoyment of natural resources in the places in which they live should be approached with respect ; and that their knowledge , innovations and practices should be legally protected and that continual feedback which benefits all concerned should thus be established . 
To underline the fact that given the existing complementarities among trade , investment , environmental quality , social well-being , growth , the benefits of the sustainable use of natural resources and the formation of an open and inclusive world economic system , the environmental dimension constitutes an opportunity rather than a barrier to investment and trade .  
To foster cooperation aimed at achieving the conservation and sustainable management of the regions natural ecosystems for the purpose of deepening world commitments to conserve biodiversity in situ and to work to establish sustainable development plans in those ecosystems which incorporate , at the local level , the agreements that figure in all the relevant conventions and that provide for the creation and reinforcement of protected areas and biological corridors and for the promotion of sustainable production activities . 
To reduce the level of vulnerability to natural disasters based on planning instruments such as ecological and economic land management ; and to promote a culture of risk awareness to further their prevention and mitigation through educational processes and improved information and early warning systems while encouraging participation on the part of civil society .  
This political will is reflected in the project for the creation of an Algerian Space Agency , which should help the country to strengthen its national capacities in economic and social development , knowledge of natural resources , environmental protection and the prevention and / or management of major disasters .  
This growth in international information-sharing is linked to a large extent to increasing global awareness of the need for continuous monitoring of the environment , natural resources and changes stemming from human activity , as well as emergency management , together with the free use of previously restricted technologies .  
To build the capacity required to develop and extend its activities in different areas of the peaceful uses of space , including satellite communication , resource investigation and satellite-based positioning systems , satellite meteorology and natural disaster monitoring , space science and technology , the Islamic Republic of Iran is not only currently taking required measures to provide required facilities , hardware and software , but is also extending its educational activities both using national resources and through the implementation of bilateral regional or interregional cooperation projects .  
In its preambular part , the draft resolution reaffirms prior resolutions that emphasize and acknowledge the importance of international , bilateral and multilateral economic , financial and technical support , cooperation and assistance for peacekeeping and peace-building in Central America following armed conflict and natural disasters .  
The World Bank hoped that that report would contribute to the global debate at a time when it was imperative for individuals and communities to better manage their human , social , physical and natural resources in the long term and to rethink their basic assumptions about how to use the planets riches and plan economic development .  
Enacting binding legislation ; formulating , implementing and periodically assessing integrated national and regional policies ; raising the awareness of all segments of society ; and implementing sound development policies that take into account the distribution and limited nature of available natural resources ;  
Despite the close geographic proximity that would appear to make the United States and Cuba natural trading partners , bilateral economic relations , in the absence of sanctions , could be limited by Cubas remaining restrictions on investments and economic activity , a foreign exchange shortage that limits Cubas ability to import , and production constraints that limit Cubas export potential ;  
Shall institute a comprehensive domestic regulatory and supervisory regime for banks , non-bank financial institutions and for natural or legal persons engaged in professional or business activities , including non-profit organizations , particularly susceptible to money-laundering , within its competence , in order to deter and detect money-laundering mechanisms , which regime shall emphasize requirements for customer identification , record-keeping and the reporting of suspicious or unusual transactions ;

The project panel set up a deaf club , with its four key members responsible for collecting , unifying and standardizing the natural sign language used by the deaf in daily life .  
Li Jing said that wetlands in the northwest not only account for a large proportion of China 's wetlands but were mainly located in sensitive areas like headwater areas , oases , riversides and inland lakes .  Under natural and human influences , they are not easily recoverable once damaged .  
With regard to ecological protection , the law stipulates : The destruction of public welfare forests , mangrove forests , wetlands , and natural scenery resources protected by law by any unit and individual is prohibited .  The engagement in activities that endanger the survival of rare ocean species of Xiamen and species inside state-level reserves by any unit and individual are prohibited .  
These procedures mainly involve issues with regard to national security , public safety , macro manipulation , environmental protection , development and use of limited natural resources , public resource deployment , public health and interests and safety of lives and property , for which administrative licenses can be granted in line with the Administrative Licensing Law of the People 's Republic of China .  
Mount Wutai is renowned worldwide for its Buddhist culture of a long tradition , unsurpassable exquisite ancient architectural art , as well as the magical and beautiful natural scenery .  It has been nearly 2,000 years since temple construction started in the 11th year of Yongping , Donghan Dynasty ( AD 68 ) .  It has developed into the world 's only Buddhist center where the blue Buddhism ( Chinese Buddhism ) and yellow Buddhism ( Lamaism ) coexist on one mountain and deliver sermons together .  
Among them , natural gas companies in Sichuan and Chongqi regions have respectively signed with US companies such as Texaco , Enron , Mobil , etc . for risk exploration contracts in the Ya'an and Leshan areas ; contracts for improving recovery ratios in the central north of Sichuan , and feasibility joint research agreements on natural gas up and downstream integrated projects in the area of Wenhuangduo in east Sichuan .  
By further increasing cooperation with overseas , and actively introducing foreign capital , technology and management experience , it accelerated the development and utilization of China 's limited oil and natural gas resources in order to make it meet the developing needs of China 's national economy .  
Currently , the natural gas resources found along the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River are mainly distributed in Sichuan Province , the Chongqing Municipality and the northwestern area of Hubei Province , among which Sichuan Province and the Chongqing Municipality 's natural gas resources are the richest .  Oil exploration area has reached 180,000 square kilometers , with a total resource magnitude of 7-trillion cubic meters .  
In recent years , China has been paying close attention to development of the natural gas industry , and has drafted a development strategy for the land-based petroleum industry of " stabilizing the east , developing the west , and increasing oil and gas " .  
It was learned that , China has planned to take advantage of the rich oil gas resources in this area during the " ninth five-year plan " ( 1996 to 2000 ) , through methods such as introducing foreign investment , jointly raising funds with the locality , etc . to build a large-scale combination project of the natural gas industry and the salt industry , which will be capable of producing 120,000 tons of PVC , 100,000 tons of caustic soda , 200,000 tons of synthetic ammonia , and 300,000 tons of carbamide .  
When a reporter asked whether the fact that now a large number of Chinese citizens overstay short-term visas after entering Russia will become a factor in tense relations between China and Russia and how this problem should be solved , Zemin Jiang expressed that with the continuous development of friendly , neighborly relations between China and Russia in recent years , the two countries are no longer isolated from each other , and relations between them have expanded , with rapidly increasing staff contacts .  This process is very natural .  
He holds that according to the experience of Asian energy market development , liquefied natural gas has become the main material of clean fuel used for electricity generation .  When the gross national product per capita reached 3000 US dollars in Japan , South Korea and Taiwan , etc . , environmental protection awareness generally rose , and all began to obviously increase usage of electricity generated by liquefied natural gas .  
He said China was in a critical period of building up a socialist market economy system and increasing the pace of its modernization build-up , but a huge , overwhelming growth in population was still restraining the social and economic development , affecting the further improvement of the living standard of the people , and has also brought about heavy pressure on the natural resources and the natural environment .  
At the same time , when we intensify our efforts in the implementation of the natural forest protection project , we should also experiment with the practice of gradually returning the grain plots to forestry and husbandry in a well-planned way , do a good job in protecting and building a sound ecological environment , clothe barren mountains and wasteland with greenery , restore the vegetation cover , and bring gradual changes to the deteriorating ecological environment in the western region .  
Just as an article published recently by " Renmin Ribao " stated , quickening China 's " entry into WTO " negotiations and enabling China to accede to WTO on an earlier date is at once a natural choice for China in developing a socialist market economy and a need for China in furthering her reform and opening up .  
Purbu Zhoima said : In view of the unique natural , historical , social , and economic background of the population development in Tibet and its specific evolution process , Tibet 's Provisional Management Procedures on Family Planning stipulate : " Tibet pursues on a trial basis a principle of adherence to spreading propaganda on birth control , quality service , and voluntary choice . "  
Wen Jiabao noted : The CPC Central Committee and the State Council have attached great importance to the management of national land and resources ; have set up a number of systems for the unified control of natural resources , including land , mineral , and marine resources ; and have made it clear that same as family planning and environmental protection , the protection and a rational use of natural resources is also considered a basic national policy of our country .  
We should increase our support of expenditures in the public welfare area to ensure that science and technology , education , social security , agriculture , ecological conservation , and other key areas and fields have the necessary funds to meet their expenditure needs .  We should increase our financial support for the establishment of a disaster prevention system , for projects designed to protect natural forests and to return grain plots to forestry , for poverty relief work , and for raising the peasants ' income .  
Wen Jiabao pointed out : From now on , the stress of aiding the poor through development should be laid on the western region , areas inhabited by minority nationalities , old revolutionary base areas , and utterly destitute area with very poor natural conditions .  It is necessary to take effective measures to step up the work of aiding the poor and to change their straitened circumstances .  
He said that although Ningxia is situated inland and its natural conditions are not excellent , its ancient irrigation works , splendid Xixia civilization , and unique customs and cultures are wholly capable of attracting tourists at home and abroad to bring along local economic developments .  
Qinghai is rich in petroleum , natural gas , salt , and nonferrous metal deposits , and it has special climatic conditions for the development of special agriculture and animal husbandry .  There are prospects for attaining development in a leaping-forward way [ kua yue shi de fa zhan 6421-6390-1709-4104-4099-1455 ] in a relatively short period of time , provided that we seize the opportunity , accelerate the progress of reform and opening up , enhance our concept of the market , and pay attention to the scientific and technological content in the exploitation and utilization of resources .  
People-owned enterprises which got rich ahead of others " thought of the sources for their wealth , " actively made contributions back to society , participated in the activities of supporting the poor , supported the Hope Project , gave donations to assist elderly people who lived alone without help , and performed positive functions in the struggle against floods and other natural disasters and providing relief for people in the disaster-stricken areas .  
In socialist construction , areas inhabited by minority nationalities in our country have scored achievements attracting worldwide attention .  Owing to the limitations of natural conditions and for historical reasons , however , there is still a certain gap between the minority-nationality regions and the more developed inland and eastern coastal areas in the levels of economic and cultural development .  
1 .  The fifth natural paragraph of General Program shall be amended as : " Our country shall remain at the primary stage of socialism for a long time to come ( at present ) and be faced with a main contradiction between people 's growing material and cultural needs and backward social production .  Owing to domestic factors and international influence , the struggle waged by our country 's people against hostile forces or hostile elements at home and abroad shall be a long-term one .  
Sometimes , a disease is cured by chance .  It is simply because the illness is not so severe and the patient recovers without any medical treatment due to the fact that he still has a natural resistant power in himself .  In ancient times , people also had a wishful thinking to live a long life .  
Deputy Huang Ju said : Our country is comparatively short of natural resources in terms of per capita quantities .  After economic development reaches a certain level , when facing the rapid scientific and technological progress in the world and the accelerating process of economic globalization , we may take the initiative in moving out of our national boundary and participate in international economic division of work and cooperation at a higher level .  
The outlay of the National Natural Sciences Foundation , in every field of natural science , has subsidized more than 40,000 projects in the more than ten years since 1986 .  In addition , recent financial support has seen a rather large increase , which has brought important functions into play , such as raising the level of the entire system of China 's basic scientific research ; promoting China 's scientific and technological innovation ;  
[ Shi Guangsheng ] Because of historical reasons and natural conditions , the economic foundation of the western region is quite weak .  The overall development level there is evidently much lower than that in the eastern region .  The gap between the two regions in the scale and level of the development of foreign trade and economic cooperation is also quite big .  
First , the western region has obvious advantage in natural resources , such as energy , minerals , tourism , and land .  At present , of the 140 kinds of proven mineral deposits of the country , over 120 are in the central and western region and the deposits of some rare metals there rank first in the country .  
It is necessary to make full use of the unique natural and humane scenic spots and the rich tourist resources with prominent characteristics of the western region to develop tourism for increasing foreign exchange income to promote the development of foreign trade and economic cooperation .  
In the event of their failure in delimitation through consultation , the environmental protection department of the provincial , autonomous regional , or municipal people 's government , in conjunction with the water resources , land and natural resources , health , construction , and other relevant departments of the same level , shall propose a delimitation plan to be submitted to the provincial , autonomous regional , or municipal people 's government for approval .  
Therefore , to stabilize the birthrate , we must persistently focus our attention on people ; under the general situation of the country 's social and economic growth , devote great efforts to eliminate those economic , social , and natural conditions which may affect people 's concept on child birth ; and provide a sufficient material guarantee and a strong spiritual driving power for the change in people 's concept on child birth .  
To be sure , Tibet 's falling behind by far the country 's average development standard is due to both historical and natural factors .  However , we must not lay the blame on objective factors alone .  After all we need to calmly and realistically analyze subjective and operational factors as well .  
Shi Guangsheng : There are many comparative advantages for foreign economic and trade development in the central and western regions .  1 ) They have noticeable advantages in the areas of natural resources including energy , minerals , tourism , land , and so on ; in some areas , they even have unique advantages that other regions do not possess .  
Rich in natural resources , China 's northwestern region enjoys a considerably high manufacturing and technological level , as well as a fairly strong ability in scientific research and development ; and some of the region 's products have proved fairly competitive in the international market .  All these advantages should be brought into better play through reform and readjustment .  
Over the past several years , the CPC Central Committee centered on Comrade Jiang Zemin has been able to grasp the overall situation , engaged in scientific decision-making , and led the entire party and people of all nationalities nationwide in making efforts , resulting in the overcoming of political , economic , and natural difficulties and risks .  
Meanwhile , some national and religious conflicts and some problems left over by history have yet been solved ; the conflicts over territorial land , territorial seas , and natural resources have risen one after another ; and some countries have even attempted to bring in foreign forces to take a hand in the interference in others ' internal affairs .  
Chen Yaobang said : Due to various reasons , such as natural and historical reasons , agricultural and rural economic developments in the western region have been lagging behind and the average per capita income of peasants is quite low .  
Tian Fengshan said : The Ministry of Land and Natural Resources has initially formulated an " outline for development and utilization of land and natural resources in the western region " to ensure that the tapping of minerals and use of underground water will be handled in coordination with the work of ecological protection and returning grain plots to other uses in an orderly manner .  
Tian Fengshan finally told this reporter : In the foreseeable future , the Ministry of Land and Natural Resources will strengthen work in four fields to cope with the needs of large-scale development of the western region : First , we will strengthen the investigation and evaluation of the situation of land and natural resources in China 's western region so as to provide information for economic construction in the western region , especially the rational planning of infrastructure facilities , and to support the harnessing of major rivers , protection of ecological environment and prevention of disasters . 
Replacing an old regime by a new one while the main body of international laws remained unchanged , China 's sovereignty and original territorial borders did not change either .  It is therefore logical and natural that the PRC fully owns and exercises China 's sovereignty rights , including the sovereignty right over Taiwan . At the same time , Taiwan 's Kuomintang authorities no longer have any right to represent China in exercising the right of national sovereignty .  
Our stand of opposing " Taiwan independence " has won the support of all the Chinese people , including the Taiwan compatriots , and met with general approval in the international community .  It has also hit the sore point of " Taiwan independence " elements .  Therefore , some diehard " Taiwan independence " elements are not willing to see the cross-strait relations developing in the direction of the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation because of their natural instinct of " Taiwan independence . "  
When many people regarded " globalization " as an inexorable " objective trend , " a German academic soberly analyzed that the " close connection of the global economy is by no means a natural result , but the result of an intentional practice of a policy to chase the set objectives . "  
Marx pointed out in " Critique of the Gotha Program " that in future society , some of total social output should be set aside for replenishing exhausted means of production , for expanding reproduction , for common needs such as ordinary management expenses , schools , and public health facilities , and for use as reserve or guarantee funds for dealing with unfortunate accidents and natural disasters , and for establishing a fund for people who have lost their laboring ability , and so on .  
Liu Jing said : In the process of implementing the " declaration on the rights and obligations of individuals , groups , and social organizations in enhancing and protecting generally-acknowledged human rights and basic freedom , " which was passed in 1998 , it is natural to encounter various questions .  This is an inevitable fact .  The concern of the international community in this respect is understandable .  
Such practice of using the human rights issue as a political tool to create ideological confrontation and promote hegemonism epitomizes politicization of the human rights issue , utterly violates the purpose and principles of the UN Charter and runs counter to the trend of the times , in which the international community calls for dialogue and cooperation .  It is only natural that the resolution was rejected by a majority of the members of the UN Human Rights Commission , and opposed by the just world opinion .  
Wang Yusheng said : Among all the biological events on earth , the most striking and most sensational events of biological extinction are actually not frightening and are very normal as far as the natural process of biological succession is concerned , because the new superseding the old is a general law of organic evolution .  
With a high forest acreage and abundant hydroelectric resources , it has favorable natural conditions and resources for economic development .  Its annual average agricultural output is three times the residents ' total demand .  It is June now , and waves of golden wheat can be seen everywhere in fields of rich black soil .  
( 9 ) Development of human society from low level stage to higher level is a kind of " natural history process " .  And transiting from socialism to communism is the ultimate goal and necessary result for developing modern social productive forces , which is also the supreme social ideal of communists .  
Taiwan 's armed forces believe that they are bound to lose in any " decisive battle on their beaches and shores " because Taiwan Island is small , shallow in strategic depth , and lacking a room for maneuver , and with the development of modern weaponry , the Taiwan Strait is becoming less and less effective as a natural defense for Taiwan .  
The ice slabs , ice tunnels , and ice trenches in a certain defensive zone were natural obstacles that delayed our tactical movements in the past .  This time , our infantry detachments , which followed the armored cars , were imbued with heroism and forged straight ahead .  Their combat capability has obviously increased .  
The method of citing examples as a proof and the functional method are both scientific methods for studying a problem .  If we can comprehensively use various advanced methods for the studies of social sciences and natural sciences , then we certainly will have more innovative and advanced elements in our research .  We can avoid the tendency of " paying more attention to the studies of military arts than to the scientific and technology foundation " .  
The input into the construction of ecological construction has been noticeably increased .  The engineering projects of returning grain plots to forestry and protecting natural forests and the projects of harnessing " three rivers " ( Huaihe River , Liaohe River , and Haihe River ) and " three lakes " ( Taihu Lake , Dianchi Lake , and Chaohu Lake ) have obtained phased achievements .  The environmental quality in urban areas has improved and the sense of environmental protection among the whole people has noticeably enhanced .  
The state has increased the intensity of investment in the ecological construction , carried out the natural forest protection project in a comprehensive way , activated the experimental project of returning land unfit for cultivation to forestry , prevented and controlled desertification , engaged in the work of soil and water conservation vigorously , controlled the water pollution in some major rivers to reach the targets within the time limit , and took the perpetual use of natural resources and the coordinated development of economy and environment more seriously than ever before .  
In recent years , given the complicated circumstances where international struggles changed tremendously and domestic reforms constantly intensified , and in the face of severe economic , political and natural tests , the united front promoted a united and stable political situation and also created a vigorous and vital democratic atmosphere .  It has relied most on Deng Xiaoping Theory , and united front theory for the new period , in particular .  
As a result , agriculture was generally regarded as an " inferior " industry .  After liberalized reforms , although agriculture and the rural economies have developed rapidly , the issue of " inferiority " has not been fundamentally solved .  In addition to insufficient inputs into agriculture by the government , agriculture was restricted by both natural and market risks , and agricultural conditions increasingly deteriorated .  
Professor Yu frankly admitted that as a developing country with a population of 1.2-billion , China 's per capita natural resources are comparatively scant , its current economic and cultural development is imbalanced , its legal system is not complete , and , in the process of law enforcement , some laws are not strictly abided by and some laws are not strictly enforced - - all these contribute to the non-perfect human rights situation in China .  
He said that , in line with the international trend and existing domestic precedent , using high-tech principles to mix electronic sound with natural sound could unite the opera house and concert hall into one .  That would mean building only an opera house and a Beijing Opera playhouse , or one cultural square with two structures , which would save much investment .  
Over the past 100 years , the world underwent untold tribulations caused bywars , diseases , hunger , crises , and disasters ; but more importantly , the peopleof various countries carried out momentous social and natural struggles on amagnificent scale , and thus made unprecedented progress in the political , economic , ideological , cultural , scientific , technological , education , military , and medical aspects .  
The frozen river had begun melting , and the grass had begun sprouting , for the weather had turned warm .  However , after leaving their barracks , the recruits had no time to watch the natural scenery , for they knew that countless hardships and difficulties were waiting for them on their way forward .  
Yunnan Province has rich tourism resources as it has beautiful natural scenes and pleasant weather .  There are many scenic spots and a rich variety of cultural features and customs of minority ethnic groups .  All this is huge economic potential to be tapped .  
Jiang Zemin said : Venezuela is a country with beautiful mountains and rivers and rich natural resources .  The diligent and courageous Venezuelan people are endowed with glorious historical traditions .  At present , under the leadership of President Chavez , the Venezuelan Government and people are making vigorous efforts to push forward political , economic , and social reform ;  
For instance , our per-capita natural resources are lower than the average global level , insufficient education among our people contrasts with the rapid growth of economic and social management and scientific and technological knowledge , and these kinds of restrictions deny China either a resource advantage or a technological advantage for international economic cooperation .  
At a commendation meeting held today for the national elementary and high school student " Protect the Earth , Love our Home " composition contest , CPC Central Political Bureau member and Vice Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee Jiang Chunyun called for profound and sustained development of natural resources educational activities to allow elementary and high school students to learn about our nation 's basic situation and to establish the idea of protecting natural resources and loving our home from an early age .  
All sectors of the society , all cadres and the masses must adopt the perspective of the strategy of a strong nation , prosperous people , and peaceful world and fully recognize the extreme importance of protecting and reasonably utilizing natural resources .  Furthermore , protecting natural resources and optimizing the ecological environment must become conscious actions .  
Jiang Chunyun emphasized that during the " 10th 5-Year Plan " sustainable development must be made more of a priority and propaganda efforts on the situation of national resources , and the basic national policies , laws , and regulations on protecting natural resources must be greatly intensified in order to strengthen people 's resource hardship consciousness and environmental protection consciousness .  
Land and natural resources management departments must mobilize the power of the entire society to participate in and support the protection and reasonable utilization of natural resources , intensifying education on the national situation of natural resources , national policies and national laws , fully utilizing all forms of media , developing propaganda activities in a variety of formats with abundant contents , strengthening the entire society 's resource hardship consciousness , and forming good habits of cherishing , protecting , and conserving natural resources .  
It is only right and natural that such an action is unacceptable to them .  As to Falungong 's plan to have Falungong elements from overseas gather in Hong Kong to repeat what they did during a previous international gathering , it is another sinister attempt to transform Hong Kong into an anti-Chinese base targeting at the central government .  
National model workers Li Huangxi , Bao Qian , Wang Yiqiang , Sun Haijun , Zhang Ruimin successively spoke on such subjects as striving to be new-type industrial workers in the new era , carrying forward the spirit of doing pioneering work against difficult conditions , rebuilding beautiful natural environment , and enhancing the enterprise 's international competitive power .  
Featured columns on the website , such as " wonderful natural landscapes , " " cultural treasures , " " urban sights , " and " inside Taiwan , " depict famous mountains and rivers and cultural relics and ancient ruins on both sides of the strait , describe the customs and traditions of various ethnic groups , display the long history and splendid culture of China , and provide first-hand accounts of the enormous changes and developments in China today .  
In order to ensure the smooth enforcement of the government and military orders in a special natural , political , and social environment in Tibet , the Tibet Military District CPC Committee spelled out the following requirement in no uncertain terms : " Though there is a forbidden zone for life on the roof of the world , there is no special zone for enforcing the government and military orders here , " thus enhancing a sense of " unconditional submission " among the officers and men .  
Shan Jie has also spared no effort to mobilize the local masses to collect and purchase Wulingzhi , Yizhihao , Hongjingtian , and other natural medicinal herbs which grow on the plateau , and has set up Tibet Kangda Medicines Company Ltd . as the first " joint venture enterprise on the plateau . "  As a result , the county 's annual financial revenue has risen by 6 million yuan .  
According to the regulations of the Constitution and the regional national autonomy laws , after the establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region , Tibet enjoys autonomy in many aspects like legislation , use of its national languages , personnel management , management and development of natural resources , and so on .  Therefore , the cultural traditions , customs and habits , languages , and so on of the people of all nationalities in Tibet have been fully respected and the political , economic , social and all other rights have been reliably safeguarded .  
Li Liguo noted : On 23 May 1951 , the Central People 's Government and the former local government of Tibet signed a 17-clause " Agreement on Procedures Concerning the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet " ; and the People 's Liberation Army entered Tibet , drove out imperialist forces , and brought true both the peaceful liberation of Tibet and the unification of the mainland motherland .  This was a major event in China 's modern and contemporary history , and a natural and epoch-making turning point in the historical development of Tibet .  
Except for a small number of social security objects , an exceptionally poor population living in areas with harsh natural conditions , as well as a certain number of the disabled , we have now basically resolved the problem of insufficient food and clothing for the poverty-stricken population in rural areas across the country , and have basically fulfilled all anti-poverty targets set by the central authorities .  
Asia is the world 's most populous region where most developing countries are situated , which have numerous newly rising markets , various natural resources , and investment effect with unlimited potential .  
To put it another way , we believe that like the natural world , the world of mankind is rich and colorful in nature , and the layout of world political and economic systems and order [ based on ] legal principles of international relations must fit and promote the realization of this diversity .  
We have made brilliant achievements in aiding and developing poverty-stricken areas , however , we should be aware that the production means and living in the poor areas have not yet been basically improved .  These poor areas are hardly capable of resisting natural disasters , their levels of production and social growth are comparatively low , and the gap between them and coastal developed areas keeps expanding .  
It critically incorporated British and French utopian socialism 's theory on fairness and justice in human society , the rational cores of dialectics of Germany 's classical philosophy and materialism , British classical political economy 's method for dissecting the capitalist economy , and intellectual pith in the latest achievements of natural sciences .  
Thus it is very natural for the Chinese people bullied and humiliated by superpowers from Western countries and domestic reactionary forces over the past 100-plus years ? to look forward to the socialist ideal - expect their country to be prosperous , rich and strong , but without the phenomena of a huge gap between the rich and the poor and the weak being bullied by the strong .  
During a recent inspection tour of Sichuan , Zhu Rongji , member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and premier of the State Council , pointed out that the implementation of the project to protect natural forests and the experiments on returning farmland land to forests at selected points have progressed smoothly and remarkable results have been obtained .  In particular , this has further speeded up the economic development of areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups .  
He said that party committees and governments at all levels in Sichuan have seriously implemented a series of central principles and policies to strengthen the protection and improvement of the ecological environment , taken the lead in launching the project to protect natural forests and making experiments on returning farmland to forests , taken prompt actions with a resolute attitude , done solid work and adopted effective measures .  They have enabled the people to consciously implement the party 's policies , accumulated much successful experience , and attained remarkable achievements .  
In particular , it should attach great importance to , and earnestly speed up , the development of tourism .  Sichuan has rich and colorful tourist resources .  It particular , it has cultural sites of historic interest , world-famous natural heritage , unique and fantastic natural scenery , and unique local ethnic customs and practices .  
We should strive for diversification of property rights through multiple forms , such as standard public listing of companies , mutual purchase of shares by legal persons , domestic natural person investment , foreign investment , conversion of bank credits rights to equity , market share subscription , stock right transaction , and the holding of shares by employees of a company , and gradually establish and improve a standard system of corporate governance .  
The mainland resident journalists have reported in objective fashion on Taiwan 's political , economic , and social situation and its natural conditions and social customs .  Their reports have been welcomed by compatriots on both sides of the strait , increased mainland people 's understanding of the state of affairs in Taiwan , and played a positive role in strengthening cross-strait understanding and contact .  
The two parties will cooperate in protecting and improving the environment , in preventing cross-border pollution , in the fair and rational use of biological resources in waters in the border area and in the north Pacific and border river courses , and will work together to protect rare plants and animals and the natural ecological system in the border areas , and cooperate in preventing natural disasters and major accidents arising from technical causes and in eliminating their consequences .  
Protecting and improving the environmental conditions , making fair and rational use of waters in the border region and biological resources in the north Pacific and in border river courses , and protecting plants and animals and preventing natural disasters in the border regions - - all these are new fields in which the two countries can cooperate .  
In the first 10 years plus since the implementation of reform and opening up , the gap between the level of Tibet 's economic and cultural development with the inland and the inland as well as the coastal developed areas in the east showed a trend of further widening instead of shrinking because Tibet was restricted by natural conditions and because of historical reasons .  
Although technology objectively has a negative impact on the environment , this negative viewpoint is basically a flimsy excuse .  With the economic development and the people 's understanding being raised to a higher and higher level , the people will make a higher and higher demand for a quality life and a healthy , comfortable environment .  This will basically restrict the living space of the technology featuring excessive exploitation of natural resources and will help promote the development of environmentally friendly technology .  
Answer : As " The Regulations " protects only the oil and natural gas pipelines and facilities owned by the whole people , faced with such a new situation that foreign investors will get involved in building pipelines and facilities in the future , we have decided to make " The Regulations " applicable to all the oil and natural gas pipelines and facilities within the PRC . 
In particular , irregular school fees for primary and secondary school pupils , irregular fees for rebuilding power grids and power supply facilities , irregular fees for housing construction , coercive subscription of newspapers and journals , and fees collected for unrealistic upgrading activities must be stopped .  The local authorities must not be allowed to raise funds in violation of the established policies for various purposes and under various excuses .  This year , some areas were seriously afflicted by natural disasters , and the masses there encountered difficulties in their production and daily livelihood .  
The Japanese prime minister 's brazenly paying his respects shows that Yakusuni Shrine is a symbol of aggressive war ; it has overtones of a public and official provocation , and indicates contempt for the people of those countries which suffered from that aggression .  It recalls for those people the pain they suffered , so is it not something natural , a matter of course , for the Chinese people to express their strong indignation and firm opposition ?  
In making plans , therefore , we should base ourselves on the present and have our eyes on the future , and combine the solution of the current outstanding problems with the realization of the long-term development objectives .  Our plans should both reflect the spirit of emancipating the mind and positively forging ahead , and conform to the principle of seeking truth from facts and following the objective laws .  In particular , adequate considerations should be given to the natural and geographical conditions and the actual circumstances of various localities .  
The total accumulated known deposits of natural gas in China 's western region is 1,500 billion cubic meters and the annual production capacity has reached 18 billion cubic meters , which far exceed the actual local need .  
Owing to the historical , geographical , natural conditions , and other reasons , it has generally formed into three regions , i.e . , eastern , central , and western regions in terms of economic development level , of which the eastern region is the highest , the western region is the lowest , and the central region is in between .  
This is because the natural conditions in some areas are abominable , the distance between cities in the region is very long , and that between the western cities and the eastern developed areas is even longer , and the infrastructure , economic foundation , and social and human conditions are relatively weak .  The development of the western region needs a huge amount of input , but the return rate of some input items is low in the short time .  
Although quite a few areas in the western region have rich resources , owing to the abominable natural conditions such as shortage of water , extremely poor transport facilities , harsh climate , and others , it needs serious exploration into how they should exploit their favorable conditions to the full and avoid the unfavorable ones .  
In the future , the eastern region should more positively explore the modes of cooperation for mutual benefits in light of the market economic rules by way of , for example , going to make investment in the western region for the exploitation of natural resources , participating in some companies there through shareholding , transferring some commodities to the western region in which there are greater benefits in producing such commodities , and so forth . 
The Chinese Government 's strategy of a large-scale west development is a long-term system project which has a vital importance to the country 's overall situation ; therefore , its development pattern will differ from that of a traditional regional development .  What is more , instead of being just a simple exploration of natural resources , the large-scale development of the western region aims to bring about a comprehensive and well-coordinated economic and social development to the western region through a series of capital , technological , and manpower inputs .  
In recent years , the state has increased the implementation intensity of the project for the protection of natural vegetation ; at the same time , it has adopted such policies and measures as " returning grain plot to forestry , closing hillside to facilitate afforestation , relieving people in disaster areas by giving them grain instead of outright grant , and introducing a contractual operation on individual household basis . "  Meanwhile , the state has also incorporated the work of environmental protection into the legal system .  
The foreign environmental protection enterprises ' natural link with the market economy enables them to gain advanced experiences in operational mechanism , market concepts , innovation awareness , personnel and distribution system , and others which are suited to the market economy .  These are useful experiences that the domestic environmental protection enterprises can use for reference in their development , reform , and transformation of operational mechanism at a faster pace so as to suit the major development trend of the environmental protection markets all over the world .  
Tian pointed out : The western regions are rich in natural resources but have a rather fragile ecological environment .  In particular , they are short of river resources and have suffered from serious soil erosion .  Thus the scientific and technological units and scientific and education personnel should directly participate in the work of harnessing soil erosion and building the ecological environment .  
In making plans , therefore , we should base ourselves on the present and have our eyes on the future , and combine the solution of the current outstanding problems with the realization of the long-term development objectives .

Thus the scientific and technological units and scientific and education personnel should directly participate in the work of harnessing soil erosion and building the ecological environment .  
Li Tieying pointed out : The western regions have rich hydropower , mineral , and biological resources and numerous sites of human civilization and natural scenery .  Many industries have established a good foundation in the regions .  
Chongqing will invest 20.4 billion yuan on the project .  Its various key ecological enhancement tasks include protecting natural forests , reverting cultivated farmland to forests or grasslands , afforesting barren hills and slopes , and remedying soil erosion .  
Xiang Huaicheng stressed : In comprehensive agricultural development , we must abide by the natural law and strengthen ecological environmental development to bring about sustainable economic and social development .  
The " five noes policy " is not some new olive branch extended by the new Taiwanese leaders , it is not their political bargaining chip , because as a minority leader , and with the DPP not the majority organization in the island 's public opinion , the points rejected in the " five noes " have strong support among those opposing " independence " in the opposition parties , which exercises a natural restraining action on the DPP . It is not something that any leader or the DPP can easily promote at will .  
Engineering or other projects for the development of the west which are listed as key national projects , and especially major infrastructure construction projects , environmental protection projects , projects for processing local superior natural resources or local specialty products , advanced science and technology projects , S &amp; T and educational development projects , and other projects requiring the import of foreign equipment will receive priority in inspections and priority in examinations for quarantine , in order to assure support to construction .  
In early 1998 , the state made public the project to protect the natural forests along upper reaches of Chang Jiang by announcing that " not a single tree in natural forests can be cut down . "  Since then , the state has allocated one billion yuan every year to help transfer 200,000 woodcutters into forest protectors , and localities have recorded a yearly drop of several billion yuan in local revenues .  
They said they started the war to keep stable the Yugoslav Federation 's situation and to halt military conflicts and disputes , namely , with good intentions , but what followed was : The people were plunged into misery and suffering , the national economy fell back 20 years , and the natural environment and people 's lives were threatened by prolonged pollution from nuclear radiation and chemical and poisonous gases We can not help asking : Can a war solve any problem ? 
Wen Jiabao pointed out that the Huai He valley is in the hinterland of the motherland , covers a vast area , has rich natural resources , is in an advantageous location , has a dense population , is an important grain , cotton and energy base of our country , is an important hub of the railways and highways of our country , and takes up an extremely important position in the economic and social development of our country .  
Li Peng said : China similarly respects the general principle of the international community on human rights .  However , we feel that as countries have different social systems , economic conditions , historical backgrounds , cultural traditions , and religious beliefs , they do not share an identical understanding of human rights .  This is very natural .  
He said : There were both subjective and objective reasons for the backwardness of the western region , and it also involved problems in policy , work , and natural conditions ; furthermore , conditions in various parts of the western region vary , and new problems will arise after stepping up the effort at development .  The large-scale development of the western region is a massive , complicated project , which calls for long-term , arduous efforts by people in various circles .  
At present and for a time to come , it is necessary to speed up the progress of projects for dealing with water pollution and garbage in the dam area , vigorously carry out projects for natural forest protection , step up comprehensive measures to deal with soil erosion , develop ecological agriculture , and build the dam area into a new-style economic zone with flourishing economy , green hills and clear waters , and beautiful environment , where people are happy to live and work .  
Hu Jintao , member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee and vice president , stressed during a recent inspection trip in Tianjin : Strengthening the building of urban communities is a natural requirement of a well-coordinated economic and social development in cities ; and is also of a great significance to deepening reform , promoting the country 's economic growth , improving the quality of life for the masses , maintaining social stability , and consolidating the ruling position of our party .  
The Chinese people have generally practiced pacifism and have the thinking and natural instincts of assuming the defensive .  These are integrated with their strong traditional ideology of blood relationship and their special social crowd structure .  One of the results of this humane culture is that hegemonism which is aimed at invading other countries will be difficult to develop .  
In the formulation of urban and rural development plans , we must take into account the national economic and social development plan as well as the natural environment , resources , historical and present conditions and future development of various localities in drawing a comprehensive layout .  
However , Turkmenistan 's remaining recoverable natural gas reserves are approximately three trillion cubic meters , and its normal annual extraction volume is 50 to 60 billion cubic meters .  
In the next 10 years , it plans to increase the annual extraction volume to 120 billion cubic meters of which 100 billion cubic meters can be set aside for export .  So , with its natural gas reserves , it is capable of providing China with a sufficient natural gas supply which not only can guarantee the smooth implementation of China 's project " to transmit natural gas from the western part of the country to the east " but also can enhance the efficiency of the future natural gas pipeline cooperation .  
In the coming 10 years , Turkmenistan has planned to increase its annual output to 120 billion cubic meters , of which 100 billion cubic meters can be exported .  Turkmenistan has sufficient natural gas reserves to provide China with natural gas .  This not only guarantees the smooth implementation of the project to " send natural gas from the western region to the east , " but also can improve the efficiency in cooperation to lay pipelines in future .  
Both sides said they would give priority to developing new and high technology products , promoting the comprehensive development and utilization of energy and natural resources , and strengthening economic and technical cooperation in production and investment .  Through joint efforts , the two countries will turn the great potential of Sino-Russian cooperation into practical results .

Since tree growth is closely dependent on water and soil quality , acid rain was suspected to be the principle cause of sluggish forest growth and a major acid rain research effort was launched .  
This year local commodity prices , which caused enough complaint before , have been affected by a " bad year " in terms of both natural and man-made disasters . Since the middle of August when Typhoon Yancy struck , Taiwan has weathered typhoons Abe and Dot in quick succession , causing enormous losses in farm produce .  
For many Taiwan businessmen , these conditions are lax and lenient , not to mention such advantageous factors as the countries ' spacious living environment , their rich natural resources , temperate climate and relative proximity to Taiwan . According to a survey by the Institute of Ethnology at Academia Sinica , Australia now stands even with the United States as the most alluring land of milk and honey for potential emigrants from Taiwan , and New Zealand ranks number five .  
Brazil was an attractive enough place for immigrants then . With excellent public facilities , a free open economy and plentiful natural resources , it was a paradise offering unlimited opportunities for the immigrant with energy to spare . "  
Five years ago , a major battle was fought in the media between the natural ecology and communications construction . The result was that the " egg " ( the environment ) defeated the " stone . " The New Central Cross-Island Highway had originally been planned to cut across the Central Mountain Range to Yuli in Hualien . But because Yushan National Park was " a single man able to hold a narrow mountain pass against an army , " the plan was shrunk so that the road became the park 's " scenic highway . "  
Though studying this or that ever since I was a child , I maintained a playful attitude and was always looking for something to throw myself into with all my heart , " Tsai recalls . After a teacher discovered that he had natural talent for the high jump in junior high school , he began to compete . At one time he had the junior high school record in the event , and he was crowned district champion . " And so I started thinking my life would be in track and field , " he says .  
Chen Er-nan , a planner / designer at Hong Jian Industries , which accounts for half of the domestic market in man-made polyesters , says that natural silk is colder to the touch , that it is more rough and textured when rubbed , and that real silk lets air pass through , making it more comfortable to wear . Fake silk is warmer , and tends to be more smooth and shiny .  
The period of tsarist conservatism at the end of the nineteenth century emphasized study of the classics and intellectuals were not allowed to delve into the natural sciences . Because Moscow was far removed from the center of power - - then in St Petersburg - - it became the hotbed of developments in the natural sciences and established a solid scientific structure .  
It was not long before they came to accept this as natural - - if you wanted to get ahead then you had to actively take part in the League , national mass study organizations and social work . Moreover , there could be no questioning of communist thinking ; otherwise one would be seen as a rebel and expelled from the League , making further study impossible .  
A Young Forty : It 's a natural human instinct to love singing . Although some criticize Taiwan 's KTV culture as being vulgar , and there are even more people who loudly complain that you have to go to supplementary school even for karaoke , for the vast majority of those who love to sing , whatever the cost in time and money , it 's worth it for that moment of joy of singing a song well , and soaking up the sounds of applause .  
Even on clear days it is still a bit cloudy , and thus the Taiwanese downstream called it " the murky river . " But the natural color of the Lele River did not detract from its great beauty . The two rivers flowed between the grandiose mountains with a steady flow of water and abundant water resources as if to announce the eternity of nature . . . .  
It certainly was n't that the river lacked natural resources - - the middle and upstream stretches of the Lele abound in precious lumber , and the Taiwan Provincial Bureau of Mines discovered abundant deposits of white marble in Walami , along the middle stretches of the river . Thirteen companies applied to mine there and were itching to go .  
Casual and easygoing in real life , she came to the studio dressed in a house robe and slippers , just like the character she played , which was down-home , offbeat and outspoken . Even though hers was only a supporting role , her natural , unaffected style of acting won over audiences and made the show a hit , boosting her career to new heights .  
" Shuishalien : Originally the name of the local aboriginal tribes in the Puli - - sun Moon Lake area ; surrounded on four sides by mountains at an altitude of about 500 meters , it is the geographic center of Taiwan with many natural springs and a moderate climate ; the tea produced there has a unique flavor and its water is perfect for tea . "  
At a time of limitless expectations about a prosperous future , we have no way to avoid the heavy costs of technology : environmental pollution , the rapid depletion of natural resources , and even human vulgarity .  
They need more care : Of course , these children would n't need extra guidance if they did n't have problems . Every teacher is aware that very few children are able to make decisions of their own about their course in life . Assailed from every direction - - their natural talents , family environment , educational level , social status and so forth - - children who did n't have a very firm grasp on the tiller to begin with may easily wind up shaken and at a loss . "  
There is still much room for discussion about whether zoos should be closed , but those trying to maintain a little conventional dignity must be careful in censuring others as inhumane . Children may not be grateful to us for closing zoos , but if zoos use destroying the natural environment as an excuse to exist , then the next generation will be even less grateful , I 'm afraid !  
China 's ancient books have been through human and natural disasters with countless numbers having been destroyed and lost . There are no certain statistics concerning just how many still survive in the world today . Moreover , with there being much space for dispute over how antique works should be carefully determined and compared , it is even more difficult to put numbers on them .  
Besides the hardware and shape , traditional ho-yuan also extolled a natural , layered and shifting spacial notion . Could this be applied in a vital , living way to modern architecture ?  
The natural distribution of heavy metals has been disturbed and they have been dispersed from their originally secure ecological position . In the course of life and industrial production people lack any real sense of alarm about all this . With the failure to take precautions the situation has gradually become harder to contain .  
Water comes from heaven . " In agricultural societies , things which are filtered out with water are all organic matter that can be broken down and returned to the natural cycle . Thus , in several places in north Taiwan which are relatively short of water , the agricultural irrigation system and the town or village drainage system were linked together , so that water could be circulated and reused , thus saving water resources .  
The tropical climate of heavy rains and high temperatures typical of the Indochina Peninsula is a natural hothouse for banana growing . Vietnam 's land , ten times larger than Taiwan 's , provides broad spaces to roam , and Pan Viet chairman C . F . Chang moved quickly to seize the investment opportunity .  
In 1988 , which was the second year after Vietnam began to permit foreign investment , Chang came by himself to Ho Chi Minh City . Upon inspecting local conditions , he discovered that the natural surroundings in southern Vietnam closely approximate those in the banana growing areas of central and southern Taiwan .  
Besides the consideration of low land costs , the concept of " bringing Taiwan 's experience in agriculture together with Vietnam 's natural resources " is just right for what the Vietnamese government - - stuck with backward local production methods and an urgent need to close the gap between city and country - - wants and needs . It has thus won their strong support .  
Before the discovery of the microscope , and before " ecological observation " became popular , when our ancestors saw these insects emerge from soft earth and light up , they imagined that the firefly was a metamorphosis from rotting leaves or decaying bamboo . The saying , " On summer nights , rotting grass turns into fireflies , " was a natural result of observing transformations as the weather changed from season to season .  
Wang Chen-yi , secretary-general of the Association of Taiwanese Ballads , who has been to the mainland many times , contends that as ko-tzai-hsihas been developing for less than 100 years , it has the special characteristic of being thoroughly plain and simple . For example , singing is done in a natural voice , with the transitions gentle . Movements are smoother , more suave , closer to the style of southerners .  
What Lin calls " knowing the earth " involves becoming familiar with different geographical environments . High mountains , rivers and marine islands all have their different appearances and their own special types of plants and animals ; tropical , temperate and frigid zones have their own natural conditions that can not be confused .  
Since people 's environments ( both natural and social ) are extremely variegated and complex , preventing people from having firsthand knowledge of all of the people , matters and things in the world , sociologists have theorized that people by necessity simplify things , making people who share one characteristic - - such as old people or poor people conform to a single mold .  
Taoist doctrine was originally developed from the thinking of the Taoist masters . These masters actually preached passive inaction and following nature , but Taoist doctrine turned this basic naturalism into a different kind of reasoning which affirmed that various " natural " methods , such as alchemy and controlled breathing , could actually resist the limitations of nature and extend life without limitation .  
She is well aware that as an emigrant returning to her native land to work , although she has various natural advantages such as knowing English , making friends easily , and being more easily forgiven if she speaks out of line , on the other hand she has to become accustomed to things which other people are already used to , learn the demands of the local market , and overcome the difficulties of communicating in a language which she only half understands .  
But tidal land after all is n't like ordinary land . Although it escapes environmental protests and other social complications , there are a lot of " natural complications " that can arise by developing tidal lands : soft and muddy soil , erosion from the waves , climatic changes , and flooding . The difficulty of overcoming these challenges is no less than the other challenges on terra firma .  
Perhaps he concentrated too intently on the glottal , natural style of traditional singing . When receiving Western style vocal training at the Institute of Art , for a while Buhe could not sing at all . The contradictions made him ponder whether it was not impossible to express traditional songs using the abdominal singing techniques of the West .  
Early on in the era of Japanese occupation , Chihpen was an aboriginal dwelling place . The Japanese discovered , in the Chihpen stream between southern slopes of a mountain and the river bed , a natural hot spring , gushing out warm water . The water 's temperature was moderate ( between 45and 56 ) ; it had a dense concentration of hydrogen ions ( 7% to 8% ) . This was a very good spring , colorless , odorless , and only slightly salty .  
The cloud leopard 's den : Auvini 's work is multi-faceted , and it mainly involves publishing newspaper articles about his interviews and research , which focus on traditional customs , tribal history , myths , legends , taboos , etc . He has discovered rules that anthropologists overlooked governing how the Haocha people placed their dead in their own homes . For example , men who died from natural causes were buried in front of the central pillar , whereas women were placed beneath a platform by the window .  
Actually this is partly because since people feared vicious dogs , it was only natural for them to compare them jestingly with the even more ferocious tiger , as in this joke about an " illiterate dog " : In olden times legend had it that the written character for tiger , or the character for the tiger 's associated Earthly Branch yin , had the power to subdue a dog . There was once a dog which liked to bite people , and everyone was afraid of it and did not dare to pass it .  
The " seed bank , " which is seen by Horticulture Department researchers as " top secret , " is similar to any other greenhouse except that it has two locks on the door . Inside are collected 29 natural varieties of moth orchids ( there are a total of 45 natural varieties worldwide , with two native to Taiwan ) , as well as 837 improved strains .  
In the 1990s , the focus for travel is on " fresh and natural , nostalgic and nativist , fixed locations to pass a holiday . " Many new natural scenic spots , such as national parks and forest recreation areas have become the new darlings of the travelling population .  
Generally speaking , the local buildings are in fresh , bright colors , and the walls and masonry , set against the natural background of green and blue , are quite eye-catching .  
In the 1950s , Taiwan received a great deal of aspirations to escape from the post-war hardships and to catch up with advanced Western civilization , young artists organized the " Orient " and " May " art associations . These sought a liberation of images , and declared total war on traditional ink painting and on natural realism . They argued that art must inevitably progress from the concrete to the abstract ; in their view " abstract expressionism , " with only basic shapes and colors , was the only end point of artistic development .  
In recent years the many new galleries springing up in the south have stressed natural subject matter , and bright and intense colors , quite different from the cool style of northern Taiwan .  
Swatting a fly with a hammerThe ingredients for Chinese medicine are taken from the natural world , and are limited by such factors as geographical spread . Unlike the supply of Western medicine , which is determined by factory production , the supply for Chinese medicine is not stable . Supply problems for ingredients used in Chinese medicine are nothing new , but over several thousand years , numerous plants have been found to have similar effects to those in short store .  
His works are first baked unglazed at 1200 . Such a temperature is perfect for effecting a warm , smooth , touchable quality . lf the temperature were higher , the clay would be far too hard ; at a lower temperature , the clay would crumble . After his pottery is fired unglazed , it is smoked with firewood . Then he chooses a complementary material derived from a natural element , such as metal , wood , stone or glass ( representing water ) to combine with the pottery .  
From these everyday natural ingredients he completes a work of art . The hues of the glaze are restrained , serene and firm ; they are the colors of Lungteng Village , colors whose power pours forth from the inside , reflecting its master 's wild head of hair and spirited eyes . Earth and man draw near to each other !  
In a photograph , a concrete model animal , of a kind which can be seen anywhere in Taiwan , is pictured in the most natural , realistic style ; it looks so false - - and yet so real .  
Professor B . J . Habibie , Indonesia 's State Minister for Research and Technology , has said publicly : " At some stage Singapore , with its limited natural and human resources but rapid economic growth , is certain to reach a critical pressure , just like a balloon ; and Batam , 20km south of Singapore , is ready to catch the balloon which will be squeezed out of Singapore 's balloon . "  
The explanation is very simple : the ancients gathered their knowledge completely from nature ; they inferred a direct relation between the waxing and waning of the natural world and the birth and death of every human being . When would the fish swim up to the water 's surface through the broken ice ? When would the swallows arrive ? When would the crops bloom and wither ?  
Although Lisa studied opera with her mother and godfather , her mother discouraged her from seeking a career in the field , emphasizing that in addition to strict training , Peking opera singers also needed natural talent - - a sonorous voice , refined features and a strong and vigorous figure . "  
On the next outdoor shoot he was confronted with another group of indigenous people who were facing an even more pessimistic , miserable fate than the city 's construction site aborigines . They live in illegal buildings which are soon to be torn down . This time , he put aside his natural feelings of sympathy for his compatriots , and conducted his story carefully with a cool heart . Although still in a terrible mood , he shed no more tears .  
In an extreme example of the principle of natural selection , only the strongest could survive the journey home , thus maintaining the durability and health of the whole species . However , when the ice receded , many brook masu salmon were left stranded , unable to return to the sea . They had no choice but to become " landlocked " salmon .  
Previously salmon had taken advantage of different types of topography to adapt to natural disasters . Today there are no pools for them to escape to , and when heavy rains come the fish are washed downstream . No fish , no matter how strong , can overcome the meters-high dams to get back upstream , so they are left to die from the higher water temperatures downstream .  
In the earliest days , mankind 's power to fend off natural dangers was very weak , and people were terrified of the strength and ferocity of the tiger . This fear gave rise to respect , and a certain degree of mystification . The stone carvings and bronzeware of the Shang and Chou dynasties all emphasize the tiger 's sharp claws and fierce countenance . " At the dawn of civilization , this was humankind 's main impression of the tiger , " believes Lin Po-ting , curator of painting and calligraphy at the National Palace Museum .  
To make redbraised beef noodle soup , generally the meat is fried with chilli and broad bean paste , then simmered with such spicy and aromatic ingredients as chopped garlic , coriander and ginger . The strong flavor naturally tends to mask any rankness in the beef , but it also covers the meat 's own flavor . But a clear broth brings out the natural flavor of the beef , so the meat 's selection and preparation require particular care .  
Twelve years ago the first book in the ROC to promote ecological conservation , We Only Have One Earth , was published . From that time until today , a rich selection of publications focusing on the natural environment has been produced in Taiwan , following the progressive development of environmental consciousness here . Recently a publishing house has even been established specializing in books about nature .  
In response to the human culture and natural environment of the Lanyang Plain , Wang Chen-hua incorporated many features often seen in old Ilan houses into the Chung home , such as turtle-shell pattern windows , and openings in walls in the shape of peaches and pomegranates , which symbolize good fortune . To cope with the local climate of fierce sunshine and abundant rainfall , the roofs have very broad eaves . In the central courtyard one can watch the rain and listen to its melody .  
Another example is monitoring of changes in forested areas . Keeping up with destructive exploitation or natural disasters ( like forest fires ) by using traditional survey techniques is time-consuming yet not timely , because of the huge extent and frequent inaccessibility of forested land ( which is often concentrated in remote mountain areas with no roads ) . Satellite surveys , on the other hand , cover huge areas and can be collected regularly , making them an invaluable tool .  
In recent years , wild animals raised in captivity have been given more living space and more natural surroundings . Still , says Marcus Phipps of TRAFFIC , there are still some extremist animal rights groups overseas who wish to close all zoos and sea-world theme parks , with the goal of returning the animals to their natural habitats .  
The reason there is still such a dazzling array of species on Earth today , with all the " natural wonders " they display , is because since life took its first steps , animals have shown a resilient capacity to face the challenges of all kinds of environmental pressures , by every imaginable means . Although the process has been a bloody one in which many species have bowed out into history , new species have continuously stepped forward onto the stage .  
Whether in terms of their right to exist or their value to the ecosystem , an elephant and an ant are equal . From an evolutionary perspective , every wild species alive on Earth today is a repository of genes which have passed the test of natural selection . Only if " genetic diversity " is maintained can these genes come into play to respond to sudden changes in the environment .  
The panda , the focus of world attention , may have difficulties getting pregnant and generally weak propagation abilities , and its powers of adaption may have declined and its population aged ; but man , by threatening the bamboo forests and destroying its natural habitat so that it has less space to forage , is even more the cause of its demise . The Formosan landlocked salmon , regarded as a national treasure , lives only in the upper stretches of the Tachia River , where the temperature is low and water quality high .  
To implement conservation work , one subject must be selected as a first objective . The environmentalist community can deliberate for a lifetime , but the disappearance of animal species from the natural world is like a raging fire , and we must quickly throw the fire alarm . In the midst of all the rush , errors naturally occur . People should learn from mistakes and move ever closer to the ideal .  
One reason was because the discovery found its way into newspapers all over the world , and many people knew that now Puli had more than picturesque natural beauty and such special local products as rice noodles and shaoxing wine . The citizens of Puli also possessed a glorious treasure - - cultural property left behind by people of an age long passed .  
Anyone holding an outdoor activity in rainy northern Taiwan has to depend on fate to make any money . So the main reason for choosing Taoyuan for the inauguration was the venue 's special feature : The transparent " sky tent " that can keep out the elements while allowing natural sunlight in , thus insuring that the event would not be rained out or blown off course .  
Nevertheless , after modern obstetrics was developed , women 's birthing territory was moved from the home to the hospital . Those who assisted delivery changed from female midwives to OBG physicians , who are predominantly male . The natural process of birth also changed into a high-tech medical procedure .  
Wu Banghua expresses the view that although many researchers are applying themselves to analyzing the chemical structure or researching the physiological effects of substances from Taxus species , few are researching their botanical characteristics . However , " inappropriate exploitation of this valuable natural resource has already reduced the worldwide population reserves of Taxus species to very small numbers . "  
Seed boxes recreate the natural environment with artificial day and night and corresponding temperature changes , after which " winter " arrives , and the seeds are stored at low temperatures . The process can not be hurried , and it demands far more patience of the silviculturists than propagating the Taiwan red cypress or Taiwan cypress , whose seeds ' dormancy can be broken in a week or two given adequate water and light .  
With repeated visits came deepened understanding , more mutual trust , firm friendships all the more relished for their regular renewals . Gradually I find myself striving to take on more of the traits I admire among my friends in Yunnan-a warm view of hospitality , a greater appreciation of natural surroundings , a resilience to ill fortune and calamities beyond one 's control and more inclination to enjoy to the fullest the good times that inevitably follow .  
Former EPA director Jaw Shau-kong recently drew up a list of " seven major problems " behind the Shihmen Reservoir 's poor water quality and heavy silting . But only one-the adverse natural geology-is a " congenital defect . " The rest are all " acquired dysfunctions . "  
Chinese have long understood how to listen to the natural music of the soughing pines . This is especially so for those ancient literati who learned that it was their duty to serve their nation , but who could find no ruler who would listen to their criticisms of official corruption and inefficiency . Disappointed by the mundane world , these literati found in pines a salve , admiring how , even in the most remote places , they grew strong .  
But from the point of view of international goodwill and the natural reaction most people have toward anything nuclear , it might have been best to give more attention to the issues raised by concerned observers . For example , Michael Kau , a scholar at Brown University in the US , and Fang Chien , a well-known environmental activist , pointed out that no one wants nuclear waste in their back yard , and disregarding the sentiments of a neighbor does not conform to Chinese ethics .  
Porter pointed out that previous ideas about national power and competitive advantage focused on countries with vast territory and abundant natural resources , which ideally were backed up by military strength .  
Over the years the HUF has prepared guided introductions to six trails , with the most popular being the Chihshan Rock Trail in Shihlin , which combines natural scenery with Class Two historic cultural artifacts . And since Mayor Chen Shui-bian declared that this trail would be made part of the city 's high school entrance exams , many dedicated parents have come here to collect informa - tion for their kids .  
Five years ago , because he had to look after his children , he could not go too far from home , so he decided to embark on extended observation of a small , nameless earthen mountain next to the Wanfang residential development . He christened it " Little Green Mountain , " and produced a series of notes and articles describing the natural scenery and plant and animal life through the four seasons on the southern rim of the Taipei basin .  
For instance , the limitless rebirth of life forms exists within cultural change and natural cycles of waxing and waning and rising and falling . And I have connected the symbols and visual vocabulary employed in each of these twelve works to the twelve signs of the zodiac , which represent the rhythmic relationship between Heaven and Earth .  
According to his study of the subject , the patterns on Damascus swords are the natural crystal patterns formed when steel is cast , and those on Japanese swords are lines of temper color left by partial quenching of the blades . But the patterns on Chinese hundred-beaten steel are the grain patterns which result from repeated folding and hammering of the metal .  
On the maritime extreme of Europe , England had always been saturated by the arts of Italy and France . It was not easy to work out how to create a " natural garden " and it was hardly desirable to give half the credit to the far-away Chinese .  
In the 1720s Burlington 's garden became something that had never been seen before . Its eastern section was in the formal classical style , with three radiating shaded avenues leading in straight lines to classical monuments . In the western part , though , Kent had created an irregular natural style , with groups of small trees and winding paths !  
Their attack on the formal palace garden was used to express their discontent with tyranny . Yet the natural garden , established as it was on the ideal of liberty , could also be used as their safe retreat from the world .  
Vargas says that damage to the environment has awakened the consciousness of Costa Ricans , and there is a consensus to protect nature . In 1990 , after the government established a ministry for natural resources and the environment ( whose Spanish acronym is MINAE ) , 50,000 square kilometers of land-a full quarter of all remaining forest-was made into ten protected areas , and 24 national parks . More than 700 conservation officers do wildlife surveys and park protection on a full-time basis ( please see the accompanying article ) .  
In traditional thinking , the bearing and raising of children is a woman 's natural occupation . Most mothers give their all in caring for their husbands and raising their children . Even women who are gradually moving out of the house and into the working world do everything they can to meet the demands of both house and job .  
After the PPI mapped out hunting grounds , it was discovered that these covered less than one-fifth of Wutai Rural Township . Also , because of forbidding topography or traditional taboos , some untouched areas were left between the hunting grounds . This fits right in with theories of effective management of natural resources .  
" I hope in the future we can trek once per year , passing through traditional lands and places of historical importance , to understand how the West Rukai spread . We will also survey the natural resources . " Sasala says that elders told him many things he did not know-about things that happened long ago , and that place names were often derived from commonly used plants . Creating a foundation of shared knowledge among the generations marks the beginning of transmission of the tribal culture .  
An official at the Council of Agriculture , the governing body for wildlife protection , notes that " the Wildlife Conservation Law was targeted at the needs of a specific moment . All law is open to change , and in the future we might permit planned hunting , and also trade in game . " Today 's comprehensive ban on using natural resources does not meet the needs of the current environment , nor do the arguments behind the ban convince those worried about the survival of aboriginal culture .  
In the 1980s , among all the social movements , the environmental protection movement found the most resonance around the world . This , coupled with the rise of the aboriginal rights movement , caused environmentalists , in the wake of modern man 's overdevelopment of land , to begin to reexamine methods of living and urge a return to natural , simple lifestyles . As a result , the complete set of cultural ceremonies and behavior that aborigines have as a result of hunting have once again been embraced .  
Many scholars are happy to see that traditional Rukai tribal hunting is being allowed under resource-management controls in order to achieve sustainable economic use of natural resources . " Only when tribal people are economically independent can they rediscover their cultural identity , " they argue . " It 's a good way for them to regain their self-respect . "  
Every two years , Dr . Lai Chiu-nan , originator of the " total natural health " lifestyle , based on a " living foods " diet , comes to Taiwan to promote her method for maintaining a healthy body , mind and spirit . Her talks always draw thousands of people . In March of this year , she came to Taiwan again to hold a workshop , leading 600 people in physical and mental training in the mountains of Shuanghsi in Taipei County .  
As the southern weather turns hot and stuffy , the ducks , missing the spring breezes which they need for their breeding season , grow bored and their hormones subside . At the same time , spring is gradually spreading across the north , melting the Earth 's icy veil . With natural enemies there few in number but food plentiful , one after the other the ducks and geese start to return home .  
Wu Wu-tien says that by presenting only positive role models , current moral education deliberately obscures the darker side of life and the reasons for it . The theoretical background to this is a belief that children are not mature enough to make proper judgements . To prevent the " bad " element in children 's natural character being awakened and tempted , some people sincerely believe that " if one does n't let children come into contact with bad people and bad things , they will not turn bad . "  
Chien Chun-an notes that extramarital affairs entail enormous risks . A third party becomes involved in the family life of others , the people having the affair face a moral challenge , and after the most romantic initial stage passes , pressure grows to bring the affair to an end . Having chosen a path of love that is by nature misguided and tragic , it is natural that it leads to serious problems .  
This use of space not only lets in plenty of light , but also makes for good ventilation , because the sun shining into the central courtyard makes it warmer than the surrounding rooms and covered walkways , and so creates a natural flow of air which draws in a cooling breeze . This made the courtyard the perfect place for clan members to stay in friendly contact with each other : here the women cleaned the vegetables , made glutinous rice pastries and chatted about family affairs , and here the children did their homework and played .  
" I keep mulling over this thought : Has this natural , simple , non-calculating character of the common man been lost under the capitalist system with its private ownership of property ? When these three people begin to specialize , they will become more adept at running the restaurant and become more calculating . Will the three of them be as happy then as they are now ? "  
In the waters off Korea a Ming dynasty wreck has been found whose cargo of lacquer ware came up looking brand new after sitting at the bottom of the salty sea for 400 years . And an experiment with two pieces of iron exposed to aqua regia have shown that the lacquer-treated piece still looks as good as new when the untreated piece has wholly disintegrated . Hence , most of the tables in chemical laboratories are coated with this natural substance .  
Recently natural wild plants have become popular foods in Taiwan , and aboriginal edible plants have become well-known in the process . However , edible plants account for only one-quarter of the plants used in daily life in Taniao village . Besides the necessities ( food , shelter , clothing ) , plants are essential materials for a huge number of other uses-medicine , landmarks , all kinds of tools used for outdoor work , rope , packaging , sandpaper , and cloth .  
In particular , Daoists ' choice of places to identify as fairy grottoes , apart from being suitable places to refine elixirs in the hope of transcending death , also responded to the mood of the times and to practical needs . Hence rich , fertile soil suitable for growing rice , and locations out of reach of natural disasters and human wars and turmoil , became essential requirements for the blessed abodes .  
" When we look at things from the perspective of the fairy realm , that is to say on a large scale , the smaller scale of the mortal world becomes unimportant , " says Ke Ching-ming . He feels that imagining fairy realms is a way of observing the basic nature of the world from a unusual angle , in order to defuse problems . It provides a relativistic perspective , breaking down blind insistence on the absolute nature of values , and this enables humans to be more relaxed and natural in many ways .  
From Laozi it borrows the concepts of non-action , clear understanding , and acting in harmony with nature . From Zhuangzi come the concepts of total freedom and life-for-the-fun-of-it . Combining these concepts , religious Daoism holds that in order to become an immortal , one must be free of joy and anger , eliminate desire , live in quietude and non-action , maintain primitive simplicity , and act in harmony with the natural laws of the universe .  
It is precisely this use of synergistic combinations of natural substances-both from animals and plants-as opposed to the use of individually active chemical substances , " says Chang , who holds a doctorate in chemistry and is certified as a doctor of Chinese medicine . If only individual active components from herbal medicines are extracted and used , then the special synergistic character of herbal medicines will be lost .  
" In researching Chinese medicine , both developing new medicines and respecting the ancient Chinese medical principles are essential , " argues Chen Chieh-pu . Synthesizing chemical components or extracting new drugs from natural herbal , mineral or animal substances has long been an important process in mainstream medicine . Quinine , which is used to treat malaria ; the cardiotonic rehmannin ; the painkiller morphine ; and antibiotics , which are widely used and have saved so many ; were all discovered in natural herbal medicines or fungi .  
" Maybe the conditions for seed germination are very specific and furthermore , they are unknown , " says Jose Luis Leon de la Luz , a botanist affiliated with the CIB . No matter how the plant manages to pass through the eons , its natural proliferation is not sufficient to sustain massive cutting for a hungry market . One fact should be borne in mind : If damiana products are to be used in large quantities , damiana plants should be plentiful .  
Although investigation of the relationship between climate and infectious diseases is still at a preliminary stage , excessive human development of jungles and rainforests has increased people 's chances of coming into contact with the microorganisms which live there , and with their natural hosts .  
In fact , some experts feel that since most enterovirus cases in Taiwan are in rural areas , it is still the result of poor hygiene . Nonetheless , it is also true that children today live too cleanly : they lack natural sources of infection in their environment , so that when they do meet with a virus they are quite unable to fend it off .  
" We ca n't know if this was right or not , " admits Wu Tsung-neng . No one knows if the slowing of the epidemic was due to human effort or was a natural trend . However , from the fact that over the same time period other communicable diseases also were reduced , it can be assumed that the preventive measures taken against the enterovirus were effective .  
There are many different kinds of oolong tea , including lightly cured Shanlin River high mountain , medium-fired smokey dongding , Ali Mountain variety , and even yancha ( dried , then set aside for five years , then cured the traditional way , over a charcoal fire-as opposed to the modern methods of natural gas flame or electric heat curing ) . There are also all manner of aromas-dark , robust or sweet-and of flavors . The variety of grades of Taiwan oolong shows how far its manufacture has progressed .  
But in natural forests , every creature has its natural enemies , and the insect fungus Beauveria bassiana and parasitic flies are ready and waiting for M . basalis pryeri . Furthermore , in the wild the inchworms prefer trees over two meters tall , and by the time trees have reached this size they are strong enough for a few caterpillars not to pose them any threat .  
" Her paintings amalgamate various techniques , including glue-and-color-on-silk and water-and-ink . On the surface is the coordination of realism , symbolism and surrealism , reflecting a sort of natural , balanced and fresh effect , attained after traditional art has been baptized by modern civilization , " opines art critic Huang Hsiao-shih .  
" Actually , controlling aging does n't mean rejecting aging . It means healthy , successful aging . " Dr . Wang says , " Aging is a natural , gradual , lifelong process . It is not the complete loss of one 's health and beauty within a very short period .  
Banded coral shrimp , known in the Far East as " cherry blossom shrimp " for their bright pink color , breed only in Japan 's Surugawan Bay and in the sea off Tungkang , Taiwan . Because the Japanese regard these shrimp , which are rich in calcium and phosphorus , as a natural national treasure , the Taiwanese have started to catch them as well .  
For instance , the subsided coast of northern Taiwan is studded with beautiful eroded bays and promontories ; the sandy and muddy coast of the western alluvial plain is rich in human culture and is a paradise for migratory birds , a place where they can rest and feed as they pass through on their southward and northward journeys ; the coral reefs of the south coast are a rare natural treasure ; and the eroded escarpments of Taiwan 's east coast bear witness to the tectonic movements which have shaped our island over millions of years .  
But over recent years , in the pursuit of economic growth , Taiwan has heavily exploited its natural resources . For example , coastal land reclamation and the development of new industrial zones have destroyed valuable wetlands , and when the wetlands are lost the birds ' paradise is lost with them .  
And taiji means " the natural way " - standing erect and centered , being impartial and unbiased , neither lacking nor in excess , adhering to one position-in other words the way of the natural world , and the way of the human being . Or in short : moral cultivation , the very purpose of human life .  
Beginning in 2001 , English will become a required course in elementary schools . " Now the English parts of both the college and high-school joint entrance exams are growing trickier . Whether one is talking about written tests or oral tests , they both require excellent English , " says Chang Yu-heng senior staff editor for Landmark English . It 's only natural that students need English magazines to bolster their efforts to learn the language .  
Written as a conversation among three people , in poking fun at the nobility and the emperor who spent all day hunting rather than in affairs of state , it also depicted a vast and colorful world : Sima exhausted his imagination to describe natural wonders , strange creatures and bizarre plants , presenting a dazzling and awesome spectacle .  
During the time of Fan Kuan , artists were neither too close nor too estranged from nature . They neither made dull and painstaking objective facsimiles of the natural world , nor showered their work with their own subjective feelings . Cun and dian brushwork , which were born out of naturalism , would-after Fan Kuan 's day-be employed in works that were more and more subjective and abstract .  
In China , a country founded on farming , there has always been a tangible link between seasonal changes and the pattern of agricultural production . As this link was absorbed into people 's lives it gave rise to the rituals of rural existence , the most prominent of which marked the conclusion of the natural cycle at the end of every year . Thus New Year became the most important of all traditional festivals , symbolizing endless rebirth and the continuation of the natural cycle .  
Besides her natural vocal quality , the key to A-Mei 's success has been that her songs reflect feelings and aspirations of her era . In fact , when you look back at the history of popular cultural interchange between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait , all the most successful singers and hit songs have been connected in some way to the hopes and feelings of the times .  
Nevertheless , it was hard to resist . Souls locked up for the decade of the Cultural Revolution had lost interest in so-called revolutionary songs that " put politics in command . " Some mainland Chinese with overseas connections brought Teresa Teng 's music into the PRC . Her delicate and warm voice radiated feelings of intimacy , love , and nostalgia , touching the natural feelings that had been suppressed for so long .  
The straightforward , confident , and unrestrained A-Mei has made quite a splash in the Chinese-speaking world . Perhaps it is not surprising that someone with such a distinctive personality would elicit strong feelings both positive and negative . Wang Dong is not alone in his views , for many in the mainland have asked how long A-Mei will continue her spectacular run of success . Hopefully she will always " speak " straight from the heart , and can keep that natural verve that set her apart from the crowd in the first place .  
I do n't have any plans to pose for a racy photo album . If I were in a movie and they wanted me to do a scene in the nude , it would n't be a problem . But I do n't think that a photo album would a way to express the ideal of male beauty . Maybe the Japanese pop idol Miyazawa Rie can express her own pure esthetic appeal through a photo album , but for a man to convey that kind of natural feeling through still photos is not an easy thing .  
" Palliative care , " or " natural death , " as it is often referred to , means that in accordance with a patient 's expressed free will , medical staff will refrain from using cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) , artificial respirators , heart stimulants and other invasive medical technologies to prolong the dying process of patients with untreatable conditions .  
Whenever some people get ahead , others will follow , and no amount of calls for simpler lifestyles or new value systems can stop them . The reason is very simple . " The money management fever is a natural product of changing times . " According to Liu , individualism and the rise of urban commercial society have broken down the support networks of traditional agricultural society .  
They often pop up in rice paddies , and the toad-which because of the keratinization of its skin is at home away from the water-is also a frequent visitor to inhabited areas . But other species are confined to specific areas or are only active in particular seasons . So unless you traipse across countless rivers and endless mountains , you are n't likely to ever see them in their natural state .  
Furthermore , the Kuroshio current and the mainland coastal current converge here , the upwelling current off Taiwan 's eastern rift valley brings up organic salts from the ocean depths , and a seabed valley forms a natural barrier . Under these conditions , many organisms have developed into unique species , and the sea off Ilan contains a cornucopia of marine life .  
" Crab doctor " Wu Shu-he , who is cooperating with the museum on a research project , explains why its specimens have attracted so much attention . In the three to four centuries since natural history museums were first established , there were no significant advances in the preparation of crustacean specimens . The pigments responsible for crabs ' coloration are not very stable , and the preservatives usually used have a corrosive effect . Thus prepared crab specimens generally look as if they have been boiled .  
The book is filled with conflict between old and new values . As Chu explains : " If we take the status of the ' desolate man ' - a homosexual role-as a metaphor , it hints that if a culture has already developed to the point where people do not want to reproduce , to create a next generation , sex becomes elevated to an end in itself , and the natural drive to reproduce becomes expended in sexual consumption , in pursuit of sensual extremes . . . .  
Holding that meditation will , along with natural science and behavioral science , emerge as one of the three most important educational disciplines , WLEF has designed a Zen leadership program that emphasizes state of mind . Students are encouraged to probe their inner selves during moments of solitude and thereby cultivate self-discipline , increase their wisdom and potential , and improve their physical endurance and ability to handle pressure . They learn both how to get involved in the world and how to morally transcend it .  
Yeh Wen-chi emphasizes that the natural history of each dragonfly species is unique , and it is hard to generalize . For instance , the protected giant spiketail only breeds once in three years . It does not fit the general pattern of insects which live fleeting lives and may produce several generations a year .  
The devastating 21 September earthquake of 1999 left Taiwan 's landscape covered in scars , but researchers discovered that the places least damaged by the quake were areas of natural forest . In mountain regions where the rainfall is most abundant , the geology most fragile and erosive forces most powerful , the false cypresses , with their massive trunks and mighty root systems , cling tightly to the frail earth .  
Large-scale logging of false cypresses continued right up to 1989 . With forestry earning no profits , and in response to energetic lobbying by civic groups , the Executive Yuan finally banned the cutting of natural forests , at last giving a respite to the giant trees which protect Taiwan 's land .  
Says Lin , " Because of the way the pieces are selected and the fact that most online readers are students , almost all the online works that get published in book format offer very realistic descriptions of school romance . I think these novels give young authors a chance to achieve a sense of closure in real-life romances gone wrong , and to use their experiences as a source of creative energy . " Lin feels that the popularity of such works is natural , since both the authors and readers are everyday people .  
But just as with other natural resources , the greatest microbiological riches are concentrated in developing countries , and these poor countries do not have the means to screen their own resources and develop useful biological agents . But the major pharmaceutical companies of Europe and North America have long been gathering rich pickings from these countries , by collecting large quantities of soil , humus and plant samples to use in the search for new drugs . This has brought them substantial profits , but in the past the countries owning the resources benefited little .  
Kuanshan Township is located in Taitung County , in the flat bottom of the East Longitudinal Valley . The Hsinwulu River runs through the township , and there are high mountains to either side . The majority of the residents are involved in farming , in particular growing Kuanshan rice , which is especially tasty because of the pristine local water . Such industrial activity as there is is of a low-polluting kind , allowing Kuanshan to retain its good natural environment .  
In addition to plentiful sunshine and ample rains , the area abounds in natural resources . It is also a virtual second home to many species of migratory bird . Throughout its history-from its aboriginal days as Orchid Village , to its Qing dynasty incarnation as Hengchun ( " Eternal Spring " ) , and even to its present form , complete with national parks and farms providing tourist accommodations-Heng-chun has always pricked the interest of visitors .  
Fully grown maroon orioles are fierce birds with few natural enemies , and they generally feed in mixed flocks with other bird species . But in the breeding season their chicks are much coveted by snakes , squirrels , crows and sparrowhawks , and an attack will often prompt the sensitive parent birds to abandon the nest they have built .  
The growing importance attached to the practical application of college courses has also spread to colleges of foreign languages and natural science , where academic research has traditionally been a priority . This is particularly the case among technical colleges and universities that have been upgraded or newly established during the past decade , where the word " applied " appears in the title of virtually every course and where the teaching approach differs from that of the more traditional universities .  
Beijing 's grand scale is truly dumbfounding . The speed of its coming economic growth poses challenges to its water and power supplies , air quality , and natural environment , as well as the well-being of its ancient buildings and cultural artifacts , which date back thousands of years .  
Liu Chia-lang , head of the office of civil affairs , also has strong feelings on the future of development and industry in Tungkang : " Only Japan and Tungkang produce banded coral shrimp , which is one of the main seafood products of the town . And Tapeng Bay abounds in natural resources . Tungkang has what it takes to develop . But Taiwan 's entry into the WTO is going to be a heavy blow to Tungkang 's fishing industry . "  
He filmed 20 60-minute tapes and produced the first edited version of the documentary , which was full of sadness . Laway admits his own mood made it difficult for him to get past tragic facts : " Afterwards , I realized this is not the natural temperament of the Amis people , so I re-edited it , creating this more optimistic version . " Laway immediately took the finished product to share with the Amis of Talu-an .  
Huang Yi-nung asserts , " Our astronomers were first-rate observers , and they had an encyclopedic mastery of the natural sciences , social sciences , and humanities . " Huang notes that astronomy is a comprehensive science that is intimately connected with our lives and , as such , is not separate from nature as a whole . Zhang Heng is also noted for inventing the world 's first seismic detector , and was an accomplished painter and writer .  
When applied to oceanography , the natural sound waves produced by the wind and currents create ambient noise , which is comparable to ambient light . An underwater target will perturb this ambient noise to produce " noisy " signals , just as ambient light reflects off objects in a room . Even though the ambient noise does not come from a specific source as in conventional sonar imaging , it can still " illuminate " objects .  
But Liu 's father by no means encouraged Arthur to go into this field , and so he studied agricultural chemistry at National Taiwan University . But it proved impossible to resist his natural inclinations , and he ended up in the broadcast world anyway . Liu attended National Taiwan Normal University Affiliated High School , which had a relatively lively , open atmosphere .  
" The natural environment is always changing . Even if the number of monkeys has been increasing in the short term , there are so many uncertain factors that it is very hard to say that their populations will grow in the long term . " Wu Hai-yin is the first biologist to have written a doctoral thesis about Formosan rock monkeys .  
Residents , on the other hand , want a casino . But , casino or no , Hsiao Liuchiu is already rich in natural assets . It is a coral island surrounded by azure seas and possessed of sparkling beaches , all of which are potential tourist attractions .  
This was the observation of Tsai Hsin-hsin , executive director of the Liao Chiung-chih Taiwanese Opera Foundation . According to Tsai , mainland Chinese actors alternate between falsetto and their natural register . They incorporate various techniques from Peking Opera and Western opera . The mainland Chinese vocal and acting styles are very standardized .  
But what many people do not know is that in 1941 Kukeng experienced another major earthquake , which struck the Chiayi-Tainan area . The western face of a 1200-meter high mountain collapsed and fell into the Chingshui River . It formed a natural dam 100 meters high , and created a new lake , Lake Tsaoling , with a volume of 12.86 million cubic meters .  
Looking out from Tachien Peak ( the " great peak " mentioned in the rural township song ) , you discover your field of vision dominated by a sheet of green formed by natural vegetation as well as cultivated betelnut , and tea trees . In addition , after the 921 earthquake , layer upon layer of fossilized marine life , dating back 150 million years , has resurfaced . When you add to this the local sedimentary rock , it is clear that the Huashan area is rich in interesting topography .  
" Huashan lies at the juncture of the Philippine tectonic plate and the Eurasian plate . After serious earthquakes , the crust is loosened and altered , and the topography shows very obvious changes , " says Chiu Tsun-lung , director of the " Lake Bottom Culture Association , " and now a member of the 921 community reconstruction committee . He says that Huashan also has a rich cultural atmosphere . The historic artifacts left behind by pioneers combined with the natural environment provide valuable resources for " mountain education " in Taiwan .  
Early flowering seasons in Yang - mingshan , mullet failing to swim south after the winter solstice , dengue fever crossing the Tropic of Cancer , unusual butterfly migrations , coral bleaching . . . . Global warming is blamed for rising sea levels , freak weather and frequent floods , but is it also responsible for some of the unusual phenomena in Taiwan 's natural world in recent years ?  
Two years back Taiwan experienced a major earthquake . Last year there were landslides and massive flooding here , and also the horrific 911 incident in New York . And most recently Taiwan has faced a drought . Some of these are natural disasters , some are man-made , and some are natural disasters made worse by human action .  
It was n't until consumption reached 150% of replacement levels in May that it finally issued a completely unexpected warning . Part of the problem is that three of Taiwan Power 's liquefied natural gas storage tanks have never been put into use because of technological defects unresolved by their Japanese contractor . The power shortage has also led to widespread suspicions that Taiwan Power is technologically inept and unable to handle crises . As a result , its chairman Lin Wen-yuan tendered his resignation .  
In 1972 , UNESCO , considering the damage that war , natural disasters , and industrial development have been doing to precious cultural and natural assets , adopted the " Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage . " This set out rigorous and comprehensive conditions for determining what places are qualified to be deemed World Heritage sites ; it also encouraged signatories to apply to have the assets within their territories that are " of outstanding universal value " included on the World Heritage list .  
" The false cypress forests that survive in this mountainous island with its wet maritime climate are rare relics of an ancient forest type that today only remains in parts of East Asia and North America . It well deserves to be called a world-class natural heritage site , not just a national one . " This is how the Ilan County Cultural Affairs Bureau 's brochure confidently describes the Chilan cypress forest .  
By 1989 , when the Executive Yuan ordered a ban on further logging of natural forests , only isolated patches were left of the great swathe of 20 million gigantic yellow and red cypress trees that once stretched the length and breadth of Taiwan . The yellow cypresses of Mt . Chilan in Ilan County form one of the last remaining relatively untouched forests of giant trees in Taiwan .  
" The growth of the false cypress forests represents a process of stabilization of the rolling mountain rivers . The false cypress trees are the living deities of the process of natural restoration of the land , " writes Chen Yu-feng in his book The Flora of Taiwan . In particular , the medium-elevation cloud forests are unstable zones of heavy rainfall and powerful erosion , and when mighty false cypress trees spring up along the lines of collapse they mend the gashes in the forest and bring new life to the broken ground .  
The false cypress forests which bear the heavy responsibility of stabilizing Taiwan 's fragmented earth , also form a safety valve for the Shihmen Reservoir , Tanshui River and Lanyang River on which the people of northern Taiwan depend for their drinking water . The band of cypress forest that runs from Mt . Chilan to Mt . Lala forms a huge natural reservoir that soaks up heavy rainfall and releases it in gentler flows while keeping the soil firmly in its grasp , in a way that no human engineering project could replicate .  
Unlike the austere limestone topology surrounding Mayan settlements in Mexico , many of the Mayan remains in Guatemala are buried within lush tropical forests . Mayan culture fused human culture with the natural environment , achieving tremendous prosperity that can be seen today in the remains of colossal pyramids , temples , sport arenas , and in the network of roads that connected them all . These achievements reflect the golden age of Mayan Culture .  
" She successfully captured the mysteriousness of weird folk tales , and threw in a lot of stuff about ghosts-Ghost Festival ceremonies , the wandering of lonely ghosts without living descendants , and the mischief committed by evil spirits , " writes the critic Wen Tien-hsiang . " She showed how a small boy would identify with his grandmother and all the traditions and tolerance that she symbolizes , and from there went on to develop an atmosphere of equality and mutual respect between the natural and the supernatural , and between the living and ghosts .  
At a symposium on the control of environmental hormones held in April , Professor Liu Li-lian , director of the Institute of Marine Biology at National Sun Yat-sen University in Kaohsiung , described the results of a coastal survey in southern Taiwan . The natural ratio of males to females in oyster drills is about one to one , " so when I noticed that the Thais clavigera we were catching had all turned male , I knew something was wrong , " said Liu with alarm .  
The applications for refined CHM can be extended considerably . Already a number of manufacturers in Taiwan are adding raw materials from Kingstone to all kinds of products , including yogurt and ice cream . These raw materials can also be put to use in natural colorings and flavorings , edible fibers , cosmetic masks , bandages , and more . These uses are already common overseas , with the production value of such products increasing year in and year out , but in Taiwan there is still vast room for R &amp; D and promotion .  
Ku enthusiastically consults with people from all areas , and has done his utmost to assist domestic research in fields related to welding . Ku also contributes by " resuscitating " expensive machinery damaged by human errors or natural disasters , thus helping industry and educational institutions reduce the massive financial losses that can result from such events . While his work has guaranteed that machinery works , he has helped even more people by passing the torch of his knowledge on to his students .  
There are records of the medicinal uses of alcohol in China even on ancient tortoise shells dating back to the Shang and Zhou dynasties . " Alcohol is a good natural solvent , enabling one to get a higher proportion of the therapeutic content out of the raw materials of Chinese medicine , " Chen Chun-che says .  
Everyone is connected to their family and the caring between two generations is natural . The givers now will one day receive . This kind of filial piety , which is built around basic feelings of human nature , is not exclusive to Chinese society . Yeh Kuang-hui , who is still researching the topic of filial piety , has lots of friends doing research on this subject in the United States and Australia .  
Lin Ku-fang , director of the graduate institute of arts at Fo Guang University , makes the point that using one 's mother tongue springs from a natural emotional link to a locality and its history . It should n't be blown up out of proportion , and there is no need for special classes to teach it . Others have questioned whether local language education has turned into an ideological tool utilized by the state , and suggested that in the long run its use as a political tool will undermine the learning of local languages .  
For one thing , he says , the raw material for lacquer ware is made from the sap of any of various species of lacquer tree and is poisonous in its natural form . Contact with the skin or ingestion will , in mild cases , cause swelling and extreme itchiness of the arms . Persons with a low tolerance level will experience general swelling and suffer from symptoms akin to poison ivy . If scratching leads to infection , the victim will puff up all over like a big balloon .  
While the raw lacquer is toxic , once it dries it is insoluble to all chemicals ; and its toxins are trapped inside . Thus there are no health worries , and lacquer ware is impervious to humidity , heat , acids , and alkalis . It is a natural insulator , and remains perfectly preserved even when buried underground for ages . Few other art objects can compare .  
Chen says that in Guangdong , where strict quarantine measures have not been taken and public health resources are inadequate , the epidemic has apparently begun to naturally slow down on its own . Does this mean that most people have been mildly infected and their bodies have produced antibodies , so that the virus can not find any " fresh " victims without natural defenses , and therefore is retiring from the field ?  
Thus by the second half of the twentieth century , thanks to an apparently invincible medical science , humanity seemed to have become the absolute master of the natural world . So much so , that it began to let down its guard against viral disease-until 1981 .  
My point is that the word " modern " is used in opposition to the classical period in the West . It has arisen as a natural continuation of the trajectory of Western culture . Because Western cultured is the world 's dominant culture , many non-Western cultures have adopted Western concepts regarding modernity while forgetting that our own cultural milieus are not completely the same as that of the West . Modern artists often treat Western ideas as if they were universal in their application , which is very dangerous .  
Like many Taiwanese agricultural towns , Kungkuan has an excellent natural endowment but has struggled to remain competitive and has lost many of its young people to jobs in urban areas . Agriculture and the once vigorous ceramics industry have been greatly weakened .  
Chu Ching-i , a scholar at Academia Sinica , thinks that a child should not be forced to enter brutally competitive streaming before he has an understanding of his own subjective , natural disposition and objective , outside choices . Only by experiencing culture as far as possible in all its facets and richness can a student discover his own real interests and talents-and then make his own decisions .  
" It 's the plainness of rice straw that attracts people to it , " says Kao Hsi-lin . " It gives rise to a desire for a natural , rustic life . " Kao is a vibrant man who builds installations , paints and studies creative media . After several years spent working on community building , he is now giving new life to rice straw , a material that the people of Jenju had previously thought of as a waste product .  
Lin Chin-chu explains that some people in the area want to develop hot springs along the river , but often when hot springs areas are developed , large financial groups rush in and the tribal peoples lose control . As a result , not only do local people not reap benefits , but in the process the natural environment on which they depend for their living is damaged .  
Most people feel that they have to dress up to enjoy art in traditional municipal galleries , and they have to make a special trip to get to them . But railroad art centers are bustling with life and allow people to experience cultural and artistic events in a natural and unplanned way . Art has been confined to museums and temples for too long : let it hop on a train and be carried from station to station around Taiwan !  
In 1994 , led by teachers Lu Hung-wen and Huang Kuei-kuan , a group of students from the Peitou Elementary School investigated the natural resources of their local area . They sought out documented information on the " Peitou Hot Springs Public Baths , " which have close ties with the development of Peitou itself . From this information , they discovered that the long-forgotten , overgrown , and run-down " haunted house " was in fact the site of that very same pool complex , Southeast Asia 's largest and most luxurious public pool in its day .  
" These women and children have no support at all from friends or the bride 's family . When they run into problems they are lost , " says Sister Therese Tang , executive director of the Good Shepherd Sisters Social Welfare Services Foundation . The language barrier often means they have no clue about how to seek help , to the point where they even accept violence as a natural part of their daily life , as their unalterable fate . This is the reason foreign brides suffer a high level of domestic violence .  
When combined with the growing leisure farming industry , this restoration takes on even more importance . All along the 9.6-kilometer Niutou-Sanhsing section of the Taipingshan railroad , a variety of beautiful natural vistas greet the eye-soaring mountains , creeks and valleys , fields , villages , and small towns . All this has great tourism potential , and aside from spurring the growth of peripheral industries such as accommodation and food service , it also has a great historical importance .  
With its beautiful natural scenery , Ilan County has a strong environmental consciousness . As early as 1977 , the county began experimenting with and promoting the recycling of kitchen waste . Natural Environmental Protection Foundation chairperson Liu Shu-hui and National Ilan Institute of Technology jointly developed a simple composting method suitable for use by families and neighborhoods .  
The completion of National Highway No . 3 bears witness to tremendous changes in Taiwan . During the period of its construction , the island experienced rapid economic , social and political changes , and the heroes who built the road had to face a host of challenges , including waves of citizens ' protests , meddling from elected officials and organized crime , and investigations by judicial agencies , as well as natural disasters such as the 921 earthquake . The difficulties of construction included record-setting bridges , tunnels and challenges of all kinds .  
Rising almost 4000 meters above sea level , Yushan is not only the tallest peak on Taiwan , it is also the source of the three major river systems that provide water for the island , has the most intact ecological system , verdant forests , varied flowers and fauna plus the nearby historical relics of Patungkuan and the rich cultural history of the Aborigines . " It is natural that this area is a topographical symbol of Taiwanese identity , just like Mt . Fuji in Japan or the Alps in Switzerland , " says Professor Tai .  
There is something dramatic about Wu 's fascination with butterflies : he was born with red-green color blindness , but is besotted with lovely butterflies of every color . Like a deaf musician , Wu arouses a natural curiosity in people who wonder whether the world he sees can really be as beautiful as theirs .  
The writer Chen Fang-ming lauds The Butterfly Trail for " saying a great deal by examining the small . " According to Chen , Wu 's meticulous and profound exploration of the world of butterflies draws on encyclopedic knowledge and the most authoritative texts . As it shuttles back and forth , Wu 's narrative is always illuminating , and enables his readers to accompany him as he discovers natural history and experiences a rich and strange universe .  
Wu Se-hwa states that capital for cultural creative industries includes the following : copyrighted music , literature , fine arts and animation ; locations that can serve as the background for creativity , such as historic sites and natural scenery ; creative talent ; and language or customs that reveal the special flavor of an area .  
The mountain Karen still make a living through such traditional methods as swidden farming , fishing , hunting and gathering , working hard to eke out an existence each and every day . However , as their numbers have increased , the limited availability of agricultural land and the impact of modernization and natural disasters have meant that they now lack adequate resources to meet their daily subsistence needs , and have been reduced to penury and perpetual shortage .  
Since the 1990s ecotourism has exploded , especially in developing nations in Latin America , Africa and Asia where there are rain forests . These nations have established numerous nature preserves and national parks , and their outstanding natural resources and unique cultures have attracted growing numbers of tourists from the developed world .  
" To get that outside money , they accommodated more and more tourists , ripping up the mountains to lay large parking lots , trails and pavilions , " says Lai Peng-chih , who previously served as secretary-general of the Taiwan Ecotourism Association . " They replaced their original structures built out of natural materials with concrete buildings . " This development had a major impact on the environment , Lai says , disturbing the growth of plants and animals .  
Furthermore , modern people may lack ecological and environmental knowledge . Or they may know that natural resources are limited and that biodiversity is important , but be unable to refuse materialistic temptations , lack the time to recycle , and be powerless to refuse their children 's requests for the fashionable pet of the moment . More knowledge does not necessarily help in easing environmental deterioration .  
Now , that land is more than just a " natural classroom " for the 11 classes on ecology , flora , and fauna at the college ; it 's also been opened to the public , becoming a well known place for the people of Yungho and Chungho-particularly local elementary and junior high school kids-to come and get in touch with nature . The college also trains volunteer guides for the garden to meet the huge demand from the local community to visit it .  
The thrifty gene theory hypothesizes that because of harsh living conditions in Asian countries during ancient times , individuals with a genetic endowment that enabled them to more efficiently store fat as a hedge against times when food was scarce were more likely to survive the natural selection process to reproduce . Now , though the environment has improved and food is no longer difficult to obtain , the thrifty gene continues to exert its effect , with the result that the person easily accumulates body fat and becomes obese-an important risk factor for diabetes .  
They noted : " Two successive years of poor harvests brought about by natural calamities , coupled with economic crises and the disrupted farming in some areas , have reduced the food production and supply in this region , resulting in one of the gravest agricultural disasters in a decade in southern Africa . "  
Helanshan Mountain , extending more than 250 kilometers to the north and south , is situated in the border area of Ningxia and Inner Mongolia , two large autonomous regions .  It is an important natural and geographical border , a water resource conservation forest and a natural ecological defense for the attacks of Tenggeli desert and Siberia cold wave .  
Mt . Helan , stretching 250 kilometers from south to north and located between Ningxia and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Regions , is the most important geographic line and water conservation forest region in China 's western areas .  It is also a natural ecological fence to prevent the eastward encroachment of Tengger Desert and the cold waves from Siberia .  
The Helan Mountain Range , about 250 kilometers long , extends from south to north along the common border of Ningxia and Inner Mongolia . It is an important natural geographical demarcation line in northwestern China as well as a water conservatory forest area .  The mountain range is also a natural protective shield , which stops the Tenger desert from expanding to the east and the inroad of Siberian cold current .  
Mt . Helan , stretching more than 250 km from south to north , is situated on the juncture of Ningxia and the Inner Mongolia , the two large autonomous regions .  An important natural geographical boundary as well as home of water-source nourished forests in western China , it also serves as a natural shield against the eastern invasion of Tengeli Desert and the onset of the Siberian cold current .  
The Sudan has very favourable natural conditions for its economic development , Qian said adding that in developing economy , a peaceful international environment and a stable domestic political order are very important  
The Asia Pacific region is densely populated , is rich in natural resources , and has rapid economic development At the same time , the area is susceptible to natural disasters due to its complex geological structure and abrupt geological movement It is hit frequently by volcanic eruptions , oceanic forces , and earthquakes  
noting that russia is rich in natural and human resources , li said he believed that the russian people will overcome the temporary difficulties china wishes to see a stable russia with a growing economy , he added  
despite a busy daily schedule for him at the party central committee secretariat , wen jiabao has retained a strong interest in natural sciences and economic matters , following developments closely , collecting relevant data and producing analytical reports  
Income adjusted for changes in national wealth is defined as national income minus the interest cost of investments needed to replace capital assets damaged or lost as a result of natural or man-made disasters .  
Despite the presence of rich natural resources , Africa 's chief attraction , the continent 's slow economic growth , which remains well below the average for all developing countries , offsets even this considerable advantage .  
The root causes of population movements and refugee flows continued to be both natural and man-made , with combinations of political , military , economic , climatic and environmental factors varying from situation to situation .  
One of the main endeavours of the least developed countries is to achieve an optimum balance between human needs and the natural resources base in order to maximize their ability to meet these demands on a sustainable basis .  
The cumulative effects of natural disasters , civil war and economic crisis have made the situation untenable and thus made Nicaragua a deserving candidate for concerted international support and assistance .  
The recent dramatic increase in natural and man-made disasters and civil and ethnic strife has made an effective and coordinated response by the international community absolutely essential .  
To these we must add size and strategic location , economic power - both present and potential - pace of industrial growth and technological progress as well as human and natural resources .  
The Committee stressed the need to build a cooperative spirit of work , based on a natural division of labour shaped by the respective areas of activity of the different bodies involved and leading to a system of mutual assistance and sharing of information .  
To this precarious picture we must add the resurgence of social problems , such as juvenile delinquency , illicit trade in drugs and narcotics , unemployment , the AIDS pandemic and the deleterious effects of persistent drought and other natural disasters .  
Recognition is now emerging that conventional economic analysis methods , as applied to agricultural projects that do not take into account the degradation of the natural resource base , do not provide a suitable measure of longterm sustainability .  
If properly designed and operated , national environmental funds can play a catalytic role in improving environmental management , biodiversity conservation , and sustainable and equitable use of natural resources .  
Training has focused on the legal and economic aspects of individual natural resource industries and provided comparisons of the main contractual forms and contract terms used in recent negotiations worldwide .  
The Programme of Action , the major outcome , is based on an explicit recognition of the peculiar characteristics of Small Island Developing States , notably their fragility and extreme vulnerability to natural disasters and international economic shocks .  
Improvement of the quality of life in the ESCWA region , encompassing material and nonmaterial aspects , is closely correlated with proper management of natural resources and economic development .  
That approach seeks to ensure that the basic needs of the poor , disadvantaged and vulnerable are addressed , that communities are empowered and that natural resources are managed and used in an optimal manner .  
In the same context , environmental degradation and its negative implications for longterm development must be addressed by improving and enhancing national capacities for the environmentally sound management of the natural resource base ;  
The sustainable management of natural resources and the improvement of environmental quality are mechanisms for protecting the ecological processes and the genetic diversity essential for the maintenance of life .  
The continent remained highly vulnerable to inequitable international economic policies , it was a frequent victim of natural disasters and it had an overwhelming debt burden at a time when financial flows were drying up and commodity prices remained low .  
Reiterates that any administering or occupying Power that deprives the colonial peoples of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reiterates that the exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a grave threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
The problems threatening international peace which arouse natural fears , create anxiety , work against the people 's well-being , cause enormous losses of human life and bring about an immense deterioration of social and economic development are no doubt the gravest problems , and they call for action for peace by all means possible . 
After engaging in broad contacts within the system of Asian States , we have once again become convinced of the correctness of the conclusion drawn at the beginning of this century that Asia , with its enormous human , natural and intellectual resources , had every possibility of becoming the most prosperous region in the world .  
Just a few years ago , at the Rio Conference , we , the Member countries of the United Nations , established as a primary concern the need to ensure a rational balance between realizing legitimate national goals and safeguarding the well-being of future generations through the protection of the world 's natural resources .  
A look at the political configuration of the United Nations reveals a strange paradox : at a time when hotbeds of tension are concentrated in Africa , at a time when poverty there has broken every record and at a time when natural and man-made disasters are proliferating , many international forums are seeking to reduce our continent to the status of a poor relative .  
It is regrettable that today , as the United Nations celebrates its fiftieth year since the signing of the Organization 's Charter in San Francisco , many people in Africa continue to live under even harsher conditions of poverty , hunger , disease , civil war and natural disaster .  The plight of the African continent remains a major challenge for the emerging world order .  
Such developments have been accompanied by a natural yearning for the achievement of development in both its economic and social domains , while developments on the negative side have generated a wider cycle of racial , national and religious disputes in some regions of the world that have led to a noticeable retreat from respect for human rights and basic freedoms of the human individual , as well as regression of development both in the economic and social spheres .  
This fiftieth anniversary might also have been a time to rejoice that the countries that 50 years ago were poor and dominated , especially those on the African continent , now find themselves today among the prosperous nations of our planet , a natural position , given their boundless natural resources .  
Indeed , it is critical to the preservation of the heritage of all art-rich nations that their cultural properties be preserved in their geographical and natural surroundings and be available for scientific and archaeological studies in their proper context .  
This is linked primarily to the absence of a clear international treaty and legal bases , procedures and documents regulating the actions and powers of the relevant international institutions and also national organizations , for securing a timely and effective reaction to emergency situations of a natural and technical origin .  
But it is clearly a temporary stimulant that must be tied to gradually increasing efficiency in our ability to build our economic institutions , our taxation and customs systems , to utilize our natural resources in reconstructing our economic infrastructure , and to encourage Palestinian and foreign capital investment in our economy so that we may be able to build an open and strong economy . 
The delegation of Madagascar takes this opportunity to congratulate the Secretary-General on his concise and accurate report on the special geographical conditions in Madagascar and this region of the Indian Ocean , which is continually exposed to the ravages of tropical cyclones and to the widespread damage caused by these natural disasters .  
This relates , above all , to attacking on a priority basis the structural factors hindering its development , namely : inadequate infrastructure ; weak institutions ; poor use of human resources ; high vulnerability to natural and climatic disasters ; unfavourable fluctuations in the terms of trade ; the enormous debt burden ; unchecked population growth ; and environmental degradation .  
To achieve this , Africa 's partners must transcend their previous ideas about cooperation with the continent and must overcome the accompanying donor fatigue , and must count on Africa 's natural determination to develop a dynamic of progress by which it will gain its proper place in the vast movement of international cooperation that is beneficial for all .  
As I have said on other occasions , this state of affairs is aggravated by armed conflicts , civil wars , the AIDS pandemic added to other devastating or debilitating endemic illnesses , such as malaria and by emergency situations , such as famine , drought , natural disasters , desertification and so on .  
We see nothing controversial about requesting the administering Powers not to violate the Charter by exploiting the natural resources of the inhabitants of the Non-Self-Governing Territories or in any way subordinating their rights and interests to foreign economic and financial interests .  Is it really wrong to urge these Powers to ensure that acceptable working conditions prevail in these Territories ?  
Nuclear tests pose a potential risk to the health and security of the people of coastal States and to their natural resources and environment , contrary to the precautionary principle on international environmental law contained in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development , the Convention on Biological Diversity , the United Nations Framework Convention on Climatic Change , the Treaty of Maastricht and other international instruments .  
Recognizing the increasing need for humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to humanitarian and natural disasters and other emergencies , both for relief and for the continuum to development ,  
Recognizing , in the light of the increasing number and growing magnitude and complexity of natural disasters and other emergencies , the need to utilize fully the national potential of countries in providing the United Nations , on a stand-by basis , with support for its activities in the area of humanitarian emergency assistance , as well as in the promotion of a smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and development ,  
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts .  
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts . 
Adopting integrated management systems , particularly for the management of natural resources ; traditional or indigenous methods should be studied and considered wherever they have proved effective ; women 's traditional roles should not be marginalized as a result of the introduction of new management systems ;  
Programmes to support and strengthen equal employment opportunities and equitable remuneration for women in the formal and informal sectors with adequate economic , political and social support systems and services , including child care , particularly day-care facilities and parental leave , and equal access to credit , land and other natural resources ;  
Countries should take urgent measures to avert the ongoing rapid environmental and economic degradation in developing countries that generally affects the lives of women and children in rural areas suffering drought , desertification and deforestation , armed hostilities , natural disasters , toxic waste and the aftermath of the use of unsuitable agro-chemical products .  
Establish procedures to incorporate children 's concerns into all relevant policies and strategies for environment and development at the local , regional and national levels , including those concerning allocation of and entitlement to natural resources , housing and recreation needs , and control of pollution and toxicity in both rural and urban areas .  
Reaffirming that sustained economic growth and sustainable development are essential for the prevention of and the preparedness against natural disasters and similar disasters with an adverse impact on the environment , and that special attention should be given to disaster prevention and preparedness by Governments concerned as well as by the international community ,  
Unless a significantly more effective approach to land resources management is adopted now , a possible scenario could include a large increase in poverty , hunger , social instability , war , greatly increased migration from resource-poor environments to more favourable ones , together with almost complete destruction of the remaining natural environment and possibly modifications to the world 's climate which will cause social upheaval and political unrest on a vast scale .  
Certain countries have developed systems of ecological zoning , which they are using as a basis for identification of threatened ecosystems and development of ecological modelling at various levels , from the regional and national to the level of individual natural habitats . 
It seeks to foster development of sustainable agricultural production systems and to ensure that the following elements of sustainability are incorporated in the formulation and implementation of Bank-financed projects : increased and stabilized productivity ; rational use of natural resources ; enhancement of the quality of life and the environment ; and intergenerational equity .  
A productive agriculture is an essential prerequisite of SARD , with its multiple objectives of reducing poverty and improving livelihoods while conserving and protecting the natural resource base .  
In all countries , policies oriented towards promoting food and agricultural production and rural development and raising or maintaining farm incomes , while protecting the natural resource base , need to be coherent , consistent and mutually supportive ;  
The initiative aims to design sustainable natural resource management options to combat land degradation using indigenous and modern scientific principles integrated into improved production technologies .  
At the Paris ceremony , AfDB committed itself to play an active part in implementing the Convention , in line with the important role assigned to it under the provisions of the Convention , particularly in terms of integrated activities in key areas such as improving national economic environments , the sustainable use of natural resources , efficient energy use , capacity-building and sensitization .  
The main priorities of the programme on natural resources address issues relating to knowledge , the utilization and conservation of biological resources and diversity , the assessment of standing vegetation and its present and potential contribution to agricultural productivity , and the establishment of sustainable farming systems .  
sustainable use at various levels : the ecosystems / biogeographic realms level ( forests , arid zones , oceans , freshwater etc . ) ; the species level ( wildlife ) ; genetic resources level ( plant , animal and microbial resources , and natural resources economics ) ; the processes level ( biotechnology ) ; the monitoring and assessment level ; and the legal level .  
ECA provides advisory services and support to its member States on agriculture and rural development policies , planning and programming , with a focus on measures for the conservation of natural forests and their biodiversity , desertification and the related conservation of biodiversity , the rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems and green belts in targeted countries , and the strengthening of regional cooperation programmes for the optimum and sustainable use of inland and marine fisheries .  
Today these plantations and the remaining more or less natural forests suffer from lack of silvicultural interventions , overmaturation and inadequate control of excessive wildlife populations ( which , in addition to being a generally uneconomical activity , is not appreciated by the general public ) , and new environmental conditions such as air pollution and the threat posed by climate changes .  
A major development in government policy concerning mountain communities is the increased understanding of the importance of local control over natural resource management and security of resources , especially land tenure , as the main incentives for investment in environmentally sound technologies and improved land husbandry .  
Approximately 1.4-billion ha are temperate , boreal and sub-temperate forests in industrialized countries ; these are broadly stable or increasing , although there is still pressure on primary 6 / and natural stands , as well as damage from pollution and fires that reduce forest quality .  
It holds promise for increasing the yield , quality , efficient processing and utilization of products ; for decreasing reliance on agro-chemicals and other external inputs ; and for improving the conservation and use of genetic and other natural resources .  
The main issue in increasing productivity and sustainability in rain-dependent areas is how to maximize conservation and utilization of the natural rainfall , coupled with the development and adoption of technologies to promote integrated soil , water , crop and livestock management consistent with environmental sustainability at the farm household level .  
Governments should promote the active involvement of the local community in all stages of planning and management of natural resource use for productive activity , through a grass-roots approach , including the encouragement of user groups , particularly for women ; delivery of new technologies should be carried out using a participatory systems approach , with special attention to targeting investment on intended beneficiary groups , where appropriate .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , exploitation , illiteracy , hunger and disability , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Stress was also laid on the growing importance which should be attached to the promotion of the rational use of renewable natural resources and environmental protection through participatory strategies which can strengthen communities and facilitate the sustainability of the achievements made .  
She endorsed the view expressed in the commentary that the principle of optimal utilization did not necessarily mean the " maximum " use of a watercourse , but the most economically feasible and , if possible , the most efficient one , since an international watercourse was not an inexhaustible natural resource .  
The economic and social assistance rendered by the specialized agencies and international institutions of the United Nations system should be increased and redesigned to create special programmes of assistance to those Territories , bearing in mind their specific characteristics , such as their small areas and populations , their remoteness , their limited resources and internal markets , their dependence on imports , and their vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards .  
By including this programme area in chapter 35 of Agenda 21 , the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) recognized that development and natural resources management will be sustainable only if it is based on sound science , using the best scientific knowledge available and with continued research to improve the knowledge base .  
A problem shared by developing and industrialized countries alike is that most current training programmes and institutional structures are sectoral and disciplinary and do not address the complex interactions among people , natural resources , technology , environment and development .  
The concept of sustainable development is based on the conviction that it should be possible to increase the basic standard of living of the world 's growing population without unnecessarily depleting our finite natural resources and further degrading the environment in which we live .  
Other types of policies are needed for promoting economic growth and trade , changing demographic behaviour , developing human resources , alleviating poverty , promoting the transfer to developing countries of environmentally sound technology and financial resources , and managing natural resources .  
The reports identify five major causes of increasing urbanization , all of which are about the search for better living conditions : rural unemployment and underemployment ; poor rural social services ; lack of arable land ; natural disasters , particularly drought ; and civil unrest .  
For example , the UNCTAD Standing Committee on Commodities decided that there was considerable scope for financial and technical cooperation between developed and developing countries for improving the environmental advantages of natural products .  
Particular attention and recognition should be given to the role and the special situation of women living in rural areas and those working in the agricultural sector , where access to training , land , natural and productive resources , credit , development programmes and cooperative structures can help them increase their participation in sustainable development .  
Even though reliable statistics on the exact numbers of disabled persons in the region have yet to be compiled , indications are that in recent years cases of disability have increased dramatically in a number of African countries as a result of natural disasters , protracted internal armed conflict , famine and malnutrition , and the resurgence of once-controlled diseases such as tuberculosis .  
In the fifth subparagraph , after the words " an effective commitment to global , coordinated action " , add the words : " on mitigating and overcoming the consequences of natural disasters and major technological and anthropogenic catastrophes , such as that at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and their like , as well as on . . . " ;  
Reiterates that any administering or occupying Power that deprives the colonial peoples of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reiterates that the exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , are a grave threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
Taking into account the main development objectives established by the Territory 's Executive Council , namely , the improved management of the economy through a more efficient public sector , the strategic development of human resources through the reform of the educational and training systems , and the development of integrated policies of physical infrastructural improvements , as well as the preservation of the natural environment ,  
The Division is also entrusted with the follow-up activities related to major regional and global programmes and provides advisory services on the administrative mechanisms for environmentally sound exploitation and utilization of natural resources , population policies and programmes and environmental conservation management .  
Substantive and technical services will be provided to ( a ) the Committee on Energy , the working parties on coal , gas and electric power , and the Steering Committee of the Energy Efficiency 2000 Project ; and ( b ) meetings of experts on energy efficiency standards and labelling systems ( 2 ) , financial engineering of energy efficiency projects ( 2 ) , renewable sources of energy , natural gas statistics , and public acceptance and environmental aspects of major regional energy programmes .  
The sectoral advisory services cover programmes relating to human rights , global development issues and policies , energy , human settlements , trade and development , population , natural resources , social development , public administration and finance , crime prevention and criminal justice , statistics and emergency humanitarian assistance .  
The exercise analysed the current state of human development in the countries and identified broad development strategies that take into account the specific socio-economic characteristics , fragile ecosystems and limited natural resource base of these island economies .  
The Pacific island countries and the donor community are now faced with the challenge of translating these strategies into concrete action at the country level , with a need to generate broad-based economic growth while making judicious , sustainable use of the limited natural resource base and ensuring a balance of the fragile ecosystems .  
In order to ensure an integrated approach to the complexity of mountain ecosystems and the socio-economic issues at stake , the Commission recognizes the need for strengthening the existing institutional mechanisms as well as the knowledge base about mountain ecosystems through research , database development , pilot projects and information exchange , along with support for training in-country of scientific and technical experts and local natural resource managers .  
The Commission requests the organizations of the United Nations system and other relevant organizations to organize , within existing resources , regional workshops to explore , discuss and further develop methodological approaches to integration based upon , for example , work being done in environmental economics , valuation , natural resource accounting and integrated economic and environmental accounting .  
The concept of sustainable human development marks an important advance in the global search for a new way of ordering human affairs - a way that is equitable to both current and future generations in all parts of the world , one that will ensure that future generations inherit a natural resource base at least as viable as that of earlier generations .  
The activities under this subprogramme will aim at strengthening the capability of ESCAP members and associate members in environmental and natural resource management ; integration of environmental considerations into economic policy decision-making ; transfer of environmentally sound technologies ; sustainable rural and urban development ; population and sustainable development ; and natural disaster reduction .  
The objective of the Decade remains , as originally stated , " to reduce through concerted international action , especially in developing countries , the loss of life , property damage and social and economic disruption caused by natural disasters " .  
The main reasons included a shortage of resources , both domestic and external , the lack of an appropriate macroeconomic framework in several countries and , in some cases , various crises - political and / or natural - that interrupted economic activity .  
The envisaged cooperation aims at supporting efforts of the member States of the two organizations to promote regional cooperation and sustainable human development through programmes and activities designed to mobilize and enhance human resources , to promote the environmentally sound use of natural and mineral resources and raise the living standards of the peoples in the countries concerned .  
These included : empowerment of women as an overall concept ; mass media ; statistics and indicators on gender issues ; natural resources and sustainable development : water , waste management and sanitation ; renewable energy ; and issues related to different groups of female population such as the ageing , displaced ; refugees and migrants .  50 .  The Board decided that INSTRAW should introduce the following in its new programme , among other subjects :  
Particular areas in which regional cooperation requires strengthening by both the Territories concerned and international agencies : preservation and protection of marine and other natural resources from over-exploitation ; transport and communications ; higher education ; research and development ; regional pooling arrangements for sharing special skills and expertise ; and assistance in the public health area ;  
Countries may experience disruption of their governmental systems from at least three major sources : massive natural disasters , such as earthquakes , cyclones , or volcanic eruptions ; internal civil strife ; or external conflict / war with neighbouring States .  
Whereas all peoples have the right of self-determination and by virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic , social and cultural development and may , for their own ends , freely dispose of their natural wealth and resources without prejudice to any obligations arising out of international economic cooperation , based upon the principle of mutual benefit and international law ;  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the people of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
In this regard , Earthwatch is exploring the potential to use schools , non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , the media and other groups in building a more complete picture of the status of species , land uses , development activities , pollution problems and other characteristics of the human and natural environment as inputs for state-of-the-environment reporting and as a basis for selective continued monitoring of national and global trends and for filling data gaps .  
In that resolution , the General Assembly decided that the major activities for the observance of the Year should be concentrated at the local , regional and national levels and assisted by the United Nations and its system of organizations , with a view to creating among Governments , policy makers and the public a greater awareness of the family as the natural and fundamental unit of society .  
This has facilitated the monitoring of borders , coastlines , territorial and international waters , space and natural resources by means of powerful , ultra-precise radar networks , instead of by land , sea and air patrols , thereby freeing up human , material and temporal resources so as to secure borders against enemy infiltration and guaranteeing the repulsion of any violation of the integrity , security and stability of States or entire regions .  
Cooperation in the context of subregional and regional action programmes includes agreed joint programmes for the sustainable management of transboundary natural resources , scientific and technical cooperation and strengthening of relevant institutions .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the people of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
In the developing countries as a whole , the share of manufacturing in GDP rose from 17 per cent in 1960 to 21 per cent in 1990 , and the share of agriculture fell from over 31 per cent to a little more than 18 per cent , but in the least developed countries , manufacturing is still less than 10 per cent of their GDP and consists largely of food processing and natural fibre textile industries , which can not expand vigorously without a strong agricultural sector .  
Provide financial and institutional support for research on safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods and technologies for the reproductive and sexual health of women and men , including more safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods for the regulation of fertility , including natural family planning for both sexes , methods to protect against HIV / AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases and simple and inexpensive methods of diagnosing such diseases , among others .  
Particular attention and recognition should be given to the role and the special situation of women living in rural areas and those working in the agricultural sector , where access to training , land , natural and productive resources , credit , development programmes and cooperative structures can help them increase their participation in sustainable development .  
In certain regions , women are generally the most stable members of the community , as men often pursue work in distant locations , leaving women to safeguard the natural environment and ensure adequate and sustainable resource allocation within the household and the community .  251 .  The strategic actions needed for sound environmental management require a holistic , multidisciplinary and intersectoral approach .  
The impact on women of environmental and natural resource degradation , deriving from , inter alia , unsustainable production and consumption patterns , drought , poor quality water , global warming , desertification , sea-level rise , hazardous waste , natural disasters , toxic chemicals and pesticide residues , radioactive waste , armed conflicts and its consequences ;  
The origin of social exclusion is often to be found in racism and racial discrimination , phenomena which many Governments believe should be written off as things of the past , denying their persistence or describing as " natural " the economic and social conditions of ethnic , racial and religious minorities and indigenous populations .

NULLCooperation between the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) and the League of Arab States continued during 1994-1995 in technical fields of mutual interest in the areas of agriculture and rural development , natural resources and environment protection , human resources training and global economic and social development .  
The mechanism , an open-ended interdisciplinary and inter-agency working process , would provide a collective operating framework to direct a credible and effective application of early warning within disaster management at all levels , in particular in support of local communities at risk from natural and similar disasters ;  
Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island States and land-locked countries ,  
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts .  
The Division is responsible for establishing policies for environmentally sound and sustainable multi-sectoral development plans , the integration of environmental imperatives into the development process , the development of energy and natural resources and the reduction of natural disasters , taking into account technological and economic and demographic development .  
NULLIn recent years , the frequency and magnitude of major disasters , whether of a natural , technological or ecological origin , have made the world community aware of the immense loss of human life and economic resources that are regularly caused by such calamities .  
38 The growing awareness and consideration of these societal issues together with advances in spaceborne technology mean that effective , affordable and global mobile satellite communications and remote sensing capabilities that should significantly reduce the devastating effects of natural disasters should soon be implemented .  
It involves the transmission of knowledge and the affirmation of values that emphasize peaceful coexistence , responsibility , tolerance , solidarity and justice and that promote the development of individuals who show social solidarity and who are active and tolerant in the political sphere , productive in the economic sphere , respectful of human rights and aware of the value of the natural environment .  
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts .  
For example , a cooperative program was undertaken examining commercial cotton fields in the San Joaquin Valley of California , aimed at developing integrated tools to produce crops that maximize economic return , support efficient use of natural resources , and minimize detrimental impacts on the environment .  
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the people of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , exploitation , intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger and disability , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
that sustained economic growth and sustainable development are essential for the prevention of and preparedness for natural disasters and similar disasters with an adverse impact on the environment and that special attention should be given to disaster prevention and preparedness by the Governments concerned as well as by the international community ,  
concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , exploitation , intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger and disability , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
dense traffic includes the transport of noxious , dangerous and hazardous cargoes ( 011 , liquified natural gas ( LNG ) , liquefied petroleum gas ( LPG ) , chemicals , other explosive and environmentally hazardous substances ) .  
With regard to the subprogrammes on food and agriculture , economic and social planning , industrial , scientific and technological development , international trade and development finance , natural resources and energy , and social development , it would be misleading to state that any of them duplicated work done by other bodies and that ECLAC should not be involved in such activities .  
concerned at the fact that the recent natural disasters that have occurred in Nicaragua , the burden of the foreign debt , despite its reduction and renegotiation achieved with the collaboration of the international community , and the harmful effects on its economy of the prolonged periods of drought followed by excessive rain and floods that have afflicted the Central American region impede the efforts being made by Nicaragua to overcome the consequences of war within the framework of a democracy and under the macroeconomic conditions already achieved ,

all countries and intergovernmental and regional organizations that have actively engaged in regional and subregional assessments of vulnerability to natural hazards and have consequently initiated regional and subregional cooperation in the field of disaster reduction , including the exchange of data and technology , as well as the development of joint administrative , technological and scientific approaches for applied disaster reduction ,  
that sustained economic growth and sustainable development are essential for the prevention of and preparedness for natural disasters and similar disasters with an adverse impact on the environment and that special attention should be given to disaster prevention and preparedness by the Governments concerned as well as by the international community ,  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the people of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
In this forum I will limit myself to recalling the significant role of His Majesty King Moshoeshoe II and the natural and constructive approach he had towards existing problems in the African continent , as well as his personal commitment towards charitable organizations with the purpose of raising funds for special social and development projects and programmes .  
This makes us hopeful that the Assembly will be able to do so as a permanent part of its daily work , not having to deal with tragic events such as these , but in a healthy and natural way playing its role as the universal , supreme and sovereign organ of the United Nations .  
The heads of Government adopted a package of recommendations aimed at reducing the vulnerability of the region to the impact of natural occurrences , improving and expanding the region 's risk acceptance capacity , the development of strong and effective insurance regulation and regulatory capacity , and at strengthening the institutional base for national disaster mitigation , forecasting and assessment .  
The ever-dwindling natural resource base , global warming , persistent droughts and desertification are eloquent reminders that humankind 's current destructive processes of growth are pushing our planet towards the precipice .  
On this occasion , I wish to express my deep gratitude to the Governments of various countries , the affiliated organs and specialized agencies of the United Nations system , including the Department of Humanitarian Affairs , non-governmental organizations , and individuals for their moral , material and humanitarian assistance and encouragement to our people , which have been provided in the hope of removing , as quickly as possible , the damage caused in recent years by successive natural disasters .  
Every State has the right to choose its political , economic and social system , to preserve its natural resources and to resort to peaceful negotiations as a means of settling disputes within the context of bilateral , regional and international initiatives and endeavours .  
Although the international community has succeeded , by dint of serious negotiations , in resolving many difficult problems and has achieved important results in many sensitive areas through the establishment of the World Trade Organization , we are still concerned by the continuing practice of trade protectionism , which runs counter to our belief in the importance of allowing market forces to play their natural role in economic affairs .  
Its objectives responsible management , food security , development of human resources , the proper and effective use of natural resources , cooperation and economic regional integration are ambitious but feasible .  
ECLAC has rendered valuable service through subprogrammes on economic development , social development , international trade , development financing and transport , industrial , agricultural , and technological modernization , environment , natural resources and human settlements , statistics and economic projections , the integration of women into development , regional integration and cooperation , economic and social planning and population .  
Thus , we are in no way , and to no degree , inhibited with regard to addressing inviting profound reflection on the issue of the special circumstances of small island developing States particularly those in the Caribbean region , where prominent among the features characterizing our special circumstances is the ever-present vulnerability to natural disaster and the widespread devastation resulting therefrom .  
While in the beginning of this partnership large amounts had to be contributed towards emergency measures , today the extensive bilateral development cooperation focuses mainly on the consolidation of structural adaptation processes , the rehabilitation of social infrastructures , the promotion of private enterprises ( including vocational training ) , agricultural development , and the protection of the environment and natural resources .  
Looking back over the recent past , we are very much aware that the cumulative impact of natural disasters and economic crises has combined to produce an untenable situation clearly deserving concerted international support and assistance .  
Consistent with agreements reached at the regional level , Papua New Guinea has adopted a comprehensive code of logging practice designed to promote the sustainable use and in-country processing of a rich renewable natural resource .  
We have developed , in close cooperation with the countries of the Caribbean region , a strategy based on three main priorities : support for the process of economic transition ; promotion of sustainable development of the Caribbean region with particular emphasis on human resource development , the protection of natural resources and combating socio-economic threats , including the fight against drugs ; and the promotion of increased economic cooperation leading to fuller integration in the world market .  
It should be unconscionable that financial flows to Africa remain so low despite renewed commitments by the international community to the contrary , and even more so when the majority of African countries have undertaken difficult and unpopular structural adjustment programmes that have marginalized the poor further , depleted natural resources and degraded the environment .  
In our endeavours to face the challenges of humanitarian assistance in emergency situations , the role of the United Nations is of utmost importance in providing a proper framework for effective coordination when the international community is called upon to address difficult problems emerging from natural disasters or other phenomena of a complex nature .  
The Republic of Belarus deeply appreciates the efforts made by all the programmes , funds and specialized agencies of the United Nations system towards providing increased , speedier and better quality assistance to the various countries and regions suffering from armed conflicts , natural disasters , industrial ecological catastrophes and other emergency circumstances .  
Concerned by the increasing suffering of millions of victims of natural disasters , emergency situations and armed conflicts and by the attendant loss of life , flows of refugees , mass displacement of populations and infrastructure devastation , the United Arab Emirates declares its support for international efforts to assess and enhance the capacity of the United Nations and its specialized agencies to address these grave international humanitarian problems and to strengthen the participation of the international community .  
It is precisely because of our recognition of the specific and peculiar problems faced by the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories , most of which are small island Territories that suffer from impediments created by the interplay of such factors as economic and geographic size , isolation , vulnerability to natural disasters , lack of technological and financial resources and so on , including problems of accessibility to international credit and markets , that the international community should give specific priority and attention to the process of decolonization affecting the peoples of those Territories .  
The draft resolution before the Assembly recognizes the increasing need for humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development .  
Endorses the need for a global knowledge base on mineral resource potential , in terms of potential source areas , to be developed so that it can be integrated with other land-use information as an essential part of an integrated approach to the planning and management of natural resources ;  
Most of the efforts are directed towards the strengthening of operational capability of existing regional or national institutions involved in environmental management for sustainable development , natural resource monitoring or land-cover mapping .  
30 ECA , through its education and training programme in 1996 and 1997 , will continue to focus on developing and strengthening institutional , technical and human capabilities in the application of cartography and remote sensing techniques in data collection for natural resource and environmental management , while organizing expert meetings to enhance policies and design legislative guidelines for the use of cartography and remote sensing in social and economic planning ( see also paragraphs 129-131 below ) . 
As far as the energy-deficient developing countries are concerned , to meet this challenge and to arrest their ever-increasing dependence on imported energy , mainly oil , it will be necessary to accelerate exploration and development of indigenous energy resources and to develop greater capacity for producing commercial primary energy : oil , natural gas , coal , hydropower and other new and renewable sources of energy .  
The outlook for natural gas consumption in developing countries is for continued steady growth , given that many of these countries have indigenous gas resources that can be developed or expanded for domestic use , and considering their high electricity demand growth and the economic and environmental benefits of additional gas use ( see figure X ) . 
Deeply concerned at the fact that the recent natural disasters that have occurred in Nicaragua , the burden of the foreign debt , despite its reduction and renegotiation achieved with the collaboration of the international community , and the harmful effects on its economy of the prolonged periods of drought followed by excessive rain and floods that have afflicted the Central American region impede the efforts being made by Nicaragua to overcome the consequences of war within the framework of a democracy and under the macroeconomic conditions already achieved ,  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
[ Depending on local conditions in the housing sector and the availability of legal protection guaranteeing equal access to resources and opportunities , ] vulnerable groups include the poorest groups , some of the older persons , street children , youth , [ documented ] migrants , internally displaced persons , inhabitants of disadvantaged communities , people affected by natural and human-caused disasters , households headed by women , persons with disabilities and some indigenous people .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the people of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
In improving natural and human-made disaster prevention , preparedness , mitigation and response , Governments at the appropriate level , including local authorities , and in close consultation and cooperation with such entities as insurance companies , non-governmental organizations , community-based organizations , organized communities , the academic , health and scientific community , should :  
In addition , such human settlements provide equal opportunity for a productive and freely chosen livelihood ; equal access to economic resources , including the right to inheritance , the ownership of land and other property , credit , natural resources and appropriate technologies ; for personal , spiritual , religious , cultural and social development ; for participation in public decision-making ; for equal rights and obligations with regard to the conservation and use of natural and cultural resources ; and equal access to mechanisms to ensure that rights are not violated .  
The sustainability of the global environment and human life will not be achieved unless , among other things , human settlements in both urban and rural areas are made economically buoyant , socially vibrant and environmentally sound , with full respect for cultural , religious and natural heritage and diversity .  
The raising costs of urban land and other factors prevent the poor and other vulnerable and disadvantaged groups from gaining access to suitable land , whose location does not pose economic , environmental or health risks to the residents because of its proximity to industrial facilities or susceptibility to natural disasters .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , exploitation , intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger and disability , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island States and land-locked countries ,  
Commending all countries and intergovernmental and regional organizations that have actively engaged in regional and subregional assessments of vulnerability to natural hazards and have consequently initiated regional and subregional cooperation in the field of disaster reduction , including the exchange of data and technology , as well as the development of joint administrative , technological and scientific approaches for applied disaster reduction ,  
Reaffirming that sustained economic growth and sustainable development are essential for the prevention of and preparedness for natural disasters and similar disasters with an adverse impact on the environment and that special attention should be given to disaster prevention and preparedness by the Governments concerned as well as by the international community ,  
Because industrial and agricultural activities on the Earth 's environment have reached such a level that their effects are clearly observed on a global scale , continuous and sustainable development action and policies should be carried out for the protection and maintenance of Earth 's natural environment .  
In addition to their direct social and local economic consequences , natural disasters affected the macroeconomic standing of countries , increasing debt , reducing foreign income due to loss of exports and reducing overall production outputs .  
It was stated that pure scientific , applied and experimental research relevant to natural hazard management was required .  
To avoid alarmist or misleading awareness campaigns , they need reliable and representative information - e.g . , on various forest types ( boreal , temperate , tropical , wet , dry , natural , plantations , monocultures ) ; ( e ) The general public and media . 
The internationally accepted definition of a protected area is given as an area of land and / or sea that is especially dedicated to the protection and maintenance of biological diversity , as well as of natural and associated cultural resources , and that is managed through legal or other effective means .  
Fiscal regimes applied to natural resources have a long way to go in discouraging the excessive extraction and harvesting of natural resources and / or mobilizing substantial additional budgetary resources for sustainable development .  
In practice , the ongoing reform of natural resource fiscal regimes in various countries has a long way to go in mobilizing substantial additional budgetary resources and at the same time discouraging excessive extraction and harvesting of natural resources .  
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
The domestic factors include : civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some LDCs and the resulting social and economic burdens , political instability , macroeconomic imbalances , manifested in large fiscal and balance-of-payments deficits , in many cases the unfavourable short-term impact of macroeconomic policy adjustments on specific areas , in particular the most disadvantaged and vulnerable sections of the population , and poor performance of the productive sectors including lack of adequate physical infrastructure .  
In this programme the United Nations University Institute for Natural Resources in Africa ( UNU / INRA ) addresses the continent 's urgent needs for human resources development and institutional capacity-building in order to achieve more effective conservation , management and rational utilization of natural resources for sustainable development .  
Whatever their geographical scope , however , issues such as depletion of natural resources , declining food production , and declining availability and quality of water were linked with issues such as income generation , literacy , health care , unsustainable patterns of production and consumption in the developed world , privatization and the effects of structural adjustment programmes , international trade patterns , and the foreign debt burden .  
Commends the efforts of the Institute to address all levels of poverty that hamper so dramatically the advancement of women , through the coordination of research and training activities in the areas of economic and political empowerment of women ; statistics and indicators in gender issues ; communications ; women , natural resources and sustainable development ; water , sanitation and waste management ; renewable sources of energy ; and issues related to different population groups , such as the girl child , older women , displaced women , refugee and migrant women and women in rural areas ;  
Article 44 of the amended Constitution stipulated that in using frequency bands for radio services , member administrations should bear in mind that radio frequencies and the geostationary-satellite orbit were limited natural resources which must be used rationally , efficiently and economically , so that countries or groups of countries could have equitable access to both , taking account of the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries .  
43 His delegation considered that any draft text prepared by the Subcommittee on the utilization of the geostationary orbit should mention chapter VII , article 44 , No . 196 , paragraph 2 , of the Constitution of ITU , which indicated that the geostationary-satellite orbit was a limited natural resource and must be used rationally , efficiently and economically , and that countries or groups of countries must have equitable access to it , taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries .  
For geographical reasons Ecuador had demonstrated great interest in the geostationary orbit , which was a limited natural resource with special characteristics , and for which there should be a sui generis legal regime regulating access to and utilization of the orbit and guaranteeing equitable access to it , with account being taken of the relative disadvantages of the developing countries .  
As a result of the decentralization of activities and resources in the fields of natural resources and energy as discussed in the report of the Secretary-General of this subject ( see document A / C . 5 / 48 / 76 of 31 May 1994 ) , technical and professional posts were decentralized from the Department for Development Support and Management Services to the regional commissions in order to strengthen their ability to provide technical assistance and policy advice in the area of mineral resources at the regional level .  
The multidisciplinary mission team consisted of 10 members and included a development economist , a mineral resources expert , an industrial economist , an environmental lawyer , a sustainable agriculture analyst , a fisheries adviser , a natural resources adviser , an institutional adviser , an education adviser and a people 's participation adviser .  
It should be possible to quadruple the goods and services that could be produced with a given quantity of natural resources and energy , which would enable developing countries to quadruple their production and consumption without increasing their environmental impact , while the developed countries could maintain their standard of living while greatly reducing their environmental impact .  
To the extent that hazardous wastes exported to developing countries result in the contamination of soil and adjacent waters , they may reduce future productivity and economic uses of those natural resources , besides endangering human , animal and plant life .  
Those who considered that the question deserved prompt consideration by the Commission stressed that rules concerning the nationality of legal persons might be more common in State practice and customary law , thus lending themselves more easily to systematization , in contrast to the striking absence of specific provisions on the nationality of natural persons in the context of State succession in the legislation of the majority of States .  
Create awareness among policy makers of women 's role in the conservation and regeneration of natural resources , including access to the required legal , scientific and technological means , and of their participation in environmental research by documenting and promoting women 's indigenous knowledge base ; advocate the increase of women 's participation and their perspectives in environment , science and technology research , policy and programmes , and more ethical science and technology ( UNIFEM , DAW / DPCSD , UNEP , Division for Science and Technology / UNCTAD , ECE , UNICEF ) .  
" Micro-organisms " : bacteria , viruses , mycoplasmas , rickettsiae or fungi , whether natural , enhanced or modified , either in the form of " isolated live cultures " , including in dormant form or in dried preparations , or as material , including living material , which has been deliberately inoculated or contaminated with such cultures .  
Most of the developed countries draw on large shares of crude oil and natural gas in their primary energy consumption ; some regions have substantial contributions of nuclear energy and modern renewable sources . 
Potential carbon dioxide utilization , disposal , and storage options include enhanced oil recovery , storage in depleted natural gas fields and other underground reservoirs , chemical feedstocks and other basic material , and finally disposal in the deep ocean .  
The Board recognizes that the transportation and provision of controlled drugs needed for humanitarian aid in acute emergencies of natural or human origin constitute a genuine justification for non-application of the normal , regular control requirements .  
Endorses the need for a global knowledge base on mineral resource potential , in terms of potential source areas , to be developed so that it can be integrated with other land-use information as an essential part of an integrated approach to the planning and management of natural resources ;  
This audience-oriented approach focuses on rural young men and women , the key players in a global programme aimed at ensuring increased agricultural production that conserves our natural resources to the greatest extent and sustainable rural development that reduces the push of rural poverty that exacerbates the current high levels of rural to urban migration in many of the developing countries .  
Thus , the rapid demographic growth of some cities and the movements of landless farm workers in hot , rainy ecosystems are extreme examples of the critical links that exist between demographic dynamics and the natural environment .  
The Board stated that the Institute 's programme of work should continue to focus on and establish priorities in areas where INSTRAW has already acquired expertise - areas such as the political and economic empowerment of women ; statistics and indicators in gender issues ; natural resources and sustainable development ; water and waste management ; renewable sources of energy ; access to credit ; women and the media ; and , issues relating to different population groups , especially the elderly and displaced , refugees and migrant women .  
The subprogramme , which is implemented by the Division for Environment Management and Social Development , provides assistance in conceptualizing , formulating and implementing action-oriented , people-centred programmes at the national level emphasizing the interface between natural resources , environmental management and social development through operational projects and substantive contributions to relevant global conferences and intergovernmental bodies .  
To strengthen the institutional , human resources and policy-making capabilities of Governments and communities in order to foster the effective planning and management of natural resources ; to promote an iterative and multisectoral approach to water resources management that integrates technological , socio-economic , environmental and human health considerations and involves local initiatives and participation in such development efforts ; and to formulate policies on mineral resources that encourage environmentally sound production practices ;  
To strengthen the institutional capacity of Governments and communities for the development , utilization and commercialization of new and renewable energy sources ; to develop national and indigenous capacity in assessment and management of energy resources and services ; to introduce changes in energy consumption patterns , focusing on conservation measures and demand-side management ; to facilitate international and interregional connections for the transmission of electric power and transport of natural gas ; and to promote technology transfer to different levels of government , civil society , community institutions and entrepreneurs .  
In relation to natural resources and energy , it focused on addressing issues of institutional management , defining the roles of the State , particularly in regard to privatization and regulation , contributing to the design and application of public policies for integrated natural resources management and providing support for the regional implementation of international environmental agreements that relate to natural resource management .  
Population density , availability of key natural resources , per capita income and urban and agricultural conditions differ between the crowded coastal plain and the less densely populated West Bank .  
Concerning agriculture , United Nations assistance will follow a multi-track approach aimed at strengthening the institutional capacity of the Palestinian Authority for agricultural development ; supporting sustainable natural resources management policies and practices ; revitalizing support services to agricultural entrepreneurs ; developing the sector 's human resources and encouraging the competitiveness of agricultural products ; and supporting the rehabilitation of essential rural physical infrastructures .  
Since its creation in 1992 pursuant to General Assembly resolution 46 / 182 , the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of the Secretariat has grown into an effective facilitator for the coordination of both natural and complex emergencies , and has increased its capacity to act as an advocate of humanitarian assistance in the context of both political and humanitarian policy discussions , and with respect to resource mobilization for humanitarian emergencies . 
The secretariat for the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction has continued to support and coordinate the implementation of the Decade 's targets and its overall objective of reducing , through concerted international action , the loss of life , material destruction , and social and economic disruption which occur as a consequence of natural disasters .  
There has been substantial progress in the establishment of a physical planning unit to direct natural resource management and in the preparation of an environmental profile of the island and an inventory of its historical , archaeological , cultural and natural resources .  
In 1993 , the President of the Republic of Kalmykia , K . Ilyumzhinov , declared an ecological state of emergency owing to the rapid deterioration of the ecological situation in the territory of the Republic as a result of the increased impact in recent decades of the anthropogenic burden on the environment combined with the region 's extreme natural conditions .  
This policy statement , intended as a contribution by the world 's farmers to the World Food Summit , emphasized that in order to increase food production while at the same time assuring sustainable relationships with the natural environment and maintaining stable rural societies , farmers acting through their own organizations needed to take a central role . 
This degree of importance becomes even more obvious as one realizes that water is a natural resource which is scarce and limited and whose quality has repercussions in the ecosystems of which it is the core , thus capable of harming the living conditions of both present and future generations .  
The traditional approach to funding ECE / FAO work on temperate and boreal forest resource assessment has been a cooperative approach in which member countries and certain organizations have provided major contributions , mostly in kind , and a very small secretariat team has played a coordinating and assembling role with a limited amount of analytical and validation work ; this is a natural and justified approach in a region where most counties have rather well-developed forest inventory capacity .  
The Forest Principles , chapters 11 and 12 of Agenda 21 and the Convention to Combat Desertification together provide a substantive framework which could support , guide and monitor national and international efforts to assess , manage and conserve fragile dryland ecosystems , including forests , wooded lands and trees , natural or planted , of dry areas .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
While they have evolved a holistic , traditional scientific knowledge of their land , natural resources and environment , their ability to practise sustainable development of their lands has been limited by economic , social and historical factors .  
Although Africa is faced with enormous problems , it also has a great potential , both in human and natural resources , for sustained economic growth and sustainable development .  
Since it may be easier to negotiate and implement , country certification may not only lay the groundwork for more comprehensive international forest product certification agreements but also buy time , by initiating immediate incentives for action on sustainable forest management while the details of more complicated agreements on certification for all global forest products from natural and plantation forests are concluded .  
In the face of this paralysing economic strangulation , decreed unilaterally by our neighbours , which should be cultivating natural human solidarity more than ever with a Burundi immersed in a state of distress , we are once again threatened with genocide , the causes of which everyone is seeking to eradicate , but which could re-emerge owing to those measures that run counter to legal and humanitarian principles .  
The Council , in paragraph 2 of the resolution , " Commends the work of the Institute on the issue addressing the process of the economic and political empowerment of women ; statistics and indicators in gender issues ; women , natural resources and sustainable development ; water , waste management and renewable sources of energy ; and issues related to different groups , such as the elderly , displaced , refugees and migrant women " .  
The eradication of poverty can not be accomplished through anti-poverty programmes alone but will require democratic participation , and changes in economic structures in order to ensure access for all to resources , opportunities and public services , to undertake policies geared to more equitable distribution of wealth and income , to implement social protection for those who can not support themselves , and to assist people confronted with unforeseen catastrophe , whether individual or collective , natural , social or technological .  
Participants in the high-level segment recognized that , in future work , more attention should be paid to addressing the driving forces that impacted on the sustainable management of natural resources while at the same time giving more attention to the economic and social dimensions of sustainable development , including combating poverty .  
Periodic natural and man-made disasters and other adverse situations , including political instability and civil strife and problems of refugees and their attendant negative consequences , continue to imperil the fragile socio-economic conditions in many least developed countries .  
It is to be hoped that the scientifically advanced nations will effectively control the use of scientific progress by their nationals or public authorities and prevent any use detrimental to the natural wealth and the human , genetic and biological resources of the less developed nations or to the individual freedom and privacy of their citizens , especially with respect to trade in and management of waste materials .  
However , he questioned the wisdom of having one treaty body that was extremely well funded , while other treaty bodies had inadequate resources and administrative support with possibly no natural outside agencies to provide additional funding that could lead to increased effectiveness and more optimal functioning .  
UNESCO 's efforts through programme implementation are centred on the training of human resources in fields of vital importance for their development , such as access to mother-tongue education , revitalization of components of their cultural heritage , development of traditional skills relating to the protection and use of natural resources , promotion of crafts and encouraging systematic mechanisms of dialogue with member States . UNESCO 's policy in the area of indigenous issues is a long-term task based on regular and progressive consultation with indigenous partners .  
The project consisted of an inter-agency mission by the Department for Development Support and Management Services , FAO , UNIDO , and UNESCO to provide an integrated package of policy advice to the Government on : ( i ) integrating environment and development at all levels of the decision-making process ; ( ii ) an integrated approach to the management of renewable and non-renewable natural resources ; ( iii ) strengthening mechanisms for effective indigenous people 's participation in decision-making ; ( iv ) capacity-building for villages , communities , and grass-root non-governmental organizations .  
" The inhuman Israeli practices include the various material , political , cultural and social situations of the Arab citizens in the occupied region of the Syrian Arab Golan , not to mention the continuity of settlement policy , advancing to the Arab territories , destruction of building , theft of antiquities , investment and seizure of lands , natural resources and water sources . "  
Deeply concerned at the fact that the recent natural disasters that have occurred in Nicaragua , the burden of the foreign debt , despite its reduction and renegotiation achieved with the collaboration of the international community , and the harmful effects on its economy of the prolonged periods of rain and floods that have afflicted the Central American region impede the efforts being made by Nicaragua to overcome the consequences of war within the framework of a democracy and under the macroeconomic conditions already achieved ,  
The proposal was made by the Commission in its report on its forty-seventh session in 1995 , 1 / in which the Commission notes that the topic could be considered as part of its long-term programme of work and could , inter alia , cover the content and scope of the rule of exhaustion of local remedies , the rule of nationality of claims as applied to both natural and juristic persons , problems of stateless persons and dual nationals , and the effect of dispute settlement clauses on domestic remedies and on the exercise of diplomatic protection .  
The Parties consider that the delimitation of the Caspian Sea between the littoral States in one form or another is fully consistent with international practice and the principles and rules of international law and will facilitate their cooperation on the basis of equal rights and mutual advantage and help to attract investments and modern technology for the purpose of the effective , rational and safe use of the natural resources of the Caspian .  
It was mentioned that the Centre was also committed to protecting and maintaining the historic , cultural and natural heritage of indigenous and other people , and that Governments , as enabling partners , should create and strengthen effective partnerships with vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities .  
In addition , given the natural cycles of drought and floods in the region , weaknesses of rural and urban infrastructure , shortage of food stocks and seeds , generalized poverty , and vulnerability of the majority of the economic agents , the country will inevitably continue to face future emergency situations , at the local level or nationwide , arising from natural calamities .  
Expressing its solidarity with the people and countries that suffer as a result of natural disasters and expressing also the deepest sympathy to all victims of the natural disasters that have struck in various parts of the globe , Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island States and landlocked countries ,  
Reaffirms the need to support the implementation of the Yokohama Strategy and its Plan of Action with particular regard to improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , for the purpose of capacity-building and human resources development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , as well as least developed , small island and landlocked countries ;  
According to Indonesia , the proposed axis lines are the result of years of careful study of various factors , such as : the need of international transportation and aviation in transiting Indonesian waters ; the hydrographic and natural marine conditions in and near the relevant axis lines ; the intensity of coastal and inter-island navigation and overflight ; the intensity of fishing activities , particularly of local artisanal fishermen ; the existence of oil and gas exploration and exploitation ;  
His delegation particularly welcomed the inclusion of crimes against United Nations and associated personnel and the use in armed conflict of methods and means of warfare calculated to cause widespread , long-term and severe damage to the natural environment , particularly in the light of their emergence as crimes under customary international law .  
The Bank viewed land ownership and natural resources management ; technical assistance and training ; basic investment in education , health and other aspects of human capital that were adapted to indigenous peoples and their cultures ; and better access to goods and services , including financial resources , as closely related factors which warranted special attention in tackling the poverty and marginalization of Latin America 's indigenous people .  
Deeply concerned at the fact that the recent natural disasters that have occurred in Nicaragua , the burden of the foreign debt , despite its reduction and renegotiation achieved with the collaboration of the international community , and the harmful effects on its economy of the prolonged periods of rain and floods that have afflicted the Central American region impede the efforts being made by Nicaragua to overcome the consequences of war within the framework of a democracy and under the macroeconomic conditions already achieved ,  
Each national legislation established its own rules concerning natural persons , with the sole obligation of observing international custom and generally recognized legal principles , particularly the 1993 Hague Convention concerning specific questions relating to conflicts of laws on nationality .  
The Heads of State again emphasize the special importance of developing and extracting the rich natural resources of their countries , in the first instance natural gas , petroleum and hydro-energy resources , and called for urgent measures to conduct joint projects for laying pipelines and electricity transmission lines to deliver energy to world markets , with the involvement in these projects of the States concerned , international financial institutions and State and private structures .  
In November 1995 , the Committee approved , on an exceptional basis , taking into account prevailing humanitarian conditions in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , the export of 186.5-million cubic metres of natural gas per month from the Russian Federation for an initial period of two months , on condition that it would revert to the matter in the case of interruptions or delays in the delivery of natural gas to Sarajevo for other than technical reasons .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , poverty , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , racism , and all forms of intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger , disability and drug abuse , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
In all cases where the responsibility of a corporate body is engaged , the maximum fine applicable to such a body is equal to five times that provided for natural persons by the statute punishing the offence ( art . 131 _ 41 of the new Penal Code ) .  
Respect for fundamental human rights was deeply embedded in what was called the " Pacific way " , a sort of unspoken mutual understanding that meant that respect for the basic rights of all came naturally to the peoples of the Pacific islands and that it was natural for them to seek out dialogue , in other words , to practice democracy , a fact of which they were quite proud .  
The purpose of the present report , which has been prepared in response to that request , is to provide an objective review and appraisal of the current conditions and trends in the exploitation and consumption of natural resources in human settlements , with a view to identifying imminent threats to sustainability , and to provide options for strategic interventions that could put current consumption patterns on to a sustainable track .  
Noting that the unfavourable situation of the Comoros , which is on the list of least developed countries , is aggravated by several important factors , including its physical distance from its trading partners , the scarcity of natural resources , the diminutive size of the domestic market , the fall in prices of its export products and the poverty of its soil ,  
Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island developing States and landlocked countries ,  
Reaffirms the need to support the implementation of the Yokohama Strategy and its Plan of Action with particular regard to improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , for the purpose of capacity-building and human resources development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , as well as least developed , small island developing and landlocked countries ;  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , poverty , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , racism and all forms of intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger , disability and drug abuse , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
The question of Palestine can not be resolved simply through the redeployment of Israeli forces , but only through complete withdrawal of the occupation forces from all the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967 , including Jerusalem ; through the dismantling of the Israeli settlements , which have been declared illegal by the international community , as is evident in Security Council Resolutions 465 ( 1980 ) and 478 ( 1980 ) ; and through the exercise by the Palestinian people of their right to sovereignty over their land and natural resources .  
The Trade and Development Report had gone beyond the traditional argument put forward by the World Bank in various respects : first , by emphasizing the need to establish a dynamic interaction between exports and investment ; secondly , by showing the importance of mobilizing and making full use of natural resources and abundant , unskilled labour and of continuously upgrading industries and moving up the technological ladder ; and thirdly , by pointing to the challenges for government policies involving new forms of intervention to support a dynamic process of development .  
In view of the acute external financial constraints and low levels of domestic savings in most African countries , there was a pressing need to improve their capacity to attract foreign investment , in the process drawing investors ' attention to the considerable opportunities existing in all major economic sectors , namely natural resources , agro-industry , other manufacturing , tourism , other services , and infrastructure .  
In spite of all these setbacks , African countries had pressed ahead with efforts to facilitate the effective development and utilization of human resources , harness their vast natural resources , mobilize both domestic and foreign financial resources for development and strengthen regional and subregional cooperation and integration .  
In view of the enormous negative effects of natural disasters on the economic and social development of countries , national , regional and international programmes for sustainable development should always take into consideration activities for disaster prevention , preparedness and mitigation .  
MANOR ( Israel ) , speaking in explanation of vote before the voting , said that the draft resolution was superfluous because the issue of rights over natural resources had been covered in the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement signed on 28 September 1995 , and should be settled within the framework of the direct negotiations on permanent status already under way .  
Today , the infrastructure in remote and rural areas can be significantly improved through satellite remote sensing , particularly with respect to natural disaster warning and mitigation , management of water , forest and food resources , planning and operation of transport systems and other supporting activities relating to social and economic development .  
" Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
" Noting also that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base , and recent natural disasters ,  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
" Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island States and landlocked countries ,

Recognizing the need for coordinated humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for immediate relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , which are not necessarily sequential and often proceed at the same time ,  
Encourages Governments to ensure coherence in the direction given to the governing bodies of relevant organizations , funds and programmes of the United Nations system , and to thereby promote the development and strengthening of the cooperation between these organizations and the Department of Humanitarian Affairs , drawing on the mandate , expertise and respective strengths and available capabilities of each , to improve the system-wide capability for a quick and coordinated response to complex humanitarian emergencies and natural disasters ;  
This enhanced capacity is already going beyond the provision of such data as natural attrition rates , by working to introduce analysis of projected staffing and organizational structures at the macro , organizational level , and skill and staff needs required at the micro , departmental level .  
Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General , [ 1 ] in particular of the attention paid by the Secretary-General to effectiveness , accountability and transparency in humanitarian assistance under increasingly complex operational environments and the need for further efforts to identify and support the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , Taking note of the establishment , within the Department of Humanitarian Affairs , of Reliefweb , for the dissemination of reliable and timely information on natural disasters and other emergencies ,

The participants of the Second United Nations Regional Conference on Space Technology for Sustainable Development in Africa noted that , as it has been proven in other parts of the world , space technology has tremendous potential for contributing to the economic and social development of countries in Africa , particularly through the improved management of the environment , improved communications , enhanced food security , delivery of services in health care and education , and the mitigation of natural disasters , just to name a few .  
The environmental policy sought to reconcile economic development with natural resource conservation and to make the high quality of the environment a key element in supporting the country 's economic and social development .  
In conclusion , the FAO report entitled " World Agriculture : Towards 2010 " addressed many issues related to Agenda 21 , in particular the technical and environmental challenges to sustainable agricultural development and the potential for future agricultural growth ; studies of technology reviews ; the natural resource base ; prevailing agricultural policies ; trade liberalization ; the trade-offs between the environment and agricultural development ; and implications for the future .  
According to article 31 , such law includes Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) , in which the Security Council determined , acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter , that Iraq is liable under international law for any direct loss , damage , including environmental damage and the depletion of natural resources , or injury to foreign Governments , nationals and corporations , as a result of Iraqs unlawful invasion and occupation of Kuwait . 
The Global Conference on Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States , held at Bridgetown , Barbados , in 1994 , noted that small island developing States are prone to extremely damaging natural disasters , primarily in the form of severe weather , volcanic eruptions and earth-quakes ( A / CONF . 167 / 9 ) .  
Humanitarian emergency situations have become more frequent , more widespread , more complex and long lasting , combining interstate and internal conflicts , large-scale displacements of people , mass famine , disruption of economic , political and social institutions , and , in some cases natural disasters .  
The adoption of this theme highlighted the emphasis given by the international community to voluntary repatriation as a durable solution and asserted that a natural extension of that emphasis is the increased importance attached to the prevention of forced displacement .  
In response to that suggestion it was observed that in legal systems that recognized insolvency proceedings of natural persons , such as individual traders or merchants , it would sometimes be difficult to establish a clear distinction between the debtors business and personal affairs , and that proceedings apparently falling in the latter category might well have influence on the debtors assets and liabilities .  
Barbados shares the anxiety of small developing States , which are highly vulnerable to marginalization in this fiercely competitive environment given our sparse natural and human-resource base and limited administrative and technical capacity .  
It is our earnest desire to take maximum advantage of the rich potential of our natural resources and to use them in a sustainable and balanced manner with a view to creating wealth and a better future for our people .  
It has paid special attention to external humanitarian assistance issues and has provided unparalleled assistance to many developing countries , particularly those which have suffered natural disasters and civil and regional wars .  
Taking full advantage of historical affinities , cultural ties and religious bonds and sparing no effort to utilize in an efficient and coordinated manner the human and natural potential and resources of the region constitute the single best long-term guarantee of security and tranquillity .  
The concept of sustainable development as a mean between the imperatives of development and the protection and conservation of the physical environment , including our natural resources , calls for the promotion of an international economic environment that is conducive to and supportive of the development efforts of all countries , particularly those of the developing world , many of which are still grappling with the provision of basic social services for their populations .  
Where Stockholm adopted an issue-oriented approach to pollution and non-renewable resource depletion , Rio emphasized integrated strategies to promote human development through economic growth based on sustainable management of the natural resource base .  
In 25 years , the population debate has evolved dramatically from a narrow focus on population size and growth rates to a more integrated agenda embracing demographic structures , distribution patterns and urbanization , levels of exploitation of natural resources , and creation of viable agricultural and industrial infrastructures .  
Small island developing States possess unique characteristics , including fragile ecosystems , small land area and limited natural resources , which make them significantly more vulnerable to environmental degradation and human health problems resulting from inadequate management of wastes .  
For instance , there is need to identify ecologically endangered areas where overexploitation of natural resources and rapid population growth create serious problems : forested uplands , coastal fishing areas , small-holder agriculture in lowland areas , arid grazing lands and tropical forests .  
Environmentally induced migrations are caused by natural disasters , such as earthquakes , flash flooding , typhoons , and volcanic eruptions ; by nuclear and hazardous waste contamination ; by agricultural and rural decline , resource pollution , chronic water shortages ; or by dam construction and other large-scale development projects .  
Very often , large-scale and sudden movements into areas of already declining environmental and socio-economic conditions lead to a reduction in migrants ' well-being ; damage to the natural resource base on which the local economy depends ; economic and political difficulties for the host areas ; and erosion of efforts made by Governments and the international community to support sustainable development in both areas of origin and host areas .  
Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island developing States and landlocked countries ,  
Reaffirms the need to support the implementation of the Yokohama Strategy and its Plan of Action with particular regard to improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , for the purpose of capacity-building and human resources development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , as well as least developed , small island developing and landlocked countries ;  
In the case of small island developing States , as for developing countries as a whole , the percentage of bilateral and multilateral commitments of ODA has risen for environmental protection and natural resource management and for basic social services ( see tables 7 and 8 ) .  
UNCTAD also maintains close relations with , and participates as required in meetings of , a wide range of international commodity bodies , including the organizations for cocoa , jute , natural rubber , olive oil , sugar , tropical timber ; the International Cotton Advisory Committee ; and the study groups for copper , lead and zinc , and nickel .  
In the context of the discussion of paragraph ( 3 ) , a question was raised as to whether the reference to keys of natural and legal persons provided sufficient guidance in situations where cryptographic keys were issued directly to electronic devices , or used by such devices , in the absence of direct human intervention .  
It was decided that the general definition of certification authority should be based on the text of paragraph ( 3 ) of draft article B . It was agreed that the reference to natural and legal persons should be complemented by a reference to electronic devices , which should be placed between square brackets , pending future consideration by the Working Group .  
The Trust Fund so established is open to voluntary financial contributions from States , inter-governmental organizations , regional economic integration organizations , national institutions and non-governmental organizations as well as natural and juridical persons .  
Other important factors in many regions include illegal logging ; illegal land occupation and illegal cultivation ; grazing pressures ; unsustainable agriculture ; the demand for fuelwood and charcoal to meet basic energy needs ; refugee-related problems ; mining and oil exploitation in forested countries not conducted in accordance with appropriate national legislation ; and natural climatic events and forest fires .  
While recognizing that forest land rehabilitation would be required in many areas and that that would need international assistance , including financial resources and technology transfer to support local and national efforts , the Panel emphasized the need for prevention , rather than mitigation and restoration , wherever practicable , with emphasis on improved and sustainable management of existing natural forest and other vegetation .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Noting also that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base , and recent natural disasters ,  
Although dependence on imported oil and coal for total energy requirements is not expected to be reduced , natural gas is anticipated to have an increasing role in electricity production and in the residential heating market .  
All relevant actors should be encouraged to work in partnership with adolescent girls and boys , utilizing both formal and non-formal educational training activities , inter alia , through sustainable consumption patterns and responsible use of natural resources .  
The view was expressed that in view of the special characteristics of the geostationary orbit , there was a need to establish a sui generis legal regime for regulating access to and use of that orbit , which was a limited natural resource , and that such a regime should guarantee actual and future equitable access to the geostationary orbit for all States , taking into particular account the needs of developing countries , including the equatorial countries , because of their special geographical characteristics .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , economic and sexual exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance and disability , and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,

The main objectives of the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources Development will be to promote regional and subregional cooperation for sustainable development and to strengthen national capacities in the field of the environment , including integration of environmental concerns into development strategies , in line with the provisions of Agenda 21 and other subsequent decisions ; development and management of natural resources , including water , mineral and energy resources ( excluding infrastructural aspects of electric power ) ; diffusion and management of environmentally sound technologies ; space technology applications ; and natural disaster reduction .  
Recognizing the respect for the environment accorded by the cultures of indigenous peoples of the Americas , and considering the special relationship between the indigenous peoples and the environment , lands , resources and territories on which they live and their natural resources .  Recognizing that in many indigenous cultures , traditional collective systems for control and use of land and territory and resources , including bodies of water and coastal areas , are a necessary condition for their survival , social organization , development and their individual and collective well-being . . .  
The role of the geospatial framework was recognized as critical for economic and sustainable development and the integration of the " 3S technologies " ( remote sensing , GPS and GIS ) was seen as essential for efficient management of natural resources .  
An appeal by the special session to the Governments of the Russian Federation and the United States of America to consider the rational employment of their missile and nuclear potential as a contribution of these two countries to common efforts to ensure sustainable development and preservation of the natural environment of this earth ; to start - should the response of the two Governments be positive - developing relevant international programmes and projects ensuring respect for the regime of non-proliferation of nuclear and missile technologies and for intellectual property rights ;  
Commit ourselves to securing the participation of all actors of civil society , in particular women , youth and children , and voluntary organizations , in the national efforts towards implementation of Agenda 21 , and decide to promote regional camps for schoolchildren and encourage their active participation in environmental protection and sustainable management of natural resources ;  
Recognizing that United Nations organs and Member States have increasingly acknowledged that lands and natural resources are essential to the Economic and cultural survival of indigenous peoples , and that some States have enacted legal measures that uphold indigenous land rights or have established procedures for arriving at legally binding agreements on indigenous land _ related issues ,  
During the FAO regional conference for Latin America and the Caribbean , held in Paraguay in July 1996 , it had been determined that , based on available natural , human and technological resources , the region could set two complementary goals for the year 2010 : to reduce malnutrition from 15 per cent in the period 1991-1992 to 6 per cent , and to ensure that the nutrition supply should be no less than 2,700 calories per person per day in any country .  
Legacies to future generations are a collective responsibility of todays citizens be this the legacy of natural capital ( the environment ) , physical capital ( infrastructure , plant and equipment ) , financial capital ( savings ) , social capital ( institutions and structures ) and cultural capital ( the values , principles and concepts that are handed down ) . 
Countries need to systematically increase the use of renewable energy sources according to their specific social , economic , natural , geographical and climatic conditions and cleaner fuel technologies , including fossil fuel technologies , and to improve efficiency in energy production , distribution and use and in other industrial production processes that are intensive users of energy ;  
These initiatives focused on increased use of alternative transportation fuels ( e.g . , natural gas ) , support for urban public transport , and improved transportation planning and regulation .  
That Constitution included clear provisions concerning collective land ownership , the management of natural resources , recognition of indigenous forms of government and administration , protection of the identity and cultural heritage of the indigenous peoples , the official status of the languages and dialects they used and the creation of special electoral districts ensuring their representation in Congress .  
Humanitarian emergency situations have become more frequent , more widespread , more complex and longer lasting , combining inter-State and internal conflicts , large-scale displacements of people , mass famine , disruption of economic , political and social institutions and , in some cases , natural disasters .  
To recognize the ethnic and cultural existence of Argentine indigenous peoples ; to guarantee respect for identity and the right to bilingual and cross-cultural education ; to recognize the legal personality of indigenous communities and community ownership of the land they traditionally occupy ; to establish regulations for the handing over of other land that is suitable and sufficient for human development , none such land being inalienable , transmissible or subject to taxes or charges ; and to guarantee their participation in the management of their natural resources and other matters of interest to them .  
The efficient work of the IDNDR national committees of France , Germany and the United Kingdom must be commended , especially in relation to the planning and organization of relevant central events of the final phase of the Decade , such as the conference on early warning systems with regard to natural and similar disasters scheduled to take place at Potsdam , Germany , in 1998 ;  
The IDNDR secretariat successfully completed its current work programme for early warning , with regard to natural disasters , in response to Assembly resolution 50 / 117 B . Six international expert groups were convened to examine scientific knowledge and public practices that could contribute to more accurate and timely short-term forecasting and warning applications for natural and similar disasters . 
In its resolution 51 / 185 , the Assembly recognized the paramount importance of a well-structured and coherent process towards the conclusion of the Decade , and requested proposals concerning the shape and form of natural disaster reduction activities in the twenty-first century and regarding the format , substance and timing of a closing event for the Decade with a view to enabling a forceful launching of the preparatory process as early as possible in 1998 .  
It focuses on the implementation of crucial activities that exemplify the Decade 's objective to reduce through concerted international action , especially in developing countries , the loss of life , property damage , and social and economic disruption caused by natural and similar disasters that have an adverse impact upon the environment .  
According to these targets , by the year 2000 all countries should have in place , as part of their national plans to achieve sustainable development , ( a ) comprehensive national assessments of risks from natural hazards integrated into development plans , ( b ) mitigation plans of practical measures for application at national and local levels to address long-term disaster prevention , preparedness and community awareness , and ( c ) ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems .  
A second pre-requisite for effective warning is both the understanding by a vulnerable population of the hazards to which it may be exposed and an appreciation of the natural forces that can destroy elements of their economic livelihood and social well-being .  
These existing arrangements demonstrate the feasibility of international and regional agreements to practical institutional arrangements , which could have wider application for the sustained monitoring of continuing natural hazard risks .  
An important outcome of the World Conference on Natural Disaster Reduction was the recognition of the close linkages between disaster losses and environmental degradation , as emphasized in Agenda 21.2 More specifically , the Conference reaffirmed Principle 18 of the Rio Declaration , 3 which stressed the need for the international community to assist States afflicted by natural disasters and other emergencies that are likely to produce sudden harmful effects to the environment . 
Technologies associated with space-based and terrestrial remote sensing , geographic information systems , satellite observation and communications , mathematical modelling of event scenarios , and the entire field of global communications have revolutionized the ability to monitor , analyze and disseminate accurate and timely information about natural hazards .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , poverty , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , racism and all forms of intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger , disability , and drug abuse , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Success in the thematic area of environment and development will be measured by : ( a ) the relevance of the new knowledge and methods produced for policy decision ; ( b ) the actual participation of pertinent decision makers in considering the proposed alternatives ; and ( c ) the extent of involvement of interested parties in consensus-building for policy decisions and of partnerships forged , joint initiatives funded and programmes launched relating to the management of common natural resources .  
All RCF programmes for Asia and the Pacific are based on one or more of the following regional criteria : sharing and / or pooling resources ( including intellectual and natural resources ) ; addressing trans-boundary issues ; addressing a common need or common problem ; and developing or promoting agreed upon regional regimes , norms or policies .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , poverty , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , racism and all forms of intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger , disability , and drug abuse , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
It was suggested that such opportunities may be found in the sectors where developing countries have ( i ) natural and geographical advantages ; ( ii ) an education and training basis to provide skilled workers ; ( iii ) the competitive advantage provided by lower wages ; and ( iv ) the possibility to cut the cost of services further , utilizing the communication and transport technology .  
For example , the parties involved in the projects conducted geological studies and a national inventory of natural resources in Madagascar , established a forest inventory in Tunisia , created an agricultural land information system in Egypt and an action plan for flood control in Bangladesh , controlled resettlement of refugees in Cambodia , and prepared a demographic census in Nigeria , a dam site impact study in Cameroon , erosion studies in Chile and a cartographic survey of mine dumps in South Africa .  
Recognizes that the White Helmets , as an operational partner of the United Nations Volunteers , are an efficient and viable mechanism for making pre-identified and trained homogenous teams available to the United Nations system , in support of immediate relief , rehabilitation , reconstruction and development activities , in the light of the increasing number and growing magnitude and complexity of natural disasters and other emergencies ;  
First , it should be noted that some replies do not correspond to the request for information made by the Secretary _ General , but they have nevertheless been included because they provided material for discussion on the realization of economic , social and cultural rights with regard to social measures at the national level , the right to self-determination and the right of countries to sovereignty over their natural resources .  
Its major commercial applications included coastal zone and environmental monitoring , marine navigation , offshore oil and gas operation , natural disaster mitigation and coastal and deep ocean fishing .  
In addition , information is provided on the serious problems facing the Cuban economy resulting from the severance of economic relations with the former Soviet Union and the countries of Eastern Europe , which were Cuba 's main trading partners ; the effects of the almost 40-year economic , commercial and financial blockade of Cuba ; problems affecting its principal exports , especially cane sugar ; and natural disasters , including hurricanes and tropical storms and infestation by a new agricultural pest .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Noting also that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base , and recent natural disasters ,  
We , the United Nations Member States and observer States , have agreed to adopt the Agenda for Development , thus holding forth a global promissory note and universal hope for the millions of our people throughout the entire world who daily go without sufficient food and water , who battle diseases and natural disasters , who can not read or write , who lack shelter , who are jobless , whose entire lives are stunted and who are deprived of the simple pleasures of human existence because of poverty . 
Those included : exposures from natural sources of radiation ; exposures from man-made sources of radiation ; medical radiation exposures ; occupational radiation exposures ; dose assessment methodologies ; epidemiological evaluation of radiation-induced cancer ; deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) repair and mutagenesis ; hereditary effects of radiation ; combined effects of radiation and other agents ; models , mechanisms and uncertainties at low doses ; and local exposures and effects of the Chernobyl accident .  
Aware that global increases in population , rising levels of urbanization and unsustainable patterns of consumption and production , particularly in developed countries , are stressing the finite natural resource base , stressing fragile ecosystems and causing environmental degradation and adverse health effects ,  
Many countries , including Peru , are currently facing a cyclical , worldwide natural phenomenon known as El Ni �� , whose severe economic , environmental and social consequences are drastically changing the marine environment , which is a source of food and employment for broad sectors of humankind .  
Malta fully supports the efforts of the Organization in the promotion of environmental protection and the sustainable use of the world \ x { e5b8 } natural resources to ensure a more equitable distribution of wealth , and of an international trade regime free of restrictive or discriminatory practices .  
Albania has a peculiar history of chronic isolation , of almost total estrangement from the rest of the world , of great potential , human and natural wealth , while being , at the same time , underdeveloped and poor .  Our difficulties of growth are directly linked to the legacies of former rules and half a century of communism , of non-existent , non-functioning or malfunctioning democratic institutions , both during and after the collapse of communism and its structures , as well as with our mentality .  
We are therefore pursuing economic , social and infrastructural development in a sustainable way which avoids environmental degradation , conserves our natural resource endowment and helps to build and maintain a long-term national capacity to support rising standards of living for the population , as well as opportunities for self-actualization .  
The Democratic Republic of the Congo is among the few countries that from time immemorial , owing to its geostrategic placement and its vast human and natural resources , has borne the burden of a sombre history of suffering and outrageous violations of human rights and the rights of peoples .  
This integration is of great benefit to national and foreign investors thanks to the country 's economic and other potential such as its geographical location , in relation to major regional markets , its transit role , its role as a supplier of hydroelectric power to neighbouring countries and export producer , using the country 's raw materials , and its innumerable natural tourist attractions .  
For its part the Government of Benin , while awaiting the fulfilment of that hope , has developed the concept of a shared social minimum level in order methodically and effectively to take actions and measures aimed at eliminating poverty , hunger , disease and illiteracy , providing adequate housing , guaranteeing productive employment , improving standards and conditions of living and ensuring the sustainable use of natural resources .  
Today we are witnessing the emergence of new forms of transnational crime : money-laundering or the investment of capital generated by activities that are usually interconnected , including drug-trafficking , corruption , traffic in weapons , terrorism , traffic in nuclear and toxic material , traffic in protected natural resources , traffic in human beings , removal of organs , and more .  
However , if one were to consider these few achievements against the background of an extremely fragile economy deprived of natural resources , and a high dependency on tourism and fisheries both of which are susceptible to global economic change and environmental and other external factors the whole scenario could easily change from a happy and promising one to an obscure and insecure one .  
Among the key objectives of this policy are the sustainable development of the region , based on overcoming poverty , and the participation of organized civil society and the population in general , as well as environmental preservation and the rational and sustainable use of natural resources .  
An essential element in propagating a culture of peace is to refrain from implementing policies that would widen the gulf between the rich developed countries and poor third world countries , unable to ensure growth , to make the best use of their natural and human resources , with the resultant unemployment , financial deficit and indebtedness worsening year after year .  
However , the management of natural resources and human settlements , the provision of basic social services , the support required for targeted programmes for poverty alleviation , the correction of acute gender disabilities , social protection , employment generation and skill development , the improvements sought in public administration and governance all priorities defined by the global community are typically activities that require public resources spent through public entities .  
It is precisely because of our recognition of the specific and peculiar problems faced by the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories most of which are small island Territories that suffer from impediments created by the interplay of such factors as economic and geographic size , isolation , vulnerability to natural disasters and lack of technological and financial resources , including problems of accessibility to international credit markets that the international community should give specific priority and attention to the process of decolonization affecting the peoples of those Territories . 
It is also natural for Algeria to plead for a global and integrated approach to the security and development of the Mediterranean , convinced as it is that there can be no genuine security for all as long as serious and intolerable imbalances persist between the northern and southern shores of the Mediterranean .  
Reduction of poverty requires not just providing goods and services to people living in poverty but also improving opportunities for access to productive resources and capital accumulation , including human capital ( education , health ) , financial capital ( microcredit ) , physical capital ( appropriate technology ) and natural resources ( land , water , energy ) .  
The Government of Iraq noted its cooperation with States and international organizations and its solidarity with the endeavours of the United Nations and the humanitarian organizations , particularly in the field of human rights , with a view to establishing an early _ warning system to avoid the problem of mass exodus or to address it when it was brought about by causes such as natural disasters or regional or international armed conflicts forcing the population of a State to enter neighbouring States .  
Historical data on consumption of fuelwood are scarce but it is estimated that today some 1.8-billion-m3 , more than half of the total volume of wood produced , is consumed as fuel . 7 Fuelwood consumption is leading in some areas to deforestation , soil impoverishment and further hardship for the poor , who are dependent on the natural resource base for their day-to-day survival . 
The persistence of current trends in a number of critical issues , according to the Conventional Development Scenario and other leading " business-as-usual " projections , will lead to continuing poverty and declining quality of life in some developing regions , especially in urban areas , increasing competition over use rights to natural resources and worsening environmental degradation .  
As noted above , while there has been a rapid development of land-related information systems in those economies having access to adequate financial and technological resources , information systems in many developing countries have been severely limited by the non-availability of basic natural resource data and information , by undeveloped market infrastructure , and by a lack of institutional capability .  
The following important common policy approaches are emerging in the promotion of SARD : ( a ) the use of economic incentives to guide sustainable agricultural practices ; ( b ) education and information exchange for human development ; ( c ) the development and transfer of new and appropriate technologies ; ( d ) farm and off-farm employment for alleviating poverty ; ( e ) sound natural resource management leading to environmental protection ; and ( f ) focusing on men and women farmers themselves .  
Noting also that the unfavourable situation of the Comoros , which is on the list of least developed countries , is aggravated by several important factors , including its physical distance from its trading partners , the scarcity of natural resources , the diminutive size of the domestic market , the fall in prices of its export products and the poverty of its soil ,  
At the theoretical level , the Conference scientifically established the organic interrelationship between the natural state of mountains and climatic conditions arising in mountainous areas , on the one hand , and the disruption of the ecological balance and level of social and economic development of peoples living in mountainous areas , on the other .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
Recognizing the need for coordinated humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for immediate relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , which are not necessarily sequential and often proceed at the same time ,  
Encourages Governments to ensure coherence in the direction given to the governing bodies of relevant organizations , funds and programmes of the United Nations system , and to thereby promote the development and strengthening of the cooperation between these organizations and the Department of Humanitarian Affairs , drawing on the mandate , expertise and respective strengths and available capabilities of each , to improve the system-wide capability for a quick and coordinated response to complex humanitarian emergencies and natural disasters ;  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , poverty , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , racism and all forms of intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger , disability and drug abuse , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
By its own definition , Executive Outcomes is a company devoted to providing highly skilled and confidential military advisor services and to furnishing personnel , mainly military and highly skilled , to provide strategic and tactical training services in countries requiring sophisticated , effective support for the adequate control of their socio-political reality , to put an end to internal conflicts and to encourage the development of economic activities related to natural and mineral resource development .  
Most representatives agreed with the Commission 's proposed approach to separate consideration of the question of the nationality of natural persons from that of the nationality of legal persons and to give priority to the former , which , it was argued , involved human rights , while the latter raised problems of an economic order .  
All relevant actors should be encouraged to work in partnership with adolescent girls and boys , utilizing both formal and non-formal educational training activities , inter alia , through sustainable consumption patterns and responsible use of natural resources .  
The overall objective of the programme emergency humanitarian assistance , derived from these General Assembly resolutions , is " to ensure better preparation for , as well as a rapid and coherent response to , emergencies , natural and man-made , thus reducing the suffering and loss of human lives and material destruction ; promoting prevention and preparedness ; and ensuring smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation and development " . b  
In resolution 42 / 169 of 11 December 1987 , the General Assembly , " convinced that concerted international action for the reduction of natural disasters over the course of the 1990s would give genuine impetus to a series of concrete measures " decided to designate the 1990s as the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction .  
The Framework contained a set of practical targets to be achieved by the year 2000 : comprehensive national assessments of risks from natural hazards , with these assessments taken into account in planning for sustainable development ; mitigation plans at national and / or local levels , involving long-term prevention , preparedness and community awareness ; and ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems and broad dissemination of warnings .  
Unfortunately , there is no reliable comprehensive data on the economic aspects of natural disasters ; as a result policy makers can not base their decisions on documented facts , and cost-benefit analyses of specific natural disaster prevention or reduction measures are often questionable .  
Recommends that long-term public awareness and information programmes related to natural disasters , including those induced by El Ni �� and similar disasters with an adverse impact on the environment , be integrated into comprehensive national disaster management programmes that focus on preventive strategies for risk reduction and that those programmes be included as integral elements of United Nations support for social and economic development programmes ;  
That position seemed tenable and acceptable inasmuch as it satisfied the main objectives pursued , namely , to reduce to the maximum possible extent the cases of statelessness as a result of State succession and to find a balance between the legitimate interests of successor States in regulating a broad range of issues connected with the attribution of their nationality and the right of natural persons to opt for the nationality of one of the successor States .  
It was therefore deeply concerned about the situation in the occupied territories where the Palestinians continued to be deprived of their basic human rights such as access to education , natural resources and land ownership , further hindering a just and comprehensive settlement and seriously undermining the spirit of trust and cooperation vital to the success of the peace process .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Noting further that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , economic and sexual exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance and disability , and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Considerable efforts have been made everywhere in Africa to revitalize the social sector , minimize needless waste of human and natural resources , promote popular participation and democratic governance , focus world attention on the continent 's needs for a more supportive international economic environment , and reinforce efforts at conflict prevention and resolution .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , economic and sexual exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance and disability , and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
There are , however , signs that the successful implementation of this operation is threatened , primarily because the separatist leadership opposes their return , as is the phased restoration of the natural regional demographics which would be an inevitable consequence of an expanded peacekeeping mandate .  
The adoption of this theme highlighted the emphasis given by the international community to voluntary repatriation as a durable solution and asserted that a natural extension of this emphasis is the increased importance attached to the prevention of forced displacement .  
UNDP assistance under the fifth cycle country programme ( 1992-1996 ) to the Caribbean dependent Territories which includes the Turks and Caicos Islands , had as its principal focus the provision of support for human resource development , capacity-building , institutional strengthening and environment and natural resources management .  With this in view , the proposed strategy of UNDP at the start of the current sixth cycle has been to continue its emphasis on providing support in those areas , building upon the outputs of its previous interventions .  
In addition to general problems facing developing countries , those island Territories also suffer handicaps arising from the interplay of such factors as geographic isolation , vulnerability to natural disasters , the fragility of their ecosystems , constraints in transport and communications , isolation from market centres , limited internal market , lack of natural resources and serious gaps in technological capacities ( in human and material terms ) . 
The High Contracting Parties shall cooperate in the protection and improvement of the environment , the prevention of transboundary pollution , the rational and resource-conserving utilization of the natural environment , the elimination of the consequences of natural and technogenic emergencies and shall promote coordinated action in this area at the regional and global levels with a view to creating a comprehensive system of international environmental safety .  
Humanitarian emergency situations have become more frequent , more widespread , more complex and long lasting , combining interstate and internal conflicts , large-scale displacements of people , mass famine , disruption of economic , political and social institutions , and , in some cases natural disasters .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base , and recent natural disasters ,  
Through participatory action-oriented research methodologies , data have been collected on the most common practices of a number of indigenous peoples in the Philippines in a broad range of domains , including fishing , farming , traditional handicraft production , and land and natural resource management .  
In addition , recognizing the imperative of a conducive policy environment for participation of resource users in conservation and sustainable management of natural resources , the Fund has launched a comprehensive programme of studies to examine pertinent policy and institutional issues at the national and local levels .  
Countries need to systematically increase the use of renewable energy sources according to their specific social , economic , natural , geographical and climatic conditions and cleaner fuel technologies , including fossil fuel technologies , and to improve efficiency in energy production , distribution and use and in other industrial production processes that are intensive users of energy ;  
The sustainable management of natural resources , the combatting of pollution and environmental degradation , the development of human resources through the implementation of a population policy , education and health , regional integration , the creation of productive jobs in rural areas and through the development of the private sector in order to eradicate poverty all these represent the strategic framework which will make it possible to ensure human sustainable development in our country .  
The Commission on Human Settlements , in its resolution 16 / 24 of 7 May 1997 entitled " Special session of the General Assembly for the purpose of an overall review and appraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21 " , reaffirmed that sustainable development was essential for human settlements development and expressed the conviction that urban settlements , properly planned and managed , held a promise for human development and for the protection of the world 's natural resources through their ability to support large numbers of people while limiting their negative impact on the natural environment .  
In addition , such human settlements provide equal opportunity for a productive and freely chosen livelihood ; equal access to economic resources , including the right to inheritance , the ownership of land and other property , credit , natural resources and appropriate technologies ; equal opportunity for personal , spiritual , religious , cultural and social development ; equal opportunity for participation in public decision-making ; equal rights and obligations with regard to the conservation and use of natural and cultural resources ; and equal access to mechanisms to ensure that rights are not violated .  
That occupation represented one of the ugliest forms of occupation in contemporary history , involving expansionist policies and practices , especially in East Jerusalem ; illegal Israeli colonial settlements ; usurpation and exploitation of Palestinian natural resources ; and the building of infrastructure separate from that available to the Palestinian people , all of which represented a unique mixture of colonialism and apartheid-like arrangements .  
There had been thinly veiled attempts at altering the demographic composition and physical characteristics of the occupied Palestinian territory , incessant human rights violations , plundering of the territory 's natural resources and exploitation of its labour force .  
Recognizing that United Nations organs and Member States have increasingly acknowledged that lands and natural resources are essential to the Economic and cultural survival of indigenous peoples , and that some States have enacted legal measures that uphold indigenous land rights or have established procedures for arriving at legally binding agreements on indigenous land _ related issues ,  
The latter provides an incentive to market-based forms of technology and skills transfer both for industrial / infrastructural projects and resource management / preservation ( e.g . enhancing the carbon sequestration service rendered by tropical forests , natural rubber plantations and other commercial tree crops ) in developing countries .  JI projects , in particular in technical infrastructure , may also improve the living conditions of the poor or other disadvantaged groups in developing countries .  
Clear examples and opportunities exist for providing benefits to source countries as well as indigenous and local communities in terms of health improvement , resource management capacity , and sustainable use of natural resources .  The key to its success will be in the ability to provide near - and long-term benefits that effect changes in the behaviour of individuals , communities and private companies , as well as in natural resource policies of both developed and developing country governments .  
In addition to natural capital , physical or produced capital , and to the now widely accepted notion of human capital , social capital refers to the functioning of the various institutions that are critical to individual welfare and social integration .  
Mineral resource development may provide a boost to developing economies otherwise poor in natural and human resources and allow rapid economic growth , provided that the problems of macro-economic stability associated with mineral dependence , in particular the influence of mineral revenues on the real exchange rate and the effect of mining wage rates on overall wage levels , can be mastered .  
For example , the indicators of sustainable development , the impact of economic globalization on the global natural environment , the relationship between sustainable development and sustained economic growth and the monitoring of natural processes at the global level could be addressed under a separate item .  
The Forum recognized the region 's vulnerability to natural disasters , environmental damage and unlawful challenges to national integrity and independence and reaffirmed its commitment to take a comprehensive , integrated and collaborative approach to maintaining and strengthening current mechanisms for cooperation among members in dealing with threats to the security , broadly defined , of States in the region and of the region as a whole .  
Vicious circles of unsound policies , predatory politics , natural disasters , violent conflict and the neglect of the developed countries have isolated large parts of the continent from the mainstream of global development .  
This remains crucial for the economic development of small economies whose vulnerabilities are intensified by our limited access to markets , narrow resource base , small size , inadequate levels of human resource development and proneness to natural disasters .  
We equally recognize that sustainable development in coastal areas is dependent upon an adequate understanding of the interaction between natural assets and social and human capital .  
Although industry is a major user of natural resources and a direct or indirect source of pollution and other environmental impacts , business and industry must remain a key partner in the common endeavour to achieve sustainable development .  
The effects of natural disasters and bad weather on agricultural production notwithstanding , hunger and the lack of sustainable agricultural development were not solely the result of chance but rather of human choices and poor decisions .  
With the encroachment of agriculture on natural or quasi-natural ecosystems , plant and animal genetic resources are being lost , modern cultivars are replacing local ones and intensive livestock production systems are developing .  
Conflict , whether at the international , State , or community level , can be considered a natural , inevitable consequence of differing interests , goals or values which may be exacerbated by ethnic , racial , cultural and linguistic differences .  
In natural monopolies , regulation focuses primarily on the production of the socially desirable level of services at economic prices , in particular by limiting the opportunities for the public service provider to collect monopoly rents .  
Due to their size , most of these Territories are not endowed with natural resources and are subject to regular natural disasters , global warming , desalination of water sources , dependency on few commodities and a high level of emigration .  
This inalienable right invests colonized and dependent countries with the power freely to determine their political status , freely to pursue their economic , social and cultural development and freely to dispose of their natural wealth and resources .  
Ongoing civil and international conflicts , financial crises and natural disasters around the world ( including volcanic eruptions , hurricanes , tidal waves and floods ) have had severe impacts on the efficacy and efficiency in the delivery of social services .  
While habitual residence constituted a very close link between a natural person and a State , there were also ethnic , linguistic , religious , cultural , social and political factors which were often very important in the case of succession of States .  
The urbanization trends experienced by developed countries until the 1950s suggested that the increasing concentration of the urban population in ever larger urban centres was a natural concomitant of the rising proportion of people living in urban areas .  
Full bathymetric models in three dimensions may be required in order to gain a spatial understanding of natural prolongation and may be essential in selecting the full extent of the 2,500 m isobath relevant to the determination of the 100 M outer limit .  
Endowed with abundant natural resources , it is a promising continent with limitless potential in international economic development .  
The majority of the reports indicate social / cultural benefits , including active involvement of local communities , increased public awareness , and maintenance of natural heritage and historical sites , as well as cleaner air .  
Globalization phenomena should not be considered only for their impact on physical and financial capital flows , but also on human and natural capital , as well as on national sovereignty and cultural diversity , including at the local and community level .  
Added to these natural disasters are man-made catastrophes like widespread minefields , the dumping of radioactive and toxic wastes , the growing number of regional and internal civil wars and the ensuing problems of refugees and famine .  
The smallness of small island developing States means that natural disasters combine with other environmental , social , and economic processes , such as climate change , ozone depletion , sea level rise , freshwater shortages , deforestation , economic marginalization consequent to trade liberalization and globalization , and growing poverty , to compound the intensity of risks .  
The effects of the El Nio Southern Oscillation , the disastrous impacts of hurricanes George and Mitch , the rising costs of natural disasters to small island developing States and the growing impact on their fragile economies are sufficient reason to launch national , regional and global consultations on the necessity for strengthening disaster prevention and preparedness measures and policies to attenuate the impacts of natural disasters on an urgent basis .  
No one can deny that the negative trends of these last decades of the twentieth century are slow to reverse .  These include growing poverty , the marginalization of hundreds of millions of people , the precarious state of natural resources , the degradation of biological diversity , the destruction of forests , worsening pollution , rampant desertification , and so many other examples .  
We believe that economic policies must be better coordinated with environmental policies and that the sustainability of our natural resources is essential , today and in the future , if we are to eliminate poverty and achieve equitable , just and participatory development throughout the world .  
It was argued , moreover , that the text failed to embody important principles such as the sovereign right of States to exploit their own natural resources according to their own policies , the concept of common but differentiated responsibility and the international consensus on the right to development ; it was also considered unfortunate that none of the draft articles had been devoted specifically to the need for an overall balance between environmental and developmental imperatives .  
While it is estimated that only half of the total natural ( and semi-natural ) forest area is currently available for wood production as a consequence of economic and physical inaccessibility , there are no apparent constraints in production and consumption at the global level .  
Second , financial aspects , recognizing that it is very difficult to rely on mobilizing domestic financial resources in very poor and populous countries where natural resources are degraded , and international cooperation will need to play a very key role .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territorys deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
A protected area may be defined as an area of land and / or sea especially dedicated to the protection and maintenance of biological diversity , and of natural and associated cultural values , and managed through legal or other effective means .  
The way in which natural resources are managed at the national level expressed in explicit or implicit policies was also identified as a major underlying cause .  
But implementation of these policies will have little impact on long _ term sustainable development , sound management of natural resources , or on the reduction of poverty and inequality unless accompanied by fundamental transformation of unjust economic and political structures both at national and global levels .  
The legislation gives priority to countries which have demonstrated a sustained commitment to poverty alleviation or have recently suffered a major natural disaster , but it excludes countries with excessive military spending , gross violations of human rights , blatant drug trafficking or ethnic conflicts ;  
The unknown and unpredictable costs associated with such risks as contractual disputes , unfunded liabilities , business interruption or losses due to civil strife , natural disasters , etc . , make it difficult to use a strict formula to determine the protection needed .  
It was , therefore , discouraging to note that , in addition to suffering from long-standing problems , such as declining commodity prices and worsening terms of trade , the developing countries were also having to face new problems as a result of developments in the world economy , current international economic problems and even natural phenomena , the direct and indirect effects of which had exacerbated their problems . 
It made it more difficult for developing countries to make use of their traditional comparative advantages , such as cheap labour and abundant natural resources , since industrial and technological capacity with a solid infrastructural base , adequate human resources and business development were increasingly determinants of economic growth and sustainable development .  
The social , economic and environmental challenges extended far beyond the capacity of individual countries and required a global effort to protect the earths ecosystem and to promote social development and economic growth in a manner which would also preserve natural resources . 
In order to guarantee international security and stability , the United Nations must also , in the context of the current reform process , reassess and redefine its responses to current problems , particularly extreme inequalities with respect to international trade and capital flows , the continual deterioration of the terms of trade , external debt , population growth , the problem of migration , the depletion of natural resources and environmental constraints .  
The Anti _ Racism Information Service suggested that the following issues could provide input into recommendations : racial discrimination in the workplace ; migration and related questions ; neo _ Nazism ; Holocaust denial ; the caste system ; inclusion of anti _ racist thought in education ; negative consequences of international trade and globalization ; the despoliation of nature and the overexploitation of natural resources ; ethnocide , ethnic cleansing and violence against women in ethnic conflict .  
While it was true that financial mediation systems were needed , and that economic activity implied a certain degree of commercial activity , it should nevertheless be remembered that microcredit functioned at the level of the individual household , existed in a natural form and was not intended to transform poor women into economic agents like their counterparts in developed countries .  
At the national level , the causes of poverty in many developing countries included inadequate national economic policies , the insufficiency or lack of a natural resource base and external economic shocks such as external debt , unfavourable terms of trade and reduced official development assistance .  
Aid programmes are intended to consolidate the new constitutional system , as well as social programmes , the development of technical assistance projects , the supply of equipment , human resources development , strengthening of the productive sectors , improvement of the environment , conservation of natural resources and the modernization of public administration .  
Therefore , international efforts to bridge the gap between developing and developed countries should be intensified through the implementation of an information strategy on aspects of globalization relating to social justice and the understanding among peoples that strengthened assistance to developing countries , vulnerable population groups and the victims of armed conflicts , human rights violations and natural disasters . 
They highlighted the disadvantages that derive from their location and physical characteristics dispersion of islands over large areas in the case of archipelagic small island developing States ; recurrent damages inflicted on small island developing States located in the cyclonic belt by natural disasters , such as hurricanes ; overuse , rapid depletion and degradation of natural resources on account of their paucity relative to the demand for them .  
The article states that United States and British forces fired more than 1-million depleted uranium rounds , weighing 315 tons , and that this was the first time that the toxic metal , a waste product left when natural uranium is refined to make weapons or fuel , was used in war .  
Furthermore , labour-intensive public works can be effective for creating employment and productive infrastructure not only in situations linked to war , natural disasters or economic emergencies but also in a variety of regular investment programmes which can provide sustainable employment to those working in agriculture or in the informal economy .  
The main economic determinants are : the size of domestic market ; spatial distribution of natural and created resource endowments ; input prices , quality and productivity of labour ; international transport and communications costs .  
Enhanced national capacity for integrating environmental considerations into economic and social policies ; improvement of energy efficiency and conservation potentials ; wider application of renewable energy technologies ; formulation and implementation of integrated development and management policies in the water , mineral and marine resources sectors ; natural disaster preparedness and mitigation ; and application of space technology through human resources development activities ;  
Protocol I additional to the 1949 Geneva Conventions , relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts , article 35 , paragraph 3 : " It is prohibited to employ methods or means of warfare which are intended , or may be expected , to cause widespread , long-term and severe damage to the natural environment " .  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily _ indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
Tourism had the potential to make an important contribution to poverty alleviation and economic advancement , particularly through integrated plans with the inclusion of local stakeholders in planning and development and where a key objective remained the protection of the cultural and natural assets of the tourist locality .  
Protocol I additional to the 1949 Geneva Conventions , relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts , article 35 , paragraph 3 : It is prohibited to employ methods or means of warfare which are intended , or may be expected , to cause widespread , long-term and severe damage to the natural environment .  * E / 1999 / 100 .  
It might consider such issues as ( a ) financial leakages and how to maximize benefits for local communities , ( b ) preparing a joint initiative to improve information availability and capacity-building for participation , thus enabling communities to manage social and environmental change and ( c ) developing a plan to ensure indigenous peoples and other local communities their rights to land , water and other natural resources .  
The Trust Fund so established is open to voluntary financial contributions from States , inter-governmental organizations , regional economic integration organizations , national institutions and non-governmental organizations as well as natural and juridical persons .  
Actions were elaborated to target , inter alia , strengthening coordination between national and local support strategies and institutions ; strengthening institutional capacities for supporting small and medium enterprises in key agro-industrial subsectors ; and improving national capacities in the sustainable management of natural resources , with emphasis on the conservation of biodiversity and exploitation of its business opportunities .  
Recent global conferences have highlighted human-centred economic growth ; basic physical infrastructures ; fundamental social services ; access to work ; land and credit ; empowerment of women ; food security ; natural resources regeneration ; good governance ; and vulnerable groups as the priorities in efforts to achieve the overarching objective to eradicate poverty .  
It was the responsibility of the international community to ensure the maintenance of UNRWA services at acceptable levels , in terms of quantity and quality , as defined by the needs of the refugee community , and to ensure that service levels kept pace with the steady natural growth of the refugee population .  21 .  The Working Group expressed alarm at the continuing negative effects of five years of austerity measures .  
When a State declares an indigenous territory as protected area , any lands , territories and resources under potential or actual claim by indigenous peoples , conservation areas shall not be subject to any natural resource development without the informed consent and participation of the peoples concerned .  
The aggressor 's daily targets are national parks , nature reservations , monuments of cultural and natural heritage , rare and protected plants and animal species , among which are those of international importance .  
While pointing out that peace was a prerequisite for development , a number of delegations stated that , in recent years , armed conflict had exacted and was continuing to exact a heavy toll on human settlements and human settlements development and several called on the Centre to provide reconstruction assistance to countries and regions afflicted by armed conflict and natural and man-made disasters .  
In the field of natural gas , two projects technological and ecological norms , required for the design and operation of the gas distribution networks , and existing standards and regulations on permissible concentrations of harmful components in gaseous fuels and gaseous fuels combustion products have been launched .  
The group is helping to prepare case studies in rural and urban areas on the linkages between ecological factors , disaster preparedness and the level of damages sustained by natural phenomena , as well as to formulate regional projects for presentation to the international community .  
This is one of the most rapidly progressing and developing national sectors and signifies a major extension of satellite communication coverage , providing communities with a greater range of local telephone and radio services , which have been used , for example , for communications to and from regions hit by natural disasters , with a consequent improvement in the utilization of the resources assigned to disaster management .  
It has had the objective of reducing through concerted international action , especially in developing countries , loss of life , property damage and social and economic disruption caused by natural hazards , including earthquakes , tropical cyclones and other storms , tsunamis , floods , landslides , volcanic activity , wildfires , locust and similar infestations , drought and desertification , and other calamities of natural origin .  
The Framework stated several explicit goals that this broad range of collaborators should strive to accomplish during the Decade : build national capabilities to mitigate the effects of natural disasters ; develop guidelines and strategies for applying existing knowledge ; foster research to close gaps in knowledge ; disseminate information ; and develop measures to apply technical assistance and technology transfer , demonstration projects , and education and training .  
In the broad context of international development issues , Agenda 211 emphasized that sustainable economic growth and development can not be achieved without taking measures to reduce losses from natural disasters , further considering the close linkages between disaster losses and environmental degradation .  
Conditions of increasing social and economic vulnerability will almost certainly lead to unprecedented natural and related hazards in the future , so specific recommendations are made to ensure continued advocacy , the development of policies and the coordination of institutionalized abilities into the twenty-first century .  
A major success of the Decade has been a widespread acceptance of the fact that the growing risk of disasters associated with natural hazards , frequently compounded by uncontrolled or adverse human practices , must be mitigated .  
Abilities essential to the reduction of natural and similar disasters are increasingly being drawn from the public sector , professional and institutional organizations , commercial interests and local forms of community leadership . 
On the one hand , changes in the need for disaster reduction will be determined by the changing patterns of natural hazards , their future potential for association with technological disasters or political conflicts , and shifts in the socio-economic and demographic trends .  
Took note of the information provided by the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) on how to sign / ratify the Tampere Convention which provides a legal framework for the use of telecommunications in international humanitarian assistance ; ( i ) Noted that the considerable recent advances in seasonal weather and climate predictions , including of such phenomena as El Nio , enable improved preparedness of vulnerable communities against natural disasters .  
The focus of the programme is on areas related to satellite communications : satellite remote sensing for natural resources and environmental survey ; development of facilities for designing , assembly / fabrication and launching of communication satellites in geostationary orbit and light-weight satellites in near-Earth orbit for various scientific and applications purposes ; and study of natural and physical phenomena in the upper atmosphere and space through rocket launchings and other means .  
During the two phases , it is very important to obtain sufficient information from the potential mining sites ( commonly termed " baseline data " ) to document clearly the natural conditions which exist prior to mining , and to gain insights into the natural processes such as dispersion and settling of particles , and benthic faunal succession , and to gather other data which will make it possible to acquire the necessary predictive capability for accurate environmental impact prediction .  
Intensify efforts to implement legislative and administrative measures as well as to promote public education , with special attention to youth , about the need for sustainable production and consumption patterns ; foster sustainable natural resource use ; and work concertedly to prevent environmental degradation within their countries ;  
In view of the continuing need to protect humanity from the impact of natural disasters and of the fact that various national and international organizations and agencies have collected enormous amounts of data from space platforms and have successfully completed a number of related studies , it would be appropriate to initiate an integrated global effort as regards disaster management using space systems .  
Intensify efforts to implement legislative and administrative measures as well as to promote public education , with special attention to youth , about the need for sustainable production and consumption patterns ; foster sustainable natural resource use ; and work concertedly to prevent environmental degradation within their countries ;  
We understand sustainable development as a comprehensive and complex process with the objective of improving the quality of life for the whole population through productive growth , social development with equity and full participation by citizens under the precepts of conservation of natural resources and preservation of environmental quality .  
The comprehensive plan for economic and social development sets out as objectives and policies the easing of migratory movements , developing the urban periphery , rationalizing the use and management of natural resources , improving environmental quality , the gender perspective and reproductive health .  
In a globalizing world , island nations such as ours , with limited natural resources and human capital , urgently need the support and assistance of the international community in overcoming our inherent vulnerabilities and realizing the hopes and aspirations of our peoples for achieving lasting and meaningful development .  
In spite of temporary difficulties caused by the destruction of health and education facilities and industrial and agricultural infrastructure as a result of the natural disasters of recent successive years , our people are full of courage and are firmly convinced that under the Great Leader and our social system they can repair the damage in the shortest possible time and build a rich and strong country .  
First , political will for the advancement of the Cairo commitments in many developing countries has been weakened by the recent financial crisis and continued economic stagnation , as well as by frequently recurring natural disasters .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
Member States should cooperate , as a matter of urgency , to ensure that future space activities that would cause potentially harmful interference with the scientific research or natural , cultural and ethical values of other nations ( para .  73 ) are subjected to an environmental impact assessment and international consultations before approval ;  
That the historical piecemeal approach to natural disasters needed to be replaced with an integrated approach one that would cut across natural hazards and would include planning , preparedness , prevention , warnings , relief and rehabilitation , and that a broader appreciation of the positive relationship between disaster reduction and economic and social development goals was required .  
The positive impulses for pursuing cross-cutting issues of universal character , such as natural disaster reduction , created on the one hand by a division of labour between non-operational responsibilities for system-wide policy development , advocacy and coordination , and on the other hand , by distinct operational responsibilities for all relevant mandate bearers inside and outside the United Nations , in particular in the field of development .  
The African continent is subject to a wide range of natural hazards , and suffers constantly from natural and other disasters , which have serious adverse effects on societies and national economies as well as on scarce human and material resources .  
Technological and human-induced ecological hazards , such as accidental releases of chemicals in surface water catchments , dumping of toxic and radioactive materials in coastal zones or on the high seas , and hydrological and climatic problems created by excessive withdrawals from large water bodies etc . add to or complicate problems related to natural hazards , particularly in CIS countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia . 
Concentrations of population in major urban centres ( megacities ) , many of which are located in hazard-prone areas in developing countries , are highly vulnerable to natural and technological hazards due to dependence on complex infrastructures and the occupation of marginal land .  
We shall adopt and implement policy measures at the international , regional , subregional , national and local levels aimed at reducing the vulnerability of our societies to both natural and technological hazards through proactive rather than reactive approaches .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
Developing countries need to be encouraged to utilize space in support of their national developmental activities and to address the basic requirements of their people : education , pollution monitoring , health , telecommunications , environmental management , weather and climate applications , utilization of natural resources , food security , urban and rural infrastructure , land-use management and many other local-level resource problems ;  
Today , the most rapidly growing segment of the economy is information : spatial information derived from remote sensing and geographic information systems can help natural resource mangers , in both developed and developing countries , to improve food production and water management , decrease costs or reduce environmental degradation .  
With the advantage of providing synoptic coverage of large areas at regular intervals , coupled with the advances made in computer-aided digital analysis and data fusion , spaceborne multi-spectral measurements made by Earth observation satellites offer an immense potential for generating reliable , timely and cost-effective information on natural resources .  
Satellite data are used operationally to lessen the impact of natural disasters such as tropical cyclones , flash floods , heavy snowstorms , volcanic ash clouds , sea ice , toxic effects on coastal waters and harmful algal blooms .  
Noting with appreciation the concerted international efforts made , in particular through the Inter _ Agency Task Force on El Nio , in close cooperation with member agencies of the Inter _ Agency Committee on the Climate Agenda , to reduce the impact of natural disasters related to the El Nio phenomenon through improved scientific understanding , close monitoring and the dissemination of timely forecasts to communities affected ,  
Expressing concern that the world is increasingly being threatened by large-scale natural disasters which will have long _ term negative social , economic and environmental consequences on vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ,  
Reiterating that the promotion of economic growth and sustainable development can not be achieved without adequate measures to prevent and reduce the impact of natural disasters and that there are close linkages between losses owing to natural disasters and environmental degradation , as emphasized in Agenda 21-3 / and in the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 , 4 / adopted by the General Assembly at its nineteenth special session ,  
Recognizing the necessity for the international community to demonstrate the strong political determination required to use existing scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , bearing in mind the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Reiterating in that regard that natural disasters damage the social and economic infrastructure of all countries , although the long _ term consequences of natural disasters are especially severe for developing countries , including the least developed countries , and landlocked and small island developing States , as well as for countries with economies in transition , thus hampering their sustainable development processes ,  
Recognizing the importance of space science and space applications for the fundamental knowledge of the universe , education , health , environmental monitoring , management of natural resources , disaster management , meteorological forecasting and climate modelling , satellite navigation and communications , and the major contribution that space science and technology make to the well-being of humanity and specifically to economic , social and cultural development ,  
To implement an integrated , global system , especially through international cooperation , to manage natural disaster mitigation , relief and prevention efforts , especially of an international nature , through Earth observation , communications and other space-based services , making maximum use of existing capabilities and filling gaps in worldwide satellite coverage ;  
The debt overhang , inadequate external finance - exemplified by the decline in ODA - limited market access for exports , severe supply-side constraints , deterioration in human welfare and the increasing number of humanitarian and natural disasters have adversely impacted on the economic performance of LDCs . 
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
The eventual abandonment of this regime in favour of an independent Palestinian currency would be a natural conclusion of the transitional process , during which credibility is established , institutions are built up and financial markets mature .  
This cooperation is not confined to official endeavours undertaken by the Kuwaiti Government ; the State is also encouraging national institutions and individuals to provide aid and assistance to those in need thereof in other countries , regardless of the origin or cause of that need which might be attributable to poverty , natural disasters , human conflicts or other causes of human suffering which the State of Kuwait is endeavouring to combat and alleviate .  
National and regional sustainable development strategies allow for a more effective use of national and regional human , institutional , financial and natural resources , as well as cooperation at the regional and interregional levels .  
At its sixth session , the Commission recalled that a vulnerability index that takes account of the constraints arising from small size and environmental fragility , as well as the incidence of natural disasters on a national scale , and the consequent relationship of those constraints to economic vulnerability , would assist in defining the vulnerability of small island developing States and in identifying the challenges to their sustainable development .  
The combined effects of this and of ongoing armed conflicts and several devastating natural calamities had a disproportionate effect on the most disadvantaged groups of society , also contributing to increased feminization of poverty .  
The gender relationships associated with other characteristics of LDCs were also discussed : weak infrastructure , environmental degradation , low level of and access to technology , high of unemployment , a small tax base and restricted government revenues / expenditures ; inability to attract full FDI , problems of government , high rates of capital flight and the effects of exogenous factors , such as natural disasters .  
They highlighted the disadvantages that derive from their location and physical characteristics dispersion of islands over large areas in the case of archipelagic small island developing States ; recurrent damages inflicted on small island developing States located in the cyclonic belt by natural disasters , such as hurricanes ; overuse , rapid depletion and degradation of natural resources on account of their paucity relative to the demand for them .  
The continental shelf of a coastal State comprises the seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea throughout the natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer edge of the continental margin , or to a distance of 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured where the outer edge of the continental margin does not extend up to that distance .  
The natural resources referred to in this Part consist of the mineral and other non-living resources of the seabed and subsoil together with living organisms belonging to sedentary species , that is to say , organisms which , at the harvestable stage , either are immobile on or under the seabed or are unable to move except in constant physical contact with the seabed or the subsoil .  
Mercenarism occurs in inverse proportion to peace , political stability , respect for the legal and democratic order , the ability to exploit natural resources in a rational manner , a well-integrated population and a fair distribution of development which prevents extreme poverty .  
While mercenaries may be recruited , trained and financed from within solid , stable countries , they are in fact used chiefly in countries affected by political violence , internal armed conflict , insurrection or insurgency and lacking the necessary financial or technical capacity to exploit their natural resources on an industrial scale .  
The persistence of mercenary activities , the range and variety of the forms in which they are carried out and the hidden networks of complicity behind them suggest that States , particularly the smallest and weakest ones , the least developed , those forming archipelagoes , those with valuable natural resources but fragile political systems and those faced with armed insurrection and internal conflicts , are not adequately protected against mercenarism in its various forms .  
We in Saint Lucia strongly support the continued participation of these Territories in regional institutions as a natural function of our ongoing Caribbean integration process , and as a critical component of the economic , social and constitutional development of the Caribbean .  
GOOS aims to meet the need for : ( a ) forecasting climate variability and change ; ( b ) assessing the state of health of the marine environment and its resources ( including the coastal zone ) ; and ( c ) supporting an improved decision-making and management process which takes into account potential natural and man-made changes in the environment and their effects on human health and resources .  
A panel of technical experts held during the Consultative Group Meeting , which included representatives from UNICEF and other United Nations organizations , suggested that reducing ecological and social vulnerability to natural hazard is a core regional development issue and that the primary responsibility for reducing vulnerability lies with sectoral institutions and with local communities . 
Activities in the Paris Club in the second half of 1998 and the first half of 1999 were marked by continued restructuring of the debts of the poorest countries in the context of the HIPC initiative ; the return of middle-income countries to reschedule their official bilateral debts ; and special measures taken in support of countries affected by conflict or natural disaster .  
Hurricane Mitch and other natural phenomena of uncommon violence lay bare the physical vulnerability of our countries and highlight the absolute necessity of early and organized preventive measures .  
Arms transfers and trafficking , and the resulting armed conflicts which they feed , are having a devastating impact on social , political and economic life for Africa south of the Sahara , a region endowed with natural resources but which still has pockets in which live the poorest people in the world today . 
Alternative 2 : Calls on Member States to give priority to improving their emergency response capabilities and to increasing their participation in existing mechanisms to allow for a timely , effective and coordinated response to natural disasters and for containment of environmental damage in the Caribbean Sea in the event of an accident or incident relating to maritime transport ,  
The group is helping to prepare case studies in rural and urban areas on the linkages between ecological factors , disaster preparedness and the level of damage sustained by natural phenomena , as well as to formulate regional projects for presentation to the international community .  
Alternative 1 : Calls upon Member States to give priority to improving their emergency response capabilities to allow for a timely , effective and coordinated response [ to natural disasters as well as the need to contain ] [ aimed at containing ] environmental damage in the Caribbean Sea in the event of an accident or incident relating to maritime transport ;  
Alternative 2 : Calls upon Member States to give priority to improving their emergency response capabilities and to increasing their participation in existing mechanisms in order to allow for a timely , effective and coordinated response to natural disasters and for containment of environmental damage in the Caribbean Sea in the event of an accident or incident relating to maritime transport ;  
If we really want to find effective and lasting solutions we can not overlook the fact that the roots of the current problems are found in the centuries of colonial exploitation during which African economies were looted and distorted in order to turn them into providers of natural resources , raw materials and cheap manpower at the cost of the annihilation and enslavement of tens of millions of people . 
Nor can we overlook the fact that the current unjust and unsustainable international economic order continues to treat Africa as an economically undeveloped source of natural wealth , that serves the unsustainable consumption patterns of industrialized countries , among which are included the former colonizers .  
Recognizing that the combined effects of natural disasters , conflicts , entrenched poverty , diseases , especially the malaria and the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic , and lack of proper education affect the economic prospects of and efforts to eradicate poverty in the most severely affected countries , especially in Africa ,  
The United Nations serve as the framework for political , economic , cultural , environmental and moral dialogue and that full use be made of the regional commissions which were the natural link between global and national concerns .  
In that context , it was regrettable that Israel continued to apply inhumane practices against the Palestinian people of the occupied territories and to confiscate their land , water and other natural resources , in flagrant violation of the principle , based on the Charter of the United Nations and international law , that land and other resources could not legitimately be acquired by force .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Noting that the territorial Government continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
Core elements of a new poverty eradication strategy should include a broadly based understanding of the mechanisms of sustainable poverty reduction ; the selection of those public interventions that would have the largest impact on the poor and reduce their vulnerability by reducing income volatility resulting from global and domestic shocks and natural disasters ; and the establishment of outcome indicators .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of girls and boys in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions in an increasingly globalized world economy , pandemics , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance , discrimination and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Progress towards sustainable development required the establishment of an international legal framework for managing deteriorating natural resources , enhanced coordination among international institutions in the environmental field , global guidance for the emerging environmental agenda and the pursuit of feasible solutions for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
Recognizing that the combined effects of natural disasters , conflicts , entrenched poverty , diseases , especially the malaria and the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic , and lack of proper education affect the economic prospects of and efforts to eradicate poverty in the most severely affected countries , especially in Africa ,  
Recognizing further that the combined effects of natural disasters , conflicts , entrenched poverty , disease , especially malaria and the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic , and lack of proper education affect the economic prospects of and efforts to eradicate poverty in the most severely affected countries , especially in Africa ,  
It had enacted a law on the sustainable use of Fijis limited renewable and non-renewable land and sea resources and readjusted its sectoral policies with a view to ensuring sustained natural resource utilization ; the development of human-resource-based industries ; the improvement of social services in the fields of health , education and housing ; poverty alleviation ; rural and urban development ; and disaster management .  
It was working throughout the developing world to fight land degradation and poverty ; in Asia , it had initiated a programme targeting very poor rural households in upland areas , which integrated natural resource management , economic diversification and the creation of local employment . 
Ms . Wong ( Singapore ) said that as a small island State with no natural resources , her country was acutely aware of the impact on its environmental well-being of external factors , and was committed to playing a proactive role in supporting regional and global initiatives to protect the environment .  
Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,  
Issues addressed with regard to the linkages between poverty and various vulnerable groups , including indigenous peoples , minorities , migrant workers and persons affected by AIDS , included social exclusion and marginalization , the exploitation of natural resources , transnational corporations and the impact of their activities on the enjoyment of the rights of communities concerned by such activities , as well as the overall policies of host Governments . 
Recognizing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
Emphasizes the urgent need to further develop and use the existing scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters , bearing in mind the particular needs of developing countries , and , in this regard , calls upon all countries to strengthen scientific research and training of experts in universities and specialized institutions and to promote the exchange of information ;  
In Africa , in particular , children were all too often the victims of armed conflict , a situation aggravated by natural disaster , disease , an adverse economic environment and the growing burden of foreign debt , while in Palestine and other occupied territories , children were being killed , tortured and imprisoned without having committed any crime .  
For many commodities exported by developing countries , there has also been substantial substitution by synthetic materials over the past two decades , while a shift away from traditional &amp; lt ; heavy = industries , such as iron and steel , has also limited the rate of expansion in demand for natural raw materials .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of girls and boys in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions in an increasingly globalized world economy , pandemics , natural disasters , armed conflict , displacement , exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance , discrimination and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,

Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,  
Further calls upon Member States to give priority to improving their emergency response capabilities and to increasing their participation in existing mechanisms so as to allow for a timely , effective and coordinated response to natural disasters and for the containment of environmental damage in the Caribbean Sea area in the event of an accident or incident relating to maritime transport ;  
The voluminous documentation on international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space that had been submitted to the Conference established the basis for the use of space for the purpose of environmental protection ; the rational utilization of natural resources ; the promotion of development ; education ; and the broader application of space technology in the interests of developing countries .  
While the conceptualization of national and other more specific benchmarks has generated a great deal of discussion within the human rights community , the setting of progressive development benchmarks has been a natural outcome of the follow-up to international commitments made to implement the education goals of successive world conferences and global summits organized by the United Nations since 1990 . 
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and property worldwide , in particular in vulnerable societies lacking adequate capacity to mitigate effectively long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences of natural disasters ;  
The main thrust of Namibias national action programme to combat decertification was that the social , economic , legal and political environment should be reconciled with the natural environment in order to enhance the sustainable use of natural resources .  
Mr . Rayani ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) said that UNISPACE III had emphasized the importance of providing the developing countries with opportunities to use the latest achievements of space science and technology for the purposes of economic development and for forecasting natural disasters , especially since outer space was not the exclusive property of any individual State but the common heritage of mankind .  
We have always said that Iraq is a great country with a rich cultural heritage , home to one of the oldest civilizations known , and that , by virtue of its abundant natural , mineral , human and other resources , it has huge potential to become an economic force to be reckoned with , not only in the Gulf region but also worldwide .  
The Government stressed that the people of the South required reparation and justice for impunity , neo-colonial wars , the extermination of populations and peoples , the defilement of their economic , cultural and natural heritage by countries of the North , the decapitalization of the developing countries charged with paying external debts and the dumping of toxic waste in their territories , to cite only a few examples .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Noting further that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territorys deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
Improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , through international assistance for the purpose of capacity-building and human resource development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , is also necessary for the successful implementation of national programmes .  
The Government of our Republic has consistently maintained a policy of providing jobs , free medical treatment and free education to all people , even amid serious temporary economic difficulties created by economic blockades of foreign forces and natural disasters which have recurred over a number of consecutive years .  
While emphasizing the imperative need for the political will on the part of States to facilitate the access of needy populations to assistance and cooperation , it seems to us equally valuable that the Secretary-General has included , as the first point in his annual report , a reference to the importance of developing a culture of prevention to deal with natural disasters . 
Can we really imagine modern international political and economic relations , trade , satellites , the Internet , aviation , technological and scientific activity , cultural exchanges , environmental protection , travel , the use of natural resources , exploration of outer space and other vital human activities without a solid international legal foundation ? 
Factors that have a direct or indirect impact on peace , such as the environment , natural resources , sustainable development , quality of life , technology and international relations , are studied in terms of their real impact on peace and not as isolated topics .  
Therefore we hope to continue to have the solidarity and the support of the United Nations system , as well as of international financial organizations and the donor community , especially those that pledged their commitment in the Stockholm Declaration , as their invaluable assistance is vital in order to overcome the structural problems underlying the effects of natural disasters .  
With its unsurpassed costs in terms of human and financial numbers , claiming some 50 , 000 victims and causing economic losses exceeding $ 90-billion throughout the world , 1998 was an annus horribilis , that clearly illustrated the extreme vulnerability of developing countries to natural disasters of all types .  
The basis for this conviction lies in our rich history and great culture , which has made an invaluable contribution to world civilization ; in our natural and intellectual potential ; in the high spiritual and moral values of our people ; in their enterprise , open thinking and desire to take their rightful place in the world society .  
The sponsors have included land as a natural resource in this operative paragraph because the Special Committee has been informed of a desire by petitioners from one particular Territory that all unused and excess land not required for military purposes be returned to the original landowners .  
Nonetheless , it is also natural , in a democratic international community based on the principles of equitable geographic representation and the sovereign equality of States , that changes to the collective security system be the result of a genuine general agreement , instead of being imposed .  
As a subregion that is extremely vulnerable to natural disasters resulting from violent tropical cyclones , El Nio , tsunamis , tidal waves , droughts , brush fires and earthquakes , we are committed to supporting the remarkable role played by the United Nations and its response system , including its engagement with many intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , in the delivery of much-needed relief assistance to our peoples .  
Mr . Ahmed ( India ) stated that the adoption of the treaty by the General Assembly would ensure the exploitation of natural resources of the Moon and other celestial bodies in an orderly and rational manner through the creation of an international regime to ensure that such resources , as the common heritage of mankind , were exploited for the benefit of all mankind .  
As a result of such an agreement , the use of the natural resources of celestial bodies and outer space , which might relieve some of the immense pressures now facing mankind due to the limited resources of the Earth , could take place in a predominantly peaceful environment , in an orderly fashion , in accordance with international law , on the basis of international cooperation and mutual understanding and in accordance with previously agreed procedures . 
Iraq was one of the pioneers in adopting organized scientific planning to mobilize and develop human and financial resources so as to achieve sustainable economic growth aimed at bringing about the prosperity of human beings and at maintaining their right to their natural resources and their environmental rights .  
National and regional sustainable development strategies allow for a more effective use of national and regional human , institutional , financial and natural resources , as well as cooperation at the regional and interregional levels .  
At its sixth session , the Commission recalled that a vulnerability index that takes account of the constraints arising from small size and environmental fragility , as well as the incidence of natural disasters on a national scale , and the consequent relationship of those constraints to economic vulnerability , would assist in defining the vulnerability of small island developing States and in identifying the challenges to their sustainable development .  
Following the adoption of Agenda 21 and the Barbados Programme of Action , the Government of Suriname acknowledged the necessity of strengthening its capacity for the sustainable management of its natural resources through , inter alia , the creation of appropriate institutional mechanisms to design and enforce sound environmental policies capable of countering the pressures and challenges arising from the promotion of economic development .  
The United Nations Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States , held in Barbados in 1994 , was aware of the enormous challenges facing these States when it adopted the Programme of Action , now considered the starting point for the sustainable development of small island developing States , whose ability to protect themselves against natural disasters is indeed limited .  
These States are confronted with major challenges , such as protecting the marine environment against various forms of pollution , the increasing scarcity of fresh water , ever more frequent and devastating natural disasters , adapting to climate change and to the rising sea level , integrating into the global economy , and the diversification of their exports .  
Indeed , the issues of climate change , soil erosion , global warming , sea level rise , coastal and marine resources , natural and environmental disasters , biodiversity resources , waste management and freshwater resources are among those that all developing countries face , in particular small island nations , in an increasingly competitive global economy .  
Many delegations stated that unsustainable consumption and production patterns include both adverse environmental impacts arising from the excess consumption of natural resources , particularly in the developed countries , and unemployment , poverty and underconsumption of basic goods and services , particularly in developing countries .  
It might consider such issues as ( a ) financial leakages and how to maximize benefits for local communities , ( b ) preparing a joint initiative to improve information availability and capacity-building for participation , thus enabling communities to manage social and environmental change and ( c ) developing a plan to ensure indigenous peoples and other local communities their rights to land , water and other natural resources .  
Tourism had the potential to make an important contribution to poverty alleviation and economic advancement , particularly through integrated plans with the inclusion of local stakeholders in planning and development and where a key objective remained the protection of the cultural and natural assets of the tourist locality .  
Among the cleaner transportation fuels , within a near-term horizon , natural gas appears to be the most likely and cost-effective significant alternative to motor gasoline and diesel , particularly for use in fleets , given its abundant resources , its possibilities as a high performance fuel , its clean burning qualities and its convenient commercial availability to end users , especially in the major transportation consumer nations .  
Such policies should be complemented by other measures for promoting efficient and clean energy that take into account the widely differing institutional , social , economic , technical and natural resource endowment in individual countries and regions .  
The Committee noted that barriers to the integration of economic , social and environmental objectives persist in current approaches to water management , but that solutions can only be found if clear integrated development frameworks are agreed at all levels of society and a long-term commitment given to the development of public health and natural resource policy , strategic planning and the mobilization of resources .  
The positive engagement with the natural resource base is essential not only to maintain local and national food security but also to offer opportunities for balanced rural development .  
The Committee considered that , since the EVI could give only a partial and approximate measure of the relative level of vulnerability of a country , a document to be called a country vulnerability profile should be prepared , for some countries , to provide a more detailed assessment of the impact of external economic and natural shocks on their economic performance and economic structure .  
National decisions and the capacity to manage land resources sustainably can also be constrained by external factors and the impacts of inappropriate development strategies pursued in the past , including unequal negotiations for rights to exploit natural resources by national and foreign companies , and poorly designed projects financed by donors which have been based on purely economic considerations .  
FAO has developed frameworks and guidelines for the implementation of the approach , including documents entitled Our land our future : a new approach to land use planning and management ( 1996 ) ; Negotiating a sustainable future for the land , structural and institutional guidelines on natural resource management in the twenty-first century ( 1997 ) ; and The future of our land : facing the challenge , guidelines for integrated planning for sustainable management of land resources ( 1998 ) .  
The experience is that these soft forms of tourism can be just as destructive as mass tourism , if they are not planned , developed and managed in a sustainable manner , so as to ensure that there are no adverse effects on the natural environment or the local sociocultural fabric , and that the local community is involved in all development and management phases .  
The main adverse impacts of tourism on the environment are connected to pressure on natural resources , harm to wildlife and habitats ( with associated loss of biological diversity ) , the generation of pollution and wastes , and social and cultural pressures related to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity .  
In Mauritius , a national environmental commission has been set up , chaired by the Prime Minister , with a broad membership , including ministers responsible for economic planning , finance , education , science and technology , energy and natural resources , tourism , industry , health and justice , and representatives of local government .  
A number of small island developing States have not yet accorded high priority to institution - and capacity-building ; some of them have had to deal with more pressing problems such as natural disasters and macroeconomic imbalances ; the recent economic crisis has had direct impact on some small island developing States where deteriorations in economic performance have further reduced scope for action for institutional and administrative capacity-building ;  
Most small island developing States would derive tremendous benefits from the introduction of environmentally sustainable technological innovations in the areas of the development of renewable energy , freshwater and marine resources ; telecommunications and information technology ; waste management and natural disaster mitigation ; and sustainable land resources management .  
The observer for the Indian Movement Tupaj Amaru stated that , while considering the draft declaration , special attention should be given to such notions as the recognition of the right of indigenous peoples to define themselves as peoples , the principle of self-determination , the exercise of collective ancestral ownership of land , the sovereignty over natural resources , the legal protection of cultural and intellectual property .  
Provide financial and institutional support for research on safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods and technologies for the reproductive and sexual health of women and men , including more safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods for the regulation of fertility , including natural family planning for both sexes , methods to protect against HIV AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases and simple and inexpensive methods of diagnosing such diseases , among others . . . .  
Tourism is a labour-intensive activity that does not require a high level of specialization , and if well managed and of the proper size , it may exert a strong attractive force on the rest of the islands economic system , including conservation of certain traditional activities , such as agriculture and fishing , and preservation of islands cultural heritage and natural assets .  
The fragile ecosystems of small island States and their generally more limited scope for pursuing alternative development strategies make concerns for the environmental impact of tourism very acute , particularly because the sector , which is almost totally dependent on the natural environment , is viewed by many small island developing States as a fast route to social and economic development .  
The introduction to the Principles contains a refinement of previous working definitions : internally displaced persons are persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence , in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict , situations of generalized violence , violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters , and who have not crossed an internationally recognized State border .  
Article 17 of the Criminal Code stipulates that persons who act as accessories after the fact for their spouse or legitimate relatives by blood or marriage , throughout the direct and collateral lines up to the second degree , as well as natural parents and children born out of wedlock , shall be exempt from the penalties imposed for concealment , unless they have profited from the effects of the crime or ordinary offence . 
That amendment also entitled any person , natural or juridical , to establish a periodical , a local radio station or a television studio , whereas the previous legislation recognized this right only for the State , social and economic organizations and for associations .  
Among the main concerns in the region are unsustainable exploitation and environmental degradation of those natural resources on which rural communities depend ; optimized use of land ; living conditions of coastal people ; insufficiently treated urban wastes , oil pollution and coastal erosion .  
New Zealand provided a variety of examples on technology innovations , including the use of wool booms in residual oil spill clean-ups , oil-eating microbes , development of captive breeding programmes for shellfish , experimental wave and tidal energy generation , and development of pharmaceutical and natural health products from marine sources , such as sponges .  
Losses in biodiversity and economic growth due to unplanned activities related to dredging , lack of clear property rights and control on natural resources , the low level of investments , and lack of participation in decision-making are conditions that have brought integrated coastal zone management onto the political agenda , and programmes are gradually being developed .  
For instance , problems of water supply in terms of both quantity and quality , environmentally sound management of solid and liquid wastes , adaptation to climate change and sea level rise , integrated management of coastal zones , prevention or minimization of natural and environmental disasters among others , all call for specific skills , without which small island developing States even with the highest level of political will can not hope to solve them .  
In view of their narrow natural resource base , their proneness to disruption by natural disasters , their small range of primary product exports and their limited local capital for productive investment , small island developing States need to join forces for their development , so that communication and exchange of information becomes vital .  
Stressing that any credible strategy for the reduction of the natural disaster effects of future El Nio occurrences must be based on effective dialogue and cooperation between the scientific and technological areas of the United Nations system and its operational responsibilities in the fields of disaster management , humanitarian assistance , sustainable development , technical cooperation and capacity-building , including data-collection , monitoring and early warning systems , at all levels ,  
At the start of the millennium , the growing concerns in the region for the environmental dimension of development will centre on the increasing demand for natural resources , the dominant role of the private sector in the development of such resources and the management of service concessions , the problems caused by pollution and land use and the need to comply with multilateral agreements on the environment , particularly under Agenda 21 , and international agreements on specific issues .  
The main users will be authorities and government officials concerned with environmental management and sustainable development , the programming , coordination and management of the use of natural resources and energy , human settlements , in particular ministries of housing and urban planning and local governments , and international and regional transport .  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily _ indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
Similarly , ICLARM , whose operating mission is geared to research and capacity-building in natural resources management , fisheries stock assessment and aquaculture , assisted in a South South training initiative among a number of scientists from the developing world in quantitative genetics and its application to select breeding .  
The development of more cost-effective mapping procedures based on satellite data will surely result in increased use of remote sensing data and consequently expand the market for such data , enabling developing countries to collect and update basic information on the topographic and thematic ( natural resource ) cartography of their territories .  
Recognizing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences on vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
Emphasizes the urgent need to further develop and use the existing scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters , bearing in mind the particular needs of developing countries , and , in this regard , calls on all countries to strengthen scientific research and training of experts in universities and specialized institutions and to promote the exchange of information ;  
Such a decision ignored the erosion of trade preferences , the CARICOM countries ecological and economic vulnerability and the fact that most of their economies lacked the resilience to recover quickly from natural disasters which could obliterate their physical infrastructure , industrial base and agricultural assets . 
Her Government was committed to fighting poverty , inter alia by promoting the education and health of girls , enhancing their participation in the management of natural resources , improving their living conditions , combating violence against women , increasing their participation in decision-making and improving synergy among the relevant mechanisms for advancing the status of women .  
Intensify efforts to implement legislative and administrative measures as well as to promote public education , with special attention to youth , about the need for sustainable production and consumption patterns ; foster sustainable natural resource use ; and work concertedly to prevent environmental degradation within their countries ;  
At the substantive session of the Economic and Social Council held in July 1999 Switzerland had stated that an effective coordination mechanism to promote the management of natural disasters should be established within the United Nations system as of the year 2000 . Such a structure should take account of the national and international dimensions of natural disasters .  
The representative of the National Aboriginal and Islanders Legal Services Secretariat considered that the working group should be guided by basic legal drafting principles in elaborating the text of the draft declaration and that the term self-determination should be given its ordinary and natural meaning .  
Reference was made to how the issue had been settled in Greenland and to the declaration made by the Government of Denmark at the time it ratified ILO Convention No . 169 , in which it had explained the unique land ownership situation in Greenland , where rights of ownership could not be acquired by either natural or legal persons but were divided between the State , the Greenland Home Rule authorities and the individual Greenlander . 
Recognizing that natural disasters constitute a major problem for development whose solution requires considerable resources and calls for efforts at the national level to be supplemented by international financial and technical assistance ,  
Our common objective is to meet the ever increasing needs of human development in the economic and social spheres , while not simply preserving , but gradually restoring natural ecosystems to conditions that will guarantee environmental sustainability .  
For relevant least developed countries in particular , including small island developing States , this may represent a considerable expenditure in the short term , while having a bearing on the future mapping of the natural resources of the continental shelf .  
In this era , when there are no natural enemies , and thus no natural allies , some seek to advance their political and military ambitions by playing on racial and religious fears to give life to the dangerous doctrine of an impending clash of civilizations .  
These setbacks can be attributed , inter alia , to a harsh natural environment , inadequate economic policies , recurring droughts and the low level of development of social sectors .  
That was especially true in view of the principal objective of the Decade , namely , to reduce the casualties , material damage and social and economic disturbances caused by natural disasters , particularly in developing countries .  
United by strong natural , historic , social and cultural ties , that community would offer a single focus for investment and tourism and a single market with a common external tariff and would facilitate the free flow of goods , services and people .  
Recognizing that natural disasters constitute a major problem for development whose solution requires considerable resources and calls for efforts at the national level to be supplemented by international financial and technical assistance ,  
Strategic options being considered include fostering human capital development and the creation of permanent rural jobs through public investments geared to conserving and restoring natural resources ;  
Understanding the natural , social , cultural , economic and political features of local and national environments , particularly their dynamics and interactions , is considered as one of the basic principles of the Convention to Combat Desertification .  
While Africa has a rich natural resource endowment , which should give it the comparative advantage in becoming a major producer of industrial raw materials and manufactures , its potential remains largely untapped .  
Market economies are neither reducible to actions that are obvious , natural and outside moral enquiry , nor made of abstract axioms such as free enterprise or free trade that are protected from testing and questioning .  
It was agreed that the organization should enhance its capacity to predict and respond to a changing global environment , marked by increased frequency and intensity of civil strife , armed conflict and natural disasters .  
Urged countries to engage in raising awareness of the ecological , social , cultural and economic roles that planted and natural forests might fulfil in the rehabilitation and sustainable management of forests in environmentally critical areas ;  
The major objective of SARD is to enhance food security ( defined as access to the food required for a healthy and productive life ) in an environmentally sound way so as to contribute to sustainable natural resource management .  
Formidable challenges arising from persistent poverty and widening economic and social disparities , humanitarian crises caused by armed conflict and natural disasters , and the growing HIV / AIDS pandemic provided the context for much of UNICEF work in 1999 .  
At present , it is obvious that the world needs sustainable economic and social development based on strategic approaches to balanced and rational use of natural and water resources .  
The collaboration with UNDP has continued along two main lines , supporting the socioeconomic aspects of governance in the region and the delivery of technical assistance at the national level , including the assessment of the impact of natural disasters .  
National and regional sustainable development strategies allow for a more effective use of national and regional human , institutional , financial and natural resources , as well as cooperation at the regional and interregional levels .  
If the political will is summoned to deny the ability of warring factions to sustain their illicit trade in natural resources , a vital lifeline that supports and sustains armed conflict will be degraded , if not destroyed .  
This vast territory which has immense natural ( mineral , agricultural , forestry , energy and other ) resources continues to have some of the lowest social indicators in the world and is classified among the poorest countries in the world . 
A deliberate action calculated to step up ethnic cleansing and genocide against the Serbs and other nonAlbanians in Kosovo and Metohija , it is a means of imposing neocolonialist control over the natural , material and human resources of a sovereign country .  
It is not an ethnic , tribal or religious conflict , but one born of greed and the desire by a handful of unpatriotic elements to control the strategic mineral and natural resources of the country .  
As is natural in a democratic international community , these changes must be the result of an authentic general agreement , and not of impositions based on artificial time limits , partial solutions or the socalled quick fix .  
Whether natural or caused by humans , crises often cross borders , draining resources away from essential public services , reducing development investments , and destroying physical , natural , institutional and social capital .  
The knowledge and wisdom of indigenous and local communities is critical to the conservation and management of much of the worlds biological diversity and natural resources and can add value to contemporary , scientific ways of thinking .  
Warnings of bad weather and natural disasters to remote areas and ships : satellite telecommunications offer increased reliability compared to the standard terrestrial maritime communications facilities that were used in the past ;  
It is on this basis that we have decided that there is a need for at least a partnership among Governments of affected countries , relevant humanitarian organizations and specialized agencies to promote training in , access to and the use of technologies , to strengthen preparedness for and response to natural disasters and to enhance the transfer of current technologies and corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on concessional and preferential terms , as may be mutually agreed .  
This has provided us with the opportunity , in the face of adversity , to redouble efforts to foster national unity and strengthen democratic institutions , and to promote activities aimed at the economic growth and social development of the country , which we had begun before this natural disaster struck , in order to preserve the political , economic and social stability that had been achieved .  
Finally , the increasing incidence and magnitude of natural disasters confirms the need for and importance of efficient coordination at all levels in disaster preparedness and emergency response ; information-sharing and early warning systems to mitigate the impact of natural disasters ; and , above all , a ready pool of resources , including financial resources that can be deployed and utilized immediately , thus minimizing human suffering .  
Those delegations expressed the view that such re-entry constituted a serious threat to human security and the economic activities of coastal States and threatened the marine environment and its natural resources .  
The Committee agreed that beneficial uses of space such as strengthening communications infrastructure , disaster management , education , agriculture , environmental protection and natural resource management had enormous relevance for human development , in particular in developing countries , and that the wider adoption of such beneficial applications would strengthen the goal of maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes .  
Some delegations reiterated the view that the geostationary orbit was a limited natural resource with sui generis characteristics that risked saturation , and that its utilization should be based on the principle of rational and equitable access for all countries , taking into account the special needs of developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries .  
It demonstrates that the false pretext of border insecurity is no longer tenable and that the real motive for the aggression is the systematic plundering and illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
We think that the nature of the Panels report is in sharp contrast to that submitted to the Council in January , as it contains numerous recommendations , including coercive measures , which are the result of the Panels review of the basic forms of illegal exploitation of natural resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and of the collection of extensive data on the structures engaged in such exploitation and their financial , commercial and transport activities .  
The second point is that my delegation wishes to express its deep concern about the humanitarian situation that the Democratic Republic of the Congo is experiencing , particularly caused by the massive displacement of people who are fleeing violence , the interruption of traditional sources of food supplies , the systematic plundering of the countrys natural resources and the impact of the war on childrens lives , as was eloquently presented by Mr . Olara Otunnu .  
Given that most of the conflicts on the Security Councils present agenda do not relate to conventional territorial disputes , but rather to ethnic reasons , religious intolerance , abject poverty , control over natural resources or systematic violations of human rights , an opportunity is created for the Economic and Social Council to cooperate with the Security Council through recommendations conducive to conflict prevention , an area which traditionally had seemed to be outside its sphere of competence .  
In the meantime , we reaffirm our firm condemnation of the ongoing pillage of the natural resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , which , according to credible sources , is the principal reason for the continuation of the conflict and for serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
The international community hopes for a return to peace and economic recovery in the Great Lakes region , especially in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , which is most unusual geopolitically , as it lies at the centre of the African continent , and which is exceptionally rich in a wide variety of natural resources , whose overexploitation by the belligerents without the least benefit to the people of the Congo is one of the leading causes of the conflict . 
It is our conviction that the solution to the problems of the Democratic Republic of the Congo undoubtedly lies in the implementation of the Lusaka Agreement and the additional protocols , as well as in the pertinent Security Council resolutions , which , once thoroughly observed , will provide the necessary conditions for a definitive settlement of the issues related to the illegal exploitation of the natural resources and other forms of wealth of the Congo in which the international community has a relevant role to play .  
While the Government of Burundi is satisfied by the conclusions of the Panel of Experts concerning charges pertaining to the alleged involvement of Burundi in the illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , the delegation of Burundi is , however , concerned by information contained in certain paragraphs of the addendum regarding assistance granted to the armed groups Forces pour la dfense de la dmocratie ( FDD ) and Forces nationales pour la libration ( FNL ) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . 
We note with interest the remark contained in paragraph 10 of the report that the history of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , regardless of the political system or governing authority in place , has been one of systematic abuse of its natural and human resources , such that a country noted for its vast natural resources was reduced to being one of the poorest and debt-ridden by the early 1990s . 
Mines and other sources of natural wealth are remote and heavily guarded , often located in areas subject to outbreaks of fighting or armed attacks against the local population .  
For its part , it had initiated a systematic study of the effects of continuous low level exposure at the cellular , molecular and clinical levels on the health of the population in high natural background radiation areas in the state of Kerala .  
In the light of the fact that lasting peace , independence and freedom were inextricably linked to social and economic development , there was a need to consider the unique circumstances prevailing in the Non-Self-Governing Territories , such as vulnerability to natural disasters , fragility of ecosystems , geographical isolation and the need to protect the cultural traditions of local populations .  
Adoption of the clean production strategy in its widest sense : This involves the prudent exploitation of natural resources ; avoidance of the use of hazardous substances ; increased efficiency of the design and production processes ; reduced emissions , runoffs and wastes , whether in production or end-use , to levels the environment can support ; environmentally sound waste management ; and consideration of the modification of patterns of consumption that have given rise to a societal demand for a particular commodity or service .  
Adoption of measures to ensure effective Arab participation in achievements in the field of advanced technology for the improvement of the Arab environment : Increasing efforts are today being made to achieve important and promising advances in addressing chronic environmental issues connected with meeting the natural resource requirements of development projects , and especially their renewable resource requirements , with reducing pollution levels in production and end-use , with improving the effectiveness of waste recycling and with safer waste disposal .  
The political instability and the natural resources of certain countries , by exciting the greed of foreign interests which had allies in the interior of the country , lay at the origin of the numerous armed conflicts in that continent .  
The European Union participated actively in space activities and carried out a variety of scientific projects , including for the development of the automatic satellite navigation system " Galileo " and a global monitoring system for environmental protection and safety which would have practical applications in a broad range of fields , including the prevention of natural and man-made disasters and the mitigation of their effects .  
Pakistan believed that in years to come the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee should devote special attention to the following issues : matters relating to remote sensing , use of nuclear power sources in outer space , means of and mechanisms for strengthening inter-agency cooperation and increasing the use of space applications and services within and among entities of the United Nations system , implementation of an integrated , space-based global natural disaster management system and the physical nature and technical attributes of the geostationary orbit and of its utilization and applications .  
His delegation wished to emphasize the importance of intensifying international cooperation with a view to implementing the Vienna Declaration , which set out recommendations in the following areas : protecting the environment and managing natural resources , using space applications for human security , development and welfare , advancing scientific knowledge of space and protecting the space environment , enhancing education and training opportunities and ensuring public awareness of the importance of space activities .  
Emphasis will be given to ensuring a more timely and better coordinated response to situations calling for humanitarian assistance in the event of natural disasters and complex emergencies , providing improved support to the resident or humanitarian coordinators and implementing field-based strategic planning for the common humanitarian assistance plans of the United Nations .  
During the biennium 2000-2001 , the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs established three regional disaster response advisory units in Asia , the Pacific and South America to assist disaster-prone countries in improving rapid response preparedness and support to Governments , national civil defence institutions and the United Nations resident coordinators and United Nations agencies during the emergency phase following the initial impact of natural disasters , as well as technological accidents and environmental emergencies .  
The Commission could emphasize that the Earths atmosphere must be considered , with the oceans and the land surface , as one of the three basic interacting domains that comprise the global life-support system , and that sustainable development is inextricably linked with the impact that variations in the atmosphere itself can have on human activity , ecosystems and natural disasters . 
Recall the historical fact that among the most hideous manifestations of racial discrimination the African continent and Diaspora have suffered , namely the slave trade , all forms of exploitation , colonialism and apartheid , were essentially motivated by economic objectives and competition between colonial Powers for strategic territorial gains , appropriation , and control over and pillage of natural and cultural resources ;  
Note with grave concern the negative effects on health and the environment of environmental racism suffered , in particular , by countries in Africa , including the illicit dumping of toxic wastes and substances , hazardous working and living conditions and dangerous methods of extracting natural resources .  
The Palestinian people continued to be subjected to the most gross , systematic and widespread violations of their human rights by Israel , which persisted in oppressing the Palestinian people and creating illegal de facto situations on the ground in an attempt to break the Palestinian peoples will and determination to realize their natural and inalienable rights , including the establishment of an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital . 
The LDCs are acutely vulnerable to a variety of natural shocks , including natural disasters , and severe structural handicaps , and are susceptible to global environmental phenomena such as the loss of biological diversity and adverse effects of climate change which inter alia exacerbates drought , desertification and sea level rise .  
Tribute should be paid to the organizations of the United Nations system , Governments and the international community , especially non-governmental organizations , for the work they were doing to help , at both the psychological and the physical level , millions of children living in abject circumstances because they were victims of poverty , a precarious economic or social situation , sickness , natural disasters , armed conflicts , exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance , disabilities or lack of legal protection .  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
The Panels recommendations revolve around six broad themes : ( 1 ) sanctions against countries and individuals involved in the illegal activities ; ( 2 ) preventive measures to avoid a recurrence of the current situation ; ( 3 ) reparations to the victims of the illegal exploitation of natural resources ; ( 4 ) design of a framework for reconstruction ; ( 5 ) improvement of international mechanisms and regulations governing some natural resources ; and ( 6 ) security issues . 
The list that follows is not exhaustive , but the Panels choice was based on the crucial roles played by these persons and their direct involvement in either providing support , entertaining networks or facilitating the exploitation of natural resources within the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
Good governance , according to article 9 of the Cotonou agreement signed by all 77 ACP countries and the EU , implies a political and institutional environment that upholds human rights , democratic principles , the rule of law , and the transparent and accountable management of human , natural , economic and financial resources .  
Recognition of the particular problems faced by small island developing States relating to their remoteness from major markets , modest natural resource and export bases , narrow skills bases , heavy reliance on costly imports , limited access to private capital , and vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental degradation .  
The trust fund so established is open to voluntary financial contributions from States , intergovernmental organizations , regional economic integration organizations , national institutions and non-governmental organizations , as well as to natural and juridical persons .  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of the persistence of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions in an increasingly globalized world economy , pandemics , in particular HIV / AIDS , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance , discrimination , disability and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
The programme of work under this section has been elaborated within the framework of programme 15 of the medium-term plan for the period 2002-2005 ( A / 55 / 6 / Rev . 1 ) , which identifies three major themes : ( a ) promoting regional economic cooperation ; ( b ) alleviating poverty in rural and urban areas ; and ( c ) protecting the environment , improving the management of natural resources and focusing on the development of infrastructure and information systems .  
Mindful of the fact that the Asian and Pacific region has two thirds of the worlds population living under the absolute poverty level and the imperative of integrating environmental considerations into economic and social development , the programme will highlight a stronger poverty alleviation thrust , particularly in the areas of social development , population and rural and urban development , and environmental and natural resources management .  
Others for different reasons , including domestic economic mismanagement , conflicts , natural catastrophes and external economic shocks , such as terms of trade changes , international interest rate hikes or contagion are faced with difficult or even unbearable debt burdens .  
Targeted effects : ( a ) helping to relaunch agro-land reform ; ( b ) helping to establish integrated and participatory management of catchment areas for a better use of space ; ( c ) contributing to the development of ( traditional and modern ) bio-food networks and to alternative energy production ; ( d ) facilitating access by vulnerable groups , particularly women , to private and public rural financial services ; ( e ) capacity-building in the area of State planning and monitoring-evaluation of rural development , food security and natural resources management .  
In 2000 , several set-backs and longstanding problems impeded progress for children , such as persistent poverty , high debt burdens of many developing countries ( despite some debt relief for heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPCs ) , the still-expanding HIV / AIDS pandemic , armed conflicts , and natural disasters in Afghanistan , El Salvador , India and Southern Africa .  
Acknowledging also the special economic and social importance of the Danube River and its tributaries as a major European river with multiple uses and functions , as well as its ecological significance and its value as a natural habitat for numerous wildlife species ,  
This approach requires a comprehensive and holistic framework to articulate needs , and generate effective strategies and efficient policies , covering a broad range of interactive determinants , including demographic dynamics , social and economic conditions and natural resource endowments .  
The development of an indigenous technological base will provide developing countries with the knowledge and skills necessary for the optimal use of their own human and natural resources and help in devising the production techniques relevant to their development strategies and cultural milieu .  
The objectives of third-country training , which takes place in a particular region where developing countries have a common base in terms of natural , social and cultural factors , are to transfer the technology and know-how of Japan in a form that is compatible with local conditions , and to promote TCDC .  
However , persistent political tension along Guineas southern borders and the resultant prolonged presence of refugees , especially in the rural areas , have been putting tremendous pressure on its natural resources .  
FAO also assists in the development of institutions for the management of common pool natural resources oriented towards reconciling conflicting interests in watersheds between upstream and downstream water users or in fish-producing areas between artisanal and commercial fishermen . 
These countries are characterized by their exposure to a series of vulnerabilities and constraints such as limited human , institutional and productive capacity ; acute susceptibility to external economic shocks , natural and man-made disasters and communicable diseases ; limited access to education , health and other social services and to natural resources ; poor infrastructure ; and lack of access to information and communication technologies .  
The LDCs are acutely vulnerable to a variety of natural shocks , including natural disasters , and severe structural handicaps , and are susceptible to global environmental phenomena such as the loss of biological diversity and adverse effects of climate change which inter alia exacerbates drought , desertification and sea level rise .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territorys deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
We recall the historical fact that among the most hideous manifestations of racial discrimination the African continent and Diaspora have suffered , namely the slave trade , all forms of exploitation , colonialism and apartheid , were essentially motivated by economic objectives and competition between colonial powers for strategic territorial gains , appropriation and control over and pillage of natural and cultural resources ;  
For example , reference may be made to losses attributable [ to the wrongful act ] as a proximate cause , [ 168 ] or to damage which is too indirect , remote and uncertain to be appraised , [ 169 ] or to any direct loss , damage , including environmental damage and the depletion of natural resources , or injury to foreign Governments , nationals and corporations as a result of the wrongful act . 
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territorys deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
Stressing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , which have resulted in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
This should include mechanisms for protection when third parties evict a vulnerable group from their bases of subsistence and mechanisms of punishment and compensation in evictions already effected ; the guarantee of security of land tenure and other productive resources ; effective regulation of workers rights ; the guarantee of non-discrimination against women , in the area of work as well as in relation to ownership of property and productive resources ; and the guarantee of traditional rights of indigenous communities in relation to their natural resources ; ( c ) Obligation to fulfil .  
Stressing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , which have resulted in massive losses of life and long term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
A State may not bring an international claim arising out of an injury to a national , whether a natural or legal person , before the injured national has , subject to Article 15 , exhausted all available local legal remedies in the State alleged to be responsible for the injury .  
In that connection they pointed out that States had an obligation to exercise control so as to prohibit security firms from participating in armed conflicts , creating private armies , engaging in illicit arms trafficking , being involved in the illegal extraction of natural resources and , in that context , employing mercenaries .  
But it has to be understood that the use of such professional services also extends to other unlawful acts such as the trafficking in persons , whether migrants or women , the trafficking in arms and munitions , drug trafficking , terrorism , acts of destabilization of legitimate Governments , acts to take forcible control of valuable natural resources , and even organized crime such as the seizure or theft of vehicles on a large scale .  
It is recommended that the General Assembly should reaffirm its full support for the self-determination of the African peoples and their right to live in peace , to benefit from the development that can result from the rational use of their own natural resources and to have their legitimate governments respected and stable , and in that regard it should condemn the mercenary activities frequently organized with the aim of undermining the rights of the African peoples .  
Those rights concern historical , cultural and ethnic identity , the juridical identity of indigenous communities , communal possession of traditional lands , bilingual and intercultural education , the preservation of indigenous heritage , measures to promote human development and participation in the management of their natural resources .  6 .
