If any grave turn occurs in Taiwan leading to the separation of Taiwan from China in any name , if Taiwan is invaded and occupied by a foreign country , and if the Taiwan authorities refuse , sine die , the peaceful settlement of cross-strait reunification through negotiation , it will then be impossible to have peaceful reunification and the Chinese Government will only be forced to adopt necessary measures to smash the separatist scheme for " Taiwan independence " and safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
However , if a grave turn of events occurs leading to the separation of Taiwan from China in any name , or if Taiwan is invaded and occupied by foreign countries , or if the Taiwan authorities refuse , sine die , the peaceful settlement of cross-Strait reunification through negotiations , then the Chinese Government will only be forced to adopt all drastic measures possible , including the use of force , to safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and fulfill the great cause of reunification .  
In view of the situation in which the amphibious warfare vehicles could not move forward under water and the wheeled canons could not land because of the poor geological conditions , such as sludge , and factors , such as waves , currents , shell craters , and ditches , the regiment made use of its existing bridge of boats equipment and set up a floating landing stage , thus enabling the heavy-duty equipment to reach the beach successfully in a forced landing .  
To attain this strategic objective , it used as bait such Preferential economic conditions as expanding trade , increasing investment , and cutting or waiving debts , and forced African countries to initiate political and economic reforms , Remolding them according to its subjective desire .  
Nevertheless , Taiwan , being a typical hilly island and surrounded by the sea , is narrow in space and lacks strategic depth .  Crowded with 23-million people , the 36,000 square kilometer island is absolutely unable to resist forced entry by a power .  At the moment , the Taiwan authorities are going against the historical trend .  
The worst victims of the bombing and sanctions were ordinary Yugoslav people .  Because of inadequate funds , many industries , mines , and enterprises stopped operations .  Many staff and workers were forced to take compulsory leave and wrer only entitled to partial wages .  
As a developing country with a huge population , China is short on per capita resources and has practiced extensive development for years .  Despite its low income level , therefore , China is forced to deal with those problems that other countries did not have to tackle until their incomes reached a high level .  China 's resource and ecological situation is very grim .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out that since the United States indeed wants to use Taiwan to contain us , we can only speed up the scientific and technological modernization of our armed forced while developing the economy and striving for peaceful reunification ; we should develop hi-tech weaponry and possess at least three or four types of hi-tech deterrent weapons to counter invading forces .  
Military sources in Beijing have revealed that the military exercise under way in the South China Sea has been affected by the collision incident and been forced to make a major readjustment ; a number of scheduled maneuvers have been cancelled and the focus has switched to dealing with the aftermath , including the order to the exercise units to repeatedly search for the missing pilot and recover the plane .  
The unexpected collision of US and PRC military aircraft at a point 140 km southeast of Hainan , leading to the PRC F-8 fighter plane crashing , and the US EP-3 reconnaissance plane making a forced landing at Lingshui Airbase , is a test of the crisis management ability of both the PRC and the US . It also makes it clear that the strategic partnership relationship is finished , and determines even more how the two regard each other as strategic competitors .  
Observers believe that the Chinese government carried out a reasonable , beneficial , and moral struggle in the process of handling this matter , and forced the downright hegemonic United States government to capitulate and admit that the American spy plane had encroached upon Chinese air space leading to the collision with a Chinese fighter plane and subsequent loss of its pilot .  The US government was compelled to make multiple expressions of regret , sadness , and apology , thereby strongly protecting China 's national dignity and the country 's sovereignty .  
First they were confusing right and wrong , taking bites and demanding that China release the crew and the airplane .  Moreover , they absurdly claimed that the forced landing of the American spy plane at the Hainan Island airport was " US territory , " and that the United States had " sovereign exemption , " and China was not permitted to board the aircraft for inspection .  They completely disregarded the fact that the Chinese fighter plane had crashed and the pilot was lost , causing a tragedy for fellow Chinese officials and a Chinese household .  
Said Zhang Wenzhong , political commissar of this institute : After the incident occurred , our government and people waged a firm struggle against the hegemonic ways of the United States and forced the US Government to change its initial tough and unreasonable attitude and to apologize to the Chinese people .  This once again shows that the party center with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core is farsighted , good at strategizing , and capable of keeping various kinds of complicated situation under control and dealing with complex issues .  
People have noticed that after this incident occurred , political leaders in the United States showed a truculent and unreasonable attitude .  They were forced to express their regret to the Chinese side only after facing tremendous domestic and international pressure .  
Due to the perverse behavior of the Chen Shui-bian government over the past year , the Taiwan stock market has weakened , the foreign exchange market is depressed , and industry and commerce face unprecedented difficulties , on top of which cross-strait relations are deadlocked and have retrogressed rather than advancing .  Industrial confidence on the island has collapsed and business has been forced to invest abroad for the sake of its existence .  
US President Bush recently issued a series of tough statements regarding cross-strait affairs and US support for Taiwan . In the wake of these statements , Communist China 's authoritative personages in charge of Taiwan affairs said that Communist China 's high-ranking personnel are paying close attention to the future actions on the part of the United States . If the United States continues getting involved in cross-strait affairs , Communist China might be forced to resolve the Taiwan issue ahead of its schedule by resorting to tough means .  
Plus its inexperience in administration and its confused and ambiguous financial , economic , environmental protection , and social welfare policies , all caused the worsening of the investment environment and forced a large number of enterprises to close down or move out of Taiwan .  
The opponent , who was in a rush for a short moment , was finally forced to land at the seaside - - investigation showed that the pilot of this small airplane was a man who once won the championship in the world super light airplane flying competition and had 25 years of flying experience .  
Judging from the surface , cross-strait relations remain calm and stable ; moreover , thanks to the hard efforts of the public as well as the industrial and commercial circles on the island who have been imposing pressure on the authorities , many man-made restrictions in Taiwan are forced to be relaxed , thus giving rise to an unprecedented upsurge of economic , trade , and cultural exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits .  
This indicates that what he said one year ago about not pursuing " Taiwan independence " was just a forced move to which he had no alternative , and as soon as he held that he had firm footing , or had a certain support from foreign forces , he showed his true features .  
At that time , the entire country of China was in the midst of a crisis of being carved up , and the Qing government was forced to conclude and sign numerous unequal treaties ceding territory and paying indemnities because of its inability to withstand the gunboats and terrific cannon of the western Great Powers .  
During his inauguration anniversary interview with the Wall Street Journal , he specifically cited the bitter experiences of leaders in neighboring countries in comparison with his own .  Philippine President Estrada was forced to resign , while the Indonesian President was censured by the national assembly , which also threatens to impeach him .  " Taiwan went through the so-called recall incident but made it through in one piece " and the key was that the military did not have a hand in the political scene as Taiwan kept its fine tradition of military nationalization .  
As a huge army of 100,000 strong amassed nearby and as the three armed services , like an arrow on the bowstring , were getting ready to conduct a three-dimensional drill of forced beach landing and attacking , who would have thought that our small car with a nonresident license plate could enter this island in Fujian Province without being subject to any inspection .  
However , if there is any major incident of making Taiwan break away from China in any name , if there occurs foreign occupation of Taiwan , or if the Taiwan authorities indefinitely refuse to peacefully resolve the issue of unification of the two sides of the strait through negotiation , the Chinese government will be forced to take all possible decisive measures , including the use of force , to safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and to complete the great cause of unification of China .  
All East Asian countries paid attention to drawing lessons from the financial crisis and intensified financial reform .  On the one hand , the financial order was straightened out .  Some ailing banks were forced to close down , merge with others , and accept others ' management , so that the bad credit of banks was resolutely resolved .

People who understand international law know that an unequal international treaty the signing of which is forced by military aggression is not valid , and so whether or not after its defeat in the war Japan signed a document on returning Taiwan to China does not affect the legal status of Taiwan as Chinese territory .  
First , beginning from 1995 , the state standardized enterprises ' activities of reproducing legal audio-video products .  The state has carried out severe inspections of enterprises engaging in reproducing porno audio-video products and pirated CD products .  It has comprehensively carried out the copyright supervisor system and the SID coding system .  It has strengthened the routine management of production lines and basically solved the problem of reproducing pirated CD products by enterprises with legal production licenses .  The move has forced the activities of pirating CD products going underground .  
This policy forced the Kuomintang authorities in Taiwan to lift the Martial Law at the end of 1986 and to open up indirect " three links " on both sides of the strait , enabled Taiwan to have opportunities to carry out a series of social , political and economic reforms under a peaceful environment , and facilitated democratic politics and free market economy in Taiwan .  
While screening and rectifying public places on 20 January 2000 , the Pudong New District Public Security Bureau discovered that a bathhouse was operating as a brothel .  The bureau personnel traveled over 3,000 km to two cities , two counties , and eight towns in Hubei , and cracked a gang of hooligans who forced the kidnapped young girls into prostitution .  They arrested 34 culprits and successfully rescued six young girls who had been kidnapped and sold .  
People remember that at the beginning of the founding of New China , the central government immediately took rigorous measures to launch a nationwide anti-narcotics campaign .  It seized narcotics , banned the planting of opium poppies , closed opium halls , sternly punished narcotics producing and trafficking activities , punished over 80,000 narcotics-related criminal elements , forced 20 million drug addicts to quit drug addiction , and eradicated opium poppy planting in conjunction with rural land reform .  
In the white paper on " One-China Principle and Taiwan Issue , " the Chinese Government announced clearly that if a major change of events occurred where Taiwan is alienated from China in whatever name , if foreign forces invade and occupy Taiwan , and if the Taiwan authorities indefinitely refuses to solve the cross-strait reunification issue peacefully through talks , the Chinese Government will be forced to adopt all possible drastic measures , including the use of force , to safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity so as to accomplish China 's great cause of reunification .

A certain mechanized infantry division of the Nanjing Theater was equipped with amphibious armored combat vehicles , forming a storm battalion that made a forced beach landing and launched an " intense battle " of attacking the " enemy 's " support locations and seizing key positions in breadth and depth .  
Traces of discrimination and prejudice were everywhere to be seen in the Wen Ho Lee case .  The US agencies concerned forced an arrest of Lee with a fabricated charge and , being prejudiced by first impressions , went to the extent of fabricating false evidence in an attempt to convict him of heavy offenses .  They put Lee in solitary confinement and in shackles and manacles , and for a time prohibited him from contacting outsiders and having exchanges with his family members in the Chinese language .  
At the same time , Taiwan 's financial authorities were forced to admit that the rate of Taiwan banks ' overdue loans has already reached 8 percent and more , and bad loans have reached more than $ 1.2 trillion NTD ; whether or not a large-scale or " local style " financial upheaval will explode in Taiwan has become a hot topic in international economic circles .  
Pressured by recent developments , he was forced to lift restrictions on the direct exchange of goods and people between the two islands of Jinmen [ Kinmen ] and Mazu [ Matsu ] and coastal Fujian . However , this is not direct " three links " in the real sense of the word and can not meet the strong desire and pressing demand of the people on both sides of the Strait . It also lags behind the objective situation of growing cross-Strait personnel and economic exchanges .  
Being forced by the development of the situation , the Taiwan authorities could not but make such an " opening . "  This was not direct " three links " in real terms , and could not meet the strong desire and the urgent need of the people on both sides of the strait .  Such an action lagged far behind the objective situation in which personnel exchanges and economic and trade exchanges between the two sides are increasing drastically day by day .  
He said that while the financial turmoil had forced other countries to cut back on infrastructure and social programmes , Hong Kong 's excellent finances - with fiscal reserves of more than HK $ 450 billion - were allowing it to push ahead with massive investments .  
He explained , " The prolonged economic downturn is making it difficult for some domestic property owners to continue with their monthly mortgage payments .  Some are even forced to sell their properties and move to less satisfactory private housing . "  " And rather than financial gains , the majority of transactions of private domestic property recorded recently have indicated losses to the vendors . "  
But most importantly , someday the Earth will be threatened by resources depletion , asteroid impacts or abrupt changes of solar activities .  Human will be forced to leave the Earth and find a new home in the endless Universe . To prepare for the challenges ahead , we need to understand the effects of prolonged weightlessness and living in confined environment on human 's physiology and psychology .  
Despite the financial crisis which forced Asian governments and businesses to strengthen their systems and to re-climb the ladder to growth , Mr Leung said no Asian country was more robust than China with a continuing economic growth consistently at seven to eight per cent a year , a stable currency , a booming manufacturing base and a blossoming domestic market . 
Since the need for mobility ruled out the use of a tripod , Kuo was forced to turn to flash . At such short range , however , flash is ineffective unless a special moveable mount for the lamp is attached to the camera .  
In the reeducation camp , Tang was chained hand and foot and forced to do heavy and demeaning work such as carting stones and spreading manure . Most of Tang 's colleagues , undernourished , overworked and lacking his physical stamina and determination , eventually succumbed . Tang 's will to live and to drive out China 's enemies gave him the strength he needed .  
In Taiwan , as elsewhere in the world , prisons have historically been dark , dank and dirty places , with poor food , unsanitary conditions , and inmates forced to do hard labor under stern , sometimes cruel supervision .  
Moreover , the costs in broken lives , lost educations , and destroyed books and artworks are incalculable and difficult for Westerners to imagine . It is even more painful to realize that Mao launched the " Cultural Revolution " in order to attain the lofty goals of eliminating poverty , bureaucratic excesses and class differences , but became so intoxicated with his own delusions and solutions that he was blinded to the wishes of the people who were forced to follow his orders .  
The Republic of China is a law-abiding nation and as such does not in any way support or approve of illegal behavior . What must be considered in this case is that it is the autocratic , repressive regime on the mainland that so relentlessly controls all aspects of life , denying the basic human rights that are enjoyed in democratic countries that literally forced the six to use these means to seek their escape .  
In the first , murderers and brigands are tied to a bronze pole filled with fire . The second contains Blade Mountain . Here those who blasphemed the Buddha or wantonly killed living creatures are forced to climb naked up a mountain of innumerable sharp swords . Punished in the last level , the hell of freezing cold , are husband-killers , adulterers , the unfilial , and those who urged others to gamble .  
Britain is a prime example . After it became a welfare state in 1945 , the government took on the responsibility of caring for the poor , the handicapped , the sick , and the unemployed from cradle to grave , but a deepening fiscal crisis forced the government to raise taxes during the 1960 ' s .  
Given the influence of the thinking that ' man and the heavens each reflect the other , ' Chinese astronomical observation could never escape superstition , " explains Hwang Yi-nung , associate professor of History at Tsing Hwa University . When official astronomers witnessed an unusual celestial event , they would attach some forced political meaning to it , and rarely explored for the objective truth .  
Despite the presence of its own ban on exploiting Chinese labor , the Manchu government of the Ch'ing dynasty was powerless to enforce it . In 1859 the Anglo-French Expeditionary Force attacked Peking , sacked the Yuan-ming-yuan and forced the Ch'ing government to sign the Treaty of Peking . One of its clauses stated : " . . . Any Chinese subject desirous of taking up employment anywhere under British jurisdiction or elsewhere abroad may contract with a British subject to do so . . . "  
Mahjongg 's compulsive hold over its aficionados can be seen from the following true stories : A typhoon had forced Liu Hsiao-chen to cut short her trip down south , and worriedly she made her way back to Taipei . As she neared home through knee-deep flood water and in the pitch dark of a power blackout her anxiety grew . But stepping in at the door , there were her parents and a couple of neighbors happily engrossed in a game of mahjongg , playing by candlelight and with their feet perched up on stools .  
To each his strengths : Before economic reforms were implemented on the mainland , emphasis was placed on " standing on one 's own feet . " Hence , scientists were cut off from information about foreign technology and were forced to grope around in the dark . Yet in this way we gained some technological development experience , especially in a few specialized areas .  
The great Western tradition of management represented by the United States has encountered grave difficulties over the past 20 or 30 years . Under multicultural attack , the Protestant , capitalist camp has met with difficulties that it has been unable to adjust to and has had to search outside for inspiration , and the organic integration of the world economy has forced them to take a look at the rest of the world .  
When reading Ionesco or Wu we might rejoice that it is not the human race that is endangered , or feel happy that the inhumane phenomenon of forced prison labor is confined to remote China ; we should not forget that the loss of any species to this world , or any trampling on humanity is a serious threat and warning towards anyone who enjoys their human rights and art . (  
After the R . O . C . lost its UN seat , its international position gradually became more and more shadowy , as one country after another broke off diplomatic relations , navigational rights were rescinded , the R . O . C . was forced to withdraw from international organizations , and R . O . C . passport holders faced obstacles wherever they went .

After he returned to Japan , Ho 's worsening stomach ailment forced him to undergo surgery . The healing process was torturous , and to make matters worse , the Second World War had broken out . Under the pall of such physical and spiritual pain , the painter put down his brush . His brush had stopped , but he remained alive at heart .  
After the universal health insurance was implemented , the medical referral system , buttressed by ample financial power , went into an experimental phase . But wave after wave of strong suspicion and opposition have been thrown up against the program . This has forced the NHIB to initiate the " transitional step " of simplifying the referral system from having four levels to only two , and doing away with extra fees for those who have no referral slips , until the population can become accustomed to the referral system .  
" In future , newspapers should be competing on quality , not price , " says Simon Cheng , observing that compared with major newspapers overseas which cost at least NT $ 30-40 , newspapers in the ROC have always been cheap . When a number of honestly-run newspapers in Hong Kong were forced out of business by cutthroat competition in a price war last year , it was the readers who suffered in the end .  
As the end approaches it is best if the patient can lie in the auspicious position with their head to the north and their face to the west , but this should not be forced , and after breathing stops they should be left to lie naturally , and not moved .  
The Chinese insistence on morality and harmony has certainly destroyed many potential happy marriages . But when , in the face of the setbacks and buffets of real life , people are forced to suppress their emotions , these filter into the deepest parts of life and give rise to a warmth and sincerity which are lasting and inexhaustible-an inward , hidden " classical love . "  
However , this part is no joke : in recent years , many young mathematical and science talents , identified as gifted in high school but unable to pass the intelligence tests required to enter college , have been weeded out of the special program as a result , and are forced to take the Joint College Entrance Exams with everyone else .  
As one author puts it with complete confidence in a book published only a few years ago , when the gates of China were forced open in the nineteenth century , " the dreadful truth leaked out : the scale of the gardens of the mandarins compared to their equivalents in England rather as the bonsai does to the beech . " With such a world of difference between the Chinese and the English garden , the two should not be spoken of in the same breath . Mountain buildings , myriad torrents  
He no longer needed to punch a time-card or go to work . He no longer had a boss and was no longer controlled by anyone . Facing a huge expanse of unstructured time , he noticed : " I began to feel anxious , insecure and afraid . But all of these reactions forced me to become the master of my own life . "  
Sadly , many adults who do n't understand that this is normal will , as soon as they see a child doing this , beat them or tie their hands . There have even been nursery schools which have forced children to strip and " show the class " in order to humiliate them into stopping . " This type of violent and repressive technique , though it may prevent the behavior for a short time , could very well lead to all kinds of sexual problems for that person in the future , " says Chiang .  
Wang argues that practical reality has forced men to come up with a new self-image . " The new man idea has put a positive spin on caring for one 's family and sharing the housework . It has transformed traditional ideas that such behavior is the result of ' letting the wife wear the pants in the family ' or of the wife keeping the husband ' on a short leash . ' It has given men a way to gracefully retreat , and supported them in putting down old roles and adapting to change . "  
The scrap contained large amounts of insulation material made of plastics containing chlorine , so burning it produced highly toxic dioxin . The stench from the fires forced pupils at the nearby Nanning Junior High School to wear cotton face masks to school , and there were high rates of respiratory tract diseases among local residents .  
Due to the increased tension across the Taiwan Strait and incessant rumors of elevating levels of military alert , within five days Taiwan 's stock market shed more than a thousand points . On July 16 alone it plummeted 506 points , with total market value shrinking by more than NT $ 1.5 trillion . To prop up the market , the Ministry of Finance forced four major government-related funds-the postal savings fund , labor pension fund , labor insurance fund and civil service pension fund-to buy stock .  
People in their prime years ( 30s and 40s ) have always been considered the elite of the employment structure , positioned as they are between inexperienced workers and aging seniors . But in recent years , there have been dramatic structural changes in the employment market . Unemployment and forced career changes have become increasingly common among workers in their prime .  
Donations have come pouring in by the truckload-instant noodles , mineral water , crackers , sleeping bags , blankets-and medical personnel have also swarmed to the area , but a lack of coordination has resulted in an excess of personnel and materiel in some areas and a complete lack in others . When well-equipped international rescue operations arrived at the disaster area , the lack of information forced many of them to set out on their own in search of victims . In some cases , five or six different rescue groups converged on a single site .  
In 1991 , the older generation of KMT politicians that filled the seats of the legislative branch of the central government-who had been in place since 1947-were forced to retire . Finally , the people of Taiwan , who in the past could only vote for local officials and a very small number of so-called " supplementary seats " to the national parliament , could elect their own legislators .  
We discovered that China in the Year 1 was in the Han dynasty , which established the foundations of Chinese systems in many areas . It was an era also of dynastic struggles , filled with heroes and striking personalities . At the Year 1000 , the Song dynasty had reunified China . Its weakness forced it into a form of " economic diplomacy " to fend off the peoples of the north , yet at the same time this demilitarization of external relations led to splendorous achievements in culture and wealth for society as a whole .

Fortunately , there are a few things we can be confident about : Though today 's constitutional environment is confused and rapidly changing , no one will be assassinated , the parliament will not be forced to dissolve , there will be no division of the national territory , and there will be no bloody wars .  
Attempts were made to eradicate the influence of organized crime in politics during Lee Teng-hui 's presidency , but the party also needed votes and had to nurture local factions . As Wang points out : " Several ministers of finance were forced out of office for raising taxes . No wonder the public tends to regard the KMT as ' rich but uncouth , ' and as having allowed ' black and gold to rule in tandem . ' "  
As Taiwan 's industrial structure undergoes transformation , we see the traditional manufacturing firms migrating offshore in search of cheap labor , materials , and land . Although this has reduced the ROC 's tax revenues , the industries that have stayed behind , forced to reinvent themselves , have adapted with flying colors to the new structure .  
From the 1970s to the beginning of 1990s , entrance to these schools was fixed at a ratio of 30:70 . No matter how strong the desire of students to continue toward university , seven out of every ten were forced out of the university track and into the vocational track right after leaving junior high ( i.e . just before their tenth year in school ) . These have been the real victims left on the school advancement battlefield .  
Moreover , because the cafe was located right next to the Hsimenting movie theater district , it attracted many young people , especially when blockbusters were showing on nearby cinema screens .

" My eldest brother was beaten more than any of us when he was little , but now he is the most devoted , " notes a senior newspaper reporter , who is one of three siblings . When they were young , their father hit her older brother or forced him to kneel in punishment on a daily basis . Even when she or her younger brother did something wrong , their parents still punished her older brother for not teaching his younger siblings to behave correctly .  
With falling student numbers and faced with apparent apathy , technical and vocational colleges have been forced to adjust their developmental goals in order to survive , and this has thrown the entire system into crisis .  
Chu Ching-i , a scholar at Academia Sinica , thinks that a child should not be forced to enter brutally competitive streaming before he has an understanding of his own subjective , natural disposition and objective , outside choices . Only by experiencing culture as far as possible in all its facets and richness can a student discover his own real interests and talents-and then make his own decisions .  
Chen Tie-yi , known for writing the words and music to more than 3000 Mandarin pop songs over the years , recognized what underlay Li Junqing 's lyrics to " Unchanging Love " : the " distant star " and " tiny firefly " represented China 's government , which had been forced by the Japanese advance to flee to Chongqing .  
Making his home in Tainan , Shen set up a private academy and practiced medicine . With other literary enthusiasts , he also formed the Tungyin Society , the writings of which were filled with the nostalgia , grief , and resentment of men of standing forced into exile .  
As human civilization has moved into the information age , factories , which had been designed with large-scale machinery in mind , have begun to shrink . Moreover , traditional factories , which used to be located in city centers , have been forced to move because of the pollution they cause or because the real estate value of land has come to outstrip its industrial value . This process has naturally left behind some major " industrial relics . "  
Some people in political circles are worried that the " strategic ambiguity " that has characterized Taiwan-US-China relations over the years will be undermined and a premature showdown forced as a result of sentiments expressed in a referendum . The rapid rise of mainland China in recent years has brought it international political and economic power that can not be ignored . If the US leans toward the PRC , this may have unfortunate consequences for Taiwan .  
Intending to prevent a recurrence of Bunun resistance and because it was difficult to keep the garrison roads in good repair in the deep mountain areas , the Japanese government went a step further and forced a mass displacement of the Bunun down the mountain to the lower reaches of the Lakulaku River on the Huatung Valley plain . Through contact with the Han Chinese and the Amis people living there , the unique characteristics of Bunun mountain culture were gradually lost .  
But neglected all along was the Aborigines ' viewpoint and what they had to say , " points out Sun Ta-chuan . He gives an example : developing the water resources of the mountain regions was for the benefit of those downstream , while the Aborigines living upstream were frequently without potable water . When the mountain regions were included in national parks , the Aborigines were forced to leave the area , losing their original living space and sacred territory , and they were cut off from their traditional cultural roots .  
" In the past some licensing companies just did n't care and forced artists to sign licensing agreements that covered ' all ' of their works . And you know , this ' all ' included creative work done in the past , present and future . They really strongarmed them , " says Ivan Fan , deeply upset at this unfair treatment of the artists .  
Many members of the public receive threatening phone calls informing them they have offended a gangster , and if not careful will get their limbs broken . The caller will claim to have the victim 's photograph and address , and may even have a pizza delivered to the victim 's home , to strike fear into them .

At a time when the Croatian authorities have resorted to the cruellest means - massive armed aggression - with a view to realizing the basic premise of their policy , that is , the creation of the ethnically pure State , Mr . Grani _ is attempting to divert the attention of the international community away from the humanitarian catastrophe and tragedy of the Krajina Serbs who have been forced to flee their ancestral homes .

She drew attention to the current problem of the forced displacement of persons within Sri Lanka and attributed that situation to the actions of a secessionist group called the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) , which earlier in 1995 had turned its back on the option for settling the country 's ethnic issues through a process of peaceful negotiations , an option freely supported by all other political parties and groups in the country and welcomed by the international community .  
The Government of Sri Lanka had endeavoured to reduce to the absolute minimum the hardships forced on the peoples concerned , and to that end it had taken steps to ensure that they received food , medicine and other essential items without interruption and in sufficient quantities , although the aforementioned secessionist group was diverting a substantial part of that assistance for its own war effort .

In urban areas , it is the poor who most often are forced to live in dense squatter settlements characterized by unsanitary conditions , or near hazardous industrial plants .  
Ethnic and religious tensions between Timorese and Indonesians had increased ; mass immigration of Indonesians into the territory of East Timor was continuing ; cases of torture , arbitrary detention , attacks , summary executions , disappearances and killings were becoming increasingly common ; the numbers and violence of the military and police forces were increasing , and many Timorese , especially young people , had become strangers in their own land and had been forced to seek asylum . 
If the enemies do not return our small submarine , survivors and the dead unconditionally while continuing to make ill use of the incident for the sinister political purpose , we will be forced to take strong countermeasures .  
The relationship between the military and prostitution has been illustrated by cases of soldiers paying for the sexual services of orphaned , abandoned or displaced girls , who are often held in brothels under conditions of virtual slavery and forced to sexually service off-duty local soldiers .  
Violations of human rights remain extremely serious , including , in particular , the practice of torture , summary and arbitrary executions , forced labour , including forced portering for the military , abuse of women , politically motivated arrests and detention , forced displacement , serious restrictions on the freedoms of expression and association , and the imposition of oppressive measures directed , in particular , at ethnic and religious minority groups ;  
From the abolition of slavery to the prohibition of practices - less brutal , but more subtle - used for purposes of political coercion or in so-called social education and prevention programmes , ILO 's international action to combat forced labour has been marked by a constant concern to ensure that persons work of their own free will .  
The latter convention calls for the immediate and complete abolition of forced labour in the following five forms : as a measure of coercion or political education ; as a measure of mobilization for purposes of economic development ; as a sanction for having participated in strikes ; and as a measure of racial , social , national or religious discrimination .  
Despite being forced to devote a large part of its human and material resources to defending its land and people against the expansionist policies of Israel , the Syrian Arab Republic had undertaken a comprehensive and successful social development programme .  The leadership provided by the President had ensured the political stability and democratic climate necessary for broad participation in youth-related activities .  
The High Commissioner / Centre maintained a close working relation with the Conference secretariat by sharing its expertise and providing background materials as well as contributions in the area of human rights and on the specific issues of forced displacement , with a view to ensuring that commitments undertaken under international human rights and humanitarian law standards were accurately reflected in the final document of the Conference . 
On the matter of internal deportations and forced relocations , the Special Rapporteur concluded that government policies violated the freedoms of movement and residence and , in some cases , constitute discriminatory practices based on ethnic or religious affiliations .  
In recent years , owing to fragmentation of States into newly independent countries , the twin problems of forced relocation of populations and mass expulsions , including the so-called " ethnic cleansing " operations , have resulted in the involuntary displacement of millions of people as well as considerable suffering and loss of life and property .  
As in the preceding months , the mission of observers continues to received numerous allegations of massacres , killings , infringements of personal freedom and security , forced disappearances and arbitrary detentions in the interior of Burundi , especially in the provinces of Muramvya , Gitega , Kayanza , Cibitoke and Bubanza , allegations which are difficult or take a long time to verify because of the aforementioned security constraints . 
The hostages and prisoners of war held by the Armenians , many of whom are considered missing persons since they are being concealed from the ICRC , are forced to do heavy physical labour , subjected to beatings and torture , and the sick and wounded are denied basic medical assistance .  
He confirms that Azerbaijani prisoners of war were tortured and humiliated , forced to eat dirt , brutally beaten , had open wounds poked with lighted cigarettes and were deprived of their human dignity .  
The Committee is particularly concerned at the insufficient measures and programmes for the protection of the rights of the most vulnerable children , especially girls , children living in rural areas , children who are victims of abuse , children of single parents , children born out of wedlock , abandoned children , disabled children , and children who are , in order to survive , forced to live and / or work in the streets .  
The Committee recommends that special protective measures be implemented in relation to children living in rural areas , children who are victims of abuse , children of single-parent families , children born out of wedlock , abandoned , institutionalized and disabled children , children involved with the juvenile justice system , particularly when deprived of their liberty , children involved in child labour and children who , in order to survive , are forced to live and / or work in the streets .

His Government was deeply concerned at the lack of progress towards democratization and the continuing violation of human rights in Myanmar , particularly the continuing detention of political prisoners under very harsh conditions , the use of forced labour , the forced displacement of ethnic communities and the ongoing harassment of those engaged in legitimate political activity .  
These are the cause of confrontations and armed conflicts that unfortunately create an exodus of thousands of human beings who take to the roads : men , women , children and old people are left abandoned , adrift in despair wandering waves of humanity searching for safe or supposedly safe places , forced to survive crushed together , sometimes like cattle , in camps where the conditions were just described by our colleague from Zaire as subhuman .  
Noting with deep concern reports of grave human rights violations in the Sudan , in particular summary executions , detentions without trial , forced displacement of persons and torture , as described in reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , and the Special Rapporteur on the question of religious intolerance ,  
Expresses deep concern at the serious , widespread and continuing human rights violations in the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings and summary executions ; detentions without due process ; violations of the rights of women and children ; forced displacement of persons ; enforced or involuntary disappearances ; torture and other forms of cruel and unusual punishment ; slavery , practices similar to slavery and forced labour ; denial of the freedoms of expression , association and peaceful assembly ; and discrimination based on religion ;  
In those circumstances UNRWA was forced to perform new tasks which had been entrusted to it after the beginning of the peace process , in particular to meet the growing humanitarian needs , ensure the necessary level of services to the Palestinian population , sometimes in extremely difficult circumstances , facilitate the advancement of the peace process with the help of investment and job creation projects , help establish Palestinian State bodies in the autonomous areas and meet the growing needs despite a reduction in budgetary resources .

On behalf of the authorities of the Abkhazian Autonomous Republic and the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have been forced to leave their native place , allow me to express our deep gratitude to the United Nations , the Security Council and personally to you , Your Excellency , for the tireless efforts aimed at achieving a comprehensive political settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia , Georgia , in particular , for the firm and clear position taken by the United Nations towards the illegal parliamentary elections held by the present separatist leadership on 23 November 1996 .  
In pursuing cases with regard to trafficking and forced prostitution , the police are compelled to rely on diverse sources for information , such as Interpol , border guards , police operational activities and investigations into organized crime , diplomatic representations abroad , families looking for missing persons , clients of victims and victims themselves .  
The term " rape " was not defined , and although it was possible to adapt the term " rape " to sociological realities , that is to say to take account of present-day sexual practices , there was a reluctance to do so ; in most cases the only act characterized as rape was that ultimate violation of the person which is likely to result in pregnancy .  [ 66 ] Oral and anal penetrations forced on a person , whether male or female , were , at most , punishable as indecent assaults .  
In its resolution 1996 / 27 of 29 August 1996 , the Sub-Commission requested the Secretary-General , in accordance with Economic and Social Council decision 1996 / 290 , to convene an expert seminar on the practice of forced evictions and its relationship to internationally recognized human rights , with a view to developing a set of comprehensive human rights guidelines on forced evictions , and to submit the report on the seminar , together with the guidelines , to the Sub-Commission at its forty-ninth session .

countries , migration pressures due to climatic change , the protection of migrant women and children from abuse by their sponsors , the right of receiving countries to regulate access to their territory , the adverse consequences of forced migration , the situation of persons whose asylum claims have been rejected , the trafficking in women and children , prostitution and coercive adoption , and the sudden and massive arrival of refugees and displaced persons in need of international protection .  
enslaved national minorities such as the African _ Americans , Afro _ Brazilians , Dalits , etc . who suffer acute and persistent inequalities due to centuries of gross violation of their human rights through official State policies of enslavement , segregation , and attempted forced assimilation into the bottom levels or underclass of the dominant majority . 
The adoption of this theme highlighted the emphasis given by the international community to voluntary repatriation as a durable solution and asserted that a natural extension of that emphasis is the increased importance attached to the prevention of forced displacement .  
The cooperation between UNHCR and SADC will focus , inter alia , on the social , economic and political issues in the southern African region that have a bearing on the root causes of forced population displacement , refugee protection , provision of humanitarian assistance and the search for durable solution .  
The Special Rapporteur thus deeply regrets the fact that the States which had formed the nucleus of this multinational force were forced to break off their concerted efforts , after spending weeks setting up a base at Entebbe ( Uganda ) , owing to the lack of sufficient political support from the international community and to Rwanda 's repeated opposition to the undertaking .  
They can be used as a basis for designing programmes to improve the situation of children , particularly those belonging to the most disadvantaged groups , including disabled children , children born out of wedlock , children ill-treated and abused within the family , in institutions , or deprived of liberty , children who are victims of sexual exploitation , children belonging to minority groups , especially Roma , and children who , in order to survive , are forced to live and / or work in the streets .  
Gravely concerned at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , killings of civilians , torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , deaths in custody , absence of due process of law , severe restrictions on freedoms of opinion , expression , assembly and association , violations of freedom of movement , forced relocation , forced labour and portering and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Also strongly urges the Government of Myanmar to ensure full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , including freedom of expression and assembly , the right to fair trial and the protection of the rights of persons belonging to ethnic and religious minorities , and to put an end to violations of the right to life and integrity of the human being , to the practices of torture , abuse of women , forced labour and forced relocations and to enforced disappearances and summary executions ;  
While maintaining a war mentality in the vain hope of crushing the rebels in the field ( and thereby nullifying any attempt to begin the negotiations which Major Buyoya has himself advocated ) the Burundi de facto authorities are systematically resettling rural populations using an outdated strategy of forced villagization , whose weaknesses and the suffering entailed for the populations concerned have been demonstrated in other conflicts , particularly in Viet Nam . 
Recalling also and concurring with the conclusions of and recommendations made by recent international conferences on the human rights of women and girl children , in particular with respect to the violation of those rights through sexual and economic exploitation for the profit of recruiters , traffickers and crime syndicates , as well as other illegal activities related to trafficking , such as forced domestic labour , false marriages , child marriages , clandestine employment and false adoption ,  
Also condemns all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , recognizes them to be violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and calls for a particularly effective response to violations of this kind , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ;  
Also condemns all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , recognizes them to be violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and calls for a particularly effective response to violations of this kind , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ;  
Expresses its deep concern at continued serious human rights violations by the Government of the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , slavery and slavery _ like practices , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly , and emphasizes that it is essential to put an end to violations of human rights in the Sudan ;  
Urges the Government of the Sudan to investigate reported policies or activities which support , condone , encourage or foster the sale of or trafficking in children , separate children from their families and social backgrounds , forcibly round up children from the streets , or which subject children to forced internment , indoctrination or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , and to terminate immediately any such policies or activities and bring to trial any persons suspected of supporting or participating in them ;  
A week ago today , on 22 May , as we were sitting in this very chamber for a formal plenary meeting , at around 11 a.m . , some 200 persons or more , brandishing banners belonging to the PKK terrorists , broke into the Palais des Nations and forced their way into the first floor of the main building , smashing glass doors at door 4 .  
The Commission on Human Rights , at its fifty-second session , in its decision 1996 / 104 , decided to recommend to the Economic and Social Council , in the light of the conclusions of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) , to be held in Istanbul in June 1996 , to authorize the holding of an expert seminar on the practice of forced evictions with a view to developing comprehensive human rights guidelines on development-based displacement .  
Recognizing the widespread nature of the practice of forced evictions and that when forced evictions are carried out they can occur in a variety of contexts including but not limited to conflicts over land rights , development and infrastructure projects , such as the construction of dams or other large _ scale energy projects , land acquisition measures associated with urban renewal , housing renovation , city beautification programmes , the clearing of land for agricultural purposes or macro-urban projects , unbridled speculation in land , and the holding of major international events such as the Olympic Games ,  
Having due regard to all relevant definitions of the practice of forced evictions under international human rights provisions and instruments , the present Guidelines apply to instances of forced evictions in which there are acts and / or omissions involving the coerced and involuntary removal of individuals , groups and communities from their homes and / or lands and common property resources they occupy or are dependent upon , thus eliminating or limiting the possibility of an individual , group or community residing or working in a particular dwelling , residence or place .  
While there are many similarities between the practice of forced evictions and internal displacement , population transfer , mass expulsions , mass exodus , ethnic cleansing and other practices involving the coerced and involuntary movement of people from their homes , lands and communities , forced evictions constitute a distinct practice under international law .

The endemic housing shortage , declining standard of living and lack of sufficient Palestinian educational institutions within the City limits delineated by Israel have forced numerous parents to send their children to schools that are officially outside Jerusalem and may be less expensive than the ones located in the City .  
Thus , while the Government of the Republic of Angola regrets once again the fact that , in spite of the numerous General Assembly resolutions , among others , not one positive measure has been taken to lift the embargo , it urges the international community to cooperate with the United Nations in order to put an end , as soon as possible , to that blockade , whose main victims are thousands of human beings who are forced to make extraordinary sacrifices and see their social and economic development hindered .

Two points should be made clear : ( a ) at a time when the Human Rights Operation in Rwanda was advising staff not to travel on Cameroon Airlines aircraft and to be careful in their choice of airlines , the Special Rapporteur was forced to travel by Cameroon Airlines ; this is particularly regrettable in that experts and special rapporteurs have no insurance coverage ; ( b ) the Special Rapporteur 's budget of $ 69,770 for the current financial year had not yet been touched , although the year was drawing to a close .

In order to cut the main links between the insurgent groups and the civilian population , SLORC has forced entire communities living in the border area between Myanmar and Thailand to move to relocation sites which are subject to tight military control .  
Numerous testimonies received by the Special Rapporteur indicate that the civilian population living in or near the combat zone is the most susceptible to being forced to move : in these grey zones ( zones controlled or influenced by the insurgents ) the armed forces often resort to ground searches , destruction and burning of houses , and confiscation of property and food , which lead the people to move temporarily or permanently .  
While it could have opted for forced repatriation , Pakistan had continued to provide for the needs of Afghan refugees with its own resources , despite the enormous administrative , economic and social repercussions their presence in the country and their participation in the economic activities had caused , and the sometimes permanent environmental damage resulting from their concentration in the northern regions of the country . 
Expresses its deep concern at continued serious human rights violations by the Government of the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , slavery and slavery _ like practices , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly , and emphasizes that it is essential to put an end to violations of human rights in the Sudan ;

It was the Greek Cypriot armed onslaught in December 1963 against the Turkish Cypriot people and the bi-communal order that led to division on the island when the Turkish Cypriot people were forced to live in enclaves , deprived of all basic necessities and fundamental human rights , for 11 years prior to the legitimate Turkish intervention of 1974 .  
The adoption of this theme highlighted the emphasis given by the international community to voluntary repatriation as a durable solution and asserted that a natural extension of this emphasis is the increased importance attached to the prevention of forced displacement .  
The Committee commented on the discriminatory application of laws enforced against women prostitutes and not the men involved as traffickers , pimps and clients , and noted further that forced medical examinations of the women without similar attention to the male clients was not effective as a public health measure .

Thus , four Governments considered that a conference could suggest ways of reducing or preventing forced or involuntary migration ; one Government was interested in reducing illegal migration , while another hoped that a conference might lead to the regularization of the status of illegal migrants ; and a further four Governments expected that a conference might contribute towards improving the management of migration so that it could be reduced , stabilized or even eliminated . 
The stories are heartbreaking doctors and nurses forced to live in the lobby of a closed hospital ; middle-class families who owned their own homes , sent their children to college , travelled abroad , now living by selling their possessions .  
This percentage is calculated by taking the average percentage of all percentages of claims determined to have met the C1-MPA forced hiding criteria , weighted by the relative size of the populations included .  
From 1963 , the Turkish Cypriots have been forced to live in scattered enclaves across the island under deplorable conditions , faced with harsh economic restrictions and besieged by hostile Greek Cypriot armed elements .  
Owing to the hard economic pressures created by the comprehensive embargo imposed on Iraq , large numbers of Iraqi women were forced to abandon working life by resigning or retiring from jobs because of fast increasing living costs and inadequate salaries .  
Destruction of houses , arbitrary indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians and forced relocation of people to unknown sites culminating in what is known as ethnic and tribal cleansing are all deployed as techniques for a show of military might .

The cruel irony is that the very victims of development are the ones who are being forced to tighten their belt and eat less in order to pay for the extravagant mistakes of powerful local elites and their external supporters .  25 .  The heavy borrowing of the 1970s alone did not precipitate the debt crisis .  
Noting with grave concern the content of the report of the Commission of Inquiry of the International Labour Organization , [ 5 ] appointed in March 1997 in accordance with article 26 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organization , regarding the observance by Myanmar of the Forced Labour Convention , 1930 ( No .  29 ) , which indicates a widespread and systematic use of forced labour imposed by the military on the civilian population ,

The intensification of armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the increasingly ethnic and religious nature of the conflict , which have resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement , and which hinder the return of the internally displaced to their homes ;  
With regard to conduct forbidden by international humanitarian law , there were numerous cases of murders of protected persons , torture , taking of hostages , attacks on the civilian population and forced displacements , which followed a systematic pattern .  
As for the acts committed ( factor a above ) , the historical and evidentiary record suggests cases of murder ( rising to the level of extermination of political opposition ) , forced labour , torture and other inhumane acts .  
The declining trend in official development assistance ( ODA ) and the increasingly frequent imposition of conditions of an economic and financial or a political , legal or humanitarian nature had forced many developing countries to resort to private capital flows , which had been concentrated in a small number of countries and had proved unstable and crisis-prone .  
While promoting the uses of voluntary initiatives and agreements as positive instruments for sustainable development , trade unions will also promote the defining of minimum social , environmental and economic indicators that voluntary initiatives or agreements must never conflict with or undermine ( for example , minimum social indicators would include International Labour Organization ( ILO ) core labour standards , child and forced labour provisions , and employment equality requirements ) .  
Demands an immediate halt to all repressive actions undertaken in Kosovo by the Serbian authorities which has led to further ethnic cleansing in the region , the genocide of Kosovars , their forced mass exodus and the destruction of their property with the aim of preventing their return , and also demands the immediate withdrawal of the Serbian military and paramilitary forces from Kosovo ;  
Condemning also the massive military operations launched by the Serbian authorities against the unarmed civilians in Kosovo , resulting in large _ scale killings , systematic and planned massacres , destruction of homes and property , and forced mass exoduses to neighbouring countries , as well as internal displacement ,  
Yet the rapidly increasing indigenous labour force in the GCC countries , which is growing by an average annual rate of 5 per cent , with a combined population growth rate estimated at 3.3 per cent annually , have forced the countries to seek appropriate policies to create adequate employment opportunities for their nationals .  
The continuing violations of the rights of children , in particular through the lack of conformity of the existing legal framework with the Convention on the Rights of the Child , through conscription of children into forced labour programmes , through their military and sexual exploitation and through discrimination against children belonging to ethnic and religious minority groups ;  
To translate into concrete action their commitment to the progressive and effective elimination of child labour contrary to accepted international standards , and urges them , as a matter of priority , to eliminate the worst forms of child labour , such as forced labour , bonded labour and other forms of slavery ;  
There is a renewed global interest in issues relating to exclusion from refugee status , not least because internal conflicts are being conducted in flagrant disregard of international human rights and humanitarian law , and because both persecutors and their victims are often forced by events to seek refuge together .  
Condemning also the massive military operations launched by the Serbian authorities against the unarmed civilians in Kosovo , resulting in large _ scale killings , systematic and planned massacres , destruction of homes and property , and forced mass exoduses to neighbouring countries , as well as internal displacement ,

To cease immediately its continued repressive practices , including the practice of forced deportation and relocation , against the Iraqi Kurds , Assyrians and Turkmen , and against the population of the southern marsh areas , where drainage projects have provoked environmental destruction and a deterioration of the situation of the civilian population , and to ensure the personal integrity and freedoms , including the full freedom of belief , of the Shia and their religious establishment ;  
The continuing violations of the rights of children , in particular through the lack of conformity of the existing legal framework with the Convention on the Rights of the Child , through conscription of children into forced labour programmes , through their military and sexual exploitation and through discrimination against children belonging to ethnic and religious minority groups ;  
To translate into concrete action their commitment to the progressive and effective elimination of child labour contrary to accepted international standards , and urges them , as a matter of priority , to eliminate the worst forms of child labour , such as forced labour , bonded labour and other forms of slavery ;

In paragraph 10 of its report ( A / 52 / 410 ) , the Advisory Committee stated that it had been informed that annex B , section 6 , Loss or damage , paragraph 18 , of the contribution agreement would read as follows : In cases of loss or damage resulting from a single hostile action or forced abandonment , the United Nations will assume liability for each and every item of major equipment when the collective generic fair market value equals or exceeds the threshold value of $ 250,000 .  
The crisis in Kosovo has resulted in the mass forced displacement and deportation of hundreds of thousands of civilians , wholesale destruction of property and means of livelihood , wanton lawlessness and violence , thousands of documented killings , countless as-yet undocumented deaths , and immeasurable human suffering .  
Refugees who have arrived in neighbouring countries have given consistent accounts of civilians being subjected to systematic and extreme human rights violations by security forces , of executions , of forced eviction from their homes , deportations , arbitrary detention , acts of sexual violence and burning of homes .

We reiterate our call on all States to translate into concrete action their commitment to the progressive and effective elimination of child labour contrary to accepted international standards , and urge them , as a matter of priority , to eliminate the worst forms of child labour , such as forced labour , bonded labour and other forms of slavery .  
Despite an increasing awareness of the problem , however , many refugees were once again exposed to cross-border attacks , forced recruitment into armed fighting forces and confinement in remote , isolated and perilously located camps .  
Owing to the uncontrolled crossing-over of armed groups of Albanian terrorists and bandits , systematically abusing , intimidating , abducting and killing non-Albanian populations and looting , stealing and destroying their property , as well as making forced entries into people 's homes , burning churches and places of worship , there followed a massive exodus of Serbs and Montenegrins from Kosovo and Metohija .  
Noting that migrant workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine their human dignity , including being forced to live separately from their spouses and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and that they are often victims of violence , racism and xenophobia ,  
UNICEF has actively publicized its view that it is unacceptable that a clear ban on childrens recruitment has not yet been imposed on the direct and indirect participation in hostilities of children below 18 years of age , regardless of whether they have been forced to join armed forces , or whether they appear to have done so voluntarily ; this applies equally to governmental and non-governmental forces .  
According to the indictment , many of the detainees under the accused 's control were subjected to inhumane treatment , including excessive and cruel interrogation , physical and psychological harm , forced labour in hazardous conditions and being used as " human shields " , and some of the detainees were murdered or otherwise killed .

Most important and this is to be welcomed it has recognized in its resolutions adopted in recent years that repression of the civilian population , ethnic cleansing , genocide , large-scale forced displacement and relocation of civilians and other flagrant violations of international humanitarian law constitute a threat to international peace and security .  
The Taliban 's conduct of forced displacement of the civilian population during their recent offensive in the Shomali plains is a particularly alarming signal which reflects the movement 's apparent disregard for the concerns expressed by the international community .  
I would like to emphasize that it was the Greek Cypriot armed onslaught in December 1963 against the Turkish Cypriots and the binational order that led to the division of the island when the Turkish Cypriots were forced to live in enclaves , deprived of all basic necessities and fundamental human rights , for 11 years prior to the legal Turkish intervention of 1974 .  
An organized group of heavily armed individuals , claiming to represent local residents , broke into the offices of the Izabal Banana Workers Union , threatened union leaders that they must give up the Union and their jobs at BANDEGUA , forced them to call off the union mobilization planned for the next day and compelled them , on pain of death , to leave the area with their families .

In the framework of the ongoing internal armed conflict , serious , gross and systematic human rights violations and large-scale breaches of international humanitarian law have forced a growing number of individuals and entire communities to leave their homes .  
Considering that serious , gross and systematic human rights violations and breaches of international humanitarian law are the foremost direct cause of forced displacement in Colombia , the workshop urged the Government of Colombia to comply with the Guiding Principles and with the international recommendations already made to address the situation , in particular by the United Nations and the OAS Inter-American Commission on Human Rights .  
Warfare in the central highlands in April and May involved vicious attacks against civilians , including the summary execution of women and children , forced and involuntary displacement , the looting and burning of homes , arbitrary detention and the use of forced labour .

The military incursions in northern Iraq violated its sovereignty and territorial integrity and had forced a withdrawal of the central administration from those areas , turning them into a breeding ground for factional infighting and bloody conflict .  
Any consideration of the Iraq sanctions regime should not be artificially forced or hurried if we are to achieve the twin goals of alleviating the grave humanitarian situation in Iraq and ensuring Iraqi compliance with the requirements in respect of its alleged remaining weapons of mass destruction .

There is a renewed global interest in issues relating to exclusion from refugee status , not least because internal conflicts are being conducted in flagrant disregard of international human rights and humanitarian law , and because both persecutors and their victims are often forced by events to seek refuge together .  
The Secretary-General raised the pertinent question of humanitarian intervention in the wake of the inaction of the Organization with regard to the genocidal war in Rwanda and its horrific consequences , and the forced intervention in Kosovo , which saved thousands of lives and reversed the heinous policy of ethnic cleansing there , but which was carried out outside the ambit of the Security Council . 
The Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts will certainly be of great practical importance , ensuring the speedy rescue of astronauts in case of breakdowns , accidents or forced landings , for , as scientific and technological advance continues , manned space flights will become longer and more complex every year . . . .  
The Working Group was concerned at the continuing abusive treatment of women , including custodial deaths , torture , rape , abduction , disappearances , arbitrary arrests , forced abortions and sterilizations , harassment and arson by security forces , including military and police forces , or by other governmental authorities , particularly where separatist movements were reported .

Numerous testimonies received by the Special Rapporteur indicate that the civilian population living in or near the combat zone is generally forced to move : in these " grey zones " ( zones controlled or influenced by the insurgents ) the armed forces often resort to searches , destruction and burning of houses , and confiscation of property and food to force the people to move , temporarily or permanently .  
The introduction to the Principles contains a refinement of previous working definitions : internally displaced persons are persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence , in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict , situations of generalized violence , violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters , and who have not crossed an internationally recognized State border .

This concern was also raised by the Government of South Africa who reported that the extensive and highly exploitative system of domestic workers provides hidden opportunities for sex services , either forced or paid .  
The human rights violations reported to him by credible eyewitnesses had included forced displacement of the civilian population , deliberate burning of houses , summary execution of noncombatants , arbitrary detention and forced labour .  
Striving to meet basic needs but unable to increase their productivity , poor rural households in most lowincome countries have been forced to expand onto marginal lands and / or mine their existing land base through unsustainable landmanagement practices .  
On the civil service level , it is often motivated by salaries so low and so infrequently paid that public servants are forced to choose between service to their country and meeting their families basic needs .  
The consequences of such failures are only too obvious : too many belligerent groups targeting the innocent and the defenceless ; massive numbers of refugees forced to flee for safety ; gross and systematic violations of human rights perpetrated .  
The panel agreed that on the institutionalization of crimes , local guilty parties would be held accountable by the people but the double crime is when people are robbed once by corrupt officials and then again when they are forced to repay the debts . 
Mr .

Concerning Myanmars cooperation with the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) , it had in October received an ILO technical cooperation mission and , with its advice , it had adopted the necessary administrative , executive and legislative measures to ensure that there could be no instances of forced labour in the country .  Those measures should completely do away with any apprehension the international community might have that laws inherited from the British colonial Government might be applied so as to facilitate forced labour in the territory of Myanmar .  
A veritable industrial complex based on forced labour had grown up in the prisons , and the whites responsible for brutal crimes such as the murder of African immigrant Amadou Diallo went unpunished .

Strongly condemns the continued use of disproportionate and indiscriminate force by Russian military forces , federal servicemen and State agents , including attacks against civilians and other breaches of international law as well as serious violations of human rights , such as forced disappearances , extrajudicial , summary and arbitrary executions , torture and other inhuman and degrading treatment , and calls upon the Government of the Russian Federation to comply with its international human rights and humanitarian law obligations in its operations against Chechen fighters and to take all measures to protect the civilian population ;  
Recalling the inclusion of gender-related crimes and crimes of sexual violence in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court ( A / CONF . 183 / 9 ) , which affirms that rape , sexual slavery , enforced prostitution , forced pregnancy , enforced sterilization and other forms of sexual violence constitute , in defined circumstances , a crime against humanity and / or a war crime , and reiterating that acts of sexual violence in situations of armed conflict can constitute serious violations or grave breaches of international humanitarian law ,  
Affirms that the term violence against women means any act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life , and including domestic violence , crimes committed in the name of honour , crimes committed in the name of passion , traditional practices harmful to women , including female genital mutilation , and forced marriages ;

This phenomenon of multiple job-holding is considered to be on the increase based on the observation of a local pollster , who points out that an increasing number of Jamaicans are being forced into additional employment on a part-time basis as a measure to counter the rising cost of living .  
The Government , which had been absorbing the bulk of this increase in international prices , was forced to pass it on at the pump . lectricit dHait then doubled its price per kilowatt , leading to a significant increase in production costs in the industrial sector , which was already in poor shape .  
The Board also took into consideration in its selection that the Group had decided to keep under consideration at its twenty-sixth session the question of debt bondage , the role of corruption in the perpetuation of slavery and slavery-like practices , problems affecting migrant workers , the protection of child labourers , forced labour , trafficking in human organs and tissues , forced marriages , ways to combat sexual abuse of children inside the family , and the urgent need for adequate help to be offered to victims of such practices .  
Recommends once again that Governments cooperate with trade unions and employers organizations at the national level to address the problem of bonded labour and that trade unions and employers organizations at the local , national and international levels utilize the existing structures of the International Labour Organization dealing with violations of the relevant conventions concerning forced labour , and encourages concerned non-governmental organizations to strengthen their activities for disseminating information and advising trade unions in this regard ;  
Noting that migrant workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine their human dignity , including being forced to live separately from their spouses and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and that they are often victims of violence , racism and xenophobia ,

At its fifty-seventh session , in April 2001 , the Commission on Human Rights adopted , without a vote , resolution 2001 / 13 on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan , in which it strongly condemned the mass killings and systematic human rights violations against civilians and persons deprived of their liberty , for reasons related to the armed conflict , resulting in the massive , forced displacement of the civilian population .  
It also noted with deep concern the continuing pattern of human rights violations in Afghanistan and the continuation of armed hostilities and the complex nature of the conflict , including its ethnic , religious and political aspects , which had resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement .  
The armed conflict in the north and the south-west , which forced most of the countrys development projects to a halt , and the unstable social and political situation prevailing in Ethiopia and Somalia have accelerated the deterioration of the Djiboutian economy .  
The representative called for an investigation into the mining activities of the Peabody Western Coal Company , which had damaged the health of indigenous peoples , destroyed irreplaceable religious shrines , ancestral graves / burial sites and other sacred areas , caused the decline of the aquifers and contaminated natural springs and vegetation ; the mining had also caused forced relocation .

At its thirty-fourth ordinary session , held in July 2001 , the Heads of State and Government of OAU adopted a resolution , entitled Fiftieth Anniversary of the Adoption of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of the Refugees , in which member States reaffirmed their commitment to finding durable solutions to refugee problems , most importantly , by facilitating voluntary repatriation , while endeavouring to create conducive conditions to that effect , and concomitantly take preventive measures , and peacefully resolve conflicts in order to avoid the forced displacement of populations . 
In the most unfortunate situations , the State apparatus , unable to cope with the security challenge posed by terrorism , is forced to take draconian measures to counter it , with an inevitable impact on civic and human rights .  
The mission , which had met with government representatives and a broad cross section of humanitarian partners and visited internally displaced persons locations in Bi , Huambo and Luanda provinces , expressed concern over allegations of human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law , including forced relocation , targeting of civilians , forced conscription , looting of humanitarian supplies and sexual violence .  
At the systematic policy of the Government of Myanmar of persecuting the democratic opposition , National League for Democracy members and their families , as well as ethnic opposition parties , and at the use by the Government of intimidatory methods such as arbitrary arrest and detention , abuse of the legal system , including harsh long-term prison sentences , which has forced many to refrain from exercising their legitimate political rights ;

If any grave turn occurs in Taiwan leading to the separation of Taiwan from China in any name , if Taiwan is invaded and occupied by a foreign country , and if the Taiwan authorities refuse , sine die , the peaceful settlement of cross-strait reunification through negotiation , it will then be impossible to have peaceful reunification and the Chinese Government will only be forced to adopt necessary measures to smash the separatist scheme for " Taiwan independence " and safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
However , if a grave turn of events occurs leading to the separation of Taiwan from China in any name , or if Taiwan is invaded and occupied by foreign countries , or if the Taiwan authorities refuse , sine die , the peaceful settlement of cross-Strait reunification through negotiations , then the Chinese Government will only be forced to adopt all drastic measures possible , including the use of force , to safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and fulfill the great cause of reunification .  
In view of the situation in which the amphibious warfare vehicles could not move forward under water and the wheeled canons could not land because of the poor geological conditions , such as sludge , and factors , such as waves , currents , shell craters , and ditches , the regiment made use of its existing bridge of boats equipment and set up a floating landing stage , thus enabling the heavy-duty equipment to reach the beach successfully in a forced landing .  
To attain this strategic objective , it used as bait such Preferential economic conditions as expanding trade , increasing investment , and cutting or waiving debts , and forced African countries to initiate political and economic reforms , Remolding them according to its subjective desire .  
Nevertheless , Taiwan , being a typical hilly island and surrounded by the sea , is narrow in space and lacks strategic depth .  Crowded with 23-million people , the 36,000 square kilometer island is absolutely unable to resist forced entry by a power .  At the moment , the Taiwan authorities are going against the historical trend .  
The worst victims of the bombing and sanctions were ordinary Yugoslav people .  Because of inadequate funds , many industries , mines , and enterprises stopped operations .  Many staff and workers were forced to take compulsory leave and wrer only entitled to partial wages .  
As a developing country with a huge population , China is short on per capita resources and has practiced extensive development for years .  Despite its low income level , therefore , China is forced to deal with those problems that other countries did not have to tackle until their incomes reached a high level .  China 's resource and ecological situation is very grim .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out that since the United States indeed wants to use Taiwan to contain us , we can only speed up the scientific and technological modernization of our armed forced while developing the economy and striving for peaceful reunification ; we should develop hi-tech weaponry and possess at least three or four types of hi-tech deterrent weapons to counter invading forces .  
Military sources in Beijing have revealed that the military exercise under way in the South China Sea has been affected by the collision incident and been forced to make a major readjustment ; a number of scheduled maneuvers have been cancelled and the focus has switched to dealing with the aftermath , including the order to the exercise units to repeatedly search for the missing pilot and recover the plane .  
The unexpected collision of US and PRC military aircraft at a point 140 km southeast of Hainan , leading to the PRC F-8 fighter plane crashing , and the US EP-3 reconnaissance plane making a forced landing at Lingshui Airbase , is a test of the crisis management ability of both the PRC and the US . It also makes it clear that the strategic partnership relationship is finished , and determines even more how the two regard each other as strategic competitors .  
Observers believe that the Chinese government carried out a reasonable , beneficial , and moral struggle in the process of handling this matter , and forced the downright hegemonic United States government to capitulate and admit that the American spy plane had encroached upon Chinese air space leading to the collision with a Chinese fighter plane and subsequent loss of its pilot .  The US government was compelled to make multiple expressions of regret , sadness , and apology , thereby strongly protecting China 's national dignity and the country 's sovereignty .  
First they were confusing right and wrong , taking bites and demanding that China release the crew and the airplane .  Moreover , they absurdly claimed that the forced landing of the American spy plane at the Hainan Island airport was " US territory , " and that the United States had " sovereign exemption , " and China was not permitted to board the aircraft for inspection .  They completely disregarded the fact that the Chinese fighter plane had crashed and the pilot was lost , causing a tragedy for fellow Chinese officials and a Chinese household .  
Said Zhang Wenzhong , political commissar of this institute : After the incident occurred , our government and people waged a firm struggle against the hegemonic ways of the United States and forced the US Government to change its initial tough and unreasonable attitude and to apologize to the Chinese people .  This once again shows that the party center with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core is farsighted , good at strategizing , and capable of keeping various kinds of complicated situation under control and dealing with complex issues .  
People have noticed that after this incident occurred , political leaders in the United States showed a truculent and unreasonable attitude .  They were forced to express their regret to the Chinese side only after facing tremendous domestic and international pressure .  
Due to the perverse behavior of the Chen Shui-bian government over the past year , the Taiwan stock market has weakened , the foreign exchange market is depressed , and industry and commerce face unprecedented difficulties , on top of which cross-strait relations are deadlocked and have retrogressed rather than advancing .  Industrial confidence on the island has collapsed and business has been forced to invest abroad for the sake of its existence .  
US President Bush recently issued a series of tough statements regarding cross-strait affairs and US support for Taiwan . In the wake of these statements , Communist China 's authoritative personages in charge of Taiwan affairs said that Communist China 's high-ranking personnel are paying close attention to the future actions on the part of the United States . If the United States continues getting involved in cross-strait affairs , Communist China might be forced to resolve the Taiwan issue ahead of its schedule by resorting to tough means .  
Plus its inexperience in administration and its confused and ambiguous financial , economic , environmental protection , and social welfare policies , all caused the worsening of the investment environment and forced a large number of enterprises to close down or move out of Taiwan .  
The opponent , who was in a rush for a short moment , was finally forced to land at the seaside - - investigation showed that the pilot of this small airplane was a man who once won the championship in the world super light airplane flying competition and had 25 years of flying experience .  
Judging from the surface , cross-strait relations remain calm and stable ; moreover , thanks to the hard efforts of the public as well as the industrial and commercial circles on the island who have been imposing pressure on the authorities , many man-made restrictions in Taiwan are forced to be relaxed , thus giving rise to an unprecedented upsurge of economic , trade , and cultural exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits .  
This indicates that what he said one year ago about not pursuing " Taiwan independence " was just a forced move to which he had no alternative , and as soon as he held that he had firm footing , or had a certain support from foreign forces , he showed his true features .  
At that time , the entire country of China was in the midst of a crisis of being carved up , and the Qing government was forced to conclude and sign numerous unequal treaties ceding territory and paying indemnities because of its inability to withstand the gunboats and terrific cannon of the western Great Powers .  
During his inauguration anniversary interview with the Wall Street Journal , he specifically cited the bitter experiences of leaders in neighboring countries in comparison with his own .  Philippine President Estrada was forced to resign , while the Indonesian President was censured by the national assembly , which also threatens to impeach him .  " Taiwan went through the so-called recall incident but made it through in one piece " and the key was that the military did not have a hand in the political scene as Taiwan kept its fine tradition of military nationalization .  
As a huge army of 100,000 strong amassed nearby and as the three armed services , like an arrow on the bowstring , were getting ready to conduct a three-dimensional drill of forced beach landing and attacking , who would have thought that our small car with a nonresident license plate could enter this island in Fujian Province without being subject to any inspection .  
However , if there is any major incident of making Taiwan break away from China in any name , if there occurs foreign occupation of Taiwan , or if the Taiwan authorities indefinitely refuse to peacefully resolve the issue of unification of the two sides of the strait through negotiation , the Chinese government will be forced to take all possible decisive measures , including the use of force , to safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and to complete the great cause of unification of China .  
All East Asian countries paid attention to drawing lessons from the financial crisis and intensified financial reform .  On the one hand , the financial order was straightened out .  Some ailing banks were forced to close down , merge with others , and accept others ' management , so that the bad credit of banks was resolutely resolved .

People who understand international law know that an unequal international treaty the signing of which is forced by military aggression is not valid , and so whether or not after its defeat in the war Japan signed a document on returning Taiwan to China does not affect the legal status of Taiwan as Chinese territory .  
First , beginning from 1995 , the state standardized enterprises ' activities of reproducing legal audio-video products .  The state has carried out severe inspections of enterprises engaging in reproducing porno audio-video products and pirated CD products .  It has comprehensively carried out the copyright supervisor system and the SID coding system .  It has strengthened the routine management of production lines and basically solved the problem of reproducing pirated CD products by enterprises with legal production licenses .  The move has forced the activities of pirating CD products going underground .  
This policy forced the Kuomintang authorities in Taiwan to lift the Martial Law at the end of 1986 and to open up indirect " three links " on both sides of the strait , enabled Taiwan to have opportunities to carry out a series of social , political and economic reforms under a peaceful environment , and facilitated democratic politics and free market economy in Taiwan .  
While screening and rectifying public places on 20 January 2000 , the Pudong New District Public Security Bureau discovered that a bathhouse was operating as a brothel .  The bureau personnel traveled over 3,000 km to two cities , two counties , and eight towns in Hubei , and cracked a gang of hooligans who forced the kidnapped young girls into prostitution .  They arrested 34 culprits and successfully rescued six young girls who had been kidnapped and sold .  
People remember that at the beginning of the founding of New China , the central government immediately took rigorous measures to launch a nationwide anti-narcotics campaign .  It seized narcotics , banned the planting of opium poppies , closed opium halls , sternly punished narcotics producing and trafficking activities , punished over 80,000 narcotics-related criminal elements , forced 20 million drug addicts to quit drug addiction , and eradicated opium poppy planting in conjunction with rural land reform .  
In the white paper on " One-China Principle and Taiwan Issue , " the Chinese Government announced clearly that if a major change of events occurred where Taiwan is alienated from China in whatever name , if foreign forces invade and occupy Taiwan , and if the Taiwan authorities indefinitely refuses to solve the cross-strait reunification issue peacefully through talks , the Chinese Government will be forced to adopt all possible drastic measures , including the use of force , to safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity so as to accomplish China 's great cause of reunification .  
more than 10,000 officers and men of a certain infantry division swam across the choppy sea fully armed and rapidly landed on shore ; amphibious armored combat vehicles struck ferociously at targets on the opposite shore , made a forced beach landing , and crushed all resistance .  
A certain mechanized infantry division of the Nanjing Theater was equipped with amphibious armored combat vehicles , forming a storm battalion that made a forced beach landing and launched an " intense battle " of attacking the " enemy 's " support locations and seizing key positions in breadth and depth .  
Traces of discrimination and prejudice were everywhere to be seen in the Wen Ho Lee case .  The US agencies concerned forced an arrest of Lee with a fabricated charge and , being prejudiced by first impressions , went to the extent of fabricating false evidence in an attempt to convict him of heavy offenses .  They put Lee in solitary confinement and in shackles and manacles , and for a time prohibited him from contacting outsiders and having exchanges with his family members in the Chinese language .  
At the same time , Taiwan 's financial authorities were forced to admit that the rate of Taiwan banks ' overdue loans has already reached 8 percent and more , and bad loans have reached more than $ 1.2 trillion NTD ; whether or not a large-scale or " local style " financial upheaval will explode in Taiwan has become a hot topic in international economic circles .  
Pressured by recent developments , he was forced to lift restrictions on the direct exchange of goods and people between the two islands of Jinmen [ Kinmen ] and Mazu [ Matsu ] and coastal Fujian . However , this is not direct " three links " in the real sense of the word and can not meet the strong desire and pressing demand of the people on both sides of the Strait . It also lags behind the objective situation of growing cross-Strait personnel and economic exchanges .  
Being forced by the development of the situation , the Taiwan authorities could not but make such an " opening . "  This was not direct " three links " in real terms , and could not meet the strong desire and the urgent need of the people on both sides of the strait .  Such an action lagged far behind the objective situation in which personnel exchanges and economic and trade exchanges between the two sides are increasing drastically day by day .  
He said that while the financial turmoil had forced other countries to cut back on infrastructure and social programmes , Hong Kong 's excellent finances - with fiscal reserves of more than HK $ 450 billion - were allowing it to push ahead with massive investments .  
He explained , " The prolonged economic downturn is making it difficult for some domestic property owners to continue with their monthly mortgage payments .  Some are even forced to sell their properties and move to less satisfactory private housing . "  " And rather than financial gains , the majority of transactions of private domestic property recorded recently have indicated losses to the vendors . "  
But most importantly , someday the Earth will be threatened by resources depletion , asteroid impacts or abrupt changes of solar activities .  Human will be forced to leave the Earth and find a new home in the endless Universe . To prepare for the challenges ahead , we need to understand the effects of prolonged weightlessness and living in confined environment on human 's physiology and psychology .  
Despite the financial crisis which forced Asian governments and businesses to strengthen their systems and to re-climb the ladder to growth , Mr Leung said no Asian country was more robust than China with a continuing economic growth consistently at seven to eight per cent a year , a stable currency , a booming manufacturing base and a blossoming domestic market . 
Since the need for mobility ruled out the use of a tripod , Kuo was forced to turn to flash . At such short range , however , flash is ineffective unless a special moveable mount for the lamp is attached to the camera .  
In the reeducation camp , Tang was chained hand and foot and forced to do heavy and demeaning work such as carting stones and spreading manure . Most of Tang 's colleagues , undernourished , overworked and lacking his physical stamina and determination , eventually succumbed . Tang 's will to live and to drive out China 's enemies gave him the strength he needed .  
In Taiwan , as elsewhere in the world , prisons have historically been dark , dank and dirty places , with poor food , unsanitary conditions , and inmates forced to do hard labor under stern , sometimes cruel supervision .  
Moreover , the costs in broken lives , lost educations , and destroyed books and artworks are incalculable and difficult for Westerners to imagine . It is even more painful to realize that Mao launched the " Cultural Revolution " in order to attain the lofty goals of eliminating poverty , bureaucratic excesses and class differences , but became so intoxicated with his own delusions and solutions that he was blinded to the wishes of the people who were forced to follow his orders .  
The Republic of China is a law-abiding nation and as such does not in any way support or approve of illegal behavior . What must be considered in this case is that it is the autocratic , repressive regime on the mainland that so relentlessly controls all aspects of life , denying the basic human rights that are enjoyed in democratic countries that literally forced the six to use these means to seek their escape .  
In the first , murderers and brigands are tied to a bronze pole filled with fire . The second contains Blade Mountain . Here those who blasphemed the Buddha or wantonly killed living creatures are forced to climb naked up a mountain of innumerable sharp swords . Punished in the last level , the hell of freezing cold , are husband-killers , adulterers , the unfilial , and those who urged others to gamble .  
Britain is a prime example . After it became a welfare state in 1945 , the government took on the responsibility of caring for the poor , the handicapped , the sick , and the unemployed from cradle to grave , but a deepening fiscal crisis forced the government to raise taxes during the 1960 ' s .  
Given the influence of the thinking that ' man and the heavens each reflect the other , ' Chinese astronomical observation could never escape superstition , " explains Hwang Yi-nung , associate professor of History at Tsing Hwa University . When official astronomers witnessed an unusual celestial event , they would attach some forced political meaning to it , and rarely explored for the objective truth .  
Despite the presence of its own ban on exploiting Chinese labor , the Manchu government of the Ch'ing dynasty was powerless to enforce it . In 1859 the Anglo-French Expeditionary Force attacked Peking , sacked the Yuan-ming-yuan and forced the Ch'ing government to sign the Treaty of Peking . One of its clauses stated : " . . . Any Chinese subject desirous of taking up employment anywhere under British jurisdiction or elsewhere abroad may contract with a British subject to do so . . . "  
Mahjongg 's compulsive hold over its aficionados can be seen from the following true stories : A typhoon had forced Liu Hsiao-chen to cut short her trip down south , and worriedly she made her way back to Taipei . As she neared home through knee-deep flood water and in the pitch dark of a power blackout her anxiety grew . But stepping in at the door , there were her parents and a couple of neighbors happily engrossed in a game of mahjongg , playing by candlelight and with their feet perched up on stools .  
To each his strengths : Before economic reforms were implemented on the mainland , emphasis was placed on " standing on one 's own feet . " Hence , scientists were cut off from information about foreign technology and were forced to grope around in the dark . Yet in this way we gained some technological development experience , especially in a few specialized areas .  
The great Western tradition of management represented by the United States has encountered grave difficulties over the past 20 or 30 years . Under multicultural attack , the Protestant , capitalist camp has met with difficulties that it has been unable to adjust to and has had to search outside for inspiration , and the organic integration of the world economy has forced them to take a look at the rest of the world .  
When reading Ionesco or Wu we might rejoice that it is not the human race that is endangered , or feel happy that the inhumane phenomenon of forced prison labor is confined to remote China ; we should not forget that the loss of any species to this world , or any trampling on humanity is a serious threat and warning towards anyone who enjoys their human rights and art . (  
After the R . O . C . lost its UN seat , its international position gradually became more and more shadowy , as one country after another broke off diplomatic relations , navigational rights were rescinded , the R . O . C . was forced to withdraw from international organizations , and R . O . C . passport holders faced obstacles wherever they went .  
Because he had chosen ophthalmology he took up a highly self-disciplined lifestyle He forced himself to strictly abstain from smoking and drinking , avoid anger , lead a settled , regular life , maintain a placid frame of mind , and not even to pick up heavy objects , so as to avoid any physical or mental imbalance which might make his hands unsteady and thereby affect the quality of his treatment of people 's eyes .  
A magic time machineThe tale begins two hundred years ago with a great flood that visited the old Penkang River ( now known as the Peikang River ) . An ancient village situated along the river was completely inundated , and the inhabitants were forced to flee , some moving north , others moving south .  
In life Among the Society of Beggars he stated that problems making ends meet combined with unfilial sons and grandchildren or unharmonious family relations forced many of the old and weak to beg . Shih described other beggars who pretended they were old and blind to support the opium habit of their wives .  
Making a choice for the childQ : After Chi An became pregnant with her second child in the United States , she was unwilling to have an abortion there , and she was afraid that when she returned to mainland China she would be forced to abort . With your help , she received political asylum and stayed in the US . In fact , she never incurred any direct oppression . Why was her application successful ?  
After he returned to Japan , Ho 's worsening stomach ailment forced him to undergo surgery . The healing process was torturous , and to make matters worse , the Second World War had broken out . Under the pall of such physical and spiritual pain , the painter put down his brush . His brush had stopped , but he remained alive at heart .  
After the universal health insurance was implemented , the medical referral system , buttressed by ample financial power , went into an experimental phase . But wave after wave of strong suspicion and opposition have been thrown up against the program . This has forced the NHIB to initiate the " transitional step " of simplifying the referral system from having four levels to only two , and doing away with extra fees for those who have no referral slips , until the population can become accustomed to the referral system .  
" In future , newspapers should be competing on quality , not price , " says Simon Cheng , observing that compared with major newspapers overseas which cost at least NT $ 30-40 , newspapers in the ROC have always been cheap . When a number of honestly-run newspapers in Hong Kong were forced out of business by cutthroat competition in a price war last year , it was the readers who suffered in the end .  
As the end approaches it is best if the patient can lie in the auspicious position with their head to the north and their face to the west , but this should not be forced , and after breathing stops they should be left to lie naturally , and not moved .  
The Chinese insistence on morality and harmony has certainly destroyed many potential happy marriages . But when , in the face of the setbacks and buffets of real life , people are forced to suppress their emotions , these filter into the deepest parts of life and give rise to a warmth and sincerity which are lasting and inexhaustible-an inward , hidden " classical love . "  
However , this part is no joke : in recent years , many young mathematical and science talents , identified as gifted in high school but unable to pass the intelligence tests required to enter college , have been weeded out of the special program as a result , and are forced to take the Joint College Entrance Exams with everyone else .  
As one author puts it with complete confidence in a book published only a few years ago , when the gates of China were forced open in the nineteenth century , " the dreadful truth leaked out : the scale of the gardens of the mandarins compared to their equivalents in England rather as the bonsai does to the beech . " With such a world of difference between the Chinese and the English garden , the two should not be spoken of in the same breath . Mountain buildings , myriad torrents  
He no longer needed to punch a time-card or go to work . He no longer had a boss and was no longer controlled by anyone . Facing a huge expanse of unstructured time , he noticed : " I began to feel anxious , insecure and afraid . But all of these reactions forced me to become the master of my own life . "  
Sadly , many adults who do n't understand that this is normal will , as soon as they see a child doing this , beat them or tie their hands . There have even been nursery schools which have forced children to strip and " show the class " in order to humiliate them into stopping . " This type of violent and repressive technique , though it may prevent the behavior for a short time , could very well lead to all kinds of sexual problems for that person in the future , " says Chiang .  
Wang argues that practical reality has forced men to come up with a new self-image . " The new man idea has put a positive spin on caring for one 's family and sharing the housework . It has transformed traditional ideas that such behavior is the result of ' letting the wife wear the pants in the family ' or of the wife keeping the husband ' on a short leash . ' It has given men a way to gracefully retreat , and supported them in putting down old roles and adapting to change . "  
The scrap contained large amounts of insulation material made of plastics containing chlorine , so burning it produced highly toxic dioxin . The stench from the fires forced pupils at the nearby Nanning Junior High School to wear cotton face masks to school , and there were high rates of respiratory tract diseases among local residents .  
Due to the increased tension across the Taiwan Strait and incessant rumors of elevating levels of military alert , within five days Taiwan 's stock market shed more than a thousand points . On July 16 alone it plummeted 506 points , with total market value shrinking by more than NT $ 1.5 trillion . To prop up the market , the Ministry of Finance forced four major government-related funds-the postal savings fund , labor pension fund , labor insurance fund and civil service pension fund-to buy stock .  
People in their prime years ( 30s and 40s ) have always been considered the elite of the employment structure , positioned as they are between inexperienced workers and aging seniors . But in recent years , there have been dramatic structural changes in the employment market . Unemployment and forced career changes have become increasingly common among workers in their prime .  
Donations have come pouring in by the truckload-instant noodles , mineral water , crackers , sleeping bags , blankets-and medical personnel have also swarmed to the area , but a lack of coordination has resulted in an excess of personnel and materiel in some areas and a complete lack in others . When well-equipped international rescue operations arrived at the disaster area , the lack of information forced many of them to set out on their own in search of victims . In some cases , five or six different rescue groups converged on a single site .  
In 1991 , the older generation of KMT politicians that filled the seats of the legislative branch of the central government-who had been in place since 1947-were forced to retire . Finally , the people of Taiwan , who in the past could only vote for local officials and a very small number of so-called " supplementary seats " to the national parliament , could elect their own legislators .  
We discovered that China in the Year 1 was in the Han dynasty , which established the foundations of Chinese systems in many areas . It was an era also of dynastic struggles , filled with heroes and striking personalities . At the Year 1000 , the Song dynasty had reunified China . Its weakness forced it into a form of " economic diplomacy " to fend off the peoples of the north , yet at the same time this demilitarization of external relations led to splendorous achievements in culture and wealth for society as a whole .  
Whether they are forced to travel to this distant country by a life of poverty at home , or they have come to roam remote lands , hearts brimming with ambition for the future , all foreign laborers that come to work in Taiwan dream of returning with a purse filled up with gold .  
Fortunately , there are a few things we can be confident about : Though today 's constitutional environment is confused and rapidly changing , no one will be assassinated , the parliament will not be forced to dissolve , there will be no division of the national territory , and there will be no bloody wars .  
Attempts were made to eradicate the influence of organized crime in politics during Lee Teng-hui 's presidency , but the party also needed votes and had to nurture local factions . As Wang points out : " Several ministers of finance were forced out of office for raising taxes . No wonder the public tends to regard the KMT as ' rich but uncouth , ' and as having allowed ' black and gold to rule in tandem . ' "  
As Taiwan 's industrial structure undergoes transformation , we see the traditional manufacturing firms migrating offshore in search of cheap labor , materials , and land .

They can be used as a basis for designing programmes to improve the situation of children , particularly those belonging to the most disadvantaged groups , including disabled children , children born out of wedlock , children ill-treated and abused within the family , in institutions , or deprived of liberty , children who are victims of sexual exploitation , children belonging to minority groups , especially Roma , and children who , in order to survive , are forced to live and / or work in the streets .  
Gravely concerned at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , killings of civilians , torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , deaths in custody , absence of due process of law , severe restrictions on freedoms of opinion , expression , assembly and association , violations of freedom of movement , forced relocation , forced labour and portering and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Also strongly urges the Government of Myanmar to ensure full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , including freedom of expression and assembly , the right to fair trial and the protection of the rights of persons belonging to ethnic and religious minorities , and to put an end to violations of the right to life and integrity of the human being , to the practices of torture , abuse of women , forced labour and forced relocations and to enforced disappearances and summary executions ;  
While maintaining a war mentality in the vain hope of crushing the rebels in the field ( and thereby nullifying any attempt to begin the negotiations which Major Buyoya has himself advocated ) the Burundi de facto authorities are systematically resettling rural populations using an outdated strategy of forced villagization , whose weaknesses and the suffering entailed for the populations concerned have been demonstrated in other conflicts , particularly in Viet Nam . 
Recalling also and concurring with the conclusions of and recommendations made by recent international conferences on the human rights of women and girl children , in particular with respect to the violation of those rights through sexual and economic exploitation for the profit of recruiters , traffickers and crime syndicates , as well as other illegal activities related to trafficking , such as forced domestic labour , false marriages , child marriages , clandestine employment and false adoption ,  
Also condemns all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , recognizes them to be violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and calls for a particularly effective response to violations of this kind , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ;  
Also condemns all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , recognizes them to be violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and calls for a particularly effective response to violations of this kind , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ;  
Expresses its deep concern at continued serious human rights violations by the Government of the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , slavery and slavery _ like practices , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly , and emphasizes that it is essential to put an end to violations of human rights in the Sudan ;  
Urges the Government of the Sudan to investigate reported policies or activities which support , condone , encourage or foster the sale of or trafficking in children , separate children from their families and social backgrounds , forcibly round up children from the streets , or which subject children to forced internment , indoctrination or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , and to terminate immediately any such policies or activities and bring to trial any persons suspected of supporting or participating in them ;  
A week ago today , on 22 May , as we were sitting in this very chamber for a formal plenary meeting , at around 11 a.m . , some 200 persons or more , brandishing banners belonging to the PKK terrorists , broke into the Palais des Nations and forced their way into the first floor of the main building , smashing glass doors at door 4 .  
The Commission on Human Rights , at its fifty-second session , in its decision 1996 / 104 , decided to recommend to the Economic and Social Council , in the light of the conclusions of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) , to be held in Istanbul in June 1996 , to authorize the holding of an expert seminar on the practice of forced evictions with a view to developing comprehensive human rights guidelines on development-based displacement .  
Recognizing the widespread nature of the practice of forced evictions and that when forced evictions are carried out they can occur in a variety of contexts including but not limited to conflicts over land rights , development and infrastructure projects , such as the construction of dams or other large _ scale energy projects , land acquisition measures associated with urban renewal , housing renovation , city beautification programmes , the clearing of land for agricultural purposes or macro-urban projects , unbridled speculation in land , and the holding of major international events such as the Olympic Games ,  
Having due regard to all relevant definitions of the practice of forced evictions under international human rights provisions and instruments , the present Guidelines apply to instances of forced evictions in which there are acts and / or omissions involving the coerced and involuntary removal of individuals , groups and communities from their homes and / or lands and common property resources they occupy or are dependent upon , thus eliminating or limiting the possibility of an individual , group or community residing or working in a particular dwelling , residence or place .  
While there are many similarities between the practice of forced evictions and internal displacement , population transfer , mass expulsions , mass exodus , ethnic cleansing and other practices involving the coerced and involuntary movement of people from their homes , lands and communities , forced evictions constitute a distinct practice under international law .  
If , as a last resort , States consider themselves compelled to undertake proceedings of expropriation or compulsory acquisition , such action shall be : ( a ) determined and envisaged by law and norms regarding forced eviction , insofar as these are consistent with internationally recognized human rights ; ( b ) solely for the purpose of protecting the general welfare in a democratic society ; ( c ) reasonable and proportional ; and ( d ) in accordance with the present Guidelines .  
A reign of terror has been let loose , characterized by extrajudicial executions , indiscriminate killings , random and mass arrests for political reasons , forced relocation of the population , gang rapes of women and systematic efforts to obliterate the ethnic , social and cultural identity of the Kashmiri people .  
Affirming that all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy , are flagrant violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ,  
The endemic housing shortage , declining standard of living and lack of sufficient Palestinian educational institutions within the City limits delineated by Israel have forced numerous parents to send their children to schools that are officially outside Jerusalem and may be less expensive than the ones located in the City .  
Thus , while the Government of the Republic of Angola regrets once again the fact that , in spite of the numerous General Assembly resolutions , among others , not one positive measure has been taken to lift the embargo , it urges the international community to cooperate with the United Nations in order to put an end , as soon as possible , to that blockade , whose main victims are thousands of human beings who are forced to make extraordinary sacrifices and see their social and economic development hindered .  
One of the main tasks of the conference could be to draw up , in cooperation with other interested international organizations , a United Nations strategy for the regulation of migratory flows and the prevention of mass forced population displacement at the global level .  
Deplores the immense human suffering and loss of life that have accompanied refugee flows and other forced displacements , in particular numerous serious threats to the security or well-being of refugees , refoulement , unlawful expulsion , physical attacks and detention under unacceptable conditions , and calls upon States to take all measures necessary to ensure respect for the principles of refugee protection , including the humane treatment of asylum-seekers in accordance with internationally recognized human rights and humanitarian norms ;  
Noting with deep concern the human rights violations and breaches of international humanitarian law outlined in Commission on Human Rights resolution 1997 / 59 , including the aerial bombardment of civilians , slavery , slave trade , extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly ,  
Expresses deep concern at the serious , widespread and continuing human rights violations in the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings and summary executions ; detentions without due process ; violations of the rights of women and children ; forced displacement of persons , enforced or involuntary disappearances ; torture and other forms of cruel and unusual punishment ; slavery , practices similar to slavery and forced labour ; denial of the freedoms of expressions , association and peaceful assembly ; and discrimination based on religion ;  
Deplores the immense human suffering and loss of life that have accompanied refugee flows and other forced displacements , in particular the numerous serious threats to the security or well-being of refugees , such as refoulement , unlawful expulsion , physical attacks and detention under unacceptable conditions , and calls upon States to take all measures necessary to ensure respect for the principles of refugee protection , including the humane treatment of asylum-seekers in accordance with internationally recognized human rights and humanitarian norms ;  
In 1885 , when Africa was being colonized , my country was set up as a State that was the personal property of the King of the Belgians ; it endured violence and blatant violations of human rights connected inter alia with the exploitation of red rubber and other kinds of forced labour . 
Two points should be made clear : ( a ) at a time when the Human Rights Operation in Rwanda was advising staff not to travel on Cameroon Airlines aircraft and to be careful in their choice of airlines , the Special Rapporteur was forced to travel by Cameroon Airlines ; this is particularly regrettable in that experts and special rapporteurs have no insurance coverage ; ( b ) the Special Rapporteur 's budget of $ 69,770 for the current financial year had not yet been touched , although the year was drawing to a close . 
The Committee commented on the discriminatory application of the laws against prostitution which are enforced against sex workers and not the men involved as traffickers , pimps and clients , and noted further that forced medical examinations of the women without similar attention to the male clients is not effective as a public health measure .  
In order to cut the main links between the insurgent groups and the civilian population , SLORC has forced entire communities living in the border area between Myanmar and Thailand to move to relocation sites which are subject to tight military control .  
Numerous testimonies received by the Special Rapporteur indicate that the civilian population living in or near the combat zone is the most susceptible to being forced to move : in these grey zones ( zones controlled or influenced by the insurgents ) the armed forces often resort to ground searches , destruction and burning of houses , and confiscation of property and food , which lead the people to move temporarily or permanently .  
While it could have opted for forced repatriation , Pakistan had continued to provide for the needs of Afghan refugees with its own resources , despite the enormous administrative , economic and social repercussions their presence in the country and their participation in the economic activities had caused , and the sometimes permanent environmental damage resulting from their concentration in the northern regions of the country . 
Expresses its deep concern at continued serious human rights violations by the Government of the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , slavery and slavery _ like practices , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly , and emphasizes that it is essential to put an end to violations of human rights in the Sudan ;  
Urges the Government of the Sudan to investigate reported policies or activities which support , condone , encourage or foster the sale of or trafficking in children , separate children from their families and social backgrounds , forcibly round up children from the streets , or which subject children to forced internment , indoctrination or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , and to terminate immediately any such policies or activities and bring to trial any persons suspected of supporting or participating in them ;  
It was the Greek Cypriot armed onslaught in December 1963 against the Turkish Cypriot people and the bi-communal order that led to division on the island when the Turkish Cypriot people were forced to live in enclaves , deprived of all basic necessities and fundamental human rights , for 11 years prior to the legitimate Turkish intervention of 1974 .  
The adoption of this theme highlighted the emphasis given by the international community to voluntary repatriation as a durable solution and asserted that a natural extension of this emphasis is the increased importance attached to the prevention of forced displacement .  
The Committee commented on the discriminatory application of laws enforced against women prostitutes and not the men involved as traffickers , pimps and clients , and noted further that forced medical examinations of the women without similar attention to the male clients was not effective as a public health measure .  
To the contrary , if shortsighted strategies and options are forced upon us , it can mean an ever-deteriorating situation combining the consequences of war , pollution and unconscionable industrial exploitation : the conspiracy of landmines and industrial waste overwhelming the land , the people , the fragile peace and our common Earth .  
Recommends that Governments cooperate with trade unions and employers ' organizations at the national level to address the problem of bonded labour and that trade unions and employers ' organizations at the local , national and international levels utilize the existing structures of the International Labour Organization dealing with violations of the relevant conventions concerning forced labour , and encourages concerned non _ governmental organizations to strengthen their activities for disseminating information and advising trade unions in this regard ;  
Noting that foreign migrant workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine human dignity , including being forced to live separately from their spouses and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and that they are often victims of violence , racism and xenophobia ,  
Affirming that all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy , are flagrant violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ,  
Recommends that Governments cooperate with trade unions and employers ' organizations at the national level to address the problem of bonded labour and that trade unions and employers ' organizations at the local , national and international levels utilize the existing structures of the International Labour Organization dealing with violations of the relevant conventions concerning forced labour , and encourages concerned non _ governmental organizations to strengthen their activities for disseminating information and advising trade unions in this regard ;  
Thus , four Governments considered that a conference could suggest ways of reducing or preventing forced or involuntary migration ; one Government was interested in reducing illegal migration , while another hoped that a conference might lead to the regularization of the status of illegal migrants ; and a further four Governments expected that a conference might contribute towards improving the management of migration so that it could be reduced , stabilized or even eliminated . 
The stories are heartbreaking doctors and nurses forced to live in the lobby of a closed hospital ; middle-class families who owned their own homes , sent their children to college , travelled abroad , now living by selling their possessions .  
This percentage is calculated by taking the average percentage of all percentages of claims determined to have met the C1-MPA forced hiding criteria , weighted by the relative size of the populations included .  
From 1963 , the Turkish Cypriots have been forced to live in scattered enclaves across the island under deplorable conditions , faced with harsh economic restrictions and besieged by hostile Greek Cypriot armed elements .  
Owing to the hard economic pressures created by the comprehensive embargo imposed on Iraq , large numbers of Iraqi women were forced to abandon working life by resigning or retiring from jobs because of fast increasing living costs and inadequate salaries .  
Destruction of houses , arbitrary indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians and forced relocation of people to unknown sites culminating in what is known as ethnic and tribal cleansing are all deployed as techniques for a show of military might .  
The current financial crisis , caused by massive inflows of private capital and their sudden reversal , had , however , forced the Committee to view the implications of private capital flows into developing countries from a completely different perspective .  
The cruel irony is that the very victims of development are the ones who are being forced to tighten their belt and eat less in order to pay for the extravagant mistakes of powerful local elites and their external supporters .  25 .  The heavy borrowing of the 1970s alone did not precipitate the debt crisis .  
Noting with grave concern the content of the report of the Commission of Inquiry of the International Labour Organization , [ 5 ] appointed in March 1997 in accordance with article 26 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organization , regarding the observance by Myanmar of the Forced Labour Convention , 1930 ( No .  29 ) , which indicates a widespread and systematic use of forced labour imposed by the military on the civilian population ,  
Deplores the continuing violations of human rights in Myanmar , including extrajudicial and arbitrary executions , rape , torture , inhuman treatment , mass arrests , forced labour , forced relocation and denial of freedom of expression , assembly , association and movement , as reported by the Special Rapporteur ;  
Gravely concerned about the systematic terrorization of ethnic Albanians , as demonstrated in the many reports , inter alia , of torture of ethnic Albanians , through indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanian citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) by the police and military ,  
The intensification of armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the increasingly ethnic and religious nature of the conflict , which have resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement , and which hinder the return of the internally displaced to their homes ;  
With regard to conduct forbidden by international humanitarian law , there were numerous cases of murders of protected persons , torture , taking of hostages , attacks on the civilian population and forced displacements , which followed a systematic pattern .  
As for the acts committed ( factor a above ) , the historical and evidentiary record suggests cases of murder ( rising to the level of extermination of political opposition ) , forced labour , torture and other inhumane acts .  
The declining trend in official development assistance ( ODA ) and the increasingly frequent imposition of conditions of an economic and financial or a political , legal or humanitarian nature had forced many developing countries to resort to private capital flows , which had been concentrated in a small number of countries and had proved unstable and crisis-prone .  
While promoting the uses of voluntary initiatives and agreements as positive instruments for sustainable development , trade unions will also promote the defining of minimum social , environmental and economic indicators that voluntary initiatives or agreements must never conflict with or undermine ( for example , minimum social indicators would include International Labour Organization ( ILO ) core labour standards , child and forced labour provisions , and employment equality requirements ) .  
Demands an immediate halt to all repressive actions undertaken in Kosovo by the Serbian authorities which has led to further ethnic cleansing in the region , the genocide of Kosovars , their forced mass exodus and the destruction of their property with the aim of preventing their return , and also demands the immediate withdrawal of the Serbian military and paramilitary forces from Kosovo ;  
Condemning also the massive military operations launched by the Serbian authorities against the unarmed civilians in Kosovo , resulting in large _ scale killings , systematic and planned massacres , destruction of homes and property , and forced mass exoduses to neighbouring countries , as well as internal displacement ,  
Yet the rapidly increasing indigenous labour force in the GCC countries , which is growing by an average annual rate of 5 per cent , with a combined population growth rate estimated at 3.3 per cent annually , have forced the countries to seek appropriate policies to create adequate employment opportunities for their nationals .  
The continuing violations of the rights of children , in particular through the lack of conformity of the existing legal framework with the Convention on the Rights of the Child , through conscription of children into forced labour programmes , through their military and sexual exploitation and through discrimination against children belonging to ethnic and religious minority groups ;  
To translate into concrete action their commitment to the progressive and effective elimination of child labour contrary to accepted international standards , and urges them , as a matter of priority , to eliminate the worst forms of child labour , such as forced labour , bonded labour and other forms of slavery ;  
There is a renewed global interest in issues relating to exclusion from refugee status , not least because internal conflicts are being conducted in flagrant disregard of international human rights and humanitarian law , and because both persecutors and their victims are often forced by events to seek refuge together .  
Condemning also the massive military operations launched by the Serbian authorities against the unarmed civilians in Kosovo , resulting in large _ scale killings , systematic and planned massacres , destruction of homes and property , and forced mass exoduses to neighbouring countries , as well as internal displacement ,  
The persisting armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering , forced displacement , including on the grounds of ethnicity , and which hinder the return of the internally displaced to their homes ;  
To cease immediately its continued repressive practices , including the practice of forced deportation and relocation , against the Iraqi Kurds , Assyrians and Turkmen , and against the population of the southern marsh areas , where drainage projects have provoked environmental destruction and a deterioration of the situation of the civilian population , and to ensure the personal integrity and freedoms , including the full freedom of belief , of the Shia and their religious establishment ;  
The continuing violations of the rights of children , in particular through the lack of conformity of the existing legal framework with the Convention on the Rights of the Child , through conscription of children into forced labour programmes , through their military and sexual exploitation and through discrimination against children belonging to ethnic and religious minority groups ;  
To translate into concrete action their commitment to the progressive and effective elimination of child labour contrary to accepted international standards , and urges them , as a matter of priority , to eliminate the worst forms of child labour , such as forced labour , bonded labour and other forms of slavery ;  
Following current practice in cases of loss or damage resulting from a single hostile action or forced abandonment , the United Nations will assume liability for each and every item of major equipment when the collective generic fair market value equals or exceeds the threshold value of $ 250,000 .  
In paragraph 10 of its report ( A / 52 / 410 ) , the Advisory Committee stated that it had been informed that annex B , section 6 , Loss or damage , paragraph 18 , of the contribution agreement would read as follows : In cases of loss or damage resulting from a single hostile action or forced abandonment , the United Nations will assume liability for each and every item of major equipment when the collective generic fair market value equals or exceeds the threshold value of $ 250,000 .  
The crisis in Kosovo has resulted in the mass forced displacement and deportation of hundreds of thousands of civilians , wholesale destruction of property and means of livelihood , wanton lawlessness and violence , thousands of documented killings , countless as-yet undocumented deaths , and immeasurable human suffering .  
Refugees who have arrived in neighbouring countries have given consistent accounts of civilians being subjected to systematic and extreme human rights violations by security forces , of executions , of forced eviction from their homes , deportations , arbitrary detention , acts of sexual violence and burning of homes .  
In response to reports of summary executions of non-combatants , including women and children , in their homes , arbitrary detentions , forced displacement , use of forced labour and burning of homes and property in the central highlands of Hazarajat , the Special Rapporteur visited Quetta , Pakistan , on 22 May where he met refugees who provided credible eye-witness accounts of gross violations of human rights during March , April and May 1999 . 
We reiterate our call on all States to translate into concrete action their commitment to the progressive and effective elimination of child labour contrary to accepted international standards , and urge them , as a matter of priority , to eliminate the worst forms of child labour , such as forced labour , bonded labour and other forms of slavery .  
Despite an increasing awareness of the problem , however , many refugees were once again exposed to cross-border attacks , forced recruitment into armed fighting forces and confinement in remote , isolated and perilously located camps .  
Owing to the uncontrolled crossing-over of armed groups of Albanian terrorists and bandits , systematically abusing , intimidating , abducting and killing non-Albanian populations and looting , stealing and destroying their property , as well as making forced entries into people 's homes , burning churches and places of worship , there followed a massive exodus of Serbs and Montenegrins from Kosovo and Metohija .  
Noting that migrant workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine their human dignity , including being forced to live separately from their spouses and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and that they are often victims of violence , racism and xenophobia ,  
UNICEF has actively publicized its view that it is unacceptable that a clear ban on childrens recruitment has not yet been imposed on the direct and indirect participation in hostilities of children below 18 years of age , regardless of whether they have been forced to join armed forces , or whether they appear to have done so voluntarily ; this applies equally to governmental and non-governmental forces .  
According to the indictment , many of the detainees under the accused 's control were subjected to inhumane treatment , including excessive and cruel interrogation , physical and psychological harm , forced labour in hazardous conditions and being used as " human shields " , and some of the detainees were murdered or otherwise killed .  
The seminar produced guidelines that recognize that forced evictions constitute prima facie violations of a wide range of internationally recognized human rights and can only be carried out under exceptional circumstances and in full accordance with relevant provisions of international human rights law .  
Most important and this is to be welcomed it has recognized in its resolutions adopted in recent years that repression of the civilian population , ethnic cleansing , genocide , large-scale forced displacement and relocation of civilians and other flagrant violations of international humanitarian law constitute a threat to international peace and security .  
The Taliban 's conduct of forced displacement of the civilian population during their recent offensive in the Shomali plains is a particularly alarming signal which reflects the movement 's apparent disregard for the concerns expressed by the international community .  
I would like to emphasize that it was the Greek Cypriot armed onslaught in December 1963 against the Turkish Cypriots and the binational order that led to the division of the island when the Turkish Cypriots were forced to live in enclaves , deprived of all basic necessities and fundamental human rights , for 11 years prior to the legal Turkish intervention of 1974 .  
An organized group of heavily armed individuals , claiming to represent local residents , broke into the offices of the Izabal Banana Workers Union , threatened union leaders that they must give up the Union and their jobs at BANDEGUA , forced them to call off the union mobilization planned for the next day and compelled them , on pain of death , to leave the area with their families .  
Condemns the widespread violations and abuses of human rights and humanitarian law , including the rights to life , liberty and security of person , freedom from torture and from other forms of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , freedom of opinion , expression , religion , association and movement , the forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflict and , in particular , the grave human rights violations against women and girls ;  
The intensification of armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including its ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement , including on the ground of ethnicity ;  
In the framework of the ongoing internal armed conflict , serious , gross and systematic human rights violations and large-scale breaches of international humanitarian law have forced a growing number of individuals and entire communities to leave their homes .  
Considering that serious , gross and systematic human rights violations and breaches of international humanitarian law are the foremost direct cause of forced displacement in Colombia , the workshop urged the Government of Colombia to comply with the Guiding Principles and with the international recommendations already made to address the situation , in particular by the United Nations and the OAS Inter-American Commission on Human Rights .  
Warfare in the central highlands in April and May involved vicious attacks against civilians , including the summary execution of women and children , forced and involuntary displacement , the looting and burning of homes , arbitrary detention and the use of forced labour . 
Despite repeated appeals from United Nations bodies , bombing of the civilian population , enforced displacement both within and outside the country , summary and extrajudicial execution , violation of the right to life and the right to physical safety of prisoners of war , attacks on the civilian population , abduction and subjection to forced labour of women and children and obstruction of humanitarian assistance continued unabated .  
The military incursions in northern Iraq violated its sovereignty and territorial integrity and had forced a withdrawal of the central administration from those areas , turning them into a breeding ground for factional infighting and bloody conflict .  
Any consideration of the Iraq sanctions regime should not be artificially forced or hurried if we are to achieve the twin goals of alleviating the grave humanitarian situation in Iraq and ensuring Iraqi compliance with the requirements in respect of its alleged remaining weapons of mass destruction .  
Condemns the widespread violations and abuses of human rights and humanitarian law , including the rights to life , liberty and security of person , freedom from torture and from other forms of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , freedom of opinion , expression , religion , association and movement , the forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflict and , in particular , the grave human rights violations against women and girls ;  
The intensification of armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including its ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement , including on the grounds of ethnicity ;  
Deplores the continuing violations of human rights in Myanmar , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , enforced disappearances , rape , torture , inhuman treatment , mass arrests , forced labour , including the use of children , forced relocation , and denial of freedom of assembly , association , expression and movement , as reported by the Special Rapporteur ;  
Condemning the grave violations of human rights in Kosovo that affected ethnic Albanians prior to the arrival of personnel of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo and troops of the international security presence , the Kosovo Force , as demonstrated in the many reports of torture , indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by the Yugoslav police and military ,  
There is a renewed global interest in issues relating to exclusion from refugee status , not least because internal conflicts are being conducted in flagrant disregard of international human rights and humanitarian law , and because both persecutors and their victims are often forced by events to seek refuge together .  
The Secretary-General raised the pertinent question of humanitarian intervention in the wake of the inaction of the Organization with regard to the genocidal war in Rwanda and its horrific consequences , and the forced intervention in Kosovo , which saved thousands of lives and reversed the heinous policy of ethnic cleansing there , but which was carried out outside the ambit of the Security Council . 
The Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts will certainly be of great practical importance , ensuring the speedy rescue of astronauts in case of breakdowns , accidents or forced landings , for , as scientific and technological advance continues , manned space flights will become longer and more complex every year . . . .  
The Working Group was concerned at the continuing abusive treatment of women , including custodial deaths , torture , rape , abduction , disappearances , arbitrary arrests , forced abortions and sterilizations , harassment and arson by security forces , including military and police forces , or by other governmental authorities , particularly where separatist movements were reported .  
The urban poor , especially women and children , are forced to live in makeshift shelters in appalling and degrading conditions presenting hazards for both physical and mental health .  
The period marked increased collaboration between ICMC and several Council agencies , particularly those that extended funding for its actions in favour of persons uprooted or forced into flight because of war and conflict , racial or ethnic persecution , human rights violations , and environmental degradation.The ICMC programmes supported by Council agencies included : 
Among the methods of torture that were employed were rape of the detainee , electric shock treatment to ears , nose , breasts and the vagina , submerging in water tanks , burning with cigarette butts , detention in a room full of water and sewage , severe beating , being stripped and paraded naked , being tied by the thumbs from the ceiling , forced intercourse with other detainees , and other means of torture .  
Numerous testimonies received by the Special Rapporteur indicate that the civilian population living in or near the combat zone is generally forced to move : in these " grey zones " ( zones controlled or influenced by the insurgents ) the armed forces often resort to searches , destruction and burning of houses , and confiscation of property and food to force the people to move , temporarily or permanently .  
The introduction to the Principles contains a refinement of previous working definitions : internally displaced persons are persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence , in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict , situations of generalized violence , violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters , and who have not crossed an internationally recognized State border .  
The persisting armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering , forced displacement , including on the grounds of ethnicity , and which hinder the return of the internally displaced to their homes ;  
To cease immediately its continued repressive practices , including the practice of forced deportation and relocation , against the Iraqi Kurds , Assyrians and Turkmen , and against the population of the southern marsh areas , where drainage projects have provoked environmental destruction and a deterioration of the situation of the civilian population , and to ensure the personal integrity and freedoms , including the full freedom of belief , of the Shia and their religious establishment ;  
Deplores the continuing violations of human rights in Myanmar , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , enforced disappearances , rape , torture , inhuman treatment , mass arrests , forced labour , including the use of children , forced relocation , and denial of freedom of assembly , association , expression and movement , as reported by the Special Rapporteur ;  
Condemning the grave violations of human rights in Kosovo , affecting ethnic Albanians prior to the arrival of United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo personnel and troops of the international security presence , the Kosovo Force , as demonstrated in the many reports of torture , indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by the Yugoslav police and military ,  
This concern was also raised by the Government of South Africa who reported that the extensive and highly exploitative system of domestic workers provides hidden opportunities for sex services , either forced or paid .  
The human rights violations reported to him by credible eyewitnesses had included forced displacement of the civilian population , deliberate burning of houses , summary execution of noncombatants , arbitrary detention and forced labour .  
Striving to meet basic needs but unable to increase their productivity , poor rural households in most lowincome countries have been forced to expand onto marginal lands and / or mine their existing land base through unsustainable landmanagement practices .  
On the civil service level , it is often motivated by salaries so low and so infrequently paid that public servants are forced to choose between service to their country and meeting their families basic needs .  
The consequences of such failures are only too obvious : too many belligerent groups targeting the innocent and the defenceless ; massive numbers of refugees forced to flee for safety ; gross and systematic violations of human rights perpetrated .  
The panel agreed that on the institutionalization of crimes , local guilty parties would be held accountable by the people but the double crime is when people are robbed once by corrupt officials and then again when they are forced to repay the debts . 
Mr . Bazel ( Afghanistan ) : Over the years , we have heard of Taliban barbarism against living beings , such as acts of summary execution ; ethnic cleansing ; gender apartheid ; the forced deportation of hundreds of thousands of innocent people ; the separation of women from their menfolk ; the torching and levelling of houses ; and the destruction of irrigation systems , canals , orchards and means of subsistence , systematically carried out by the Pakistan-Taliban-bin Laden triangle in the occupied parts of Afghanistan .  
Concerning Myanmars cooperation with the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) , it had in October received an ILO technical cooperation mission and , with its advice , it had adopted the necessary administrative , executive and legislative measures to ensure that there could be no instances of forced labour in the country .
