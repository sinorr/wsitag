" All industrial nations should implement sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms that are necessary to sustain robust domestic demands and hence , create multiple engines to promote economic growth , " he said . 
The report said the three northern European countries are most outstanding in the areas of " industrial network readiness " and " measures of sustainable development , " while the United States is ranked first in " improving the environment for innovation and R &amp; amp ; D , " an area most representative of economic growth and competitiveness , and in " creating an enterprise environment that is more conducive for private sector economy . "  
As an important industrial city in northern China and a foreign trade port with vast inland , Tianjin 's light industry products , food products and livestock products exported to Russia last year accounted for 50% of the amount of export from Tianjin to Russia ; whereas steel and non-ferrous metals imported from Russia accounted for 60% of import volume from Russia .  
It is estimated that industries of the entire province at the township level and above will have accumulated completed sales values of 23-billion yuan , increasing by 16% over last year .  The overall benefit of the industrial economy has bounced back , and the industrial enterprises with independent business accounts have increased profits .  
Having gone through the deficit phase incurred by the whole industry in the last half year , China 's chemical industry completed an annual gross industrial output value of 278-billion yuan , with a growth rate of 8% , and continuing to maintain steady growth .  
At present , nearly 70 large projects , with 10-million US dollars being invested in each , have already spread out in a belt standing tall with more than 100 square kilometers along the 20 kilometer Gold Coast of Ningbo 's Beilun district , forming a recently emerging large industrial economic belt with leading industries such as petrochemical , iron and steel and developing subsidiary industries such as electric power , machinery , electronics , light industry and textile , building materials , plastic cement , etc .  
The analysis of the State Statistical Bureau shows , last year , there were still certain problems during the industrial economy operation , for instance , capital defaults increased , deficits were still serious , fundamental products such as energy resources , raw materials , etc . grew at low rates , the transfer of industrial structure was considerably slow , and all these are restraining factors assailing the further healthy development of an industrial economy .  
This year , the spirit of National Economy Work Conference should be carried through and implemented , while deepening State-owned enterprise reform and continuing to reinforce restructuring , striving to increase effective demands , improving supply quality , promoting the healthy and steady development of an industrial economy .  
In the past 5 years , Xiamen has actually utilized 6.3-billion US dollars in foreign funds , and foreign trade exports have continuously ranked fourth among China 's cities , and nearly 50% of local industrial products are sold overseas .  The actual realization rate of foreign merchant investments ranks first in the nation .  
The areas in which Liaoning utilizes foreign investment have been expanded from medium and small-sized processing projects to the four pillar industries for old industrial base transformation purposes : the petrochemical industry , the metallurgical industry , the mechanical industry , the electronic industry , etc . and such industries as agriculture , real estate , infrastructure , energy , finance , etc .  
Shanxi province is located at the intersection of the Mid-west and the East , and is also an important national production base for coal and electricity commodities , is abounding in resources , with low labor costs and land prices , and possessing an industrial foundation abundant in economy and technology and a broad market .  
Gross domestic output values reached 73-billion yuan in 1995 , increasing by 4 times compared with 1978 , before the reform and opening up .  The average living expenses and income of city and township residents reached 4053 yuan , and the average pure income of peasants reached 1554 yuan .  The total industrial and agricultural output value was 144-billion yuan , among which the former was 120.1-billion yuan .  Third industry output values reached 24.7-billion yuan , accounting for 33% of the gross domestic output value .  
Additionally , the Weihai economic and technological development zone also cooperates with relevant regions in Korea , and has established so far Shandong 's largest exclusive Korean investment industrial park - the Qingnan syndicate .  At present , the Qingnan syndicate has approved 12 entering projects , with a total project investment of 73.1-million US dollars and has preliminarily formed three large industries , taking automobile and automobile parts and components processing as the focus .  
According to data provided by the Guangzhou Statistics Office , last year , Guangzhou completed a gross domestic product of 144.584-billion yuan ; completed industrial added values of 57.348-billion yuan ; agricultural added values of 8.075-billion yuan ; fixed asset investments of 65.545-billion yuan ; total social consumable retail amounts of 64.432-billion yuan ; foreign trade export values of 6.513-billion US dollars ; actual utilized foreign investments of 2.6-billion US dollars ; and a retail goods price index increase of 4.3% .  
According to information from the Provincial External Economy and Trade Committee , in 1996 , Shandong 's foreign-capital corporations ' exports achieved 5.49-billion US dollars , occupying 51% of total provincial export values ; the entire province 's actual utilized foreign capital occupies 14.7% of the whole society 's fixed asset investment ; foreign merchant investment corporation employees have reached 1.15-million people , occupying 10.9% of total industrial employees in the entire province .  
In the recently convened working meeting of Tianjin 's economic co-operation with Taiwan , Lichang Zhang , mayor of Tianjin , said that Tianjin and Taiwan are similar in industrial structure , close in technology , and mutually have very strong complements .  The future of bilateral co-operation is very wide open and has bright prospects .  
According to what was revealed in the meeting , as far as investment direction is concerned , Tianjin encourages Taiwanese investors to invest in infrastructure , base industries , funded technology concentrated industries , and high-technology projects , and to participate in the technological reform of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises , to invest in third industry experimental projects .  Taiwanese financial capital and industrial capital institutions are welcome to come to Tianjin to build up financial organizations .  
However , China is still much engaged in her own domestic development , and has limited national strength .  For this reason we are selecting those key areas or key links that have favorable prospects , where the degree of industrial linkage will be significant , and which can drive the entire mechanism for critical breakthroughs , and through these we will vigorously strive to realize a leap in high-tech development .  
Article 41 Those that violate article 13 of these regulations should be given a warning by industrial and commercial administration organs and other organs of administrative law enforcement .  Their illicit gains and illegal properties should be confiscated , and a fine equivalent to between one and three times the illicit gains should be imposed .  
Article 44 Those that violate articles 25 , 26 , and article 27 , clause 1 , items 2 and 4 should be given a warning by the industrial and commercial administration organs and other relevant administrative law enforcement organs .  Their illicit gains and illegal properties should be confiscated , and a fine equivalent to between one and three times the illicit gains should be imposed .  
impel the establishment of a modern enterprise system ; create a mechanism for equal competition ; achieve rational resource allocation ; promote the restructuring and industrial upgrading of all sectors ; and improve the international competitiveness of the industries and service trades concerned .  At the same time , we must do a good job in handling the relationship between observing international rules and carrying out our international obligations on the one hand and ensuring national security and upholding economic stability on the other .  
Insufficient domestic funds have been made up by utilizing foreign capital ; this has increased the state tax revenue and foreign exchange earnings , promoted economic restructuring and the optimization of the industrial structure , accelerated the blending of China 's economy with the world economy , and created a large number of job opportunities .  Products turned out by foreign-funded enterprises have greatly enriched the material lives of our people .  
The utilization of foreign capital has made up the deficiency of funds needed for construction projects at home .  It has increased the state 's revenues and gains on foreign exchange , promoted the adjustment of economic structure , optimized industrial structure , accelerated integration of China 's economy with the world 's economy , and created a large amount of employment opportunities.In addition , products manufactured by foreign-funded enterprises have greatly enriched people 's material life .  
The circular states : Personnel departments at all levels should provide preferential policies to meet the personnel needs of state-owned large and medium-sized key enterprises that conform to the state industrial policy , the units that undertake the state 's key construction and scientific research projects for the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , the agriculture , water conservancy , energy , transportation , and telecommunications units that the state strengthens on a priority basis , the units of the pillar industries , and the national defense and military units .  
Oversupply refers to the excess industrial output capacity and product mix formed by years of blind investment and duplicate construction , as well as a staged surplus of farm products due to successive bumper harvests .  
The Central Economic Work Conference held in November 1999 proposed a series of policy steps to promote economic development such as continuing to pursue an active fiscal policy and bringing into better play the role of monetary policy , making decisions such as expanding domestic demand , sharply adjusting the economic structure , and promoting industrial optimization and upgrading .  
In combination with economic restructuring , knocking out backward production capacity , and upgrading industry , last year the industrial front focused on reducing surplus production capacity in sectors such as textiles , coal , petrochemicals , and the metallurgical industry ; and the banks refused to lend money for products with high production costs , low standards , and lack of sales outlets , thus opening up a market space for superior enterprises and evening out some of the market supply and demand .  
Positive efforts should be made to explore ways of providing financial services in support of the scientific and technological development and their popularization in the western regions , support infrastructure construction in key state-level hi-tech development zones as well as the production and circulation of hi-tech products , accelerate the technical transformation of competitive industrial enterprises in the western regions , and properly provide credit services to scientific research institutions in accordance with regulations .  
the people of the whole country have expressed an ardent wish to build a prosperous nation through science and education and a strong country through knowledge ; the whole country 's industrial and agricultural structures have been undergoing major readjustment ; the enterprises have been engaged in technical innovation ;  
By cooperating with and serving others , Chongqing should solve well the problem of redundant industrial structure that is likely to occur during the course of developing the Western Region . By serving others , it should strengthen itself , attain the goal of " striving to turn Chongqing into an economic center on the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang put forward by General Secretary Jiang Zemin , and join the western provinces and autonomous regions in building a great economic circle of sustainable development in the Western Region .  
In light of Hainan 's actual conditions , we have defined " one province , two localities " as our industrial development strategy and the construction of Hainan to be a symbol of an ecological province as our sustainable development strategy .  We have also defined the strategy of promoting reform and development through opening to the outside world and the strategy of invigorating Hainan on the strength of science and education .  Hainan will make more rapid and steady strides with still firmer confidence .  
Forces will be concentrated on key basic research projects and key projects , such as digital high division television , broadband high-speed information network , industrial automation , civil airplanes , and civil satellites and on developing newly rising industries . 
Drawing a lesson from the bitter experience , Hainan has since then set sights on its good ecological environment and its unique resources and re-established the industrial strategy of building itself as a base of tropical and high-efficiency agriculture and as an island tourist resort .  At the same time , it has developed high-technology , high-value-added , and high-efficiency industry which does not cause pollution , does not require redundant construction , and does not destroy resources .  
The practical industrial structural adjustment has laid a sound industrial foundation for Hainan , enabling the province 's economy to develop rapidly and the economic results to improve ; as a result , the quality of its economic growth has improved notably .  
Deputy Du Qinglin , secretary of the Hainan provincial CPC committee , said : Hainan 's industrial structural adjustment is based on , from a strategic viewpoint and bearing the overall situation in mind , making use of the resources for Hainan 's development , studying the market trend , deciding strategic industries to be developed , and bringing about industrial upgrading by making scientific and technological innovations .  In addition , through structural adjustment and linking the industries , we have effected new economic growth on an industrial base at a higher level .  
While participating in a discussion held by the Beijing NPC Delegation , Deputy Wu Bangguo , member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of the State Council , stressed : It is necessary to use new and high technologies to transform traditional industries and to vigorously develop emerging industries as well as new and high-tech industries so as to advance the readjustment and upgrading of the industrial structure .  
Traditional industries are still the principal bodies in Liaoning , which is an old industrial base , and to a great extent , state-owned industries manifest the model of speed and efficiency .  The state 's efforts to stimulate domestic demand , and gradually put the proactive fiscal policy into place , have produced a certain effect of stimulating the market for Liaoning industries .  
Inner Mongolia deputies Liu Mingzu , Yun Bulong , Lei Eerdeni , Niu Yuru , Chen Pengshan , Ma Dehai , Wang Weishan , Zhu Guangkai and Cha Gan separately expressed their views on the autonomous region 's economic development , large-scale development of China 's Western Region , transformation of old industrial base , exploitation of rare earth elements , grassland construction , reform of state-owned enterprises , establishment of a social security system , economic restructuring , and attaching importance to education in ethnic minority regions .  
We should make active use of new and advanced technologies , as well as advanced applied technologies , to transform a number of traditional industries in the western region , including the industries of industrial chemicals , building materials , machinery , metallurgy , and light and textile products ; and devote great efforts to enhancing the technological level and the innovation ability of existing enterprises there .  
the industrial structure is irrational , the total number of secondary and tertiary industries is not large enough , with low technological content and poor efficiency .  
A rational industrial structure and solid economic strength constitute an important foundation for the existence and development of towns as well as their basic conditions for forming their strong stimulating ability and for bringing along economic and social development in their areas .  
In the course of town construction , attention should be focused on the concentration of industries and population ; through the use of regional and industrial policies , economic levers , and administrative measures , we should guide and promote the concentration of secondary and tertiary industries in towns and accept the stimulating influence of major cities so that towns ' economic and population scales will increase rapidly .  
and eliminate backward production techniques .  Meanwhile , the industrial enterprises in the urban areas should be relocated in an orderly fashion .  With regard to the tertiary industry , we should give priority to developing tourist , financial and insurance , real estate , and cultural industries , as well as network-based information service industries .  
He Guoqiang , secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee , answered : Chongqing is the only municipality in western regions as well as the key industrial and commercial city in the southwest region .  The Chang Jiang golden waterways have linked Chongqing to both eastern and western regions .  Thus , Chongqing should serve as a bridge linking the east with the west and making them promote each other .  
Delegate Zhou Benli said Anhui , although a central region province , should also seize opportunities and accelerate its own development to take part in the grand development of China 's western regions .  Anhui should not only step up infrastructure construction and accelerate the pace of structural readjustment but also effect the spread and transfer of industrial sectors in a selected way , cooperate with western regions to do well in ecological environment protection and construction , implement the strategy of " marching to the east and west , " and energetically develop the market .  
Beginning in the 14th century , Europe saw the Renaissance , broke away from the confines of theocratic power , achieved unprecedented emancipation of the mind , and produced rapid scientific and technological development .  By the 18th century , Europe achieved the industrial revolution , marked by the steam engine , and completed the transition to capitalist industrial society .  
In the fields of electronic information , new materials , biological engineering , integration of light , machines , and electricity [ guang ji dian yi ti hua , 0342-2623-7193-0001-7555-0553 ] , new energy sources , and environmental protection , the high-tech zones are more and more becoming important bases for the development of China 's high-tech industries and have played a active role in promoting industrial restructuring and in leading forward sustained economic development .  
The surging tide of acquisitions and mergers among international enterprises is breeding yet another major industrial transfer .  After accepting the market for labor-intensive industries in the 1970s , developing countries may have to brace themselves again for the full-fledged onslaught of multinational companies .  
Guizhou used to have a relatively weak industrial foundation ; thanks to the construction and readjustment of remote regions away from coastal areas over the past more than 30 years , a military industrial system has been established in Guizhou , with the three major bases of aviation , space flight , and electronics as its main body .  Today , these three major bases have become an important force in Guizhou 's economic development .  
Third , we should bring into full play the roles of the existing assets stock of the military industry in the western region , vigorously push forward the readjustment and the strategic restructuring of both the industrial structure and capability of the western region , take the initiative to incorporate the military industry into the economy of the western region , and step up the work of extricating enterprises from their difficulties as well as the establishment of a modern enterprise system .  
It is true that in comparison with the coastal areas in the country 's eastern region , the western region has a relatively lower industrialization level and an irrational industrial structure on the whole , and its gap with the eastern region has been further widened ever since the beginning of reform and opening up ; however , the central cities in the western region , such as Xian , Chongqing , Chengdu , and Guiyang , as well as certain industries and trades still maintain each 's own relative advantages .  
Article 24 In places where industrial wastewater and urban sewage are used for irrigation , the agricultural authority of local people 's governments at or above the county level shall organize regular monitoring of the quality of water used for irrigation and the irrigated soil and farm produce and shall take appropriate measures to prevent the pollution of soil , underground water , and farm produce .  
do a good job in diverting redundant workers to other jobs and increasing efficiency with reduced staff ; put it in a prominent place to improve efficiency ; and establish a new-type small and efficient nuclear technology industrial system based on the integration of military and civilian production .  
through the introduction of foreign capital and advanced applicable technology and equipment , they can speed up enterprises ' technological transformation and industrial structural upgrading , heighten the international competitiveness of the central and western regions , and transform the development potential into realistic productive forces , so as to provide an even broader space and gigantic propelling force for the sustained development of the central and western regional economy and their foreign economic relations and trade in the new century .  
It is necessary to proceed on the basis of resolving currently prominent problems and to have in mind long-term development ; it is necessary to vigorously proceed with the strategic adjustment of the economic structure , to further stabilize and enhance agriculture 's position as the base , to intensify the adjustment of the industrial structure , and to accelerate the grand development of the western region , so as to improve the overall quality of the national economy and to raise the economy to a higher level .  
It can be anticipated that in a period to come , the huge demand of the Western Region for building materials , engineering machinery , industrial equipment , electronic products and other supplies will greatly stimulate the production of relevant industries and make a large number of enterprises free themselves from their current situation of operating under capacity .  
To promote the application of patented technologies , the exhibition also displays all the patented items that won gold medals and outstanding awards in China in the past , the projects that were selected by the State Intellectual Property Office as showcases for application of patented technologies to industrial production , and some selected patented technology projects that have attained high technological standards and generated good economic returns .  
By 2005 the CSSIC will have formed a military industrial scientific research and production system based on adequate maintenance and supplies and a relatively complete S &amp; T innovation system and a good operation mechanism , under which the CSSIC 's shipbuilding capacity will have been expanded to 2.2-million tonnes ; 60 percent of exported boats and ships will have used home-made equipment ; five to eight brand-name products with a sales volume amounting to over 1-billion yuan will have been developed ;  
For many years we have worked hard to put into practice Deng Xiaoping 's thinking of common prosperity .  Having gained a certain economic strength , we began to carry out the " project of common prosperity " and , relying mainly upon the financial departments at the city level for many consecutive years , raised funds totaling 1.88-billion yuan and put them into the relatively backward areas of the city in a bid to improve their infrastructure facilities , industrial layout , and cultural and educational conditions , thereby bringing about the coordinated development of various localities .  
A People 's Bank official spoke today in Beijing on cracking down on unauthorized fund gathering activities .  He said People 's Bank would take further steps to join with the industrial and commercial as well as the judicial departments and adopt stern measures to resolutely ban , investigate , and crack down on unauthorized fund gathering activities in an effort to preserve the stability of socioeconomic order .  
Those who hand in false documents or use other deceptive means to fraudulently obtain their registration , once discovered , must be promptly punished , to the point of having their business licenses suspended , by the industrial and commercial administrative organ .  
Third , to have the right of contributing to industrial development .  As the technical and safety standards are formulated by ourselves , they will contribute to the industrial development of the broadcast and television network , pager , cellular phone , electronic notebook , computer , public screen , and household electrical appliances , among other things .  
Non-governmental economic cooperation has evolved from individual corporate ones to the stage of establishing " special economic zones " and industrial parks .  Increasing economic and trade cooperation and personnel exchanges have helped increase mutual understanding and trust , which not only bring real benefits for the people of the two Koreas but produce a positive impact on the improvement of the north-south relationship .  
At the same time , starting with the first five-year plan , the central authorities concentrated finances to invest in a number of key construction projects ; within quite a short time we built up an independent and relatively complete industrial system and national economic system on the backward " poor and blank " foundation left over from old China .  
Carrying out a positive fiscal policy , strengthening infrastructure construction , supporting agricultural basic construction and construction for the ecological environment , supporting economic restructuring , speeding up the development of hi-tech industry , revamping old industrial bases and traditional industries , practicing the policy of rejuvenating the nation through science and education and the strategy of sustainable development , and establishing a social security system all require corresponding increase of input and state financial support .  
An authoritative person analyzed the situation when he was interviewed by reporters and noted that the driving forces included mainly the following : The showing of the effectiveness of the policy of macro-control , the increase of demand for export as a result of the recovery of the global economy , the significant improvement of quality in industrial production , the new motive force as a result of the rapid development of new and high-tech industries , and the " popular feeling " that expect good economic growth .  
Learning and studying successful experiences of developed countries and neighboring regions in developing an integrated circuits industry and summing up our country 's experiences and lessons in developing an integrated circuits industry has become undoubtedly and extremely vital to our country 's development in future .  We should map out industrial policies ; build a development environment ;  
With the driving force of the overseas Chinese , this city achieved uncommon , vigorous , and rapid growth .  In ten years the total value of industrial and agricultural output grew 90-fold , and their overall economic strength jumped from being near the last in the province to one of the top three .  
Piracy has seriously disturbed the economic and cultural operational orders in the country and worsened the environment for national cultural industries ' survival , thus causing a massive drain on state revenues and causing cultural business units ' failure to gain an advantageous position in competition amid world economic integration by making it difficult for them to achieve effective accumulation and rapidly expand their industrial scale .  
[ Liu Shijin ] After we started the reform and opening-up drive , we reexamined and adjusted our previous strategy of giving priority to developing the heavy industry .  This resulted in the pattern of industrial development with emphasis on the textile and other light industries during the early and middle periods of the 80 ' s of the 20th century .  
As a result of economic and trade cooperation with the mainland , the proportions of primary and secondary industries in the island 's total output value have kept declining , while that of tertiary industry has gradually risen , thereby effectively promoting Taiwan 's economic transformation and industrial structural adjustment .  
Compared with other countries , in 1999 China 's overall economic amount ranked seven in the world , major industrial and farm product output ranked first in the world , total foreign trade amount ranked ten in the world , foreign exchange reserve ranked second in the world , international tourism ranked eight in the world , and attraction of foreign capital ranked second in the world .  
Xiamen now ranks as one of the top-ten economically strong cities in the country .  To meet the need of the state 's safety , Xiamen has initially built an industrial system , which can rapidly covert civilian production to defense technology industry .  Electronic , machine tool , and chemical industrial enterprises constitute a major part of this industrial system .  
The city has developed , in a selected and planned manner , more than 130 projects that can manufacture products both for military and civilian purposes .  To meet the need of military maneuvers , the city has repeatedly made such a conversion in an effort to turn sci-tech achievements into combat capability .  Now a total of 16 high-tech industrial enterprises are able to manufacture military articles to meet various needs at short notice .  
The ultimate effect of the modern economic protection , that is regarded as a system , hinges on the questions whether the overall function of the system can be brought into full play and whether the system can provide various major economic targets with enough survival capacity , appropriate production capacity , and rapid after-war recovery capacity under the condition of high-tech wars .  Hence , the protection of economic targets has already developed from the protection of individual factories to the overall protection of urban and industrial sectors .  
Second , we should formulate scientific and rational policies to guide foreign commercial investment industries , enhancing foreign economic policy coordination , integrating the attraction of foreign capital with the readjustment of the industrial structure and with expanding exports and improving the level of technical development , and improving the nation 's overall competitiveness .  
For example , last year , when discussing the measures for promoting community construction and management , advancing the construction of new and high-tech industrial bases , and reinforcing the party organizations at the grass-roots level , members of the municipal party committee standing committee were dispatched to do special investigations and research in the fields they took charge of .  This guaranteed that the decisions and arrangements made by the municipal party committee more relevant and pertinent in giving guidance to the concrete work .  
At the beginning of the 20th century , as a result of the new cultural movement and the Russian October Revolution , a group of patriotic and progressive intellectuals accepted Marxist theory which represented advanced culture and a forward direction .  They penetrated the industrial working masses that represented the advanced productive force , propagated revolutionary theory , and combined the two .  The result was the birth of the Chinese Communist Party .  
In 1986 , Qingdao started to openly select and appoint the deputy directors of its planning commission , economic commission and financial committee .  In 1993 , it selected deputy administrators and assistants from applicants all over the country for its five departments including the city 's science and technology commission , bureau for tourism , and high-tech industrial park .  In 1999 , it had selected and appointed six leading cadres at the deputy bureau chief level from applicants in the whole city .  
The city transferred a number of cadres with knowledge about industrial and urban development from city-level organs to work in suburban counties ; as a result , knowledge of local party and government leaders has been diversified , their average age was five years younger , and their average educational level has been raised , which has effectively boosted local economic work .  
The countries of Asia should seize the opportunity , aggressively adjusting their development strategies and accelerating the industrialization , modernization , and market-orientation process .  In particular , they should increase their investments in education and science and technology , vigorously developing and training talented individuals , emphasizing the development of new and advanced technology industries , accelerating industrial upgrades , promoting the sustained and rapid development of the Asian economy in the new century and gradually enabling the people everywhere to affluent lives .  
After the beginning of reform and opening-up , our country 's gross economic quantity continued to expand .  GDP increased from 362.4-billion yuan to over 8,000-billion yuan , ranking seventh place in the world and ranking first among all developing countries .  The output of major farm produce and industrial products also ranks in an advanced position in the world .  
Support for projects of basic research , common industrial technology , key technology , and high technology has been strengthened and initial results for conducting technical innovation and industrializing scientific and technological achievements have been obtained .  
The fundamental approach to dealing with all our existing problems , including such economic construction problems as insufficient domestic demand , an irrational industrial structure , and uneven development across the regions and such political problems as the unification of the motherland , lies in accelerated development .  
The great development of the industrial revolution early in this century made the organization of the military move away from the traditional model of having the infantry ( cavalry ) forces as the dominant forces , with the structure of the military coming to encompass such elements as artillery , armed , engineering , air defense , and naval forces ; the availability and quantities of the new services and arms of the military , characterized by high technological contents , became important indicators of the level of modernization and combat effectiveness of the military .  
Human society 's change from the pastoral civilization to agricultural civilization and from agricultural civilization to industrial civilization was the qualitative leap of the human social and economic development after the structural adjustments were repeatedly accumulated to a certain stage .  
Since Chen Shui-bian took office , Taiwan 's economic environment has been worsening every day .  The outflow of large amount of capital and the " shifting " of industrial and commercial enterprises one after another to other countries have consumed more than half of the economic achievements painstakingly accumulated by the Taiwan people over the past 30-plus years .  On improving the cross-strait relations , Chen Shui-bian has only given some ambiguous remarks .  
When promoting the optimized upgrading of the national economic structure , although we must not neglect changes in the industrial structure , or the significance of raising the relative proportion of the tertiary industry on the basis of optimized internal structures in the primary and secondary industries , at the same time we must not neglect to promote structural optimization and upgrades in the other areas .  
- - Attach importance to and improve strategic studies in enterprise development , implement scientific and democratic decision making in order to avoid major mistakes due to rash decisions , establish a responsibility system for major decision making in enterprises , and hold relevant personnel accountable in cases where enterprises suffer serious losses due to violations of relevant laws , regulations , and industrial policies . 
- - We will perfect the mechanism for withdrawing enterprises from the market ; comprehensively resort to economic , legal , and other necessary administrative means to undertake bankruptcy proceedings against those chronically loss-making enterprises with debts in excess of assets and with no hopes of climbing out of the red ; actively and prudently close down those mines that are exhausting resources ; continue to close down the " five small industrial enterprises " in accordance with the law ; and eliminate backward production capability .  
Speeding up the establishment of a social security system is now the key issue in deepening enterprise reform and speeding up structural adjustment ; it has a bearing on efforts by enterprises to separate out their social functions and cut personnel to improve efficiency , on whether the reassignment of laid-off personnel to other jobs can move forward or not , and on whether the task of upgrading the industrial structure and improving enterprise efficiency can be accomplished smoothly .  It has become a critical task .  
According to the communiqu published by the meeting , world economic development will be slowing down , but the basic factors supporting the sustained development of most of the major industrial nations have remained unchanged .  
It is understood that , during the 15 years of the " 863 " Plan , it has achieved a large number of world class research results .  It has made breakthroughs on and mastered a number of key technologies , closing our gap with the advanced world level , to develop a number of high-tech industrial growth-points .  It has sharply promoted China 's development of high technology and high-tech industry , providing high-tech support for upgrading traditional industry .  
For instance , there were no China-made robots 15 years ago , but China has currently developed a group of industrial robots , service-oriented robots , and special robots which are applied to industrial production , work involving high risks , and other businesses .  For example , robots for wall cleaning , pipeline robots , robot-like engineering machinery , contour spraying robots , assembly robots , micro-driving robots , and automatic pathfinders have been on the market for application .  Important achievements have been made with the technique of underwater autonomous deep diving .  
Third , thanks to the close cooperation between the key techniques developed during the implementation of the " 863 " Project and the industrial circle , China has created products with its own intellectual property rights in such hot point fields of international high-tech competition as biological engineering medicine , communications equipment , high-performance computers , Chinese information processing platform , artificial crystal , photoelectron material and apparatuses .  
Our current tasks are extremely arduous , such as deepening the reform of state-owned enterprises , realigning industrial structures , increasing peasant income , re-arranging laid-off workers , expanding social employment , balancing the distribution of incomes , and setting up and improving the socialist security system .  
Through reforms and opening up over more than 20 years , Guangzhou has given play to many of its traditional commercial advantages and has gradually built up a mature market system , laid a good industrial foundation , built up its financial strength , and improved its investment environment and investment management .  
Fourth , along with the development of agricultural productive forces , the social division of labor is increasingly elaborate , the degree of commercialization , specialization , and socialization of agricultural production is unceasingly enhanced , and the combination and interdependence of agriculture with relevant industrial departments is closer and closer with each passing day , which have led to the integration of supply , production , and marketing , and of agriculture , industry , and commerce in agricultural operation .  
Internationally , the trend toward economic globalization is intensifying , the scientific and technological revolution is developing by leaps and bounds , the pace of the readjustment of the industrial structure is quickening , and China 's neighboring countries are developing at an accelerated pace .  
Qian Qichen said : " During my visit , I also had the chance to have extensive contact and exchange with personalities from various circles , such as the US Congress , industrial and commercial enterprises , media , ethnic Chinese community , and community of Chinese people residing in the United States . They all expressed the wish to see China and the United States friendly to each other and that the bilateral relations between the two countries can develop steadily . " 
First , the reorganization and transformation of traditional industries should be put in an important position .  Traditional industries should be optimized and upgraded by means of quickening the change in the mode of industrial growth , increasing product variety , improving product quality , lowering energy consumption and other costs , adopting high and new technologies and other advanced and applicable technologies .  Second , it is necessary to develop high and new technology industries .  
During the period of the 10th Five-Year Plan , we should work closely around the goal of expanding domestic demand and adopt practical and effective macroeconomic fiscal policy and monetary policy to stimulate domestic market demand for investment and consumption in order to promote economic growth and upgrade the industrial structure .  
The state is obliged to adopt effective steps to guarantee the realization of these rights , for example , providing technical and vocational guidance and training , ensuring men and women enjoy equal pay for equal work , guarantee industrial safety and public sanitation in the working environment , ensuring that people in the same trades enjoy equal chances for promotion and such promotion will only be determined by seniority and ability , and will not be affected by any other factors .  
It is understood that " sewage charges " are charged according to the monthly water consumption of enterprises ( including foreign-invested enterprises and units ) and different rates are imposed on industrial enterprises , tertiary enterprises and public institutions .  " Sewage charges " on enterprises that have not yet met environmental protection standards are several times higher than for enterprises that are up to standard .  
The insufficient development of the tertiary industry is a principal problem existing in China 's industrial structure .  Since the implementation of the Ninth Five-Year Plan , given the rapid development attained in the tertiary industry and its increasing proportion held in the GDP , there is still a big gap as compared with other countries in the world .  
However , there is one point which the MAC has neglected .  Not all the key industrial cities today are located in northern China , but are located in the southeastern coast of the mainland such as Jiangsu , Guangdong and Fujian . In terms of geographic distance , they can be formed into an industrial group with Taiwan . However , the political factors have made most people feel today that the distance between both sides of the strait is too far to be reached .  
If it is said that in the era of industrial economy , knowledge could find expression in a combatant 's skills or a commander 's tactics , in a future war , intellectual fighting capacity and knowledge confrontation will respectively constitute a major symbol of military strength and a fundamental characteristic of military confrontation .  
As an official of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation noted , the motherland is rich in resources and has a vast market that is full of potential .  It also has an abundant supply of labor , low wages , cheap land , a huge contingent of scientific and technological personnel , and an industrial productive system that is complete in range and large in scale .  
The industrial value added continued to increase at a comparatively high rate .  The growth rate in the industrial sectors under state ownership or with dominating shares held by the state was higher than that in the same period of last year , and the rate of their contributions to overall economic growth was also raised .  However , the industrial sector under collective ownership grew at a relatively slower pace , and the growth rate of light industry was markedly lower than that of heavy industry .  
As the industrial and commercial circles in Taiwan are expecting to further open up economic and trade exchanges on both sides of the strait , a public figure of the Taiwan authorities recently issued a thought-provoking statement that the continued rising unemployment rate on the island and the unfavorable economic situation would affect the time to relax restrictions on the implementation of the " no haste , be patient " policy and the extent of implementing this policy .  
set things right in matters ranging from theory to practice ; carried out and acted in the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee ; lost no time in shifting the focus of party work to economic construction ; restored and developed industrial , agricultural , scientific , cultural , and educational undertakings that had been disrupted by the " Great Cultural Revolution " ; revived and carried forward the fine traditions of the party ; and consolidated and developed political stability and unity in Jilin Province .  
When he learned that there was no more hope for Wang Wei to return alive , elder Chen Yingming , chief senior aviation industrial artist of the China Aviation Museum who is over 70 years of age , decided to make with his own hands for Wang Wei a fighter plane model named the " Blood-and-Iron Fighter Plane , " and the model would look exactly the same as the fighting eagle piloted by Wang Wei before his death .  
The state has decided to make infrastructure construction the base , strengthening the protection and construction of the ecological environment the main content , grasping the readjustment of the industrial structure the key , developing scientific and technological education the basic condition , and thorough reform and expanded open up the strong driving force of development .  
the import of technological equipment for private use by domestic-investment and foreign-investment industrial projects encouraged by the state , as well as superior industrial projects within their total amount of investments in the western region , will be exempted from paying tariffs and the import value-added tax , with an exception for commodities that are not allowed to enjoy tax exemption as stipulated by the state .  
National model workers Li Huangxi , Bao Qian , Wang Yiqiang , Sun Haijun , Zhang Ruimin successively spoke on such subjects as striving to be new-type industrial workers in the new era , carrying forward the spirit of doing pioneering work against difficult conditions , rebuilding beautiful natural environment , and enhancing the enterprise 's international competitive power .  
[ passage omitted ] In the 10 years beginning in 2001 , based on their yearning for an American century , extreme rightwing American politicians , tycoons , the military industrial complex , the media , and its ideological wildness will wallow together in the mire , and unscrupulously stir up the " theory of the China threat " ; in coordination with a psychological offensive , they will carry out a new " physical offensive . "  
Contradictions in various strata in Hong Kong should be resolved through mutual understanding and accommodation after consultation and discussion .  Sensational means should not be used to intensify contradictions .  Seeking development means creating conditions for " gathering talent and financial resources , " actively promoting industrial and education restructuring , and maintaining Hong Kong 's competitive edge at the advent of the era of global economic integration and knowledge-based economy .  
Observers point out that the most direct and evident information gleaned from the fact that , only three months after taking office , the Bush Administration could not wait to deploy an NMD program far exceeding that of his predecessor is that the United States needs to simulate its economy , which has started a downturn , by means of stepping up production in the defense industry , and also to offer a political reward to the military industrial complex for supporting Bush in getting into the White House .  
The " 10th Five-Year Plan " for tackling key scientific and technological issues will focus over 60 percent of S &amp; T funding on surmounting a host of integrative technological issues that have the greatest effect on spurring industrial technological upgrades and sustainable social development , issues that cover a broad area , and that relate to high-level core technology and associated equipment .  
Judging from the surface , cross-strait relations remain calm and stable ; moreover , thanks to the hard efforts of the public as well as the industrial and commercial circles on the island who have been imposing pressure on the authorities , many man-made restrictions in Taiwan are forced to be relaxed , thus giving rise to an unprecedented upsurge of economic , trade , and cultural exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits .  
During his inspection tour , Wu Bangguo expressed admiration for the way Shanghai implemented the " 3-2-1 " industrial development policy and organically integrated the urban layout readjustment and its functional improvement with the industrial readjustment in accordance with the plan for economic and social development and the general urban plan .  
The " prescriptions " written by people of insight on the island include pursuing political stability , promoting industrial upgrade , raising administrative efficiency , and promoting financial reforms .  However , they spontaneously stressed the crucial role of developing cross-strait relations .  Some scholars pointed out that the authorities ' " no haste , be patient " policy has led people to lose hope .  
At present , the people and the industrial and commercial circles in Taiwan are still restless and dissatisfied .  The principal reason is that the will of the people has been distorted and their confidence has been broken .  There are three specific manifestations of this situation :  
First of all , Zhu Rongji expressed his appreciation for the attention given by Hong Kong 's industrial circles and professionals to the strategy of developing the western region and to the vigorous assistance and support given by the Hong Kong SAR in their participation in the strategy .  He hoped that Hong Kong 's industrial and commercial circles would play a greater role in developing the motherland 's western region and in promoting the common development of Hong Kong and the interior .  
Last year industrial enterprises owned by the state and those in which the state held a dominant stake of shares registered a profit exceeding the preceding year by 137.7-billion yuan .  According to estimates , 48 percent of this increase in profit was attributable to the improvement of the macroeconomic environment , and 23 percent was due to the direct effects of the policies adopted by the government to enable the enterprises to stop losses and earn profits .  
All localities and departments should conscientiously implement the spirit of the central instructions , take practical and effective measures to guarantee water supply for cities and drinking water for people and livestock in rural areas and , through structural adjustments and major efforts to save on water , strive to do a good job in industrial and agricultural production .  
However , since he took office , he has failed to honor his commitment .  To consolidate his political base , he has been blindly playing up to the interests of the conservative forces , the rich , and large enterprises , especially of the military industrial enterprises , in the financial budget and taxation policy , education policy , social security policy , environment policy , and on a series of other issues .  
Zhu Rongji emphasized that at present , the supply of grain and industrial consumer goods is greater than demand and this has provided a golden opportunity for returning farmland land to forests and improving the ecological environment .  We must firmly grasp this rare opportunity and actively and prudently push forward work in this respect .  
With the beginning of the new century , our country 's drive for socialist modernization has entered a new stage of development .  The world scientific and technological revolution is developing rapidly , the tendency toward economic globalization is getting stronger , the pace of industrial restructuring is quickening , and international competition is becoming increasingly keen ; all these pose new challenges to us .  
On this basis , our party seized the opportune moment to creatively realize the socialist transformation of individual farming , handicraft industry , as well as capitalist industrial and commercial industries , destroyed the exploiting system and the exploiting class , and established the socialist system .  
Meanwhile , the 10th Five-Year Plan for Sci-Tech Development has clearly defined the following concrete goals for China 's sci-tech development : First , we should greatly improve our industrial level and international competitiveness .  We should ensure that the technical level of the major domains of our agricultural , industrial , and service sectors would be improved to the same level as enjoyed by advanced countries in the mid-1990s .  
In the light of the needs of its social and economic development as well as the needs of its industrial structural readjustment , and also in accordance with its promises concerning the WTO accession , China is to accelerate the opening of its central and western regions , as well as its service trade , to the outside world ; and is to increasingly expand the scale of its foreign investment introduction , and to open more fields to foreign investment .  
He demanded that environmental protection work be assigned a still more prominent position in industrial development ; we should be resolved to readjust and close down cement and other industrial and mining enterprises currently polluting the environment and wasting resources , so that Tibet 's skies will be more blue , its waters more clear , and its trees more green .  
Go a step further in optimizing foreign companies ' investment in the industrial structure , raise foreign companies ' investment in the content of science and technology , continually expand the scope of foreign companies ' investment , strive to complete the regional distribution of foreign companies ' investment , encourage foreign companies to invest in our central and western areas , improve the legal system concerning foreign investment , further transform the role of government , and carry forward administration according to law .  
the proportion of the gross industrial product made up of dominant products , high-tech products and technical products for both military and civilian use rising to 40 percent from the current approximately 30 percent ;  
According to what is understood , for more than 20 years China 's national defense science and technology industry has gradually realized a transformation from an industry that produces industrial products for military use only , to one that produces products that integrate military and civilian use .  Every industry within the military industrial complex has fundamentally formed a developmental pattern with professional characteristics for products for the civilian industry .  
The session reached a comprehensive consensus on the 12 questions left over from the multilateral talks , including agricultural and industrial subsidies , trade rights , a transitional review mechanism on China , and other important issues , Long Yongtu said , adding that the political and substantial questions related to China 's accession to the WTO have been resolved . 
The cumulative total of actual utilization of direct investment by foreign companies now exceeds $ 360-billion , and China has ranked first in the world in bringing in foreign investment for eight successive years .  This has played an irreplaceable role in making full use of " two markets and two kinds of resources , " leading forward national economic growth , speeding up industrial restructuring and the progress of science and technology , and impelling the reforms of the economic structure and the marketization process .  
In carrying out such special campaigns , quality inspection , industrial and commercial administration , public security , customs , and other relevant departments should coordinate closely with one another , work in cooperation , and make every possible effort to achieve major results .  
If the export growth rate for the second half of the year continues at the low level we saw in May - - or even lower , perhaps becoming negative growth - - industrial growth for the entire year will be hard pressed to reach 10% , while the GDP growth rate for the entire year may fall below the minimum target of 7% .  
On the afternoon of the 17th , Beijing Municipality held its first Mayoral Office meeting since the successful Olympics bid , where it studied the high-tech industrial development plan drawn up by the concerned departments for the " 10th Five Year Plan " and the three-year urban public transportation development plan .  
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , Hubei 's national economy grew steadily at an annual average rate of 10.8 percent ; its industrial production , in particular , maintained the trend of a rapid development , growing at an annual average rate of 13.5 percent ; the province 's economic structure was further optimized , and its economic strength evidently strengthened ;  
Wu Bangguo pointed out : In the first half of this year , China 's economy continued to show the favorable trend of a steady growth .  The country 's industrial production enjoyed a rapid growth , and its economic efficiency was enhanced by a considerable margin .  
Industrial and commercial enterprises engaged in development projects in the agricultural sector are urged to adopt the industrialized management method of using companies to bring along the growth of rural households , while the practice of developing a modern agriculture by industrial and commercial enterprises through a large-scale " land encirclement " is not encouraged at the present stage .  
We must actively support the development of agricultural product processing industries , taking a path of integrated trade , industrial , and agricultural industrialization .  We must bolster qualified enterprises in their development of agricultural production , processing , and export bases , enhancing the motivating power on farmers by the market competition forces , and raising the level of agricultural production organization and the international competitive power of China 's agriculture .  
He demanded that the broad ranks of cadres and employees working in the industrial and commercial administration sector nationwide perform their duties conscientiously , reinforce regulation and law enforcement , bravely act as defenders of the market , strive to open up a new prospect in industrial and commercial administration , and make new contributions to the establishment and maintenance of a good order of market economy and the sustained and healthy development of the national economy .  
While performing their duties , industrial and commercial administration personnel must be impersonal and incorruptible and enforce the law bravely .  They should be brave to make arrests , fulfill their regulatory function , and handle tough cases , waging a relentless war against all lawbreaking and criminal behavior .  
Overall , the contingent of staff of industrial and commercial administration departments we have today is good and a batch of excellent law enforcers who are brave to enforce the law , defy violence and brute force , and do not hesitate to lay down their lives have come to the fore .  
All industrial and commercial law enforcers must be faithful to their duty , be brave to take responsibility , and remain upright and incorruptible .  They should make a good job of market regulation and law enforcement by presenting a clean , honest , and lofty image ;  
This is especially true following China 's entry to the WTO , when foreign agricultural produce of high quality will be entering the market at a much lower price , thus threatening the existence of traditional agriculture .  More farmers should be given the opportunity to engage in industrial and commercial undertakings .  
Through accelerating the practice of opening up , China should smash departmental and industrial monopoly as well as local protectionism , build up and perfect a nationwide unified , standardized , and orderly market system which is characterized by fair competitions , diversify the principal parts of investment , and bring about a rational flow to and readjust the mix of key production factors ;  
The nation 's discharge of sulfur dioxide , chemical oxygen demand , dust , industrial solid waste and other major pollutants should be cut by 10 percent relative to 2000 ' s level .  In particular , the emission of sulfur dioxide in the " two controlled " zones should be reduced by 20 percent compared to 2000 ' s levels .  
1 .  To coordinate the process of joining the WTO , Taiwan should decontrol direct cross-strait trade and direct postal and telecommunications services , and , considering the Mainland 's moves to lower its trade barriers , appropriately increase and open up Mainland imports .  Meanwhile , Taiwan should also plan to set up an " early warning system governing cross-strait trade security " to take charge of affairs relevant to national security and industrial risks .  
and resolve a number of problems currently facing our economic development , including an irrational industrial structure , a low industrialization level of new and high technologies , and poor market competitiveness .  We should stress launching a batch of engineering projects using new and high technologies , which include high-performance computers , photoelectronic materials and apparatus , the design and manufacturing of submicroscopic and deep-submicroscopic integrated circuits , biological technologies and their industrialization , biochips , and agro-biological projects .  
In accordance with the Regulations Governing the Administration of Recreational Establishments and on the basis of the principle of " protecting what is legitimate , cracking down on what violates the law , and banning what is illegal , " cultural , public security , industrial and commercial departments at all levels , as well as other functional departments , must resolutely ban recreational establishments that are engaged in illegal operations without a license or a complete license .  
Third , take scientific and technological progress as a driving force , use high and new technology and advanced technologies to transform traditional industries and change the mode of industrial production growth according to the actual conditions in Tianjin , promote industrialization by means of adopting advanced information technology , continuously enhance the overall quality and market competition power of the enterprises .  
Principal leader of local governments should bear primary responsibility for industrial safety .  Those bearing direct administrative responsibility for serious industrial accidents should be punished .  Second , the industrial safety management and supervision institutions should be strengthened .  
Aleksandr Nikolasov , deputy director of the National Economic Forecast and Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences , stated : Over the past few years , the Russian Government and industrial circles have attached growing importance to exploiting energy resources in eastern Russia , and with large oil and gas fields discovered and verified in eastern and western Siberia and in Russia 's far east , and proven deposits outstripping future demand in those regions , Russia is bound to increase energy exports by a large margin . 
When being interviewed by this reporter , Yu Zhengsheng , minister of construction , stressed that at present , the dynamism and competitiveness of the construction industry and the real estate industry should be enhanced through structural adjustments , industrial policies , and the work of straightening out and regularizing the order of the construction market , and efforts must be made to turn the construction industry into one of the pillar industries and major economic growth points of the national economy .  
This method of getting enmeshed in a web of one 's own spinning has muzzled Taiwan 's economic vitality and competitiveness , with the result that Taiwan industrial and commercial enterprises have missed good opportunities for coming to the motherland to invest and run businesses , and the upgrading of Taiwan industries and change of economic pattern have been delayed , and this has also become one of the main reasons for Taiwan 's rapid and serious economic recession in the past year .  
We must take effective measures to appropriately lower the prices of industrial raw materials for which there are big price differences between China and abroad , resolutely intensify the work of closing down " five small " industries and knocking out backward production capacity , ensure the prevention of new duplicate construction , strictly control excessive imports of ordinary industrial products , and expand the market space for the development of state enterprises .  
A concerned expert in Beijing today revealed that with the implementation of a great strategy for developing the western region , the state will promote policies in favor of the western region in four fields : The state will appropriate 60 percent of obtainable foreign funds to the western region , permit cities in the western region to issue lottery tickets for the construction of infrastructure facilities , expand the scale of issuance of bonds by local enterprises , and try to establish an industrial investment fund in the western region .  
The concerned expert notes that since the founding of the State Development Bank five years ago , it has implemented the state 's macro-economic policy , industrial policy and regional development policy .  The bank has supported the development in central and western regions and the amount of loans extended to central and western regions accounted for more than 60 percent of its total loans each year .  
We should no longer solidify the previous examination and approval system and the industrial policies of mercantilism , and the government should change its keynote of public policies to more open-minded industrial policies , which include steady and sound macroeconomic policies , transparent legal system , and better external public conditions and facilities .  
Ye Xuanping said that in the past year , the CPPCC National Committee has strengthened ties with personalities in various circles in Taiwan , made extensive contacts with people of the industrial and commercial circles there , and tried in all possible ways to solve problems and do solid work for Taiwan businessmen .  Besides , it has also severely repudiated the " two-state theory " dished out by Lee Teng-hui [ Li Denghui ] and strongly condemned the Taiwan authorities ' acts of trying in vain to split up the motherland .  
Invited member Zhao Jiazhi , who rushed here from the old industrial base of Jilin Province , indicated that , in attending the session this time , he aimed most at gaining understanding of major arrangements made by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council that are oriented toward the new century , especially arrangements on how to develop the western region and coastal regions .

Sheng Huaren said : In its economic and trade work in 1999 , China made good progress in the areas of controlling the aggregate supply , making structural readjustment , deepening the reform , and improving economic returns and was expected to comprehensively achieve the major projected targets .  The economic returns of state-owned industrial enterprises and industrial enterprises where the state holds a controlling interest were distinctly better than in 1998 and could top 70 billion yuan , or 40 percent more than the projected target , for the whole year .  
Laying stress on the metallurgical , textile , petrochemical , nonferrous metals , mechanical , telecommunication , and paper industries , we selectively supported sound and strong enterprises and favored old industrial bases in northeast China as well as the central and western regions and made arrangements for the technological transformation of a number of symbolic projects .  
Wen Jiabao said : The key to successfully develop the country 's vast western region lies in the adjustment of industrial structure .  For this purpose , we should strengthen the role of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy .  Particularly , we should not overlook the current conditions of a large population and limited farmland as well as an increasing population and decreasing farmland .  
He considers Tibet 's present industrial structure as irrational .  With the primary industry carrying too much weight , the secondary industry carrying too little weight , and the tertiary industry being undeveloped , it has the typical characteristics of an agricultural economy .  
Fifth , speaking of the country 's agricultural development , China has adopted a comprehensive policy of readjusting the internal industrial structure of agriculture , promoting an industrialized operation of agriculture , paying close attention to the building of the ecological environment , and speeding up the development of small cities and towns ; and has moved to resolve problems that are currently existing among its peasants and in its rural areas and agriculture .  
Some people generally maintained that the economic structural problems were deep-rooted reasons causing the Asian financial crisis .  To revive the economy , the East Asia countries should exert efforts to readjust the enterprise systems and the industrial structures , attach importance to long-term goals , focus on enhancing international competitiveness , and enhance their national productivity and technological levels through the restructuring of their industries .  
The main factors constraining Russia 's industrial structural adjustment include , firstly , the government 's " passive adaptation " policy .  To fight crises , Russia has been tilted in favor of advantage-enjoying energy and raw material industries in terms of the direction of investment and exports .  This has unavoidably further worsened the already-deformed heavy-light structure .  
We will take the adjustment of industrial structure as the main direction of attack in the strategic adjustment of economic structure , and the internal and external market demands as the orientation for reinforcing primary industry , elevating secondary industry , and developing tertiary industry on the strength of scientific and technological advancement and technological innovation .  
Taking the conservation of energy , reduction of exhaustion , comprehensive utilization , and enhancement of environmental protection results by using new techniques and technologies as the focal points , we will expedite the technological transformation and equipment renewal of traditional industries and old industrial bases , speed up the elimination of outdated equipment and techniques , and reduce excess production capacity in a bid to narrow the gap with the developed countries in terms of production techniques , material exhaustion level , labor productivity , and the varieties and quality of products .  
In the article Wang Hui pointed out that despite an unusual development in cross-strait relations , trade between the two sides of the strait continued to set an all-time record in 1999 and the contracted Taiwan investment amount still posted more than 10-percent point increase , thanks to the joint efforts of the business and industrial circles of the two sides of the strait .  The growth of the mainland exports to Taiwan , however , was down and the actual Taiwan investment amount continued to slide .  
- - Looking at the development of productive force and changes in supply-demand relations : After more than 20 years of great development , the era of shortage where the supply of ordinary industrial and agricultural products could not meet the demand has basically ended ; the buyers market has taken shape ; the objective of economic development has gradually shifted from purely pursuing quantity in the past to giving equal attention to quality ;

Li Tieying stressed : The development of the western regions is a massive and systematic project involving ecological environmental protection , infrastructure construction , industrial restructuring , scientific and technological education , reform and opening up , and ethnic and religious issues .  
She indicated that real strength is the key in participating in international competition , and that improving real strength , such as developing industrial and agricultural product quality , invariably relies on science and technology .  
For a long time , the [ gap between ] economic and social development in eastern and western China has been growing larger , and this is primarily because of differences in scientific and technical levels and capabilities .  The government has already formulated the strategy for the major development of western China , and through the training , development , and effective utilization of S &amp; T human resources , we will improve our economic qualities and industrial competitiveness , bringing about the leapfrog development of the social productive forces in western China .  
With regard to the grain varieties excluded from the scope of purchases at protective prices , grain consuming enterprises and marketing enterprises will be allowed to purchase grain in the rural areas after the examination and approval of the industrial and commercial administrative departments at prefectural ( city ) or county level .  
As to the grain varieties still within the scope of purchases at protective prices , the purchasing channels should also be appropriately widened to allow and encourage the grain consuming enterprises and marketing enterprises to directly purchase grain , subject to the examination and approval of the industrial and commercial administrative departments at provincial level , according to the state policies .  
Second , our country 's economic restructuring has entered a crucial stage , and industries are in a historical stage of large-scale readjustment .  If we do not set up and improve the social security system , it will be impossible to realize the fundamental reform of state-owned enterprises , there will be no way to readjust the industrial structure , and it will be difficult to maintain social stability .  
Wang Shucheng , minister of water resources , indicated that the contradictions between shortage of water resources and accelerated economic development have become increasingly larger over the past few years .  Besides the shortage of water for agricultural and industrial production and domestic use , the drought has directly worsened the ecological environment .  
In order to meet with the challenges , it is imperative for the Chinese government to make some adjustments to its economic policies , vigorously develop modern agriculture , and quicken the tempo of agricultural modernization , upgrading of industrial structure , construction of infrastructure facilities , protection of ecological environment , and development of the central and western regions .  
That is why we must take the initiative in conforming to the trend of the global economic integration , positively readjust China 's agricultural industrial structure , cut down the proportion of grain production , and more thoroughly participate in the international division of labor with regard to grain production and conduct more international grain transactions .  
the manufacturing industrial departments with a medium ( less than 50 percent ) effective protection rate include paper , petroleum , chemical industry , basic chemical products , chemical fiber , rubber , plastics , nonmetallic minerals , ferroalloy processing , and nonmetal processing industry ;

The hidden motive and the attempt to sound out the response can not be ignored .  
As a result , although the labor productivity of agriculture in developing countries is the same as that of the industrial sector which is considerably lower than that in advanced countries , the domestic prices of primary agricultural products and their processed and manufactured goods are generally lower than the prices in the international markets , thus enjoying an absolute advantage .  
A wise way to adapt ourselves to the tide of globalization is to exchange concessions in land-intensive grain for a greater export of labor-intensive fresh agricultural products , and to exchange the opening-up of China 's monopolized industries for a greater share in the international market for China 's agriculture and its light industrial and textile industry - - Only this can be said a correct countermeasure .  
The four major economic trends to emerge in China pointed out by Premier Zhu made the patriots see the broad prospect of having opportunities to serve the motherland , made industrial and commercial circles in Hong Kong grasp the endless business opportunities , and made the broad masses of compatriots in Hong Kong see the brilliant future of economic cooperation between Hong Kong and the hinterland .

We will use industrial centralization and development as a driving force to prompt rural population to migrate to urban areas in a reasonable and orderly manner .  
At this historical juncture , in using its social resources and in its industrial restructuring , Hong Kong must put greater stress on cost-effectiveness and on increasing its value-adding ability .  It is wise to allow an international financier to plan financial and industrial work , because he is in a better position to : understand the needs of various industries , create new ideas , amass talents , create new industries , and achieve optimum allocation of resources .  Antony Leung will , like his predecessor , handle financial matters with circumspection .  
With the accession to WTO , China will establish a unified , fair , and standardized market system , break down industrial monopoly and departmental blockade and local protectionism , transform government functions , separate government institutions from enterprises , reduce administrative procedures for examining and approving investment and business plans .  
The " Boao Forum for Asia " is an unofficial international conference organization .  Being based in Asia , it will provide a convenient place for people in the enterprise , industrial , business , and academic circles who are concerned about Asia 's development to obtain information , carry out exchanges , and strengthen cooperation , thus promoting mutual understanding and mutually beneficial cooperation between various Asian countries and between Asian countries and other regions of the world .  
China 's forthcoming accession to the WTO , economic globalization , and the country 's participation in the international division of labor in the economic field all require China to make drastic readjustments to its industrial structure , make best use of its advantages and bypass its disadvantages , and enhance its international competitiveness .  This explains why the 10th Five-Year Plan has made structural readjustment its main line .  Structural readjustment has a fairly extensive connotation , and industrial structural readjustment serves as its core content .  
" To take a look at the possible change of a country 's industrial structure , it is necessary mainly to see the speed of its technological changes . "  Lin Yifu commented that the secret of Japan and Asia 's " four small dragons " in making rapid development in the 20th century was to introduce advanced technology .  As for China , it has a tremendous potential in promoting economic growth by making full use of its comparative advantages to introduce advanced technology .  
In the contemporary world , the new scientific and technological revolution is rapidly forging ahead with great momentum , the trend of economic globalization is also gathering momentum .  Many countries , including developed countries , are speeding up their own reforms mainly by actively promoting industrial restructuring .  They are all trying to seize a more favorable and advantageous position ahead of others by stimulating vigor , enhancing strength , and increasing their international competitive power .  
Delegate Zhou Shulian said that in order to ensure the smooth completion of the tasks of structural adjustment , it is necessary to overcome all kinds of institutional obstacles and establish a protective mechanism for structural optimization and upgrading .  By this he meant a mechanism for protecting the effective raising , rational distribution and efficient utilization of funds , talent , technology and other resources .  This mechanism mainly includes a rational economic system , a community of excellent entrepreneurs , scientific development strategies and industrial policies , as well as a sound and effective legal system .  
Their wide-ranging discussions covered such issues as industrial development , agricultural structural adjustment , increase of peasants ' income , the scientific , cultural , and educational undertakings , the building of democracy and legal system , and so on . 
Wen Jiabao said : To raise the level of industrial management of agriculture , first , it is necessary to bring the exemplary and stimulating role of major organizations into full play ; such organizations should form rational relations with peasants , make it possible for them to get material gain , and bring about common development .  
Speaking on environmental protection during the 10th Five-Year Plan period , Qu Geping said : Of all five-year plans , the draft outlines of the 10th Five-Year Plan place the greatest emphasis on environmental protection .  In addition to setting aside one special chapter - - " The Ecological Environment and Environmental Protection " - - to detail the protection plan , it also sets requirements for projects to be accomplished by the industrial , agricultural , and other sectors , thus incorporating the strategy for achieving sustainable developments with the national economic development plan .  
During the Tenth Five-Year Plan , the city of Lhasa will take advantage of the construction of the Tibetan railroad to speed up the readjustment of the industrial structure , actively develop new products that have a special plateau flavor and are sought after on the market , and will work hard to try to make its way into markets outside the autonomous region .  It will enhance the vitality of the local economy and achieve leapfrog-style social and economic development . "  
Second , we must help minority nationality areas in the country 's western region change their traditional way of thinking on the issue of economic development , adopt the principle of " establishing finite targets , and making advances in some fields while retreating from others , " make a full use of the advantages of the country 's western region in having a biological diversity and a nationality diversity , and build up an industrial structure and systems that enjoy distinguishing local features .  
enhance the overall quality and competitiveness of industry ; speed up the development of such pillar industries as electronics and information , hydropower , machinery and metallurgy , medicine and chemical industry , and beverages and foodstuffs ; and strive to build up eight major industrial bases for electronics and information , hydropower , heavy machinery and equipment , special steel products , new vanadium-titanium materials , modern Chinese medicine , natural gas and chemical industry , and beverages and foodstuffs .  
With the development of industry and the tertiary industry , the comprehensive productive capacity of agriculture is constantly increasing , and more and more people of the agricultural population will break away from traditional agriculture and move to industrial and urban areas .  
The key to conforming to the general trend of readjusting the world 's economic structure and striving to hold a still more advantageous position in the international and domestic division of labor lies in building up an industrial pattern with optimum structure and high competitive power .  
Taking into account the general law governing the evolution of the industrial structures at home and abroad and the present conditions of the industrial development in Heilongjiang , our overall industrial structural orientation during the 10th Five-Year Plan period should be set on solidifying and improving the primary industry , optimizing and elevating the secondary industry , and accelerating the development of the tertiary industry .  
Second , the industrial structure will be adjusted , the process of industrialization will be quickened , the proportion of the secondary and tertiary industries in gross internal product will be raised to a level closer to the national average .  
The rapidly developing trend of economic globalization that has come at the heels of the new century and the rising tides of the third industrial revolution that are sweeping the world will change the economic , political and cultural order of the world in profound ways .  
10 .  In chapter 10 of " promoting scientific and technological progress and renovation and raising sustainable development capabilities , " " provide technical support for industrial structure readjustment " was revised to " provide technical support for industrial structural readjustment , particularly for the upgrading of traditional industries . "  
Now , we have drawn a lesson from our painful experience .  The new round of industrial revolution in today 's world , like a tidal wave , is not only posing a grim challenge to us , but also providing us with a historical opportunity whereby we can catch up with the new revolution in science and technology and achieve leap-forward development of the productive forces .  
Speaking on China 's economic situation in the past three years , Premier Zhu said , after the Asian financial crisis , China 's foreign trade export had dropped drastically , there had been an oversupply of principal industrial products , and 10 million workers of state-owned enterprises had to be laid off .  In face of such gigantic difficulties , China did not devaluate the RMB , nor did we sell state-owned properties .  Rather , what China did was make a resolute policy decision , adopting a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy .

In its growth from a poor agricultural village to a modern industrial city , from a labor to a capital intensive industrial economic base , Kaohsiung is a mirror of Taiwan 's overall economic development . Kaohsiung has paid a price for its industrial boom .  
Covering an area of 120 square kilometers , Hsin Tien is bordered by the Taipei suburbs of Mucha and Chingmei in the northeast and the industrial communities of Chung Ho and T'uch'eng in the northwest . The southern area is bounded by scenic Wulai and the charming community of Sanhsia . Hsin Tien is 70% mountainous , an important factor shaping its rather unique development .  
Limited land and natural resources creates real problems for directing future industrial development of the nation 's economy . This , however , is offset by a fabulous pool of human resources reflected in a highly educated population and proportionally high percentage of skilled engineers .  
Ricebowls must be compact , easy to hold attractive , and not burn the hands that hold them . Ricebowls that meet these basic needs sell well ; those that do n't stay on the store shelf . Put simply , industrial design aims to make products more attractive and easy to use , requiring a minimum of human effort .  
Manufacturers generally have been in the role of supplying larger foreign companies and have prospered as their buyers have prospered . However , this strategy has its limits , particularly in the area of independent product development , and Taiwan has not used its own research potential . In addition , the specter of rising labor costs and tougher international copyright and trademark laws have further intensified the need for local manufacturers to do their own industrial design , marketed under their own labels .  
What we are concerned about today is how , during the process of our society 's transformation and while our citizens pursue their economic lives , we can uphold our traditional ethical , spiritual , and moral concepts and fuse this into a harmonious and modern industrial society .  
In the rapidly changing industrial society of today , where values are constantly changing , youths are especially ready and willing to accept all kinds of fresh things and events . With the addition of the all-pervasive modern mass media , it is only natural that young people should have concepts and ways of doing things which are different from those of their elders in the preceding generation .  
Taiwan 's economic structure changed during the 1960 ' s from an agricultural to an industrial base , and its core industries have developed during the 1980 ' s from labor-intensive to capital - and technology-intensive ones . The future job market will require higher quality manpower , and the demand for technical personnel will grow ever larger .  
As to how to clean up the Tamsui River system , Premier Yu stated that his preliminary view is that the main sources of pollution of the Tamsui River system are pollution caused by urban domestic sewage , industrial waste water , and refuse dumped along the river banks .  
According to Wang Ming-yang , a lecturer in industrial engineering at National Tsing Hua University , the problem lies in mass production . In a traditional society , where products were made by hand , clothing and everyday items could be custom designed to fit the individual .  
Unless we further accelerate the training of technical personnel , it will be difficult for us to join the ranks of the industrialized nations . 4 ) Sluggish renovation of technology by private enterprise . The most fundamental reason why the nation 's industrial structure is weak and its speed of adjustment is slow is that the level of creativity in products and production processes is inadequate and technological renovation by private enterprise is sluggish .  
Through this method the level of industrial technology increased and a large sum of capital accumulated which was necessary for research . At the same time it also served to nurture technological talent laying down the foundation for the rapid economic growth of the sixties .  
Currently R . O . C . agriculture has major weaknesses . First , natural agricultural production can not compete with mechanized industrial production , leading to an outmigration of labor , which affects the ability of agriculture to continue to develop ; Second , small farm operations lack economy of scale , leading to a low return on resources , which in turn influences the raising of real incomes of farmers .  
For just this reason , Stan Shih suggested in his presidential report that the government set up four new high-tech industrial parks in northern , central , southern , and eastern Taiwan that would be integrated with neighboring universities , research organizations , and satellite high-tech industrial parks to transform Taiwan into a high-tech island .  
A total of 653 international direct-dial public telephones will be installed at a wide variety of locations , including airports , harbors , train stations , tourist hotels , airline companies , tourist spots , large hospitals , major streets in commercial districts , universities , highway rest stops , industrial science parks , foreign affairs and trade centers , international activity centers , and the directorate 's main business offices .  
Then the quality of daily human existence for everyone will improve immeasurably as we march towards the turn of the century . . Establishing a Science CityAll our cities of today will eventually be transformed into science cities . Our economic infrastructure is based on the development of industrial science and technology . This goes hand-in-glove with the modernization of public facilities .  
By the end of this century , we must establish a complete system of laws and regulations , develop a hi-tech industrial structure , fill the gaps in modernized public facilities , carry out well-planned social security and welfare policies , and at the same time expand our particiaption in international activities . If we succeed in doing this , there is no doubt that we will create an advanced , prosperous , healthy , happy , and more balanced society in Taiwan by the year 2000 .

In 1975 the director of National Central University 's Environmental Center , Lu Shih-tsung , initiated an islandwide survey of Taiwan 's rainfall . His project was taken up by the Taiwan Forestry Research Institute and other university research bodies , together with the EPA . Their report indicated that the rainfall in many parts of Taiwan , such as the central mountainous region , is still " clean , " but the rain in the major conurbations of northern and southern Taiwan , together with certain industrial zones , is becoming more and more acidic .  
Good social welfare systems offer lifetime security , and geographical remoteness has spared people fierce economic competition from other countries of the world . As a result , Australians and New Zealanders are leisurely and carefree , but their economic growth has been rather slow . Their leading exports are still agricultural and mining products , and they rely on imports for most industrial and manufactured products .  
With the arrival of the 20th century , as Australia 's abundant agricultural , industrial and mineral resources were increasingly exploited , more and more investment was devoted to applied research in related areas , Before 1960 , when Melbourne was still the only university in the state of Victoria , faculties and departments with a practical orientation flourished in particular .  
Most downstream pollution comes from industrial and residential sources , but in sparsely populated upstream regions , not only have the water and soil been damaged by tea plantations , fruit orchards and vegetable farms , but excessive use of fertilizers has led to half of the reservoirs becoming infested with algae .  
This is because economic prosperity brought by industrial prosperity has led to luxuriant lives and long-term extravagant consumption of foods which are too rich and have too high a fat content , leading to overburdening the body 's organs , generating in turn obesity , high blood pressure , and diabetes .  
The 1980 ' s was the takeoff period for the ROC information electronics industry . The Hsinchu Science Based Industrial Park and special regulations to reward industrial upgrading were put in place . This was timed just right to give many young scholars who had lived in the US for a few years and acquired great experience the chance to come back to found enterprises , leading to an unprecedented wave of returning talent .  
At noon on May 15,1911 , a riot broke out in the Northern industrial city of Torreon . Three hundred Chinese - - about half the city 's Chinese community - - were killed ; in 1915 , there was a disturbance in another and the mad rioters looted the commercial district murdering over 200 Chinese . In July of the same year , Mexican revolutionary troops and their impoverished supporters pillaged 40 large-scale Chinese owned businesses in Cananea . According to statistics their losses amounted to US $ 5.3 million .  
Q . Some People are worried that with the use of cheap and abundant mainland labor , some of our labor-intensive industries will transfer investment and set up factories on the mainland which could influence the speed of our own industrial upgrading . They are also worried that when the mainland has absorbed our technology and capital , in the future they can turn around and destroy Taiwan 's native industries . What is your view ?  
Despite this , the " neither large nor small " numbers of cases of these illnesses still leave people a little non-plussed when they see them . The threats to life and health from modern industrial society come from stress and environmental pollution - - cancer , heart disease , asthma , infertility , and other " diseases of modern civilization " caused by chemical or biological agents . Have n't these acute communicable illnesses transmitted by bacteria or viruses already been eradicated ?  
When instant noodles first appeared on the market in Taiwan more than 20 years ago - - convenient , tasty and suited to the rapid pace of industrial society as they are - - they were an instant success . But their uniformity of flavor and inability to " fill you up " made it impossible for modern-day people who are pressed for time but still picky about their food to make them a staple of their diet .  
In the 1960s the government struggled to obtain foreign exchange . Under a policy of forcefully pursuing industrial development , record numbers of trees were cut . In 1960 the Yuli Forest District Office was established , and the forest compartments upstream continued to send down such top-grade conifers as red spruce and cypress and such broad-leaved trees as the Nanmu and Formosan Michelia .  
Planning has been completed on a second science-based industrial park , designed to be a future stronghold of high-tech industry . The Ministry of Economic Affairs is promoting the development of 64 promising key technologies such as liquid crystal displays and compact disk drives .  
The rapid development of technology has resulted in a gap between the living standards of the highly industrialized countries and the underdeveloped countries . As a result , the 1.2 billion people in the advanced industrial countries consume seven-eighths of the resources . And the four billion residents of the " Third World " are faced with hunger in many areas . This is also a topic that those involved in science and technology ought to consider .  
These plans were produced by first of all bringing together a group of top-notch scientists , who would perform deep investigations , hold discussions and perform analysis and research before collectively coming up with worldwide development trends . Then related industrial departments would be mobilized to describe their scientific development needs . Finally , in accordance with the special strengths of Chinese research personnel , the three aspects would be integrated , and a most beneficial development plan would be proposed .  
In Pingtan , boats from afar : Let 's return to the fishing industry . Taiwan is surrounded by the sea on all sides , and conditions for the development of the fishing industry were originally excellent , but because of the pollution caused by industrial development and improper fishing methods , the Taiwan coastal and inshore fishing industries have fallen on hard times .  
If the birds only have a place to go , and the environmental impact assessment for the industrial zone can be brought up to requirements and implemented , " no one would oppose the locality developing an industrial park , " says one official at the COA who hopes the local government can enter into reasonable , calm dialogue . Since those closest to the black-faced spoonbill are the local residents , to protect it first requires getting local support .  
The natural distribution of heavy metals has been disturbed and they have been dispersed from their originally secure ecological position . In the course of life and industrial production people lack any real sense of alarm about all this . With the failure to take precautions the situation has gradually become harder to contain .  
Taiwan developed relatively late , so that it was somewhat behind in terms of spraying pesticides , and the most destructive and toxic chemicals had already been banned for use anywhere in the world , so the problem was not so severe as in the advanced industrial nations . This was good luck . But since all that is true , and Taiwan has had the experience of others to serve as a mirror , why is it that today this has become a pressing problem for us ?  
Mr . Bigs should clean up their heavy metal : Faced with the red , blue , green , and other variously colored liquid pollutants generated by the electroplating industry , the industrial community ten years ago thought to follow the example of Japan and establish a special electroplating industrial zone to concentrate the scattered factories in one place and treat the waste water collectively .  
Due to the close relationship between heavy metals and the soil , along with the extremely complex composition of soil , it is much harder to get rid of this kind of pollution than it is when dealing with water and air . More time is required and the technology in this field is not as mature as it is with other industrial environmental techniques . So if you want to improve the problem of soil pollution , the costs are exorbitant .  
Super alliance to explore new industrial worlds : T . H . Steve Chao , deputy director of the Visual Information Technology Division at the CCRL , who has been responsible for laying the groundwork for this alliance , notes that HDTV will be the main-stream of global visual technology in the future . The key relevant technologies include high speed digital signal handling spun off from computer technology , high resolution imaging , and so on ; this will be a major revolution in the visual industry .  
Using green goods is only one part of green thinking . Even more important is lowering demand for material goods , and treasuring the things you already have , " explains Chang Kuo-lung , a professor of physics at National Taiwan University , of the origins of the green tide . He argues that in the two hundred years since the industrial revolution , the large-scale use of non-recyclable materials by mankind has allowed modern people to enjoy the same standard of living as an ancient emperor attended by 200 servants .  
But placing so much importance on marriage and the family has n't made modern Chinese more willing to cleave together as couples . On the contrary , with the change from an agricultural society to a commercial and industrial one with an international orientation , more and more couples are living apart for the sake of pursuing a better future .  
Various units including the Industrial Development Bureau ( IDB ) and the Construction and Planning Administration at the central level to the local city and county governments have mapped out seven industrial parks , three recreational parks , new cities and towns , garbage dumps , and other projects for the west coast tidal land . It is estimated that development will go forward in 13 places , adding more than 40,000 hectares of tidal land , which is equivalent to the area of three Taichung cities .  
Broadly speaking , the work of the ITRI can be divided into two main areas . The first is that of accepting commissions from government units ( especially the Ministry of Economic Affairs ( MOEA ) which directs industrial technological development ) . This includes taking on topical special technology development projects , along with generalities such as assisting in upgrading plans for traditional industries .  
When the government came to Taiwan over 40 years ago , power was in the hands of those labelled as being from " outside the province . " The main industrial and commercial businesses , and economic power , were also primarily " mainlander . " This meant that chairmen , directors and other important leadership posts were largely held by mainlanders , so as to establish good ties between business and the central government .  
At that time , countries all over the world operated on the gold standard , and gold was also required for international trade . It was partly thanks to this shipment of gold that Taiwan , which only had commodities such as tea and sugar to export and which relied on imports for all manufactured goods , was gradually able to transform itself from an agricultural to an industrial society , and to go from having a massive trade deficit to holding foreign exchange reserves which now rank among the world 's largest .  
An expectations gapIn fact , there are some industries where economic conditions are not too bad , and people can find work in their original line . But sometimes , the needs of labor and capital collide . Therefore , despite the fact that there is a severe shortage of manufacturing labor , everywhere you can see laid-off industrial workers drifting to other areas of employment ; it 's very perplexing .  
The broad idea for this was floated two years ago . The hope is that Taiwan can take advantage of its geographic location , orthodox Chinese culture , business connections with overseas Chinese , and solid industrial base to become the regional center for foreign firms coming to the Asian region ( and especially for those firms investing in the PRC ) .  
In Kaohsiung , factories in the industrial district begin spewing out smoke of a strange color . In office buildings in the city 's commercial district , air conditioning units large and small come to a halt . It becomes impossible for more than 300,000 households in the Kaohsiung-Pingtung area to generate the enticing smells of food being cooked . . . .  
In fact , the real cause of power rationing and blackouts can be seen from even a superficial glance : Because of rapid economic growth with a corresponding increase in national wealth , commercial and industrial demand for electricity has risen while consumer electric products have become common . On top of these , Taipower has run into land-acquisition problems and local resistance for plants it planned to develop , so these plants have not been able to come on line in a timely manner .  
But these industries do not yet reflect their real social costs : There is no environmental impact assessment of those social costs , environmental laws are not strict , and industrial investment in pollution control is inadequate . It has been suggested that recently a contradiction has developed between policies governing industry and those governing energy .  
" Starting from late 1994 , as the global economy recovered , demand increased greatly , and this brought sharp rises in the international prices of some agricultural and industrial raw materials , including petrochemical feedstocks , textile fibers , paper pulp , grains , basic metals and so on . Price rises in Taiwan are part of a global chain reaction , " says Liu Fang-jung , a specialist researching prices at the Council for Economic Planning and Development .  
Kris Chen of the Taipei Computer Association , who is in charge of the Industrial Technology Research and Development Office for the VR Industrial Alliance , argues that these conditions present Taiwan with an excellent opportunity . He notes that Taiwan already has a deep foundation in personal computers and integrated circuits . Thus , if VR core technology and peripheral equipment can be developed in time , not only will this spur industrial upgrading in Taiwan , it can reduce current high production costs through mass production .  
After deciding , Yang-who studied mechanical engineering and took a course in " industrial fibers " in college-returned to Taiwan to check out a CETRA exhibition to find machinery . In Taiwan he bought machines designed for combing and laying out cotton , as well as an automated sewing machine . He sent everything over to New Zealand , and altered those parts that were not suited for wool .  
What 's really depressing about this highway is the desolate vista presented by the heavy industry lining both sides . Whatever kind of grey and ugly industrial form you can think of-concrete factories , petroleum refineries , rusting old oil drums , discarded tire dumps , corrugated-steel structures put up without regard to building codes , construction machinery parks , steel smelters , chemical companies , oil pipeline , huge storage towers-they are all here . There 's only one thing you ca n't find , in fact : a tall green tree .  
" If developed according to plan , this will be the best industrial zone in the world , " says Enrique Lai . Fort Davis is blessed by verdant scenery and level terrain ; it is a modern town surrounded by unspoiled wilderness , and yet only fifteen minutes by car from downtown Colon , and ten minutes from the Colon Free Trade Zone .  
In the industrial age , enterprises had to sell a physical product to make a buck . But now that we have entered the information age and acceptance of the idea of intellectual property rights has become widespread , firms have begun to view things as intangible and abstract as technical know-how and business acumen as their most valuable money-making tools .  
And although these kind of knowledge can be recorded in books , such books are difficult to understand and in the end , it is " technicians " who are key . In a how-to manual on industrial espionage , chapter one might mention that if a company wants to protect itself , it must be very careful with high-level technical people it has hired away from other companies .  
In the light of the problems that the case has caused for Bayer , for the DPP and for central and local governments , Taiwan 's political parties have a responsibility to face up to the problems of overcoming political disagreements and formulating a set of realistic and complete methods , which have the confidence of the public , for policymaking , investment approval and environmental impact assessment in respect of major industrial projects . Otherwise , the future may bring more debacles like the Bayer case .  
" In 1982 Chien Ssu-liang , who was then president of the Academia Sinica , visited the East Coast of the United States and gathered together a group of us overseas members of the Academia Sinica , " Luke Yuan recalls . " He noted that Taiwan was doing pretty well in terms of applied science-using science to advance industrial and commercial development . But in basic research , especially in fields dependent on scientific experiments , Taiwan was quite weak . He asked us for our opinions and advice . "  
" Not only do we need to make the environment more suitable , we also need to change our habits and thinking about leisure , " says Lin Wan-yi . Lin says that with regard to Taiwan 's leisure-time habits , you have to remember that the whole society only went from being an agricultural one to an industrial one 20 or 30 years ago . " The traditional Chinese agrarian society did n't operate on a system of weeks . People 's holidays were folk festivals and their way of celebrating them was active and noisy . "  
Taiwan is by no means unique in encountering a growing number of elderly following rapid economic gains and improvements in the quality of medical care . The experiences of the advanced industrial nations in confronting these problems can serve as a reference for us , but we still need to do some basic homework : carrying out surveys about the different elderly age groups here and achieving general recognition of these problems and a consensus about how to deal with them .  
In an industrial society , as extended families living under one roof have given way to smaller and smaller nuclear families , the family can no longer serve the same functions it once did in supporting the needs of all segments of the population . Yet traditional Eastern attitudes , morality and values rooted in thousands of years of history are not easy to change , and they have a big effect on how policy toward the elderly is set .  
He reminisces , thinking back to some of the measures that led to Taiwan 's current level of development . All of these policies , whether the all-out effort to develop the local IC industry , the establishment of the " one-stop shopping " science-based industrial parks , the importation of the concept of venture capitalism or the incentives to high-tech investment that the government provided , were hammered out in discussions between government strategists and Chinese who had studied and worked overseas .  
Unfortunately , in modern industrial society , the structure of family life has changed dramatically . One rarely sees the intimacy of the extended family living all together . Instead people are always busy and there is a feeling of distance between them . This situation not only provides grist for countless films and novels , it is a very real reason why growing numbers of young people are turning to sex .  
Such projects included the building of the Shihmen and Tsengwen Reservoirs and the Central Cross-Island Highway . The provincial government implemented compulsory education through grade nine , encouraged development of coastal marshes and hilly districts , rezoned agricultural land , took steps to prevent excessive concentration of urban land ownership , built public housing , and developed industrial parks . All these measures were taken to create the conditions that would enable Taiwan to vault from the category of developing nation into the ranks of the newly industrialized economies .  
After Taiwan 's economic development shifted to industry and commerce and cities were constructed rapidly , problems of water resource management became more complex , demand for water increased , underground water sources were excessively tapped , hillside development was allowed where soil conservation should have been exercised , and industrial pollution increased steadily . The government 's attention to the subject of water resources never kept pace with the rate at which these problems developed .  
But over recent years , in the pursuit of economic growth , Taiwan has heavily exploited its natural resources . For example , coastal land reclamation and the development of new industrial zones have destroyed valuable wetlands , and when the wetlands are lost the birds ' paradise is lost with them .  
But most worrying are the fish farms spread all over Taiwan 's coastal regions . In some places , abalone pools have been dug into the marine erosion terraces , while in others illegal and excessive pumping of groundwater for aquaculture , along with extraction for domestic , industrial and agricultural use , has caused serious land subsidence in areas covering almost 1,000 square kilometers .  
In many of the more remote mountain districts , the population drain has led to Earth Lords being consolidated together for joint worship , while in major industrial areas , and sites where large development projects are in progress , numerous Earth Lords , suddenly deprived of their own hideaways , now have to cram together at a single altar .  
" The Marshall Islands have a severe shortage of water for industrial use , so it is not appropriate to set up fish processing operations there such as canning factories . But their geographical location makes them suitable to be developed as a Pacific base for Taiwan 's fishing industry , if they are amenable to this kind of cooperation , " says Koo Kuan-min .  
" If it had n't been for the Formosa Plastics mercury waste incident in Cambodia , who knows how long the chaos in Taiwan 's management , storage and disposal of hazardous industrial wastes would have continued , along with the tremendous threat it poses to human health and the environment ? " asks Professor Lin Cheng-fang of National Taiwan University 's Graduate Institute of Environmental Engineering , giving FPG some backhanded credit for highlighting the issue .  
Under the ROC 's " Standard Criteria for Identifying Hazardous Industrial Wastes , " hazardous wastes are divided into three major categories . The first comprises specifically listed substances which are generated by industrial processes or are inherently toxic . The second comprises substances defined as hazardous by their characteristics , including those which are corrosive , flammable or infectious ( mostly medical waste ) , or contain individual non-ferrous metals . This includes substances such as powerful oxidants which may cause other materials to ignite .  
She explains : " Kaohsiung 's industrial structure has long stagnated around the petrochemical and steel industries . Not only is output value low , the environmental costs are very high , and it is almost impossible to raise the quality of life for local citizens . " Upgrading the local industrial structure , she believes , requires devoting more attention to technology . Therefore she hired experts in electronic commerce from Taiwan and from abroad and founded her own company , through which she hopes to improve the e-commerce capabilities of Kaohsiung companies .  
The introduction of foreign labor has been a mixed blessing for Taiwanese society . While helping to provide temporary relief for the labor shortage , keeping the island 's products competitive and easing pressure for firms to move offshore , the policy has also had unwelcome side-effects . Foreign labor has been blamed for undermining the local job market , putting a brake on the pace of industrial upgrading and triggering social problems .  
According to art academic Chiang Hsun , Impressionism , from which sorrow and suffering and even seriousness all seem to be absent , was a product of the first generation to enjoy the fruits of urban life following the industrial revolution . The painter Renoir was particularly fond of showing nudes posed amid nature , depicted with caressing strokes of the brush .  
If we compare him to other Nativist writers who address the tragedy of the rural elderly unable to adapt to the modern industrial world , we note that Huang is reluctant to expose his elderly characters to unmitigated suffering .  
Letting Them Go gathers together ten moving short stories which take as their theme the plight of the elderly in rural communities . The stories respond to the changing circumstances in Taiwan 's countryside , such as the departure of young people for the cities and growing industrial pollution . Speaking in this interview , Huang explicitly stated his purpose in this collection : " I want to bear witness to the plight of the senior citizens left behind in rural communities . "  
Hao Tien-hsia 's words seem a little sad , and there is no banquet of life that does n't come to an end with the guests scattering to the four winds . But what 's important is what lasts : Kao Yang still has his annual dinner , and though these old friends rarely meet , the warm feelings are still there . It 's just that , with the Li-Ku dinner on the fourth day of the year finished , in our modern industrial society , it 's time to go back to work .  
In ancient times Dongguan was covered with lichee plantations whose fruit was favored by the imperial consort Yang Guifei . Just a little more than a decade ago Dongguan was still a largely agricultural area , its landscape a patchwork of rice paddies and corn fields . It has since been completely made over into a " boundless industrial park " with an area of 2,520 square kilometers , a population of more than 5 million , and more than 3,000 Taiwan firms .  
When Taiwan was a primarily agricultural , then primarily industrial , society , most men lived off physical labor . Few bothered to worry about their external appearance . Even office workers dressed the same every day for years on end . Of course , rich kids had the ability to dress up , but they were generally seen as playboys or dandies .  
As Kung Peng-cheng sees it , modern Taiwan society is changing even more dramatically than was society in Zhu Xi 's time . It has inherited the problem of ascendant Western culture and declining Eastern culture that arose in the late Qing , and has added to this the disruptions of industrial and commercial development and rapid modernization . Yet , though Chinese have been arguing for a century about how best to cope with such changes , no very concrete systems have taken shape .  
On May 24 , Premier Tang Fei convened the first session of the new cabinet and outlined six major goals for future administration : ensuring national security and improving cross-strait relations ; eliminating " black gold " ( criminal and corrupt influence in politics and big business ) and raising the standard of living ; speeding up reconstruction work in the September 21 earthquake disaster area ; deepening the industrial structure and recreating the economic miracle ; deepening education reform and strengthening culture ; and promoting the reinvention of government and the raising of administrative efficiency .  
" The KMT lost because it was divided and because of the ' black gold ' issue , and not on account of its administrative track record , " says KMT legislator Chen Shei-saint . Viewed alongside the performance of the world 's other perennial ruling parties , the KMT 's record has been pretty good , with brisk economic growth in spite of environmental protests and the difficulties of industrial upgrading .  
But a flip side to economic growth , something the new administration needs to address , is the worsening problem of unemployment . In the first quarter of this year the number of unemployed climbed to 270,000 people , and narrowly-defined unemployment rose to a new high of 2.8% . Under the combined pressures of industrial upgrading , internationalization and liberalization , Taiwan 's economy is still facing a number of difficult challenges .  
After that fiasco , " investment " became a nasty word for many locals , who recoiled from betting on the economy at the very time when the economy entered an industrial boom that would last for decades . As the rest of Taiwan raced ahead , Chishan remained preserved in its rose-tinted memories of banana money . An agricultural adventurer After Ku 's father passed away his dwindling estate was split up between Ku and his siblings , thus splitting the Ku fortune into still smaller shares .  
The MOEA promotes economic diplomacy in coordination with overall foreign policy . Concrete measures include the following : Based on the " Guidelines for Strengthening Economic and Trade Ties with Diplomatic Partner States in Latin America , " businesses are assisted in accessing agricultural or industrial raw materials , cheap labor , or land in Latin America , and are assisted in creating an international division of labor with Latin America and in penetrating North and South American markets .  
A : Of all the wealthy and powerful countries in the world today , there is not one that does not employ overseas investment to maximize the efficiency of factors of production and to develop overseas markets . In so doing , they achieve the dual goals of improving the domestic industrial structure and raising their international economic position .  
The public is very wary of the nuclear plant , however , and environmental groups have been engaged in a raging debate with plant supporters over industrial policy and nuclear safety . There have been numerous street demonstration against the plant , and many members of the Democratic Progressive Party , including former DPP chairman Lin Yi-hsiung , are among the plant 's leading detractors . Opposition to the plant is one of the DPP 's key policy positions .  
In Taiwan , the Ministry of Economic Affairs ' Department of Industrial Technology , whose main mission is to support the development of industrial applications for new technologies , set up a major R &amp; D program at the Industrial Technology Research Institute ( ITRI ) to develop products making practical use of high-temperature superconductors . The island 's leading electrical wiring and cable manufacturers were the industrial partners for technical cooperation under the program .  
On October 14 , the cabinet 's economic task force further announced eight major economic policies . These included eliminating the business tax for financial institutions , instituting a " no tax hike " policy for this presidential term , permitting the appropriate use of foreign labor , establishing a guarantee fund to provide preferential loans , allowing foreign asset management firms to handle bad loans , assisting small and medium firms to upgrade their technology , leasing out government land in industrial zones , and taking active steps to prevent electricity and water supply shortages .  
Women were dependent , the instruments of reproduction . But the industrial revolution changed all that . Women joined the production lines , home appliances reduced the time and energy women had to spend in the home , and liberated women began to enter society . As women have become equals in terms of financial support of the family , society has been transformed , and the forms of the family have become diversified .  
Advantages that were once monopolized by Taiwan and the other Asian dragons , including close economic cooperation with the leading industrial nations , a cheap and productive workforce , and capital reserves built on the back of high savings rates , have gradually been lost to other countries .  
Plans for the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant have triggered an intense struggle between opponents of nuclear power and those more concerned about industrial development . A constitutional ruling by the Council of Grand Justices appears to have moved the debate back to square one , with the ruling and opposition parties slugging it out once again . ( photo by Hsueh Chi-kuang )  
Kuanshan Township is located in Taitung County , in the flat bottom of the East Longitudinal Valley . The Hsinwulu River runs through the township , and there are high mountains to either side . The majority of the residents are involved in farming , in particular growing Kuanshan rice , which is especially tasty because of the pristine local water . Such industrial activity as there is is of a low-polluting kind , allowing Kuanshan to retain its good natural environment .  
Since the beginning of this year the government has held a series of national conferences on economic development , administrative reform , industrial development , and science and technology . It has also adopted a dizzying array of measures designed to stimulate the economy , including plans to spur domestic demand , bolster the property market , create job opportunities , and promote mergers between financial institutions .  
The Council for Economic and Development ( CEPD ) , which is supposed to take overall charge of economic development policy , failed to play its proper coordinating role . The Ministry of Economic Affairs was consumed by the struggle over nuclear power , and failed to pay enough attention to the need to adjust Taiwan 's industrial structure . The Ministry of Finance was busy trying to support share prices on Taiwan 's stock market , but in doing so resorted to measures that violated market principles .  
Alarms are again going off over public safety hazards in Taiwan . The huge fire that burned through the Eastern Science Park , and the explosion at a chemicals plant in Hsinchu , both in mid-May , caused losses in the industrial sector approaching NT $ 10 billion , forcing both the government and the public to realize the urgent need to set up an integrated and comprehensive public safety system .  
" It 's been no easy task searching for a suitable place to live , and we eventually had to make the leap all the way from western Taiwan to Hualien here in the eastern part , " says Chang . They lived in Lukang before , but when that place started to become affected by industrial pollution , they moved to Meilun in Hualien , where they rented a house .  
These jokers just stand out in storms , posing in front of the camera and talking a bunch of unscientific nonsense . " Liu asserts that important industrial facilities throughout Taiwan need trained meteorologists to monitor atmospheric conditions where expensive equipment is installed , otherwise they will be unprepared to take preventive measures before sudden power outages , storms , or floods occur , and they wo n't be able to seek compensation afterward .  
The finance panel witnessed struggles between government officials and the corporate sector . The corporate sector made a number of proposals including cutting the tax for land value-added in half for two years , freezing collection of the stock transaction tax for one year , and giving government an upper debt limit . However , these proposals would have reduced government revenues by NT $ 95 billion per year . These were also resisted by scholars who argued that they would create a " bubble economy , " as well as by industrial elder statesman Wang Yung-ching .  
As Taiwan 's industrial structure undergoes transformation , we see the traditional manufacturing firms migrating offshore in search of cheap labor , materials , and land . Although this has reduced the ROC 's tax revenues , the industries that have stayed behind , forced to reinvent themselves , have adapted with flying colors to the new structure .  
If it is easy to find a free e-paper that is similar , or if the readers do n't really need the content , it is difficult to achieve the level of appeal required to collect fees , " says Hsu . But it can be done . Currently , e-papers at PChome that do the best with subscriber fees are for language learning and industrial reports . The publication with the most subscribers is iThome , a computer report , with about 10,000 .  
Just as the halls of government were reverberating with heated debate about the shortage of water , on May 8 Taiwan Power , as a result of the drought and increasing demand from the rebounding economy , began rationing power without prior warning . This decision has had an impact on more than 2,000 industrial users . Kuo Jan-tai , a civil engineering professor at National Taiwan University , points out that because the water reservoirs in Taiwan are naturally unreliable storehouses of water , dams usually generate only one-tenth of Taiwan 's electricity supply .  
In 1972 , UNESCO , considering the damage that war , natural disasters , and industrial development have been doing to precious cultural and natural assets , adopted the " Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage . " This set out rigorous and comprehensive conditions for determining what places are qualified to be deemed World Heritage sites ; it also encouraged signatories to apply to have the assets within their territories that are " of outstanding universal value " included on the World Heritage list .  
But those workers who have lost their jobs are quite a different group from the workers in such urgent demand in industry . Michael Hsiao pointed out that those who are out of work have lost their jobs because changes in Taiwan 's industrial structure have made their skills obsolete . Continuing the restructuring of local industry is not going to create jobs for this group . Hsiao argued that the government should instead address the unemployment problem through social assistance measures , and the shortage of workers in key industries through economic policy .  
In 1992 , Chiku Township began planning an industrial park in this area . Conservationists fought the initiative and eventually built a national consensus to " set aside a piece of pristine land for the black-faced spoonbills . " The birds ' nesting grounds were thus preserved , and scholars gradually began to get involved in research and conservation .  
The paper says that the unemployment problem results from the industrial transformation process and reform needs time . Meanwhile , unemployed workers are stuck in a trap and require basic assistance . The government has already implemented an advanced national unemployment policy that has turned from the passive stance of giving unemployment assistance to an active stance of providing employment services and professional training , government job creation , and helping workers change occupations .  
In theory , highly educated children with abundant financial resources ought to have more power to fulfill their filial duties , but an industrial and commercial society values material gain and shows little concern about separation . People of higher status often have to invest more and more energy in their careers . " Why is it that the more people study the less filial they seem ? " wonders Chang Meng-jui , a senior reporter at the Min Sheng Daily who is a long-time observer of social phenomena .  
It 's just that in comparison with the enormously powerful TNCs , domestic companies are still the runts of the litter , and only venture into relatively mature directions in their R &amp; D . Because it is impossible to alter this " hand-me-down-ism " in the short run , it is in Taiwan 's interest that foreign R &amp; D pace-setters are here , because future international industrial trends will be clearer , and local R &amp; D centers can avoid unnecessary detours .  
But the downside of having conquered these illnesses is that the number of patients is constantly falling , so most young doctors prefer to specialize in growth fields like illnesses of advanced industrial societies or problems of the elderly . Virology , bacteriology , and epidemiology are considered " sunset subjects . " The result is that there has been no one to take the baton from the previous generation , and gatherings of specialists in these fields can be mistaken for meetings of a senior citizens group .  
A new policy of " industrial Taiwan , agricultural Southeast Asia " was crafted , and Japan began to actively promote industrial development in Taiwan with an eye to making the island self-sufficient in the event of war in the Pacific . The Japanese contribution to development can be seen in three areas . In terms of basic industry , the " new city " of Kaohsiung , which the colonial authorities began building in 1904 , became the main base for moving farther into Southeast Asia .  
From his welcoming of the Japanese into Taipei in 1895 to his contributions to the Japanese colonial government and to stabilizing social order , he continually maintained good relations with the colonial regime , in return for which he received monopoly privileges for camphor , edible salt , and opium . In addition , the Koos proved bold and adept at grasping trends , making investments , and diversifying their business interests , so that today , they are the only family of these original five to remain influential in industrial and commercial circles in Taiwan .  
Although the rapid expansion of senior technical and vocational education has been able to meet student demand for degrees , another problem has arisen . With the rapid transformation of Taiwan 's industrial structure , there has been an increase in demand for individuals with specific skills . Vocational education now faces the problem of providing people with skills for which there is insufficient market demand . Supply and demand imbalance  
Sun Yung-ching observes that " in industrial education , time is money . " The central reason why technical and vocational students are unable to meet the demands of industry is that the equipment they need to train on is too expensive . Schools are unable to meet the financial burden of constantly upgrading facilities and industry is unwilling to receive students for training in their plants , on the one hand because of the possible impact on output , but also out of genuine concern that students could damage precision machinery .  
As human civilization has moved into the information age , factories , which had been designed with large-scale machinery in mind , have begun to shrink . Moreover , traditional factories , which used to be located in city centers , have been forced to move because of the pollution they cause or because the real estate value of land has come to outstrip its industrial value . This process has naturally left behind some major " industrial relics . "  
In the mid-1990 ' s , Taiwan 's IT industry began to take off , and every major company was fighting for the ever-decreasing , prime property at Hsinchu , making it nigh-on impossible to secure a spot there . Then , in July 1996 , after considering the levels of industrial development in the north and the south of Taiwan , the government began formulating a plan for a " Southern Taiwan Science Park " .  
The dominant influence of NTU-known as Taida to Taiwanese-in political circles can be seen in the fact that the " Taida Gang " accounts for more than 40 legislators , including members of both the governing and opposition parties . And the glory of Taida has not been limited to politics . As Taiwan has made the transition from agricultural to industrial to high-tech society , many NTU alums have from scratch developed chip processing , IC design , and the largest notebook computer factory in the world , similarly producing a brilliant record .  
Eric Lin / tr . by Phil Newell We may only have just opened chapter one of the 21st century , but already the twists and turns in the world are coming so fast that it makes your head spin . Taiwanese have always prided themselves on their adaptability and nose for the latest in global trends , but in an age in which even industrial technology comes and goes in the blink of an eye , even the most agile individual is likely to find him - or herself buffeted by time 's waves into unforeseen directions .  
Originally employed as a machinist , Grandfather Chen lost his job a few years ago as a result of the general industrial upgrading , which led to the closure of his factory . In recent years he has taken a succession of odd jobs to make ends meet . Currently he is unemployed and stays at home taking care of the children . Grandmother Chen , meanwhile , has been operated on for breast cancer and is in poor health .  
A : The cross-strait industrial relationship has been complementary for the past 20 years , but now economic development in the mainland is gradually bringing us into competition with one another . This is true of our ports , as well . Once completed , the mainland 's southeast coastal ports will represent a real challenge to their counterparts in Taiwan .  
Though going through the worst wave of overseas relocations by local industry in history and facing increasingly bitter competition in industrial development , this year , thanks to a turn for the better in the international economy , Taiwan 's economic performance has stabilized .  
It took the US and Europe some two to three hundred years to make the transition from preindustrial to industrial society , and this transition extended into the mid-20th century . It was during this period that the concept of retirement was born as circumstances changed . Concerned about productive forces , capitalists took into consideration the relative physical and technological backwardness of middle-aged and older workers and began to draw up retirement systems .  
head of the chinese delegation told xinhua that " the exhibition is a window aiming at promoting the mutual understanding between china and indonesia , increasing the exchange between scientific and technological as well as industrial circles of our two countries , and seeking channels of cooperation to achieve common development "  
according to experts , the satellite launched today is expected to fly in space for half a month in addition to scientific surveys , it also carries technical experimental devices for plant and animal micro cells and industrial micro gravity  
China 's abundant resources , cheap labor , sound industrial and technological foundation , advancing legal system , and the rapidly growing economy , make itself an ideal investment spot , and a broad market for the Belgian enterprises , the Vice Premier pointed out  
The Vice Premier noted that China and Nepal , as two developing nations , are economically complementary He hoped industrial and commercial circles of the two countries could work out more projects with less investment and quick results to benefit the peoples , and enhance a steady development of bilateral trade and economic cooperation  
the emphasis of the government in the development front is to build a stable , sustainable and prosperous economy where trade will be promoted , a vigorous industrial policy pursued and agriculture salvaged , she noted at her first meeting with journalists after assuming duties as prime minister today  
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 50-44 at 10,887-39 The index fell 16-52 points Tuesday , recovering from a 112 point drop that was triggered by the Federal 's warning of possible rise in interest rates in the coming months if necessary while leaving rates unchanged at present  
To meet the urgent need for increasing human capital and skills , developing countries have continued to allocate to educational services a higher proportion of central government expenditure than have industrial countries .  
To these we must add size and strategic location , economic power - both present and potential - pace of industrial growth and technological progress as well as human and natural resources .  
Growing environmental awareness worldwide has stimulated the development of a complex range of regulations and institutional mechanisms aimed at controlling the adverse environmental effects of industrial and agricultural production .  
Liquid wastes from urban and industrial pollution sources represent about 20 to 40 per cent of total liquid waste generation , but are the major sources of organic pollutants , heavy metals and hazardous toxic chemicals .  
As emphasized particularly by industrial organization explanations of FDI , TNCs generally enjoy specific competitive advantages based on their superior proprietary technological and organizational capacities .  
UNCED further emphasized that gross chemical contamination , with grave damage to human health , genetic structures , reproductive outcomes , and the environment , continues to exist in some of the world 's most important industrial areas .  
The foregoing review has demonstrated the vital importance of groundwater whether confined or not , as a source of fresh water for both human consumption and for industrial and agricultural use .  
In the medium term , this decline in the construction sector can be expected to be reversed given the potential for industrial restructuring , the need for extensive infrastructure investment , and the social pressures for a renewal of the housing stock .  
The globalization of industrial production is likely to proceed at rapid pace and innovative responses will be required to counter growing unemployment and associated social unrest in both industrial and developing countries .  
Those forces conducting port operations continued building a sustainment base , and the multinational force established a complete headquarters for the Joint Task Force commander in the PortauPrince industrial complex .  
Reforms this year included a substantial cut in corporate taxes , sharp reduction in import tariffs on capital goods and industrial inputs , financial sector liberalization and full currency convertibility on the current account .  
The probability of sustained current recovery in the industrial countries would be greatly enhanced if the international community could take credible actions to realize the tremendous growth potential of developing countries .  
They must also adapt to a new form of " upstream " industrial competition determined by specialized skills , quality products , clean technologies , compliance with demanding standards and major investments in research and development .  
Small size also means that our entire society , not just areas of it , is equally vulnerable to dislocations of the global economic system , including currency and commodity price fluctuations , new international trading arrangements , and the changing fortunes of the major industrial economies .  
We have accumulated considerable scientific , technological and industrial potential in developing detection and de-mining equipment which allows us to take part in international programmes for the development and manufacture of promising equipment and technologies in this field .  
Developing industrial and non-industrial planted forests in order to support and promote national ecologically sound afforestation and reforestation / regeneration programmes in suitable sites , including upgrading of existing planted forests of both industrial and non-industrial and commercial purpose to increase their contribution to human needs and to offset pressure on primary / old-growth forests .  
African countries , in particular , required more imaginative long-term solutions to overcome their competitive disadvantage deriving from dependency on primary exports , a weak industrial and export base and technological backwardness .  
The Protocol was a complex and detailed document which empowered the Palestinian authority in a range of fields : imports and customs ; monetary and financial issues , including taxation ; labour mobility and social insurance ; the free movement of agricultural and industrial goods between the two sides ; insurance issues ; and tourism .  
In August 1993 , IMF wrote to ministers of finance , central bank governors and heads of national statistical offices in a number of industrial and developing countries to seek their comments on the terms of reference of the Task Force ; on the role of international organizations in developing standards for finance statistics ; on current arrangements for data collection and sharing ; and on the findings of the questionnaire .  
The Task Force has reviewed current arrangements for the reporting and sharing of finance statistics by international organizations , and notes that there appears to be a considerable and probably increasing degree of data sharing of finance statistics among international organizations , especially through the use of electronic media , which have replaced the use of report forms in the industrial and major developing countries .  
The procedure includes a series of visits by IMF staff to the main international organizations concerned and to official agencies in a number of selected industrial and developing countries , as well as the distribution of an annotated outline of the manual to all member countries for comment .  
China , as a State party and particularly as a developing country with a considerable nuclear industrial capability , strictly abided by the relevant provisions of the NPT to ensure the exclusive use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and had engaged in cooperation with other developing countries in that field , which would increase as his country continued its economic reform and development . 
Conduct educational campaigns to encourage women to use their purchasing power as consumers to promote the production of environmentally safe products and encourage them to invest in environmentally sound and productive agricultural , commercial and industrial activities .  Strategic objective K . 3 .  Establish mechanisms at the national ,  
Hundreds of settlements have been set on fire and destroyed ; government institutions , agricultural facilities and industrial enterprises , medical and consumer services , educational establishments , transport , power and water supply infrastructure and other important amenities have been plundered ; and the communications of the Azerbaijani State have been disrupted .  
A meeting in 1994 of biotechnology managers from more than 40 developing countries , mostly members of the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology ( ICGEB ) , to explore emerging biotechnologies and industrial opportunities revealed that the understanding and appreciation of local entrepreneurs with regard to the economic potential of the biotechnology industry are still very low .  
Programmes dealing with biosafety have expanded beyond the scientific sector to include the concerns of workers exposed to biological agents in the workplace ( ILO ) , farmers ( FAO ) and the general public , while programmes on marine agricultural and industrial biotechnology call for closer cooperation among FAO , ILO , the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) , UNEP , UNIDO , WHO and the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) .  
Bioremediation of polluted groundwater , technologies for containing pollution , biological methods of treating pollution in the unsaturated zone above groundwaters contaminated by past industrial and military activities , and the treatment of extracted contaminated soil are among the topics of the regional ECE Seminar on the Prevention and Control of Groundwater Pollution to be held in September 1995 .  
The Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes ( Helsinki , 1992 ) contains binding obligations to parties to apply best available technologies for the treatment of industrial waste water containing hazardous substances , to apply at least biological treatment or equivalent processes for treating municipal waste water , and to carry out research on the development of new technologies and environmentally sound disposal practices .  
The major areas identified in the Plan are human rights and the promotion of equality ; employment promotion including improving the situation of women in the labour market , women workers in the formal and informal sectors ; training ; working conditions and environment ; social security ; labour legislation , labour relations , labour administration , workers ' and employers ' activities ; women in specific industrial sectors ; and in the different regions .  
As far as production is concerned , the use of input and materials ( intense or otherwise ) and the adoption of technologies ( i.e . , whether they are environmentally sound or not ) may well determine both the level of industrial waste generation and the chemical and physical properties of products , with implications for the use and disposal stages .  
In particular , the more economically advanced developing countries are in a position to transfer to other developing countries the skills and experience , including new and innovative techniques of industrial organization and production and the creative application of technology , that have proved so successful in increasing the productivity and competitiveness of their own economies .  
TACF provides assistance and training to developing countries in the use of nuclear technology for power generation , and for scientific , resource , agricultural , medical , environmental and industrial applications , as well as for activities relating to radiation protection , safety of nuclear installations and waste management .  
Apart from the moderating effect of the unsynchronized pattern of the recession in the major industrial countries , the region 's ability to withstand the adverse impact of the recession can be attributed to the growing strength of domestic markets , intraregional trade and investment links , and the competitiveness of exports from the region , which are now well diversified into a variety of manufactures . 
Within the project on " Coastal Marine Pollution Monitoring and Training : Asia Pacific Mussel Watch " , UNU is seeking to analyse and monitor key hazardous chemicals and substances in the coastal marine areas of the Asia-Pacific region , including relative levels of important agricultural and industrial halogenated hydrocarbons in the eastern Pacific .  
Sixteen recurrent publications .  ( i ) Air pollution ( 2 ) ; ( ii ) national environmental performance reviews ( 6 ) ; ( iii ) environmental series ( 2 ) ; ( iv ) water series ( 2 ) ; and ( v ) revisions to the industrial accidents manual ( 4 ) ;  
Efforts will also be directed to incorporating the secretariat into a regional network linking the main national research centres on industrial restructuring and competitiveness to conduct comparative and overall analyses on the experiences in designing industrial and technological development strategies .  
Article 1 ( c ) of the ECE Convention on the Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents refers to the adverse consequences of industrial accidents on " ( i ) human beings , flora and fauna ; ( ii ) soil , water , air and landscape ; ( iii ) the interaction between the factors in ( i ) and ( ii ) ; material assets and cultural heritage , including historical monuments " .  
Services on economic reforms in the least developed countries ; economic and financial management in Pacific island developing countries ; demographic issues in the Pacific island developing countries ; institutional capability-building , including private sector development for the promotion of industrial investment and technology transfer ; and promotion of sustainable development in small island developing States ; ( b ) Group training , including seminars and workshops .  
In addition , small and medium-sized enterprises require sectoral policies , networking and basic technical support , while the capacity for developing human resources must be built up so that emerging industries in the occupied territories can respond effectively to the new industrial development challenges .  
The SPF secretariat encourages enterprise sector participation in regional industrial development activities through various measures such as ongoing regular and consultation visits to public and private enterprises , liaison with national chambers of commerce and industry , training seminars and workshops , and provision of technical assistance facilities ( a marketing support fund scheme was set up to provide assistance to new exporters , for example ) .  
Most ECDC / TCDC promotional and supportive programmes / activities involve twinning of industrial research institutions ; identification and strengthening of centres of excellence in developing countries to provide industrial training and expert advice ; promotion of joint research and development programmes and linking of chambers of commerce and industry , industrial associations and other relevant institutions in various developing countries .  
Within the framework of ECLAC / UNDP regional project RLA / 88 / 039 , entitled " Design of policies to strengthen the capacity for technological innovation and enhance international competitiveness in the Latin American entrepreneurial environment " , ECLAC and SELA officials held meetings to analyse the possibilities for cooperation in identifying and describing the current status of industrial policy in various countries in the region .  
An effective government planning mechanism is essential if necessary social investment - especially for human-resource development - is to be well designed , and is even more essential for efficient government guidance of the investment process in those countries that choose to have activist industrial , agricultural or other sectoral policies .  
NULLThe UNEP programme dedicated to the Awareness and Preparedness for Emergencies at the Local Level ( APELL ) has been instrumental in translating the broad need for warnings into a process for developing awareness of potential technological hazards and providing effective community collaboration for responding to industrial accidents .  
Starting as a small programme implemented jointly with UNEP to assist countries to implement the prior informed consent ( PIC ) procedure for chemicals in international trade , these programmes now increasingly address a wider spectrum of chemicals management topics , relevant to sound industrial development at both national and regional levels .  
" A technical consultation on sustainable fisheries development in the area of the FAO Western Central Atlantic Fishery Commission ( WECAFC ) , held at Caraballada , Venezuela , from 18 to 22 October 1993 , agreed that the conflict between industrial and artisanal fisheries continued to be a problem in the region , given the difficulties of coming up with equitable solutions .  
Among the key issues which should be addressed were poverty eradication , global macroeconomic policy coordination , industrial development , economic diversification and the development of infrastructures , improved resource flows , including debt relief ; commodities policy ; human resource development and capacity-building .  
In the Cairo Agenda for Action adopted by the OAU Council of Ministers at its seventeenth extraordinary session , held at Cairo in March 1995 , which concerned " Relaunching African economic and social development " , industrial development was highlighted as being central to structural change and to transformation of African economies .  
The main focus of the country programmes , as determined during the missions , will be on the strategic management of industrial development , human resources development , quality control and standardization , the environment , private sector development , with emphasis on small and medium industries , and the implications of the Uruguay Round agreements for the industrialization of Africa .  
The field of basic industries requires massive capital outlay and larger markets beyond the capacity of individual African countries and can therefore be optimally established through subregional and regional cooperation arrangements of multinational / transnational industrial enterprises .  
It was necessary to acknowledge once and for all that atomic radiation was capable of causing considerable damage , but such damage could take on catastrophic proportions in small States and manifest itself in heavy loss of human life and industrial and economic collapse .  
The wireless office for travelling professionals and mobile workers of all kinds seemed to be an almost inevitable trend , as the global economy increasingly shifted from agricultural and industrial employment to service-based employment dependent upon information and data rather than physical resources and specific locations .  
Mr . RUDENSKY ( Russian Federation ) said that the problem of human settlements , which encompassed social , economic , industrial , technological , administrative and environmental aspects , had taken on a global dimension .  
Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;  
With regard to the subprogrammes on food and agriculture , economic and social planning , industrial , scientific and technological development , international trade and development finance , natural resources and energy , and social development , it would be misleading to state that any of them duplicated work done by other bodies and that ECLAC should not be involved in such activities .

Above and beyond the creation of a dense industrial network , the direct involvement of the State in economic management has made it possible for us to take on the considerable and manifold needs of a population deprived of essentials in the areas of education , health , jobs and housing and to set up an infrastructure even in the remotest corners of our vast territory .  
Today in my country , reform of the public administration system is being carried out in the following ways : the adoption of economic means of stimulating production and business activities ; the restructuring of the national economic sector , with emphasis on leading edge and high technology sectors ; reform of the banking sector ; the creation of conditions for stimulating long-term capital investment and for attracting direct foreign investment to modernize industrial enterprises and to create competitive new market structures ; reform of the system of social protection for citizens ; and so on .  
The immediate consequences of this were the destruction of approximately one seventh of the population , the majority of whom were in the productive labour force ; the destruction of infrastructure and equipment , both public and private ; the collapse of institutions , including the civil service , judiciary and local administration , to mention but a few ; a severe setback in economic activity , particularly agriculture and industrial activities ; the exodus of between 1-million and 2-million people to neighbouring countries as refugees ;  
In contrast with Europe , the absence of a middle class able to launch the process of economic and social development , the weakness of the industrial fabric , the well-known inadequacy of public facilities and national structure were , at the time of independence , major challenges to be met .  Hence the need for State intervention , including through protectionism , to modify the nature of comparative advantages .  
We also support the decisions of the latest summit meeting of the Group of Seven industrial Powers aimed at fighting terrorism and punishing its perpetrators , as terrorism has become a dangerous international phenomenon that has taken the lives of many innocent people , destroyed the infrastructure of many countries , disrupted tourism and the free movement of innocent people and defamed national liberation and independence movements .  
ECLAC has rendered valuable service through subprogrammes on economic development , social development , international trade , development financing and transport , industrial , agricultural , and technological modernization , environment , natural resources and human settlements , statistics and economic projections , the integration of women into development , regional integration and cooperation , economic and social planning and population .  
The full economic and social utilization of those resources for the benefit of the peoples , to uplift them and create and maintain a better way of life , has been retarded by the severe impact of external debt and , concomitantly , debt-servicing costs , declining levels of official development assistance , reduced financial flows for investment and for industrial , business and commercial development , increasing barriers to trade and impaired access to the markets of the developed countries of the world .  
The objectives of the Community , as defined in the Treaty of Chaguaramas inter alia , economic cooperation through the Caribbean Common Market ; coordinated foreign policies ; and creating joint services in such essential sectors as health , education , culture , communications and industrial relations have been methodically pursued through the establishment of appropriate Community structures by its member States . 
For example , even though calls for the promotion of the private sector , increased industrial development and foreign direct investment , and the reduction of external debt in African countries are regularly made in various forums , harsh marketplace reality shows that portfolio equity investment remains virtually absent , and that less than 5 per cent of global foreign direct investment is targeted to African countries .  
Even though it is important to reaffirm a strong commitment of the private sector , donor Governments , agencies and non-governmental organizations to genuine partnership for the accelerated industrial growth of Africa , a critical step must be made to design policies based on the real needs of individual African economies , as development will take place in Africa only when its peoples have democratic control over their own policies .  
The Republic of Belarus deeply appreciates the efforts made by all the programmes , funds and specialized agencies of the United Nations system towards providing increased , speedier and better quality assistance to the various countries and regions suffering from armed conflicts , natural disasters , industrial ecological catastrophes and other emergency circumstances .  
Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;  
A number of other actions can be noted , such as the 1993-1994 ban on the dumping of radioactive waste , sewage sludge and industrial waste and on incineration of toxic wastes at sea , as agreed in the 1972 Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter ( London Convention ) ; ( c ) In relation to programme areas C and D , the legal framework for sustainable use and conservation of living aquatic resources in the oceans has been substantially improved since UNCED .  
The raising costs of urban land and other factors prevent the poor and other vulnerable and disadvantaged groups from gaining access to suitable land , whose location does not pose economic , environmental or health risks to the residents because of its proximity to industrial facilities or susceptibility to natural disasters .  
Because industrial and agricultural activities on the Earth 's environment have reached such a level that their effects are clearly observed on a global scale , continuous and sustainable development action and policies should be carried out for the protection and maintenance of Earth 's natural environment .  
States should develop , as a matter of priority , national environmental programmes to address the protection of the atmosphere , including major local environmental air quality issues such as urban pollution emissions from industrial complexes and accidental release of hazardous material into the atmosphere .  
The scope and scale of the role of forests in providing diverse socio-economic , environmental , industrial and cultural benefits at local , national , regional as well as global levels are now better recognized , and involve many international and regional institutions and instruments .  
The plan has received strong interest from numerous major industrial corporations , national Governments , environmental groups and international agencies .  
Extended producer responsibility ( EPR ) represents one of the most innovative approaches to tackling the problems of rising industrial and household waste volumes ( which may be either physically or politically hard to dispose of ) , rising costs of disposal and human health and environmental concerns relating to the spread of toxic and hazardous substances as a result of dissipative uses of products or inadequate waste management practices .  
The aforementioned 1972 London Dumping Convention for the prevention of marine pollution by waste dumping has been significantly strengthened by amendments in 1993 banning the dumping of radioactive , industrial and incineration wastes ; a new protocol under discussion would ban all marine disposal except in specific cases that could be shown to have no adverse environmental impacts .  
The multidisciplinary mission team consisted of 10 members and included a development economist , a mineral resources expert , an industrial economist , an environmental lawyer , a sustainable agriculture analyst , a fisheries adviser , a natural resources adviser , an institutional adviser , an education adviser and a people 's participation adviser .  
Government and local business representatives should be encouraged to participate in national and international industry and technical groups as a means of facilitating technology transfer , gaining market intelligence , raising and keeping apprised of industry-wide issues and concerns and as a means of formulating long-term relationships with other industrial , government and financial leaders .  Local and national Chambers of Mines should be fully activated and supported in order to act as an effective vehicle for handling industry-wide concerns and effectively working with the appropriate governmental bodies .  
That has required close coordination of macroeconomic policies among major industrial countries to prevent the harmful effects on national economies of any adverse market reactions to actual or perceived changes in national economic situations and associated policies . 
First world environmental standards are becoming increasingly stringent and have moved from regulating obvious pollutants such as sulphur dioxide ( SO2 ) , to controlling , for example , the quality and quantity of industrial wastes , the transboundary shipment of hazardous wastes , acid mine drainage , and heavy metals releases .  
It also asked Governments and agencies of the United Nations system to promote programmes for guiding management and corrective actions to control pollution in the larger coastal urban settlements , specifically in the treatment of sewage and waste disposal , both domestic and industrial , as well as to control pollution in river systems caused by mining industries .  
Constraints to social and economical development strategies will appear and will have to be reckoned with in national planning , possibly imposing unforeseen and unwanted limitations on economic development , self-reliance in food , health , industrial development etc . 
Technical advisory services were provided by the Group on a variety of development issues , covering such areas as : inland water transport ; subregional cooperation for lake basin development ; implementation of the African Platform for Action on Women ; formulation of development priorities , programmes and projects ; economic cooperation and integration ; human resources development and utilization , and energy development ; criminal justice and crime prevention ; mineral resources and development ; agricultural development ; rural development ; industrial development ; and science and technology development . 
Regional development and global changes included published studies on the impact of the single European market on ESCWA countries ; privatization in the Gulf countries and in Arab countries with more diversified economies ; and on industrial strategies in the ESCWA region within a changing international and regional environment .  
In urban areas , it is the poor who most often are forced to live in dense squatter settlements characterized by unsanitary conditions , or near hazardous industrial plants .  
With regard to technical assistance , ESCAP has focused on strengthening national management capacities in developing the financial , industrial , infrastructural , trading and other institutional framework required in managing transition to a market economy .  
INFOTERRA , the Global Environmental Information Exchange Network , is operating through 171 government-designated national focal points ; a network of 8,000 sources of information , including national and international institutions , non-governmental organizations , industrial and commercial enterprises , academic institutions and experts ; 34 special sectoral sources , and 10 regional service centres .  
Impediments to training programmes abroad , which are of the highest importance in replacing expatriate personnel with local technical personnel trained in operating and managing high-technology production units ; this means depriving Libyan experts of the possibility of learning the advanced techniques required to follow the technological changes in the industrial sector of the industrialized countries ;  
Investment lending covers a considerable range of sectors ( industrial restructuring , energy and environment , roads and urban transport and the social sectors ) and aims at supporting private sector development via projects that can help remove bottlenecks , and at improving the efficiency of public sector investments .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 49 / 108 on industrial development cooperation , inter alia , stressed the importance of industrialization to the economic and social development of developing countries ; emphasized the importance of industrial development cooperation ; reaffirmed the central coordinating role played by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) in the United Nations system in the field of industrial development in the developing countries ; and welcomed the process of reform and restructuring of UNIDO .  
In their aspirations to raise standards of living , the developing countries are following the example of the already industrialized countries , and by seeking to build up efficient industrial capacities have chosen the only viable route to achieve lasting economic growth and escape the vicious circle of poverty .  
Since the adoption by the General Assembly of its resolution 49 / 108 , UNIDO has advanced a major process of programmatic and managerial reform , responding to changed industrial realities and support requirements both by a substantive reformulation of its priorities and focus and by internal reforms in management and organizational structure with a view to increasing effectiveness , efficiency and impact .  
The strategic reform of UNIDO , endorsed by member States at the General Conference of UNIDO in December 1995 , has emphasized UNIDO 's dual role as a worldwide forum for supporting and promoting industrial development , and a provider of specialized integrated technical cooperation services .  
In spite of the difficult world economic climate , Tunisia has also managed to achieve encouraging results , illustrated in a rate of growth in national product averaging 4.8 per cent over the last four years ; an increase in non-agricultural industrial exports at an annual rate of 13 per cent ; and an improvement in employment potential , with demand for employment fully absorbed for the first time ; while at the same time the country 's financial equilibrium has been preserved and its external debt brought under control .  
In accordance with article 1 of the Code , these include industrial , trade and agricultural establishments and their dependencies , of whatever nature , whether public or private , religious or secular , even if they are of a professional or charitable nature ; liberal professions , craft establishments , cooperatives , civil law partnerships , unions , associations and groupings of any kind .  
These committees , which operate as special committees of the works councils , are tripartite in structure : in addition to the representatives of management and staff , their members include health and safety officials , i.e . the in-house doctor , the regional health and safety information officer , the head of security and , where applicable , the establishment 's social assistant ; not to mention experts on prevention of industrial accidents and occupational diseases , whom the committee can consult at any time .  
These programmes have been accompanied by specific measures of equal importance dealing with social security , including in particular the reform of the industrial accident and occupational disease scheme , which has produced substantial improvements both in the extent of the cover and benefits , especially those paid to widows and orphans , and in the improvements made in the social security system in the agricultural sector . 
Cancelled : ( ii ) role and implications of macroeconomic policies for promotion of regional economic cooperation ; ( viii ) one issue on new and innovative ways to develop and strengthen industrial and technological skills : and ( x ) one issue on technology indicators and directories of selected research and development institutions , experts and technologies .  
They agreed that the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries should jointly sponsor draft resolutions to be presented by the Group of 77 at the fifty-first session of the General Assembly on the following agenda items : trade and development , cooperation for industrial development , environment and sustainable development , human settlements , population and development , external debt crisis and development , food and sustainable agricultural development , an Agenda for Development and renewal of the dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development through partnership .  
In 1995-1996 , the United Nations Industrial Development Organization 's ( UNIDO ) technical cooperation programmes with the front-line States focused on , inter alia , the following : developing support strategies and formulating policies for accelerated industrial development ; providing support for developing existing industries and industrial infrastructures ; private sector development with emphasis on strengthening private sector institutions ; small and medium enterprises development ; and industrial information investment and technology promotion .  
Recognize that increased use of solar energy can reduce environmental degradation caused by adverse human activities , such as industrial pollution and deforestation , and that it is the responsibility of Governments and all sectors of civil society to work together to find lasting solutions to problems threatening the sustainable development of humanity ;  
Mr . CHUNG ( Republic of Korea ) said that industrialization played a vital role as a catalyst for economic and social progress and that international cooperation had a role to play in industrial development , although the process increasingly was being driven by the laws of the market and by the private sector .  
In order to assist , in particular , small and medium enterprises which had neither the resources nor the expertise required to reduce environmental pollution , strong support should be extended to the concept of environmentally sustainable industrial development and the Area-Wide Environmental Quality Management Plan developed by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) .  
UNIDO played an active role in the implementation of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer , was an authority on environmentally sound industrial development and promoted direct contacts between government officials and representatives of the private sector on a global level .  
For example , in trade policy , when a low uniform tariff rate is applied to all products , any extra amount spent on luxury goods deprives the industrial sector of scarce foreign exchange .  
Subsequently , as the industrial base of the country in the industry concerned is developed and capabilities are acquired , the domestic sector may be exposed to import competition through gradual trade liberalization .  
Natural resource endowments , the level of development of the industrial base and of the physical and communications network , the size of the domestic market and the degree of integration of the domestic economy , the technological capacity and availability of adequate human capital in terms of skills , and the proximity to major production and consumption poles are elements in which developing countries also exhibit differences among themselves .  
Consequently , their main concerns are quite different from those of other developing countries which have already developed some industrial base but which need to improve their productivity and efficiency in order to penetrate international markets or of those developing countries which have developed competitive enterprises and significant export capacity , such as the newly industrializing countries ( NICs ) and a number of second-tier NICs , but which need to sustain their export capabilities by a process of continuous upgrading and productivity improvement .  
The task of regulating the potentially detrimental external effects of intensive industrial activities not prohibited by international law and finding a balance between the profits derived from such activities and the burden caused to third parties could be achieved in various ways , such as through the polluter-pays principle , which was not applicable in all cases , or through a regime of civil or State liability or through a combination of both .  
The issue involved mainly activities typical of modern industrial societies , such as those connected with nuclear power plants , the chemical and space industries and maritime transport of petroleum and other dangerous or polluting substances , which certainly had undeniable political and economic value , but also posed a considerable risk for the safety of human beings and protection of the environment .  
In considering applications on a case-by-case basis , the Committee viewed as inappropriate requests to supply industrial equipment and raw materials , as well as horticultural produce , except fruits and vegetables , to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , unless such applications contained , in every case , specific explanations of how the commodities and products in question were intended to meet essential humanitarian needs ( see press release SC / 6118 ) .  
Yet , foreign direct investment was urgently required in Africa and in the least developed countries for the rejuvenation of the industrial and agricultural sectors and for the effective implementation of structural adjustment programmes .  
The end of the recession in the industrial countries had favourably influenced exports from the region , which had also received a considerable inflow of foreign direct investment and other external financial flows , although these had remained concentrated in a few countries .  
A solid scientific , technological and industrial capability accumulated in developing detection and mine-clearing equipment allows us to participate in promising international programmes in the field .  
A dramatic deterioration of the social and industrial infrastructure and a sharp decline in the provision of social , health and education services , lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes , and a sharp drop in the real income of most families have combined to render large sectors of the population in Tajikistan unable to meet even their basic food needs .  
Emphasis is being given to improving the location of housing , services and employment to reduce transportation needs ; strengthening sanitary measures to reduce the environmental impacts of industrial development , fostering the use of local technologies and materials in construction ; planning and managing incremental housing programmes which minimize consumption of materials and energy ; halting the deterioration of existing housing stock ; and initiating its gradual rehabilitation .  
Implementing measures for the safe and appropriate return of the refugees , their active involvement in the social , political and economic life of the country and the provision of assistance in reconstruction of the housing and industrial and agricultural facilities destroyed by the war ;  
Of the listed persistent organic pollutant ( POP ) pesticides and industrial chemicals that are or have been intentionally produced , other than for the small number of remaining recognized uses , these POPs pose unreasonable and otherwise unmanageable risks to human health and the environment such that :  
That desire becomes even more urgent given that the boundless mind of man has produced numerous miraculous inventions , opening up a new era called the post-industrial era or the information age , while more than a quarter of the developing world 's population still lives in poverty , some 840-million go hungry or face food insecurity , and even in industrial countries more than 100-million people live below the poverty line and 37-million are jobless . 
In view of the special features of biological weapons and the complicated technical factors involved , efforts should be made to realistically formulate relevant definitions , criteria and lists ; clearly delineate activities prohibited and permitted under the Convention ; and , on this basis , explore effective and feasible verification measures , together with measures aimed at preventing abuse , protecting commercial secrets and reducing unnecessary interference in normal scientific research and industrial activities .  
When people talk of the increasing intangibility of the economy , they are speaking about developments in industrial production such as the rapid development of microprocessors for information-related products ; transactions such as communication over the Internet ; productive assets , such as software and research ; and commercial assets , such as patents , goodwill , corporate organization and skilled staff .  
In 25 years , the population debate has evolved dramatically from a narrow focus on population size and growth rates to a more integrated agenda embracing demographic structures , distribution patterns and urbanization , levels of exploitation of natural resources , and creation of viable agricultural and industrial infrastructures .  
Space telecommunications , which are the primary field of commercial applications of space , involve major economic , political , cultural , strategic and industrial stakes .  
Fourthly , FDI inflows should continue to be promoted by the per capita incomes in developing countries of the region , which are rising at higher rates than in the rest of the developing world , and increasing competition in the industrial as well as the developing countries and the resultant pressures on their transnational firms to locate abroad in search of reduced production cost and the strong likelihood of further liberalization of trade and investment policies in developing countries of the region . 
In her statement , the Chairperson-Rapporteur , Ms . Erica-Irene Daes , outlined four major concerns : ( a ) the need for a recognition of the effects of dispossession of lands and habitat on the health of indigenous peoples ; ( b ) the exposure of indigenous peoples to hazardous industrial and military activities ; ( c ) the need to improve access to national health-care systems ; ( d ) the role traditional medical practices could play in national primary health-care systems and the protection of those practices .  
Serve as a mobilizer of ideas and a catalyst for action to promote regional economic cooperation by identifying and addressing major development issues and regional concerns and priorities in trade , investment , financial , information technology , industrial and technological areas , and recommend policy options and measures to achieve tangible results and enhance national capacities to meet new challenges .  
Decide to work towards evolving principles based on sound management of hazardous wastes so as to develop national policies to phase out toxic agricultural and industrial chemicals and trade in hazardous waste ;  
Some progress has been made by the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) since 1995 with regard to drafting essential legal instruments governing economic activity in areas such as private investment , enterprise activity , banking , public finance , industrial zones , standards and safety , civil service and intellectual property .  
Operationally , the UNIDO work programmes were based on the following thematic priorities : formulation of strategies and institution-building for global economic integration ; innovation , productivity and quality to increase competitiveness ; industrial information , investment and technology promotion ; human resource development with special attention to the integration of women in industrial development ; rural industrial development ; and industry-related environment and energy issues .  
The motor of that process was the promotion of an enabling environment that would ensure increased access for the poor to economic services and industrial goods , given that the great majority of poor people in rural areas were self-employed and that their prosperity depended on their having direct access to more and improved means of production .  
Kenya appreciated the role of UNIDO in industrial development cooperation and concurred with the Secretary-General that developing countries increasingly required the policy advisory and capacity-building services of UNIDO in support of their endeavours to create an enabling environment for sustainable industrial growth and international competitiveness .  
In line with the objectives of the Second Industrial Development Decade for Africa , the international community and the United Nations system must strengthen industrial development cooperation for African industrialization in the areas of industrial policy , investment , transfer of technology , institutional and human resource development , and the development of small - and medium-scale industry .  Support was also required for the promotion of regional and sub-regional cooperation as a practical means of enlarging markets and establishing multinational projects .  
Her delegation hoped that within the framework of UNIDO , UNCTAD and other relevant United Nations bodies , adequate support would be extended to developing countries for the removal of structural deficiencies impeding the transformation of the industrial sector and the creation of the conditions necessary for sustainable self-reliant industrialization .  
Thailand believed that industrial development facilitated economic growth and technological change , as well as creating dynamic linkages with the agricultural and service sectors and contributing to foreign exchange earnings that were key to overall development .  
Developing countries increasingly required the technical assistance and capacity-building services of the united Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) , which supported endeavours to create an environment propitious for sustainable industrial growth and international competitiveness .  
Promising directions of cooperation of development of cooperative links in the mining and metallurgical , chemical and jewellery industries and light industry , mechanical engineering , building materials production , military industrial complexes and agro-industry complexes ; the establishment of inter-State industrial and financial groups and joint enterprises ; cooperation between transport department ; harmonization of the actions of the banking systems of Armenia and the Russian Federation ; and other joint actions taken in the light of the mutual economic interests of the two countries .  
The Special Rapporteur affirmed that , owing to their double marginalization as women and as migrants , women migrant workers might easily find themselves in situations in which they were vulnerable to violence and abuse , especially since women migrant workers dominated the informal labour market of most countries , working as domestic , industrial or agricultural labourers , or within the service industry . 
Countries need to systematically increase the use of renewable energy sources according to their specific social , economic , natural , geographical and climatic conditions and cleaner fuel technologies , including fossil fuel technologies , and to improve efficiency in energy production , distribution and use and in other industrial production processes that are intensive users of energy ;  
The Convention is recognized as the first truly verifiable global disarmament accord , with a unique , comprehensive and effective verification regime covering both military and industrial facilities .  
The problem of the widening industrialization and technology gap is acknowledged to be particularly acute in sub-Saharan Africa , with 33 of the world 's 48 least developed countries , while macroeconomic stabilization programmes have been adopted by most African countries since the early 1980s in an attempt to create an enabling environment for long-term growth , they have usually not included any specific measures to promote industrial development .  
In this connection , the Assembly of African Heads of State and Government of OAU at their thirty-third ordinary session , in June 1997 , adopted the Harare Declaration ( Dec . 4 ( XXXIII ) ) on African industrialization in which they , inter alia , decided to redouble efforts to promote sustainable industrial development to overcome major economic and social constraints and achieve a greater stake in the global market place as called for in the Lagos Plan of Action and the Abuja Treaty Establishing the African Economic Community .  
The leaders also reaffirmed their belief that , without sustainable industrial development , African economies would be condemned to persistent economic crisis , dependence on humanitarian relief and deepening poverty , despair and political unrest with dire consequences for global peace and stability .  
The articles in the four publications covered a wide spectrum of issues , including the critical role of the informal sector in the development of indigenous industrial capabilities ; the development of international competitiveness ; the private sector and entrepreneurship development ; privatization in Africa ; the Uruguay Round Agreements and implications for African industry ; and the current status of African metallurgy industries and prospects for the year 2000 .  
Further , implementation strategies advocated were not adopted at the country level , the nascent African private sector was not fully prepared to assume the new responsibilities in the industrial investment process and financial support , including term lending , from both domestic and foreign sources was not readily available for industrial projects .  
This is fully in line with the predominant role of the agricultural sector in African economies , the potential for long-term comparative advantage of agro-based production , the multiple linkages between the industrial and agricultural sectors and their potential socioeconomic / economic impact through SMEs and informal-sector activities , particularly in rural areas .  
At the same time , it is clear from the correlation between export expansion , inflows of foreign direct investment and industrial economic growth that countries following inappropriate policies and lacking adequate skills and technological capacities will be left behind in the globalization process .  
Other organizations interested in the process , such as governments , trade unions , industrial sectors , TNCs and other NGOs , should contribute and cooperate with each other to disseminate , as widely and as homogenously as possible , basic information on EMS in order to guarantee a common ground for achieving the opportunities for a fair development of worldwide trade and avoid negative effects that may arise from an inadequate implementation of EMS in developing countries .  
To the supplementary Ariane-5 programmes at rates ranging from 3 to 6 per cent according to the anticipated activities in these three programmes , with the aim of maintaining the high standard of the specific industrial capabilities established in Belgium since the 1970s and thus preserving their advantageous position in the industrial consortium marketing the launch vehicle .  
Emphasizes that the Business Plan marks a watershed in the history of the Organization , defines activities to be undertaken by the Organization in future , reinforces the continuation of UNIDO in global forum functions and in areas where UNIDO has comparative advantage , enabling it to function as a specialized agency within the United Nations system in the field of industrial development for supporting the endeavours of developing countries and those in transition to achieve sustainable development ;  
Requests the United Nations Industrial Development Organization , the Economic Commission for Africa and other relevant United Nations organizations , in accordance with their agreed mandates , work programmes and priorities , to work closely with Governments and the private sector in Africa at the national , regional and international levels to foster industrial production and development ;  
Emphasis is being given to improving the location of housing , services and employment in order to reduce transportation needs ; strengthening sanitary measures to reduce the environmental impact of industrial development ; fostering the use of local technologies and materials in construction ; planning and managing incremental housing programmes which minimize consumption of materials and energy ; halting the deterioration of existing housing stock ; and initiating its gradual rehabilitation .  
Now we are practically the only country of the Commonwealth of Independent States that had a stable economic growth of about 16 per cent during the first half of this year ; we have arrested the decrease in volumes of industrial production and we are a country free from religious , ethnic or civil strife . 
The Action Strategy begins with measures representing a set of possible early priority interventions , including land title reform ; a new agricultural development initiative and special agricultural economic zones ; promotion of new manufacturing investment through relocation of labour-intensive industries to create industrial estates in the region ; introduction of modern and appropriate technologies ; marketing systems ; and human resource development , including improved skills . 
Although the world community set out on the right path with the adoption of Agenda 21 in Rio , and although steps are being taken on the national and international levels towards achieving our goals , globalization , economic and social disparities , pressing agricultural and industrial needs , serious financial constraints and technological deficiencies all combine to make sustainable development an elusive target .  
In view of the increasing importance of trade and international investment as engines of growth , developed countries must provide comprehensive support , including macroeconomic support , to the efforts of developing countries , as agreed at various OECD ministerial meetings and the summits convened by the seven major industrial countries .  
Joint ventures or other forms of foreign direct investment in developing countries that combine high-tech industrial knowledge of developed countries ' companies with low-tech indigenous knowledge of the host countries ' enterprises could become effective mechanisms for stimulating the demand for ESTs and thus promoting their transfer to , and diffusion in , developing countries .  
The predominant role of the private sector in the transfer and diffusion of ESTs and , more importantly , its leading function in the transition to cleaner production , have increased the private sector 's responsibility for ensuring that technology-related investments and industrial and business operations are consistent with community requirements for sustainable lifestyles and environmental protection .  
On the contrary , experience demonstrates that excessive government interference with trade union rights and restrictions on collective bargaining leads to a progressive build-up of industrial relations tension and eventually can result in severe public protests and widespread strikes , with detrimental effects for economic and political stability .  
Dependence on aquaculture ( mainly inland ) for an important part of future net increases in fish consumption will require improved management of freshwater resources , protection of aquaculture sites from industrial and urban pollution , as well as protection of coastal areas , wetlands and mangrove swamps from irresponsible coastal aquaculture practices .  
First , once they are fully implemented , the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture , market access reforms in manufactured and industrial products , and the phasing out of the Multifibre Agreement in textiles trade are projected to raise global income substantially ( estimates range from an increase of US $ 40-billion to one of US $ 215-billion relative to the 1992 base period gross domestic product of approximately US $ 23-trillion ) .  
In developing countries with a weak industrial base , a rapid and sustained rise in the levels of income depends on increasing investment , which has a very high import content .  
Thus , adopting an integrated treatment of the bases of economic growth , by not only ensuring macroeconomic balance and stability but also directing attention to the industrial base and incentive structures , may do much to enhance the viability of policies that address the environmental and social aspects of sustainable development in individual countries .  
The overall humanitarian situation in Tajikistan has remained critical .  A dramatic deterioration of the social and industrial infrastructure and a decline in the provision of social , health and education services , the lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes , and a sharp drop in the real income of most families have combined to render large sectors of the population in Tajikistan unable to meet even their basic food needs .  
The Penal Code lays down offences of an ecological nature , dealing , for example , with the unlawful destruction of raw materials , trees , agricultural or industrial products or means of production , such destruction being detrimental to national wealth or consumption , as well as with the protection of mammals or marine vertebrates and aquatic species .  
Spain reported on initiatives to combat marine pollution , including the control and monitoring of maritime transport of pollutant products that may have an impact on the environment ; the prevention of pollution from ships ; the monitoring and control of industrial waste or waste from ships ; and active participation in the implementation of specific maritime safety plans in each port , taking into account current provisions including those of the National Regulation for the Admission , Handling and Storage of Hazardous Goods in Ports .  
Many representatives noted that the topic involved mainly activities typical of modern industrial societies , such as those connected with nuclear power plants , the chemical and space industries and maritime transport of petroleum and other dangerous or polluting substances , which certainly had undeniable political and economic value , but also posed a considerable risk for the safety of human beings and protection of the environment . 
The remark was made that the task of regulating the potentially detrimental external effects of intensive industrial activities not prohibited by international law and finding a balance between the profits derived from such activities and the burden caused to third parties could be achieved in various ways , such as through the polluter-pays principle , which was not applicable in all cases , or through a regime of civil or State liability or through a combination of both .  
The United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) has implemented HIV / AIDS prevention projects in sub-Saharan Africa , to meet the combined objectives of industrial development and the prevention of the spread of HIV / AIDS . UNIDO is supporting improved access to and affordability of products used in prevention programmes condoms , latex gloves , syringes , HIV-1 / 2 test kits through development of local manufacturing capability . 
Requests the United Nations Industrial Development Organization , the Economic Commission for Africa and other relevant United Nations organizations , in accordance with their agreed mandates , work programmes and priorities , to work closely with Governments and the private sector in Africa at the national , regional and international levels to foster industrial production and development ;  
However , in Central and Eastern Europe ( including the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ) the difficulties inherent in introducing viable market and State mechanisms ab initio to replace the defunct system of control and command took a severe toll , with sharp declines in industrial output , shortfalls in agricultural production , disruption of trade flows , external financial strains and fiscal imbalances .  
Technical advisory services on economic , demographic , social , industrial , energy and environment , and trade statistics to developing countries and countries with economies in transition ; and ad hoc provision of technical cooperation services on national accounts and computers and informatics ;  
The planned improvement of the mechanism of trade and economic relations must provide for the creation of the necessary conditions for developing market-based cooperation , broader access of Russian and Ukrainian capital to each other 's markets , the development of joint investment projects , the formation of transnational financial and industrial groups and the creation of intergovernmental special-purpose programmes .  
In the twenty-first century , megalopolises and cities of all sizes would become the main centres of efforts to achieve sustainable economic , social and environmental development and , at the same time , hubs of world trade and national and global partnership in the areas of industrial and scientific and technological cooperation .  
Countries need to systematically increase the use of renewable energy sources according to their specific social , economic , natural , geographical and climatic conditions and cleaner fuel technologies , including fossil fuel technologies , and to improve efficiency in energy production , distribution and use and in other industrial production processes that are intensive users of energy ;  
This plan is responsible for all programmes related to desertification , surface and ground water pollution , atmospheric pollution , poor sanitation suffered by rural and urban peoples , poor management of industrial and household waste and population growth and its impact on urban sprawl .  
To the contrary , if shortsighted strategies and options are forced upon us , it can mean an ever-deteriorating situation combining the consequences of war , pollution and unconscionable industrial exploitation : the conspiracy of landmines and industrial waste overwhelming the land , the people , the fragile peace and our common Earth .  
Efforts should be made by the international community and intergovernmental bodies and organizations to establish cooperative relations with the authorities in Afghanistan in order to assist in the eradication of illicit cultivation , production and trafficking of narcotic drugs , especially in the drug-producing areas of the country , and to provide them with packages of aid and the means of economic reform , such as human development and capacity-building , mobilization of resources and industrial development to enable them to resort to alternative sources of income , which would provide better economic possibilities for future generations ;  
The latter provides an incentive to market-based forms of technology and skills transfer both for industrial / infrastructural projects and resource management / preservation ( e.g . enhancing the carbon sequestration service rendered by tropical forests , natural rubber plantations and other commercial tree crops ) in developing countries .  JI projects , in particular in technical infrastructure , may also improve the living conditions of the poor or other disadvantaged groups in developing countries .  
Governments of developing countries have sought to promote industrial development and export expansion not only through macro-economic policies aimed at providing favourable framework conditions , but also through policy measures at the microeconomic level intended to reduce supply-side impediments by accelerating the dynamic process of accumulation of physical capital , skills and technology .  
The content and application of competition law and policy , and its relationship with industrial and trade policies , have varied among different countries at different times , as countries have sought with mixed success to promote the technological capacity and international competitiveness of their industries , compensate for the effects of market failures or ease structural adjustment .  
Governments in all countries that have successfully closed the gap on the leading industrial economies have pursued policies aimed at directing the form and focus of competition , be it between domestic firms or from the international market-place , to achieve specific development goals .  
To date over 80 bilateral agreements covering the economic , trade , scientific , industrial , technical and environmental fields had been signed with developing countries and countries in transition .  
Rapidly rising tariffs , from low rates for raw materials to higher rates for intermediate products and sometimes peak rates for finished industrial products , continue to hamper vertical diversification and industrialization in developing countries .  
Russia , and most of the other countries with transition economies , possessed a developed industrial , scientific and technological base , now operating under difficult transitional conditions .  
The difficulty in providing adequate health care , the continued practice of open drainage , the indiscriminate disposal of waste water and industrial effluents and rampant water pollution have resulted in the creation of mega-slums unsuitable for human living .  
International cooperation was indispensable in containing its contagious effects , but so was a resilient national economy built upon a strong industrial base ; UNIDOs mission was to help build and fortify that industrial base for the benefit of all .  
Bocalandro ( Argentina ) said that the current critical social situation which was due to unsuitable industrial structures , excessive bureaucracy and structural adjustments had been aggravated by the international financial crisis .  
Governments must provide the political and legal framework for sound environmental management and for agricultural and industrial development policies that take into account current and foreseeable health needs .  
Although demand for industrial wood raw material is expected to increase in the future , changes in the product mix and changes in production technology and sources of raw material are likely to provide opportunities for production increases consistent with constant ( or modestly increasing ) prices .  
It made it more difficult for developing countries to make use of their traditional comparative advantages , such as cheap labour and abundant natural resources , since industrial and technological capacity with a solid infrastructural base , adequate human resources and business development were increasingly determinants of economic growth and sustainable development .  
The continuing Asian crisis , which was taking place in countries considered to have dynamic economies based on sound fundamental macroeconomic variables , had clearly shown that macroeconomic stability could not by itself ensure the level of stability that a sustained development-oriented industrial strategy required .  
UNIDO , with its capacity to carry out objective and independent studies of the global , regional , national and sectoral issues that affected industrial development , could provide the developing countries with valuable sources of information and advice in that area .  
Based on past experience and the changes brought about by the rapid globalization of the economy , there had been a growing convergence of policies that encouraged investment in human resources and government responsibility in creating a dynamic domestic framework in which the private sector could play its role as the driving force of industrial development .  
A sustainable industrial policy was a crucial component of development strategies , which included a number of key objectives : open competitive economies , progressive trade liberalization , secure and productive employment , social development and environmental protection .  
The report of the Director-General of UNIDO ( A / 53 / 254 ) included a highly justified critique of the so-called gradual approach to economic and industrial development , which posited a first stage of macroeconomic reforms , followed by a second stage of socio-economic , institutional and legal reforms .  
In his delegations view , the following UNIDO activities should be strengthened : ( a ) attracting foreign investment in the industrial and technological sectors ; ( b ) developing international environmental protection standards for industry ; ( c ) enhancing the role of small and medium-sized enterprises in science and technology and in industry ; ( d ) establishing regional industrial development and ecological production centres ; and ( e ) promoting certification and standardization in industry . 
UNIDO harnesses the joint forces of government and the private sector to foster competitive industrial production , develop international industrial partnerships and promote socially equitable and environmentally friendly industrial development .  UNIDO is the only worldwide organization dealing with industry from a development perspective .  
Hospitals , schools , factories , refugee accommodation centres , private houses and farms , food depots , landmarks of priceless cultural and spiritual value , industrial facilities , and public utility services , such as water supply systems , power plants and Post , Telephone and Telegraph communication centres , have been destroyed or severely damaged .  
While ongoing efforts to reform the international financial architecture and improve economic management will reduce the risks of future crises , there is growing recognition of the need to proceed , in parallel , with efforts to strengthen social policies and institutions , including industrial relations systems and institutions for social dialogue .  
These are particularly difficult times for the families of mineworkers and industrial workers who have no revenues from the land ( poverty ratio of 44.33 per cent ) , poor urban families with a large number of children , families with mentally or physically handicapped members , adults or elderly persons without relatives unable to fend for themselves , pensioners with a minimum pension , urban families who have provided shelter to refugee families from war-torn areas of the former Yugoslavia , etc .  
Contributing factors to the marine environmental deterioration include oil exploration and exploitation , rapid economic growth , overfishing , physical alteration of the coastlines by dredging and filling , discharge of raw sewage , disposal of untreated industrial effluents , and dumping wasted oil and debris .  
These aggregate figures conceal a wide variation in national economic performance , but broadly speaking , in most of the faster-reforming and faster-growing economies of Central Europe and the Baltic States , the growth rates of industrial production have fallen considerably , while in South-eastern Europe the recession in industry worsened in the second half of the year .  
The revised budget for 1998 / 99 also provides for the replacement of obsolete and damaged refrigeration , water-purification and industrial laundry equipment required to support the MINURCA military personnel after the departure of the French logistical contingent .  
Further escalation of military action , barbaric bombings of industrial , social , cultural and civilian targets and the peaceful population are all assuming horrible proportions .  
A UNIDO policy firmly aligned with the broad United Nations global agenda of sustainable human development and poverty reduction through UNIDOs programmatic focus on the three Es of sustainable industrial development : competitive Economy , productive Employment , and sound Environment , at the policy , institutional and enterprise level ;  
The former CIA official stated in this article that the National Security Advisor , Samuel R . Berger , justified the action against the factory by claiming that the plant was part of the " Sudanese military industrial complex " , that it was heavily guarded , that it produced no medicines and that its ownership trail led to terrorist chief Osama bin Laden .  
This would seem to suggest that Governments may follow one of two paths to development , the first encompassing a vision of a free trade economy with heavy reliance on foreign investment and foreign technology , and the other centring on a vision of a deep and diverse industrial sector with predominantly nationally owned enterprises capable of autonomous innovation .

Beginning in the 14th century , Europe saw the Renaissance , broke away from the confines of theocratic power , achieved unprecedented emancipation of the mind , and produced rapid scientific and technological development .  By the 18th century , Europe achieved the industrial revolution , marked by the steam engine , and completed the transition to capitalist industrial society .  
In the fields of electronic information , new materials , biological engineering , integration of light , machines , and electricity [ guang ji dian yi ti hua , 0342-2623-7193-0001-7555-0553 ] , new energy sources , and environmental protection , the high-tech zones are more and more becoming important bases for the development of China 's high-tech industries and have played a active role in promoting industrial restructuring and in leading forward sustained economic development .  
The surging tide of acquisitions and mergers among international enterprises is breeding yet another major industrial transfer .  After accepting the market for labor-intensive industries in the 1970s , developing countries may have to brace themselves again for the full-fledged onslaught of multinational companies .  
Guizhou used to have a relatively weak industrial foundation ; thanks to the construction and readjustment of remote regions away from coastal areas over the past more than 30 years , a military industrial system has been established in Guizhou , with the three major bases of aviation , space flight , and electronics as its main body .  Today , these three major bases have become an important force in Guizhou 's economic development .  
Third , we should bring into full play the roles of the existing assets stock of the military industry in the western region , vigorously push forward the readjustment and the strategic restructuring of both the industrial structure and capability of the western region , take the initiative to incorporate the military industry into the economy of the western region , and step up the work of extricating enterprises from their difficulties as well as the establishment of a modern enterprise system .  
It is true that in comparison with the coastal areas in the country 's eastern region , the western region has a relatively lower industrialization level and an irrational industrial structure on the whole , and its gap with the eastern region has been further widened ever since the beginning of reform and opening up ; however , the central cities in the western region , such as Xian , Chongqing , Chengdu , and Guiyang , as well as certain industries and trades still maintain each 's own relative advantages .  
Article 24 In places where industrial wastewater and urban sewage are used for irrigation , the agricultural authority of local people 's governments at or above the county level shall organize regular monitoring of the quality of water used for irrigation and the irrigated soil and farm produce and shall take appropriate measures to prevent the pollution of soil , underground water , and farm produce .  
do a good job in diverting redundant workers to other jobs and increasing efficiency with reduced staff ; put it in a prominent place to improve efficiency ; and establish a new-type small and efficient nuclear technology industrial system based on the integration of military and civilian production .  
through the introduction of foreign capital and advanced applicable technology and equipment , they can speed up enterprises ' technological transformation and industrial structural upgrading , heighten the international competitiveness of the central and western regions , and transform the development potential into realistic productive forces , so as to provide an even broader space and gigantic propelling force for the sustained development of the central and western regional economy and their foreign economic relations and trade in the new century .  
It is necessary to proceed on the basis of resolving currently prominent problems and to have in mind long-term development ; it is necessary to vigorously proceed with the strategic adjustment of the economic structure , to further stabilize and enhance agriculture 's position as the base , to intensify the adjustment of the industrial structure , and to accelerate the grand development of the western region , so as to improve the overall quality of the national economy and to raise the economy to a higher level .  
It can be anticipated that in a period to come , the huge demand of the Western Region for building materials , engineering machinery , industrial equipment , electronic products and other supplies will greatly stimulate the production of relevant industries and make a large number of enterprises free themselves from their current situation of operating under capacity .  
To promote the application of patented technologies , the exhibition also displays all the patented items that won gold medals and outstanding awards in China in the past , the projects that were selected by the State Intellectual Property Office as showcases for application of patented technologies to industrial production , and some selected patented technology projects that have attained high technological standards and generated good economic returns .  
By 2005 the CSSIC will have formed a military industrial scientific research and production system based on adequate maintenance and supplies and a relatively complete S &amp; T innovation system and a good operation mechanism , under which the CSSIC 's shipbuilding capacity will have been expanded to 2.2-million tonnes ; 60 percent of exported boats and ships will have used home-made equipment ; five to eight brand-name products with a sales volume amounting to over 1-billion yuan will have been developed ;  
For many years we have worked hard to put into practice Deng Xiaoping 's thinking of common prosperity .  Having gained a certain economic strength , we began to carry out the " project of common prosperity " and , relying mainly upon the financial departments at the city level for many consecutive years , raised funds totaling 1.88-billion yuan and put them into the relatively backward areas of the city in a bid to improve their infrastructure facilities , industrial layout , and cultural and educational conditions , thereby bringing about the coordinated development of various localities .  
A People 's Bank official spoke today in Beijing on cracking down on unauthorized fund gathering activities .  He said People 's Bank would take further steps to join with the industrial and commercial as well as the judicial departments and adopt stern measures to resolutely ban , investigate , and crack down on unauthorized fund gathering activities in an effort to preserve the stability of socioeconomic order .  
Those who hand in false documents or use other deceptive means to fraudulently obtain their registration , once discovered , must be promptly punished , to the point of having their business licenses suspended , by the industrial and commercial administrative organ .  
Third , to have the right of contributing to industrial development .  As the technical and safety standards are formulated by ourselves , they will contribute to the industrial development of the broadcast and television network , pager , cellular phone , electronic notebook , computer , public screen , and household electrical appliances , among other things .  
Non-governmental economic cooperation has evolved from individual corporate ones to the stage of establishing " special economic zones " and industrial parks .  Increasing economic and trade cooperation and personnel exchanges have helped increase mutual understanding and trust , which not only bring real benefits for the people of the two Koreas but produce a positive impact on the improvement of the north-south relationship .  
At the same time , starting with the first five-year plan , the central authorities concentrated finances to invest in a number of key construction projects ; within quite a short time we built up an independent and relatively complete industrial system and national economic system on the backward " poor and blank " foundation left over from old China .  
Carrying out a positive fiscal policy , strengthening infrastructure construction , supporting agricultural basic construction and construction for the ecological environment , supporting economic restructuring , speeding up the development of hi-tech industry , revamping old industrial bases and traditional industries , practicing the policy of rejuvenating the nation through science and education and the strategy of sustainable development , and establishing a social security system all require corresponding increase of input and state financial support .  
An authoritative person analyzed the situation when he was interviewed by reporters and noted that the driving forces included mainly the following : The showing of the effectiveness of the policy of macro-control , the increase of demand for export as a result of the recovery of the global economy , the significant improvement of quality in industrial production , the new motive force as a result of the rapid development of new and high-tech industries , and the " popular feeling " that expect good economic growth .  
Learning and studying successful experiences of developed countries and neighboring regions in developing an integrated circuits industry and summing up our country 's experiences and lessons in developing an integrated circuits industry has become undoubtedly and extremely vital to our country 's development in future .  We should map out industrial policies ; build a development environment ;  
With the driving force of the overseas Chinese , this city achieved uncommon , vigorous , and rapid growth .  In ten years the total value of industrial and agricultural output grew 90-fold , and their overall economic strength jumped from being near the last in the province to one of the top three .  
Piracy has seriously disturbed the economic and cultural operational orders in the country and worsened the environment for national cultural industries ' survival , thus causing a massive drain on state revenues and causing cultural business units ' failure to gain an advantageous position in competition amid world economic integration by making it difficult for them to achieve effective accumulation and rapidly expand their industrial scale .  
[ Liu Shijin ] After we started the reform and opening-up drive , we reexamined and adjusted our previous strategy of giving priority to developing the heavy industry .  This resulted in the pattern of industrial development with emphasis on the textile and other light industries during the early and middle periods of the 80 ' s of the 20th century .  
As a result of economic and trade cooperation with the mainland , the proportions of primary and secondary industries in the island 's total output value have kept declining , while that of tertiary industry has gradually risen , thereby effectively promoting Taiwan 's economic transformation and industrial structural adjustment .  
Compared with other countries , in 1999 China 's overall economic amount ranked seven in the world , major industrial and farm product output ranked first in the world , total foreign trade amount ranked ten in the world , foreign exchange reserve ranked second in the world , international tourism ranked eight in the world , and attraction of foreign capital ranked second in the world .  
Xiamen now ranks as one of the top-ten economically strong cities in the country .  To meet the need of the state 's safety , Xiamen has initially built an industrial system , which can rapidly covert civilian production to defense technology industry .  Electronic , machine tool , and chemical industrial enterprises constitute a major part of this industrial system .  
The city has developed , in a selected and planned manner , more than 130 projects that can manufacture products both for military and civilian purposes .  To meet the need of military maneuvers , the city has repeatedly made such a conversion in an effort to turn sci-tech achievements into combat capability .  Now a total of 16 high-tech industrial enterprises are able to manufacture military articles to meet various needs at short notice .  
The ultimate effect of the modern economic protection , that is regarded as a system , hinges on the questions whether the overall function of the system can be brought into full play and whether the system can provide various major economic targets with enough survival capacity , appropriate production capacity , and rapid after-war recovery capacity under the condition of high-tech wars .  Hence , the protection of economic targets has already developed from the protection of individual factories to the overall protection of urban and industrial sectors .  
Second , we should formulate scientific and rational policies to guide foreign commercial investment industries , enhancing foreign economic policy coordination , integrating the attraction of foreign capital with the readjustment of the industrial structure and with expanding exports and improving the level of technical development , and improving the nation 's overall competitiveness .  
For example , last year , when discussing the measures for promoting community construction and management , advancing the construction of new and high-tech industrial bases , and reinforcing the party organizations at the grass-roots level , members of the municipal party committee standing committee were dispatched to do special investigations and research in the fields they took charge of .  This guaranteed that the decisions and arrangements made by the municipal party committee more relevant and pertinent in giving guidance to the concrete work .  
At the beginning of the 20th century , as a result of the new cultural movement and the Russian October Revolution , a group of patriotic and progressive intellectuals accepted Marxist theory which represented advanced culture and a forward direction .  They penetrated the industrial working masses that represented the advanced productive force , propagated revolutionary theory , and combined the two .  The result was the birth of the Chinese Communist Party .  
In 1986 , Qingdao started to openly select and appoint the deputy directors of its planning commission , economic commission and financial committee .  In 1993 , it selected deputy administrators and assistants from applicants all over the country for its five departments including the city 's science and technology commission , bureau for tourism , and high-tech industrial park .  In 1999 , it had selected and appointed six leading cadres at the deputy bureau chief level from applicants in the whole city .  
The city transferred a number of cadres with knowledge about industrial and urban development from city-level organs to work in suburban counties ; as a result , knowledge of local party and government leaders has been diversified , their average age was five years younger , and their average educational level has been raised , which has effectively boosted local economic work .  
The countries of Asia should seize the opportunity , aggressively adjusting their development strategies and accelerating the industrialization , modernization , and market-orientation process .  In particular , they should increase their investments in education and science and technology , vigorously developing and training talented individuals , emphasizing the development of new and advanced technology industries , accelerating industrial upgrades , promoting the sustained and rapid development of the Asian economy in the new century and gradually enabling the people everywhere to affluent lives .  
After the beginning of reform and opening-up , our country 's gross economic quantity continued to expand .  GDP increased from 362.4-billion yuan to over 8,000-billion yuan , ranking seventh place in the world and ranking first among all developing countries .  The output of major farm produce and industrial products also ranks in an advanced position in the world .  
Support for projects of basic research , common industrial technology , key technology , and high technology has been strengthened and initial results for conducting technical innovation and industrializing scientific and technological achievements have been obtained .  
The fundamental approach to dealing with all our existing problems , including such economic construction problems as insufficient domestic demand , an irrational industrial structure , and uneven development across the regions and such political problems as the unification of the motherland , lies in accelerated development .  
The great development of the industrial revolution early in this century made the organization of the military move away from the traditional model of having the infantry ( cavalry ) forces as the dominant forces , with the structure of the military coming to encompass such elements as artillery , armed , engineering , air defense , and naval forces ; the availability and quantities of the new services and arms of the military , characterized by high technological contents , became important indicators of the level of modernization and combat effectiveness of the military .  
Human society 's change from the pastoral civilization to agricultural civilization and from agricultural civilization to industrial civilization was the qualitative leap of the human social and economic development after the structural adjustments were repeatedly accumulated to a certain stage .  
Since Chen Shui-bian took office , Taiwan 's economic environment has been worsening every day .  The outflow of large amount of capital and the " shifting " of industrial and commercial enterprises one after another to other countries have consumed more than half of the economic achievements painstakingly accumulated by the Taiwan people over the past 30-plus years .  On improving the cross-strait relations , Chen Shui-bian has only given some ambiguous remarks .  
When promoting the optimized upgrading of the national economic structure , although we must not neglect changes in the industrial structure , or the significance of raising the relative proportion of the tertiary industry on the basis of optimized internal structures in the primary and secondary industries , at the same time we must not neglect to promote structural optimization and upgrades in the other areas .  
- - Attach importance to and improve strategic studies in enterprise development , implement scientific and democratic decision making in order to avoid major mistakes due to rash decisions , establish a responsibility system for major decision making in enterprises , and hold relevant personnel accountable in cases where enterprises suffer serious losses due to violations of relevant laws , regulations , and industrial policies . 
- - We will perfect the mechanism for withdrawing enterprises from the market ; comprehensively resort to economic , legal , and other necessary administrative means to undertake bankruptcy proceedings against those chronically loss-making enterprises with debts in excess of assets and with no hopes of climbing out of the red ; actively and prudently close down those mines that are exhausting resources ; continue to close down the " five small industrial enterprises " in accordance with the law ; and eliminate backward production capability .  
Speeding up the establishment of a social security system is now the key issue in deepening enterprise reform and speeding up structural adjustment ; it has a bearing on efforts by enterprises to separate out their social functions and cut personnel to improve efficiency , on whether the reassignment of laid-off personnel to other jobs can move forward or not , and on whether the task of upgrading the industrial structure and improving enterprise efficiency can be accomplished smoothly .  It has become a critical task .  
According to the communiqu published by the meeting , world economic development will be slowing down , but the basic factors supporting the sustained development of most of the major industrial nations have remained unchanged .  
It is understood that , during the 15 years of the " 863 " Plan , it has achieved a large number of world class research results .  It has made breakthroughs on and mastered a number of key technologies , closing our gap with the advanced world level , to develop a number of high-tech industrial growth-points .  It has sharply promoted China 's development of high technology and high-tech industry , providing high-tech support for upgrading traditional industry .  
For instance , there were no China-made robots 15 years ago , but China has currently developed a group of industrial robots , service-oriented robots , and special robots which are applied to industrial production , work involving high risks , and other businesses .  For example , robots for wall cleaning , pipeline robots , robot-like engineering machinery , contour spraying robots , assembly robots , micro-driving robots , and automatic pathfinders have been on the market for application .  Important achievements have been made with the technique of underwater autonomous deep diving .  
Third , thanks to the close cooperation between the key techniques developed during the implementation of the " 863 " Project and the industrial circle , China has created products with its own intellectual property rights in such hot point fields of international high-tech competition as biological engineering medicine , communications equipment , high-performance computers , Chinese information processing platform , artificial crystal , photoelectron material and apparatuses .  
Our current tasks are extremely arduous , such as deepening the reform of state-owned enterprises , realigning industrial structures , increasing peasant income , re-arranging laid-off workers , expanding social employment , balancing the distribution of incomes , and setting up and improving the socialist security system .  
Through reforms and opening up over more than 20 years , Guangzhou has given play to many of its traditional commercial advantages and has gradually built up a mature market system , laid a good industrial foundation , built up its financial strength , and improved its investment environment and investment management .  
Fourth , along with the development of agricultural productive forces , the social division of labor is increasingly elaborate , the degree of commercialization , specialization , and socialization of agricultural production is unceasingly enhanced , and the combination and interdependence of agriculture with relevant industrial departments is closer and closer with each passing day , which have led to the integration of supply , production , and marketing , and of agriculture , industry , and commerce in agricultural operation .  
Internationally , the trend toward economic globalization is intensifying , the scientific and technological revolution is developing by leaps and bounds , the pace of the readjustment of the industrial structure is quickening , and China 's neighboring countries are developing at an accelerated pace .  
Qian Qichen said : " During my visit , I also had the chance to have extensive contact and exchange with personalities from various circles , such as the US Congress , industrial and commercial enterprises , media , ethnic Chinese community , and community of Chinese people residing in the United States . They all expressed the wish to see China and the United States friendly to each other and that the bilateral relations between the two countries can develop steadily . " 
First , the reorganization and transformation of traditional industries should be put in an important position .  Traditional industries should be optimized and upgraded by means of quickening the change in the mode of industrial growth , increasing product variety , improving product quality , lowering energy consumption and other costs , adopting high and new technologies and other advanced and applicable technologies .  Second , it is necessary to develop high and new technology industries .  
During the period of the 10th Five-Year Plan , we should work closely around the goal of expanding domestic demand and adopt practical and effective macroeconomic fiscal policy and monetary policy to stimulate domestic market demand for investment and consumption in order to promote economic growth and upgrade the industrial structure .  
The state is obliged to adopt effective steps to guarantee the realization of these rights , for example , providing technical and vocational guidance and training , ensuring men and women enjoy equal pay for equal work , guarantee industrial safety and public sanitation in the working environment , ensuring that people in the same trades enjoy equal chances for promotion and such promotion will only be determined by seniority and ability , and will not be affected by any other factors .  
It is understood that " sewage charges " are charged according to the monthly water consumption of enterprises ( including foreign-invested enterprises and units ) and different rates are imposed on industrial enterprises , tertiary enterprises and public institutions .  " Sewage charges " on enterprises that have not yet met environmental protection standards are several times higher than for enterprises that are up to standard .  
The insufficient development of the tertiary industry is a principal problem existing in China 's industrial structure .  Since the implementation of the Ninth Five-Year Plan , given the rapid development attained in the tertiary industry and its increasing proportion held in the GDP , there is still a big gap as compared with other countries in the world .  
However , there is one point which the MAC has neglected .  Not all the key industrial cities today are located in northern China , but are located in the southeastern coast of the mainland such as Jiangsu , Guangdong and Fujian . In terms of geographic distance , they can be formed into an industrial group with Taiwan . However , the political factors have made most people feel today that the distance between both sides of the strait is too far to be reached .  
If it is said that in the era of industrial economy , knowledge could find expression in a combatant 's skills or a commander 's tactics , in a future war , intellectual fighting capacity and knowledge confrontation will respectively constitute a major symbol of military strength and a fundamental characteristic of military confrontation .  
As an official of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation noted , the motherland is rich in resources and has a vast market that is full of potential .  It also has an abundant supply of labor , low wages , cheap land , a huge contingent of scientific and technological personnel , and an industrial productive system that is complete in range and large in scale .  
The industrial value added continued to increase at a comparatively high rate .  The growth rate in the industrial sectors under state ownership or with dominating shares held by the state was higher than that in the same period of last year , and the rate of their contributions to overall economic growth was also raised .  However , the industrial sector under collective ownership grew at a relatively slower pace , and the growth rate of light industry was markedly lower than that of heavy industry .  
As the industrial and commercial circles in Taiwan are expecting to further open up economic and trade exchanges on both sides of the strait , a public figure of the Taiwan authorities recently issued a thought-provoking statement that the continued rising unemployment rate on the island and the unfavorable economic situation would affect the time to relax restrictions on the implementation of the " no haste , be patient " policy and the extent of implementing this policy .  
set things right in matters ranging from theory to practice ; carried out and acted in the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee ; lost no time in shifting the focus of party work to economic construction ; restored and developed industrial , agricultural , scientific , cultural , and educational undertakings that had been disrupted by the " Great Cultural Revolution " ; revived and carried forward the fine traditions of the party ; and consolidated and developed political stability and unity in Jilin Province .  
When he learned that there was no more hope for Wang Wei to return alive , elder Chen Yingming , chief senior aviation industrial artist of the China Aviation Museum who is over 70 years of age , decided to make with his own hands for Wang Wei a fighter plane model named the " Blood-and-Iron Fighter Plane , " and the model would look exactly the same as the fighting eagle piloted by Wang Wei before his death .  
The state has decided to make infrastructure construction the base , strengthening the protection and construction of the ecological environment the main content , grasping the readjustment of the industrial structure the key , developing scientific and technological education the basic condition , and thorough reform and expanded open up the strong driving force of development .  
the import of technological equipment for private use by domestic-investment and foreign-investment industrial projects encouraged by the state , as well as superior industrial projects within their total amount of investments in the western region , will be exempted from paying tariffs and the import value-added tax , with an exception for commodities that are not allowed to enjoy tax exemption as stipulated by the state .  
National model workers Li Huangxi , Bao Qian , Wang Yiqiang , Sun Haijun , Zhang Ruimin successively spoke on such subjects as striving to be new-type industrial workers in the new era , carrying forward the spirit of doing pioneering work against difficult conditions , rebuilding beautiful natural environment , and enhancing the enterprise 's international competitive power .  
[ passage omitted ] In the 10 years beginning in 2001 , based on their yearning for an American century , extreme rightwing American politicians , tycoons , the military industrial complex , the media , and its ideological wildness will wallow together in the mire , and unscrupulously stir up the " theory of the China threat " ; in coordination with a psychological offensive , they will carry out a new " physical offensive . "  
Contradictions in various strata in Hong Kong should be resolved through mutual understanding and accommodation after consultation and discussion .  Sensational means should not be used to intensify contradictions .  Seeking development means creating conditions for " gathering talent and financial resources , " actively promoting industrial and education restructuring , and maintaining Hong Kong 's competitive edge at the advent of the era of global economic integration and knowledge-based economy .  
Observers point out that the most direct and evident information gleaned from the fact that , only three months after taking office , the Bush Administration could not wait to deploy an NMD program far exceeding that of his predecessor is that the United States needs to simulate its economy , which has started a downturn , by means of stepping up production in the defense industry , and also to offer a political reward to the military industrial complex for supporting Bush in getting into the White House .  
The " 10th Five-Year Plan " for tackling key scientific and technological issues will focus over 60 percent of S &amp; T funding on surmounting a host of integrative technological issues that have the greatest effect on spurring industrial technological upgrades and sustainable social development , issues that cover a broad area , and that relate to high-level core technology and associated equipment .  
Judging from the surface , cross-strait relations remain calm and stable ; moreover , thanks to the hard efforts of the public as well as the industrial and commercial circles on the island who have been imposing pressure on the authorities , many man-made restrictions in Taiwan are forced to be relaxed , thus giving rise to an unprecedented upsurge of economic , trade , and cultural exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits .  
During his inspection tour , Wu Bangguo expressed admiration for the way Shanghai implemented the " 3-2-1 " industrial development policy and organically integrated the urban layout readjustment and its functional improvement with the industrial readjustment in accordance with the plan for economic and social development and the general urban plan .  
The " prescriptions " written by people of insight on the island include pursuing political stability , promoting industrial upgrade , raising administrative efficiency , and promoting financial reforms .  However , they spontaneously stressed the crucial role of developing cross-strait relations .  Some scholars pointed out that the authorities ' " no haste , be patient " policy has led people to lose hope .  
At present , the people and the industrial and commercial circles in Taiwan are still restless and dissatisfied .  The principal reason is that the will of the people has been distorted and their confidence has been broken .  There are three specific manifestations of this situation :  
First of all , Zhu Rongji expressed his appreciation for the attention given by Hong Kong 's industrial circles and professionals to the strategy of developing the western region and to the vigorous assistance and support given by the Hong Kong SAR in their participation in the strategy .  He hoped that Hong Kong 's industrial and commercial circles would play a greater role in developing the motherland 's western region and in promoting the common development of Hong Kong and the interior .  
Last year industrial enterprises owned by the state and those in which the state held a dominant stake of shares registered a profit exceeding the preceding year by 137.7-billion yuan .  According to estimates , 48 percent of this increase in profit was attributable to the improvement of the macroeconomic environment , and 23 percent was due to the direct effects of the policies adopted by the government to enable the enterprises to stop losses and earn profits .  
All localities and departments should conscientiously implement the spirit of the central instructions , take practical and effective measures to guarantee water supply for cities and drinking water for people and livestock in rural areas and , through structural adjustments and major efforts to save on water , strive to do a good job in industrial and agricultural production .  
However , since he took office , he has failed to honor his commitment .  To consolidate his political base , he has been blindly playing up to the interests of the conservative forces , the rich , and large enterprises , especially of the military industrial enterprises , in the financial budget and taxation policy , education policy , social security policy , environment policy , and on a series of other issues .  
Zhu Rongji emphasized that at present , the supply of grain and industrial consumer goods is greater than demand and this has provided a golden opportunity for returning farmland land to forests and improving the ecological environment .  We must firmly grasp this rare opportunity and actively and prudently push forward work in this respect .  
With the beginning of the new century , our country 's drive for socialist modernization has entered a new stage of development .  The world scientific and technological revolution is developing rapidly , the tendency toward economic globalization is getting stronger , the pace of industrial restructuring is quickening , and international competition is becoming increasingly keen ; all these pose new challenges to us .  
On this basis , our party seized the opportune moment to creatively realize the socialist transformation of individual farming , handicraft industry , as well as capitalist industrial and commercial industries , destroyed the exploiting system and the exploiting class , and established the socialist system .  
Meanwhile , the 10th Five-Year Plan for Sci-Tech Development has clearly defined the following concrete goals for China 's sci-tech development : First , we should greatly improve our industrial level and international competitiveness .  We should ensure that the technical level of the major domains of our agricultural , industrial , and service sectors would be improved to the same level as enjoyed by advanced countries in the mid-1990s .  
In the light of the needs of its social and economic development as well as the needs of its industrial structural readjustment , and also in accordance with its promises concerning the WTO accession , China is to accelerate the opening of its central and western regions , as well as its service trade , to the outside world ; and is to increasingly expand the scale of its foreign investment introduction , and to open more fields to foreign investment .  
He demanded that environmental protection work be assigned a still more prominent position in industrial development ; we should be resolved to readjust and close down cement and other industrial and mining enterprises currently polluting the environment and wasting resources , so that Tibet 's skies will be more blue , its waters more clear , and its trees more green .  
Go a step further in optimizing foreign companies ' investment in the industrial structure , raise foreign companies ' investment in the content of science and technology , continually expand the scope of foreign companies ' investment , strive to complete the regional distribution of foreign companies ' investment , encourage foreign companies to invest in our central and western areas , improve the legal system concerning foreign investment , further transform the role of government , and carry forward administration according to law .  
the proportion of the gross industrial product made up of dominant products , high-tech products and technical products for both military and civilian use rising to 40 percent from the current approximately 30 percent ;  
According to what is understood , for more than 20 years China 's national defense science and technology industry has gradually realized a transformation from an industry that produces industrial products for military use only , to one that produces products that integrate military and civilian use .  Every industry within the military industrial complex has fundamentally formed a developmental pattern with professional characteristics for products for the civilian industry .  
The session reached a comprehensive consensus on the 12 questions left over from the multilateral talks , including agricultural and industrial subsidies , trade rights , a transitional review mechanism on China , and other important issues , Long Yongtu said , adding that the political and substantial questions related to China 's accession to the WTO have been resolved . 
The cumulative total of actual utilization of direct investment by foreign companies now exceeds $ 360-billion , and China has ranked first in the world in bringing in foreign investment for eight successive years .  This has played an irreplaceable role in making full use of " two markets and two kinds of resources , " leading forward national economic growth , speeding up industrial restructuring and the progress of science and technology , and impelling the reforms of the economic structure and the marketization process .  
In carrying out such special campaigns , quality inspection , industrial and commercial administration , public security , customs , and other relevant departments should coordinate closely with one another , work in cooperation , and make every possible effort to achieve major results .  
If the export growth rate for the second half of the year continues at the low level we saw in May - - or even lower , perhaps becoming negative growth - - industrial growth for the entire year will be hard pressed to reach 10% , while the GDP growth rate for the entire year may fall below the minimum target of 7% .  
On the afternoon of the 17th , Beijing Municipality held its first Mayoral Office meeting since the successful Olympics bid , where it studied the high-tech industrial development plan drawn up by the concerned departments for the " 10th Five Year Plan " and the three-year urban public transportation development plan .  
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , Hubei 's national economy grew steadily at an annual average rate of 10.8 percent ; its industrial production , in particular , maintained the trend of a rapid development , growing at an annual average rate of 13.5 percent ; the province 's economic structure was further optimized , and its economic strength evidently strengthened ;  
Wu Bangguo pointed out : In the first half of this year , China 's economy continued to show the favorable trend of a steady growth .  The country 's industrial production enjoyed a rapid growth , and its economic efficiency was enhanced by a considerable margin .  
Industrial and commercial enterprises engaged in development projects in the agricultural sector are urged to adopt the industrialized management method of using companies to bring along the growth of rural households , while the practice of developing a modern agriculture by industrial and commercial enterprises through a large-scale " land encirclement " is not encouraged at the present stage .  
We must actively support the development of agricultural product processing industries , taking a path of integrated trade , industrial , and agricultural industrialization .  We must bolster qualified enterprises in their development of agricultural production , processing , and export bases , enhancing the motivating power on farmers by the market competition forces , and raising the level of agricultural production organization and the international competitive power of China 's agriculture .  
He demanded that the broad ranks of cadres and employees working in the industrial and commercial administration sector nationwide perform their duties conscientiously , reinforce regulation and law enforcement , bravely act as defenders of the market , strive to open up a new prospect in industrial and commercial administration , and make new contributions to the establishment and maintenance of a good order of market economy and the sustained and healthy development of the national economy .  
While performing their duties , industrial and commercial administration personnel must be impersonal and incorruptible and enforce the law bravely .  They should be brave to make arrests , fulfill their regulatory function , and handle tough cases , waging a relentless war against all lawbreaking and criminal behavior .  
Overall , the contingent of staff of industrial and commercial administration departments we have today is good and a batch of excellent law enforcers who are brave to enforce the law , defy violence and brute force , and do not hesitate to lay down their lives have come to the fore .  
All industrial and commercial law enforcers must be faithful to their duty , be brave to take responsibility , and remain upright and incorruptible .  They should make a good job of market regulation and law enforcement by presenting a clean , honest , and lofty image ;  
This is especially true following China 's entry to the WTO , when foreign agricultural produce of high quality will be entering the market at a much lower price , thus threatening the existence of traditional agriculture .  More farmers should be given the opportunity to engage in industrial and commercial undertakings .  
Through accelerating the practice of opening up , China should smash departmental and industrial monopoly as well as local protectionism , build up and perfect a nationwide unified , standardized , and orderly market system which is characterized by fair competitions , diversify the principal parts of investment , and bring about a rational flow to and readjust the mix of key production factors ;  
The nation 's discharge of sulfur dioxide , chemical oxygen demand , dust , industrial solid waste and other major pollutants should be cut by 10 percent relative to 2000 ' s level .  In particular , the emission of sulfur dioxide in the " two controlled " zones should be reduced by 20 percent compared to 2000 ' s levels .  
1 .  To coordinate the process of joining the WTO , Taiwan should decontrol direct cross-strait trade and direct postal and telecommunications services , and , considering the Mainland 's moves to lower its trade barriers , appropriately increase and open up Mainland imports .  Meanwhile , Taiwan should also plan to set up an " early warning system governing cross-strait trade security " to take charge of affairs relevant to national security and industrial risks .  
and resolve a number of problems currently facing our economic development , including an irrational industrial structure , a low industrialization level of new and high technologies , and poor market competitiveness .  We should stress launching a batch of engineering projects using new and high technologies , which include high-performance computers , photoelectronic materials and apparatus , the design and manufacturing of submicroscopic and deep-submicroscopic integrated circuits , biological technologies and their industrialization , biochips , and agro-biological projects .  
In accordance with the Regulations Governing the Administration of Recreational Establishments and on the basis of the principle of " protecting what is legitimate , cracking down on what violates the law , and banning what is illegal , " cultural , public security , industrial and commercial departments at all levels , as well as other functional departments , must resolutely ban recreational establishments that are engaged in illegal operations without a license or a complete license .  
Third , take scientific and technological progress as a driving force , use high and new technology and advanced technologies to transform traditional industries and change the mode of industrial production growth according to the actual conditions in Tianjin , promote industrialization by means of adopting advanced information technology , continuously enhance the overall quality and market competition power of the enterprises .  
Principal leader of local governments should bear primary responsibility for industrial safety .  Those bearing direct administrative responsibility for serious industrial accidents should be punished .  Second , the industrial safety management and supervision institutions should be strengthened .  
Aleksandr Nikolasov , deputy director of the National Economic Forecast and Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences , stated : Over the past few years , the Russian Government and industrial circles have attached growing importance to exploiting energy resources in eastern Russia , and with large oil and gas fields discovered and verified in eastern and western Siberia and in Russia 's far east , and proven deposits outstripping future demand in those regions , Russia is bound to increase energy exports by a large margin . 
When being interviewed by this reporter , Yu Zhengsheng , minister of construction , stressed that at present , the dynamism and competitiveness of the construction industry and the real estate industry should be enhanced through structural adjustments , industrial policies , and the work of straightening out and regularizing the order of the construction market , and efforts must be made to turn the construction industry into one of the pillar industries and major economic growth points of the national economy .  
This method of getting enmeshed in a web of one 's own spinning has muzzled Taiwan 's economic vitality and competitiveness , with the result that Taiwan industrial and commercial enterprises have missed good opportunities for coming to the motherland to invest and run businesses , and the upgrading of Taiwan industries and change of economic pattern have been delayed , and this has also become one of the main reasons for Taiwan 's rapid and serious economic recession in the past year .  
We must take effective measures to appropriately lower the prices of industrial raw materials for which there are big price differences between China and abroad , resolutely intensify the work of closing down " five small " industries and knocking out backward production capacity , ensure the prevention of new duplicate construction , strictly control excessive imports of ordinary industrial products , and expand the market space for the development of state enterprises .  
A concerned expert in Beijing today revealed that with the implementation of a great strategy for developing the western region , the state will promote policies in favor of the western region in four fields : The state will appropriate 60 percent of obtainable foreign funds to the western region , permit cities in the western region to issue lottery tickets for the construction of infrastructure facilities , expand the scale of issuance of bonds by local enterprises , and try to establish an industrial investment fund in the western region .  
The concerned expert notes that since the founding of the State Development Bank five years ago , it has implemented the state 's macro-economic policy , industrial policy and regional development policy .  The bank has supported the development in central and western regions and the amount of loans extended to central and western regions accounted for more than 60 percent of its total loans each year .  
We should no longer solidify the previous examination and approval system and the industrial policies of mercantilism , and the government should change its keynote of public policies to more open-minded industrial policies , which include steady and sound macroeconomic policies , transparent legal system , and better external public conditions and facilities .  
Ye Xuanping said that in the past year , the CPPCC National Committee has strengthened ties with personalities in various circles in Taiwan , made extensive contacts with people of the industrial and commercial circles there , and tried in all possible ways to solve problems and do solid work for Taiwan businessmen .  Besides , it has also severely repudiated the " two-state theory " dished out by Lee Teng-hui [ Li Denghui ] and strongly condemned the Taiwan authorities ' acts of trying in vain to split up the motherland .  
Invited member Zhao Jiazhi , who rushed here from the old industrial base of Jilin Province , indicated that , in attending the session this time , he aimed most at gaining understanding of major arrangements made by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council that are oriented toward the new century , especially arrangements on how to develop the western region and coastal regions .

Sheng Huaren said : In its economic and trade work in 1999 , China made good progress in the areas of controlling the aggregate supply , making structural readjustment , deepening the reform , and improving economic returns and was expected to comprehensively achieve the major projected targets .  The economic returns of state-owned industrial enterprises and industrial enterprises where the state holds a controlling interest were distinctly better than in 1998 and could top 70 billion yuan , or 40 percent more than the projected target , for the whole year .  
Laying stress on the metallurgical , textile , petrochemical , nonferrous metals , mechanical , telecommunication , and paper industries , we selectively supported sound and strong enterprises and favored old industrial bases in northeast China as well as the central and western regions and made arrangements for the technological transformation of a number of symbolic projects .  
Wen Jiabao said : The key to successfully develop the country 's vast western region lies in the adjustment of industrial structure .  For this purpose , we should strengthen the role of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy .  Particularly , we should not overlook the current conditions of a large population and limited farmland as well as an increasing population and decreasing farmland .  
He considers Tibet 's present industrial structure as irrational .  With the primary industry carrying too much weight , the secondary industry carrying too little weight , and the tertiary industry being undeveloped , it has the typical characteristics of an agricultural economy .  
Fifth , speaking of the country 's agricultural development , China has adopted a comprehensive policy of readjusting the internal industrial structure of agriculture , promoting an industrialized operation of agriculture , paying close attention to the building of the ecological environment , and speeding up the development of small cities and towns ; and has moved to resolve problems that are currently existing among its peasants and in its rural areas and agriculture .  
Some people generally maintained that the economic structural problems were deep-rooted reasons causing the Asian financial crisis .  To revive the economy , the East Asia countries should exert efforts to readjust the enterprise systems and the industrial structures , attach importance to long-term goals , focus on enhancing international competitiveness , and enhance their national productivity and technological levels through the restructuring of their industries .  
The main factors constraining Russia 's industrial structural adjustment include , firstly , the government 's " passive adaptation " policy .  To fight crises , Russia has been tilted in favor of advantage-enjoying energy and raw material industries in terms of the direction of investment and exports .  This has unavoidably further worsened the already-deformed heavy-light structure .  
We will take the adjustment of industrial structure as the main direction of attack in the strategic adjustment of economic structure , and the internal and external market demands as the orientation for reinforcing primary industry , elevating secondary industry , and developing tertiary industry on the strength of scientific and technological advancement and technological innovation .  
Taking the conservation of energy , reduction of exhaustion , comprehensive utilization , and enhancement of environmental protection results by using new techniques and technologies as the focal points , we will expedite the technological transformation and equipment renewal of traditional industries and old industrial bases , speed up the elimination of outdated equipment and techniques , and reduce excess production capacity in a bid to narrow the gap with the developed countries in terms of production techniques , material exhaustion level , labor productivity , and the varieties and quality of products .  
In the article Wang Hui pointed out that despite an unusual development in cross-strait relations , trade between the two sides of the strait continued to set an all-time record in 1999 and the contracted Taiwan investment amount still posted more than 10-percent point increase , thanks to the joint efforts of the business and industrial circles of the two sides of the strait .  The growth of the mainland exports to Taiwan , however , was down and the actual Taiwan investment amount continued to slide .  
- - Looking at the development of productive force and changes in supply-demand relations : After more than 20 years of great development , the era of shortage where the supply of ordinary industrial and agricultural products could not meet the demand has basically ended ; the buyers market has taken shape ; the objective of economic development has gradually shifted from purely pursuing quantity in the past to giving equal attention to quality ;

Li Tieying stressed : The development of the western regions is a massive and systematic project involving ecological environmental protection , infrastructure construction , industrial restructuring , scientific and technological education , reform and opening up , and ethnic and religious issues .  
She indicated that real strength is the key in participating in international competition , and that improving real strength , such as developing industrial and agricultural product quality , invariably relies on science and technology .  
For a long time , the [ gap between ] economic and social development in eastern and western China has been growing larger , and this is primarily because of differences in scientific and technical levels and capabilities .  The government has already formulated the strategy for the major development of western China , and through the training , development , and effective utilization of S &amp; T human resources , we will improve our economic qualities and industrial competitiveness , bringing about the leapfrog development of the social productive forces in western China .  
With regard to the grain varieties excluded from the scope of purchases at protective prices , grain consuming enterprises and marketing enterprises will be allowed to purchase grain in the rural areas after the examination and approval of the industrial and commercial administrative departments at prefectural ( city ) or county level .  
As to the grain varieties still within the scope of purchases at protective prices , the purchasing channels should also be appropriately widened to allow and encourage the grain consuming enterprises and marketing enterprises to directly purchase grain , subject to the examination and approval of the industrial and commercial administrative departments at provincial level , according to the state policies .  
Second , our country 's economic restructuring has entered a crucial stage , and industries are in a historical stage of large-scale readjustment .  If we do not set up and improve the social security system , it will be impossible to realize the fundamental reform of state-owned enterprises , there will be no way to readjust the industrial structure , and it will be difficult to maintain social stability .  
Wang Shucheng , minister of water resources , indicated that the contradictions between shortage of water resources and accelerated economic development have become increasingly larger over the past few years .  Besides the shortage of water for agricultural and industrial production and domestic use , the drought has directly worsened the ecological environment .  
In order to meet with the challenges , it is imperative for the Chinese government to make some adjustments to its economic policies , vigorously develop modern agriculture , and quicken the tempo of agricultural modernization , upgrading of industrial structure , construction of infrastructure facilities , protection of ecological environment , and development of the central and western regions .  
That is why we must take the initiative in conforming to the trend of the global economic integration , positively readjust China 's agricultural industrial structure , cut down the proportion of grain production , and more thoroughly participate in the international division of labor with regard to grain production and conduct more international grain transactions .  
the manufacturing industrial departments with a medium ( less than 50 percent ) effective protection rate include paper , petroleum , chemical industry , basic chemical products , chemical fiber , rubber , plastics , nonmetallic minerals , ferroalloy processing , and nonmetal processing industry ;  
As the longest river in China , Chang Jiang has 1.7 square kilometers of drainage areas , one fourth of the country 's cultivated areas , and one third of the country 's entire population ; and turns out two fifths of the country 's total industrial and agricultural output value .  The Chang Jiang valley plays a decisive role in China 's national economic and social development .  
Taiwan 's industrial and commercial circle , political sphere , scholars , and media were all disappointed , and even foreign businessmen also indicated their dissatisfaction .  Taiwan 's stock market continued to fall for straight five days .  The general index fell from 9,119 points on 19 May to 8430 points on 25 May , a fall of almost 700 points .  
However , the industrial and commercial circle of Taiwan could not therefore set their minds at rest .  In their thinking , it is absolutely not a simple thing that Ch'en Shih-meng , an official for the " quasi-cabinet " and a long-term advisor to Chen Shui-bian [ Chen Shuibian ] in financial and economic issues , posed the idea of collecting " national security tax " twice in one month , the period from May to early June . The hidden motive and the attempt to sound out the response can not be ignored .  
As a result , although the labor productivity of agriculture in developing countries is the same as that of the industrial sector which is considerably lower than that in advanced countries , the domestic prices of primary agricultural products and their processed and manufactured goods are generally lower than the prices in the international markets , thus enjoying an absolute advantage .  
A wise way to adapt ourselves to the tide of globalization is to exchange concessions in land-intensive grain for a greater export of labor-intensive fresh agricultural products , and to exchange the opening-up of China 's monopolized industries for a greater share in the international market for China 's agriculture and its light industrial and textile industry - - Only this can be said a correct countermeasure .  
The four major economic trends to emerge in China pointed out by Premier Zhu made the patriots see the broad prospect of having opportunities to serve the motherland , made industrial and commercial circles in Hong Kong grasp the endless business opportunities , and made the broad masses of compatriots in Hong Kong see the brilliant future of economic cooperation between Hong Kong and the hinterland .  
In China , the small and medium size enterprises are the important components of the country 's economic structure .  The proportion of small and medium-size enterprises accounts for over 99 percent of the industry as a whole .  With staff members accounting for around 80 percent of the total , their industrial output value accounts for over 60 percent and foreign trade and exports , 68.53 percent .  Almost all the light industry , textile , garments , toys , and metal export products are provided by the small and medium-size enterprises .  
In distributing the productive forces , designing the industrial structure and planning regional development , we should encourage the advanced , stress efficiency , give higher priority to selected projects as necessary , and let good examples spur on others .  We should also pay attention to structural balance and coordinated development , and to gradually narrowing the gap between different regions and between different trades so as to benefit national unity and social stability and eventually achieve common prosperity .  
Zhu Rongji fully affirmed the positive role played by friends of Hong Kong 's industrial and commercial circles in promoting economic cooperation between China 's interior and Hong Kong and common prosperity of the two places .  He expressed his appreciation for friends of Hong Kong 's industrial and commercial circles , who have the tradition of loving the country and Hong Kong by consistently putting the interests of the country and the nation before anything else .  
He hoped that friends of the industrial and commercial circles will continue to exert a positive influence , support the administration of the government of the special administrative region headed by Mr . Tung Chee-hwa , and further play their role in maintaining long-term stability and prosperity of the society in Hong Kong and further supporting the modernization drive in China 's interior .  
Authoritative people have held that , in addition to continuous rises in exports and retail sales of social commodities , another eye-catching bright spot in China 's economy this year is that industrial efficiency has improved and profits have doubled and redoubled .  
According to relevant stipulations , if the two interested parties apply , investigation organs must give an opportunity for both sides to express their opinions face to face .  Therefore , the industrial damage investigation and adjudication committees of the State Economic and Trade Commission decided to hold the current public hearing into the ruling of industrial damage .  
The law on farm seeds adopted at this meeting is of great significance in protecting and using seed resources , standardizing the breeding , production , management , and use of seeds , protecting the legitimate rights and interests of seed breeders , producers , managers , and users , improving the quality of seeds , promoting an industrial management of farm seeds , expediting agricultural development through science and technology , and promoting the development of crop farming .  
In particular , the implementation of measures designed to exercise aggregate control , readjust the economic structure , close down " five kinds of small enterprises , " and eliminate the backward productive capacity has played an important role in pushing for a rebound in industrial efficiency .  
The restructuring of scientific research institutions is conducive not only to making scientific and technological achievements market-oriented , applying such achievements in industrial production , and promoting the optimization , readjustment , and development of our country 's economic structure but to deepening the reform of government institutions , changing government functions , and making it possible for the government to concentrate on the macro - management of all industries .  
The SAR Government has attached great importance to studying and resolving problems left over from British rule such as bubble economy , overly narrow industrial structure base , excessive expenditure , cramming-style education , and the practice of civil servants eating from the same big pot , and has set reform targets to meet the challenge of the new economic era .  
This year additional treasury bonds worth 100 billion yuan were issued and listed in the budget at the start of the year .  While further accelerating infrastructure construction , the central authorities have intensified business technological renovation ; promoted technological advance and industrial upgrades ;  
Such favorable turns and changes were mainly the results of effectively promoting economic growth through the implementation by the state of a proactive fiscal policy , a moderate monetary policy , a policy on industrial restructuring , and a series of measures for macroeconomic regulation and control ;  
As a result of rising oil prices , industrial product prices bottomed out in the first half of the year , with ex-factory prices of industrial products rising two percent and prices of capital goods rising 4.3 percent .  This indicates that with domestic demand expanding , the rise in upstream product prices will cause consumer goods prices to rise , thereby further improving the situation of deflation that has existed for two years .  In addition , enterprise deposits rose substantially .  
For this reason , the State Metallurgy Industrial Bureau decided a few days ago to continue to regard " overall control , structural readjustment , and efficiency " as the focus of iron and steel industrial work for a period of time in the future .  Based on this , only by making the most of the favorable opportunity to speed up enterprise technical progress and carry out enterprise organizational structural readjustment can the iron and steel enterprises smoothly participate in international competition before long .  
Through two and a half years of arduous efforts , the losses incurred by Liaoning 's large and medium-sized state enterprises in the state appraisal list were down from over 60 percent to 39.9 percent , while 80 of 100 large and medium-sized state enterprises under the state plan have undergone corporate restructuring .  The provincial industrial economic operation has not only shown a pickup but also witnessed structural changes , laying a solid foundation for securing a decisive victory in the reform and turnaround of state enterprises .  
Third , by way of structural readjustment , the province should close down a number of small factories and small mines which are plagued by backward production techniques and unmarketable products and which have caused a huge waste of resources and a heavy pollution to the environment ; meanwhile , to meet the demands of the modern enterprise system , the province should extend support to a number of dominating enterprises which have a great bearing on the country 's overall situation , and should further readjust and optimize its industrial structure .  
The amount of profits of the state owned and state holding industrial enterprises from January to May totaled 69.2 billion yuan , a 3.1 fold increase over the same period last year .  This has been rare in recent years .  The state enterprises in the petrochemical , metallurgical , and textile industries have attained outstanding achievements and the trend of development is fine .  
The momentum of industrial economic development was good , in particular , state-owned industries grew rapidly , economic efficiency further improved , and the task of reforming and freeing state-owned enterprises [ SOE ] from difficulties made major progress .  This has laid down the foundation in time for achieving the goal of reforming and freeing SOEs from difficulties in three years , making important improvements to the national economy and bringing into play the vital role of developing it toward a sound cycle .  
The expanded domestic and foreign demand has brought an overall production improvement , with industrial operating quality markedly improved .  It is understood that over one-half of the losing large and medium state-owned enterprises [ SOE ] and state-owned stock-control or holding enterprises have now overcome their difficulties .  
Statistics show that , during the first six months , China 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) grew 8.2% , industrial added value increased 9.9% , the total retail value of social consumables was up 10.1% , investments in fixed assets grew 12.1% , and foreign trade exports increased by 38.3% , so each of the macroeconomic indicators continues to develop in a good direction .  
From the perspective of practice during the first half of the year , expanding the investment in development of the infrastructure and key projects has not only stimulated growth and a recovery in prices in the energy and raw materials area , including cement , steel , and nonferrous metals , etc . , in the first half of the year , it has also laid an excellent foundation for stimulating an increase in the price of industrial consumables and long-term economic development .

A person in charge of the Guangdong provincial industrial and commercial administration bureau said : From January to July this year , the industrial and commercial administration departments across the province listed a total of 37 cases of illegal MLM for investigation and handling and dispersed 3.28 million people involved in MLM .  
As for the orientation of industrial development , according to relevant sources , in the next five years , China will focus efforts on developing high-efficiency and high-quality agriculture and quickening the development of high and new technology industries , including the information industry , biological engineering , new energy sources , and new materials .  The traditional industries will be equipped with high technology .  The manufacturing and machine-building industries will be regenerated , and tertiary industry will also be developed actively .  
Scholars maintained that the adjustment and reform of old industrial bases in mainland China , the unceasing deepening of state-owned enterprise reform , and the development of high and new-tech industries and modern agriculture have provided a vast world for carrying out cross-strait economic and technological cooperation and created more business opportunities for Taiwan businessmen .  
According to the demands of the CCDI and the Central Commission for Judicial , Procuratorial , and Public Security Work , as revealed by people in the know , after September there will be a cleanup and rectification of the law enforcement contingent aside from the successive announcement of the outcome of major and important cases with an impact .  A large number of discipline violators and unqualified personnel in industrial and commercial administration , taxation , customs , and other departments will be dismissed or laid off .  
Various levels of party committees and governments in stricken areas have always treated the anti-drought and disaster-relief task as a priority task and a major matter , tried all means to organize the anti-drought and disaster-relief work , properly helped arrange the masses ' daily life , and ensured the normal industrial and farming production and social stability .  
Third , to facilitate the domestic economic and capital structural adjustment and enhance the international competitiveness of the national industries , it is also necessary to formulate new tax policies and adjust the existing ones under the precondition of flexibly applying the WTO rules and in light of the requirements of the state 's new industrial policies .  
He indicated that , by insisting on being guided by Deng Xiaoping theory and resolutely implementing the spirit of the 15th Party Congress and various plans from the central authorities , and in keeping with the reality of their own situations , the broad cadres and masses in Heilongjiang and Jilin have struggled hard and forged ahead , producing new achievements in the promotion of economic development , the transformation of the old industrial base , Party-building , the establishment of a democratic legal system , and cultural and ideological development .  
New and sophisticated technology and suitable advanced technology should be adopted to accelerate the transformation of the traditional industries , that the ability to produce products which are in short supply on the market , which have high technical contents , and which have international competitiveness should be developed , creating new growth points for industrial development .  
We should persistently promote economic restructuring amid development and maintain a rapid development amid economic restructuring to comprehensively upgrade our industrial structure , raise the standards and economic efficiency of our agriculture , industry and service trade , make a rational readjustment of the distribution of productive forces , promote a coordinated development of local economy and a beneficial interaction between urban and rural economy , and achieve a sustainable development .  
its industrial structure under went gradual readjustments ; social undertakings in areas such as science and technology , education , culture , and health made considerable progress ; the people 's living standards improved unceasingly ; and the relations of equality , unity , and mutual help between different ethnic groups have been further consolidated .  All this constitutes a solid foundation for Tibet 's better development in the new century .  Practice has proven that the party 's ethnic policy and the central authorities ' numerous principles guiding Tibet 's work are entirely correct .  
The active use of foreign investments has promoted sustained , healthy , and rapid development in China 's economy , and particularly promoted China 's economic restructuring and industrial optimization .  It also has provided valuable business opportunities and vast markets to the large number of international investors ; intensified the integration of China 's economy with the world economy ;  
The existing industrial foundations , technological capabilities , rich natural resources , and superiority in labor resources in the central and western regions will provide favorable conditions for foreign businesses to participate in the cooperative development of China 's central and western regions .  
It is necessary to step up efforts to make use of foreign capital and to actively introduce advanced technology , qualified personnel , and managerial expertise from abroad ; efforts should be made to accelerate the readjustment of the industrial structure , to upgrade the industry , to make technological innovations , to raise the quality and grade of products , and to make the products brand-name ones .  
Although the United States calls ethnic Chinese a " model ethnic minority , " quite a number of whites still look down on ethnic Chinese in their heart of hearts .  Faced with the outstanding achievements of ethnic Chinese in the academic , science and technological , and industrial and commercial fields , they have suffered from a psychological unbalance , and the subconscious attitude of repressing and discriminating against ethnic Chinese has been waiting for the right time to break out .  
The main reason for prices to become stable in the first half of the year was due to some short-term factors , such as the hikes of international oil prices , the policy-related increases of house rentals and water and power rates , and dry climate in the north .

The Ninth Five-Year Plan period has become an important phase in which China 's strategy of coordinated development of regional economy has fully rolled out and achieved initial successes .  
The industrial structure in central and western regions has also shown a tendency toward optimization , with the quality of economic operations significantly enhanced .  In the first four years under the Ninth Five-Year Plan , the relative size of the secondary industry in central and western regions steadily expanded ;  
As the industrial structure continues to be optimized , the level of coordination and cooperation between central-western regions and the eastern part of the country will also be continuously upgraded ; the traditional mode of interaction between the resource supplying bases and processing bases will be broken down ; and all-dimension exchanges in capital , technology , human resources , and information will take place between the eastern and western regions .

The economy has maintained steady growth momentum in the first three quarters , and besides the impact of global economic recovery and the brisk international markets , the good situation is due largely to the state 's implementation of a positive financial policy , a sound monetary policy , and the policy to readjust the industrial structure .  
As viewed internationally , just as the rapid development of the modern European and American countries brought by the sprouts of the capitalist production relationship and industrial revolution , the trend of world multi-polarization and global economic integration is increasingly prominent at present , the scientific and technological revolution in the world is advancing by leaps and bounds , and the knowledge-based economy has begun to show an inkling .  This has brought new opportunities and challenges to various countries , which , at the same time , are confronted with a new round of fierce economic competition .  
The other characteristic is that industrial structural readjustment is carried out with a view to not only continuing the completion of industrialization and the shift of agricultural labor to non-farming sectors through industrialization but also propelling industrialization with informationization , transforming and upgrading the traditional agriculture and industry , and vigorously developing the modern tertiary industry that uses more science and technology and provides greater avenues for employment .

Huang Ju said that in the Tenth Five-Year Plan period , Shanghai will , while aiming for the goal and sticking to the mainline of raising the city 's comprehensive competitiveness , constantly raise the information technology , marketization , and rule-of-law levels that are worthy of the name of a metropolis that embarks on socialist modernization and that strives to become a big international city .  It will also make great efforts developing industrial sectors that produce high value-added products , that create business opportunities for other sectors , and that generate more employment .  
Proceeding from raising the city 's comprehensive competitiveness , Shanghai will , during the Tenth Five-Year Plan period , treat the biotechnology , new materials , environmental protection , modern commodity flow as the four potential emerging industrial sectors and gradually nurture them to become new sectors to replace other sectors in the future .  
At the same time we must make strengthening professional training the focal point for raising labor quality , at appropriate times moving technical and industrial training guidance onto the track with professional training as the mainstay .  We must forcefully develop professional education , reform training content , and strengthen the focused nature , practicality , and effectiveness of training .  
The circular said : Currently and in the near future , the key tasks in implementing the policy of the great development of the western region are : speeding up infrastructure construction , stepping up ecological and environmental protection and building , strengthening agriculture 's position as the basic industry , adjusting the industrial structure , developing tourism featuring special attractions of the western region , and developing science and technology education and cultural and public health work .

The state 's funds for various scientific and technological plans should further slant toward the western region so as to provide powerful support and guarantee for the western development .  
At the same time as this , the new authorities ignored the requests of the widespread public in Taiwan for easing up , improvement and development of cross-strait relations , and ignored the urgent requests of numerous industrial and business circles to quicken cross-strait economic interchanges and cooperation .  They still obstinately insisted on Lee Teng-hui 's [ Li Denghui ] " no haste , be patient " policy , saying one thing about cross-strait direct " three links " and meaning another , completely lacking sincerity .  
Thus , the " measures , " which were drawn up based on these principles , are bound to be warmly received by the industrial and business communities on both sides of the strait .  Moreover , they will benefit our Taiwanese compatriots in fully understanding the relevant regulations concerning trade with Taiwan and bolster confidence in cross-strait trade .

As the 1987 poverty relief goals have basically been achieved , the people 's living conditions have improved .  
Hubei has outstanding natural conditions and rich resources .  It is nationally renowned for its scientific and educational undertakings .  With its solid industrial and agricultural foundation , it has the potential for rapid development .  
He pointed out that the year 2001 is the first year for implementing the 10th Five-year Plan in our country .  We must put making great efforts to promote structural readjustment in a prominent position , speed up industrial reorganization and transformation as well as the optimization and upgrading of structure by firmly depending on reform at a deeper level and technical progress , and strive to make considerable and substantive progress in several fundamental aspects and aspects that have a bearing on the overall situation in several years .  
Insofar as Shanghai 's industrial sector at large is concerned , lower tariffs are expected to help textile enterprises , under structural readjustment at the moment , further invite or draw upon advanced foreign technology or products ; to enhance capabilities of developing or introducing new products with hi-tech contents ; or to accelerate structural readjustment as a whole .  
China 's existing economic structure is riddled with problems .  Primarily , the industrial structure ( the primary , secondary , tertiary , and within various industries ) is poor ; regional ( primarily the eastern , central , and western regions ) developments are not coordinated , and the standard of urbanization is low .

China 's forthcoming accession to the WTO , economic globalization , and the country 's participation in the international division of labor in the economic field all require China to make drastic readjustments to its industrial structure , make best use of its advantages and bypass its disadvantages , and enhance its international competitiveness .  This explains why the 10th Five-Year Plan has made structural readjustment its main line .  Structural readjustment has a fairly extensive connotation , and industrial structural readjustment serves as its core content .  
" To take a look at the possible change of a country 's industrial structure , it is necessary mainly to see the speed of its technological changes . "  Lin Yifu commented that the secret of Japan and Asia 's " four small dragons " in making rapid development in the 20th century was to introduce advanced technology .  As for China , it has a tremendous potential in promoting economic growth by making full use of its comparative advantages to introduce advanced technology .  
In the contemporary world , the new scientific and technological revolution is rapidly forging ahead with great momentum , the trend of economic globalization is also gathering momentum .  Many countries , including developed countries , are speeding up their own reforms mainly by actively promoting industrial restructuring .  They are all trying to seize a more favorable and advantageous position ahead of others by stimulating vigor , enhancing strength , and increasing their international competitive power .  
Delegate Zhou Shulian said that in order to ensure the smooth completion of the tasks of structural adjustment , it is necessary to overcome all kinds of institutional obstacles and establish a protective mechanism for structural optimization and upgrading .  By this he meant a mechanism for protecting the effective raising , rational distribution and efficient utilization of funds , talent , technology and other resources .  This mechanism mainly includes a rational economic system , a community of excellent entrepreneurs , scientific development strategies and industrial policies , as well as a sound and effective legal system .

Wen Jiabao said : To raise the level of industrial management of agriculture , first , it is necessary to bring the exemplary and stimulating role of major organizations into full play ; such organizations should form rational relations with peasants , make it possible for them to get material gain , and bring about common development .  
Speaking on environmental protection during the 10th Five-Year Plan period , Qu Geping said : Of all five-year plans , the draft outlines of the 10th Five-Year Plan place the greatest emphasis on environmental protection .  In addition to setting aside one special chapter - - " The Ecological Environment and Environmental Protection " - - to detail the protection plan , it also sets requirements for projects to be accomplished by the industrial , agricultural , and other sectors , thus incorporating the strategy for achieving sustainable developments with the national economic development plan .  
During the Tenth Five-Year Plan , the city of Lhasa will take advantage of the construction of the Tibetan railroad to speed up the readjustment of the industrial structure , actively develop new products that have a special plateau flavor and are sought after on the market , and will work hard to try to make its way into markets outside the autonomous region .  It will enhance the vitality of the local economy and achieve leapfrog-style social and economic development . "  
Second , we must help minority nationality areas in the country 's western region change their traditional way of thinking on the issue of economic development , adopt the principle of " establishing finite targets , and making advances in some fields while retreating from others , " make a full use of the advantages of the country 's western region in having a biological diversity and a nationality diversity , and build up an industrial structure and systems that enjoy distinguishing local features .

With the development of industry and the tertiary industry , the comprehensive productive capacity of agriculture is constantly increasing , and more and more people of the agricultural population will break away from traditional agriculture and move to industrial and urban areas .  
The key to conforming to the general trend of readjusting the world 's economic structure and striving to hold a still more advantageous position in the international and domestic division of labor lies in building up an industrial pattern with optimum structure and high competitive power .  
Taking into account the general law governing the evolution of the industrial structures at home and abroad and the present conditions of the industrial development in Heilongjiang , our overall industrial structural orientation during the 10th Five-Year Plan period should be set on solidifying and improving the primary industry , optimizing and elevating the secondary industry , and accelerating the development of the tertiary industry .  
Second , the industrial structure will be adjusted , the process of industrialization will be quickened , the proportion of the secondary and tertiary industries in gross internal product will be raised to a level closer to the national average .  
The rapidly developing trend of economic globalization that has come at the heels of the new century and the rising tides of the third industrial revolution that are sweeping the world will change the economic , political and cultural order of the world in profound ways .  
10 .  In chapter 10 of " promoting scientific and technological progress and renovation and raising sustainable development capabilities , " " provide technical support for industrial structure readjustment " was revised to " provide technical support for industrial structural readjustment , particularly for the upgrading of traditional industries . "  
Now , we have drawn a lesson from our painful experience .  The new round of industrial revolution in today 's world , like a tidal wave , is not only posing a grim challenge to us , but also providing us with a historical opportunity whereby we can catch up with the new revolution in science and technology and achieve leap-forward development of the productive forces .  
Speaking on China 's economic situation in the past three years , Premier Zhu said , after the Asian financial crisis , China 's foreign trade export had dropped drastically , there had been an oversupply of principal industrial products , and 10 million workers of state-owned enterprises had to be laid off .

Although Hong Kong has not yet established a formal CERC , the normal supporting services of a CERC have , to a certain extent , been provided by the Information Technology Services Department ( ITSD ) and other industrial support organisations like the Hong Kong Productivity Council ( HKPC ) .  These include the issue of warning alert and dissemination of information on the emergence of new computer virus through the media or their web sites , and the provision of advisory services on how the virus should be properly tackled .  
Also , this more than offset the deficit in visible trade , giving a combined surplus ( including an estimate of imports of gold for industrial use ) of $ 3 billion in the first quarter of 2000 , equivalent to 0.8% of the total value of imports of goods and services in that quarter .  
Generally speaking , our assessment is that the rise in local interest rates in the past several months could have some negative impact on Hong Kong 's export , industrial and commercial sectors and hence its Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) , but any negative impact may be cushioned to a large extent by the present strong growth momentum in economic activity . 
This round of the survey covers about 77,000 establishments which are drawn from various sectors including the industrial sector ( mining and quarrying ; manufacturing ; electricity and gas ) , the construction sector , the distributive trades sector ( wholesale , retail and import / export trades , restaurants and hotels ) and the services sector ( transport , storage and communications ; financing , insurance , real estate and business services ; community , social and personal services ) .

We therefore propose to amend the Ordinance to the effect that any initial , annual and balancing allowances granted , and balancing charges made , when the building was used previously as either an industrial or commercial building , will be aggregated with the allowances granted under its current use ( industrial or commercial as appropriate ) to derive the net overall position when calculating the balancing charges or allowances at the time of the building 's disposal .  
The exhibits include archaeological finds , rock and animal specimens , daily necessities , industrial products , philatelic items and objects on topics like Chinese wedding , traditional trades and crafts , commerce and finance , etc .  Special attraction may count on the display of the items collected from various government departments prior to the 1997 Handover and those relating to the Handover Ceremony .  
Due to rapid increase in the population in Sha Tin and indiscriminate discharges from industrial , commercial , livestock and domestic sources , the Shing Mun River was heavily polluted in the 1980s .  The organic pollution load discharged into the river in those days was around 9 000 kg Biochemical Oxygen Demand ( BOD ) per day , which was equivalent to the waste discharged from about 160 000 people .  
Thus , even with a larger deficit on the visible trade account , there was still a combined surplus ( including an estimate of imports of gold for industrial use ) of $ 34 billion in the first three quarters of 2000 , equivalent to 2.5% of the total value of imports of goods and services in that period .

The foundation of democracy was consolidated through local self-government . Agricultural and industrial production increased and economic construction was expanded . Nine years of free schooling improved the educational level . The rich traditions of Chinese culture were rediscovered and rejuvenated .  
The National Science Council , under the Executive Yuan , has established a " Scientific and Technological Information Center " in Taipei , to meet the needs of national economic construction and to serve better the industrial and academic worlds . The main tasks of the center include providing information service , collection of documents , coordination and communication and technological evaluation .  
Despite the changing of the society , industrial development and the tensions of modern social life , the Chinese people still think as highly of the traditional festivals as their ancestors did . With the economic prosperity of the country and the peoples ' continuing respect for their culture , the Chinese celebrate every lunar festival as gravely , gaily and fervently as in countless centuries past .  
To make maximum use of the materials and lands has always been the ultimate goal in our economic reconstruction . It is essential , at this crucial hour , to develop a larger and better labor force and to enhance skills to meet the demands of working capital and of more intensive industrial needs .  
Unfortunately more extensive development of this area has been suspended due to the corrosive properties of the hot water . The steam alone , however , is far less acid , and a feasibility study to use dry steam for agricultural and industrial purposes has been going on since 1974 . The main achievements of the project include a lumber drying kiln , a horticulture greenhouse , and a general laboratory for testing soil sterilization , cereal drying and shrimp and poultry culture .  
During the switch in the social infrastructure from an agricultural to an industrial base , embroidery has proved to be a valuable stabilizing force in cultivating the mind and preserving the cultural heritage , while at the same time earning foreign exchange for the country .  
Even in modern times , as free China marches into the industrial and commercial age , exhibitions and competitions for colorful and graceful kites provide relief from the hustle and bustle of everyday life , and add a splash of color to the environment .  
Work Enriches Students ' Lives As a relative newcomer to the industrial world , Taiwan has been experiencing accompanying changes in its social and cultural structure . In China in the past , academic study was generally re served for the nobility or the rich , while toiling in the fields was the lot of most people .  
Tainan can not compare with Taipei as a political and economic center , and has little chance to catch up with Kaohsiung 's industrial development . But Mayor Su intends to restore Tainan 's faded glory . " We hope to create a city that is both comfortable to live in and enjoyable to visit , " he says .  
But the mainland has been isolated from the rest of the world for more than 30 years , and therefore is backward in industrial production . Its major exports are raw materials and labor-intensive products of low quality , while Taiwan exports semi-finished and finished products .  
If we do not push hard for advanced development , how can we compete with other industrial countries ? For people who assumed nature 's resources to be infinite , the energy crunch of the 1970 ' s was a rude awakening , an indication of impending environmental crises stemming from careless spoiling and waste of natural resources .  
This bustling hub is not only one of the island 's most prosperous industrial centers but is also rich in history and traditional Chinese arts and crafts . Taichung is a unique blend of old and new , offering the visitor an example of Taiwan 's economic development and a glimpse of its cultural heritage .  
In its growth from a poor agricultural village to a modern industrial city , from a labor to a capital intensive industrial economic base , Kaohsiung is a mirror of Taiwan 's overall economic development . Kaohsiung has paid a price for its industrial boom .  
Covering an area of 120 square kilometers , Hsin Tien is bordered by the Taipei suburbs of Mucha and Chingmei in the northeast and the industrial communities of Chung Ho and T'uch'eng in the northwest . The southern area is bounded by scenic Wulai and the charming community of Sanhsia . Hsin Tien is 70% mountainous , an important factor shaping its rather unique development .  
Limited land and natural resources creates real problems for directing future industrial development of the nation 's economy . This , however , is offset by a fabulous pool of human resources reflected in a highly educated population and proportionally high percentage of skilled engineers .  
Ricebowls must be compact , easy to hold attractive , and not burn the hands that hold them . Ricebowls that meet these basic needs sell well ; those that do n't stay on the store shelf . Put simply , industrial design aims to make products more attractive and easy to use , requiring a minimum of human effort .  
Manufacturers generally have been in the role of supplying larger foreign companies and have prospered as their buyers have prospered . However , this strategy has its limits , particularly in the area of independent product development , and Taiwan has not used its own research potential . In addition , the specter of rising labor costs and tougher international copyright and trademark laws have further intensified the need for local manufacturers to do their own industrial design , marketed under their own labels .  
What we are concerned about today is how , during the process of our society 's transformation and while our citizens pursue their economic lives , we can uphold our traditional ethical , spiritual , and moral concepts and fuse this into a harmonious and modern industrial society .  
In the rapidly changing industrial society of today , where values are constantly changing , youths are especially ready and willing to accept all kinds of fresh things and events . With the addition of the all-pervasive modern mass media , it is only natural that young people should have concepts and ways of doing things which are different from those of their elders in the preceding generation .  
Taiwan 's economic structure changed during the 1960 ' s from an agricultural to an industrial base , and its core industries have developed during the 1980 ' s from labor-intensive to capital - and technology-intensive ones . The future job market will require higher quality manpower , and the demand for technical personnel will grow ever larger .  
As to how to clean up the Tamsui River system , Premier Yu stated that his preliminary view is that the main sources of pollution of the Tamsui River system are pollution caused by urban domestic sewage , industrial waste water , and refuse dumped along the river banks .  
According to Wang Ming-yang , a lecturer in industrial engineering at National Tsing Hua University , the problem lies in mass production . In a traditional society , where products were made by hand , clothing and everyday items could be custom designed to fit the individual .  
Unless we further accelerate the training of technical personnel , it will be difficult for us to join the ranks of the industrialized nations . 4 ) Sluggish renovation of technology by private enterprise . The most fundamental reason why the nation 's industrial structure is weak and its speed of adjustment is slow is that the level of creativity in products and production processes is inadequate and technological renovation by private enterprise is sluggish .  
Through this method the level of industrial technology increased and a large sum of capital accumulated which was necessary for research . At the same time it also served to nurture technological talent laying down the foundation for the rapid economic growth of the sixties .  
Currently R . O . C . agriculture has major weaknesses . First , natural agricultural production can not compete with mechanized industrial production , leading to an outmigration of labor , which affects the ability of agriculture to continue to develop ; Second , small farm operations lack economy of scale , leading to a low return on resources , which in turn influences the raising of real incomes of farmers .  
For just this reason , Stan Shih suggested in his presidential report that the government set up four new high-tech industrial parks in northern , central , southern , and eastern Taiwan that would be integrated with neighboring universities , research organizations , and satellite high-tech industrial parks to transform Taiwan into a high-tech island .  
A total of 653 international direct-dial public telephones will be installed at a wide variety of locations , including airports , harbors , train stations , tourist hotels , airline companies , tourist spots , large hospitals , major streets in commercial districts , universities , highway rest stops , industrial science parks , foreign affairs and trade centers , international activity centers , and the directorate 's main business offices .  
Then the quality of daily human existence for everyone will improve immeasurably as we march towards the turn of the century . . Establishing a Science CityAll our cities of today will eventually be transformed into science cities . Our economic infrastructure is based on the development of industrial science and technology . This goes hand-in-glove with the modernization of public facilities .  
By the end of this century , we must establish a complete system of laws and regulations , develop a hi-tech industrial structure , fill the gaps in modernized public facilities , carry out well-planned social security and welfare policies , and at the same time expand our particiaption in international activities . If we succeed in doing this , there is no doubt that we will create an advanced , prosperous , healthy , happy , and more balanced society in Taiwan by the year 2000 .

In 1975 the director of National Central University 's Environmental Center , Lu Shih-tsung , initiated an islandwide survey of Taiwan 's rainfall . His project was taken up by the Taiwan Forestry Research Institute and other university research bodies , together with the EPA . Their report indicated that the rainfall in many parts of Taiwan , such as the central mountainous region , is still " clean , " but the rain in the major conurbations of northern and southern Taiwan , together with certain industrial zones , is becoming more and more acidic .  
Good social welfare systems offer lifetime security , and geographical remoteness has spared people fierce economic competition from other countries of the world . As a result , Australians and New Zealanders are leisurely and carefree , but their economic growth has been rather slow . Their leading exports are still agricultural and mining products , and they rely on imports for most industrial and manufactured products .  
With the arrival of the 20th century , as Australia 's abundant agricultural , industrial and mineral resources were increasingly exploited , more and more investment was devoted to applied research in related areas , Before 1960 , when Melbourne was still the only university in the state of Victoria , faculties and departments with a practical orientation flourished in particular .  
Most downstream pollution comes from industrial and residential sources , but in sparsely populated upstream regions , not only have the water and soil been damaged by tea plantations , fruit orchards and vegetable farms , but excessive use of fertilizers has led to half of the reservoirs becoming infested with algae .  
This is because economic prosperity brought by industrial prosperity has led to luxuriant lives and long-term extravagant consumption of foods which are too rich and have too high a fat content , leading to overburdening the body 's organs , generating in turn obesity , high blood pressure , and diabetes .  
The 1980 ' s was the takeoff period for the ROC information electronics industry . The Hsinchu Science Based Industrial Park and special regulations to reward industrial upgrading were put in place . This was timed just right to give many young scholars who had lived in the US for a few years and acquired great experience the chance to come back to found enterprises , leading to an unprecedented wave of returning talent .  
At noon on May 15,1911 , a riot broke out in the Northern industrial city of Torreon . Three hundred Chinese - - about half the city 's Chinese community - - were killed ; in 1915 , there was a disturbance in another and the mad rioters looted the commercial district murdering over 200 Chinese . In July of the same year , Mexican revolutionary troops and their impoverished supporters pillaged 40 large-scale Chinese owned businesses in Cananea . According to statistics their losses amounted to US $ 5.3 million .  
Q . Some People are worried that with the use of cheap and abundant mainland labor , some of our labor-intensive industries will transfer investment and set up factories on the mainland which could influence the speed of our own industrial upgrading . They are also worried that when the mainland has absorbed our technology and capital , in the future they can turn around and destroy Taiwan 's native industries . What is your view ?  
Despite this , the " neither large nor small " numbers of cases of these illnesses still leave people a little non-plussed when they see them . The threats to life and health from modern industrial society come from stress and environmental pollution - - cancer , heart disease , asthma , infertility , and other " diseases of modern civilization " caused by chemical or biological agents . Have n't these acute communicable illnesses transmitted by bacteria or viruses already been eradicated ?  
When instant noodles first appeared on the market in Taiwan more than 20 years ago - - convenient , tasty and suited to the rapid pace of industrial society as they are - - they were an instant success . But their uniformity of flavor and inability to " fill you up " made it impossible for modern-day people who are pressed for time but still picky about their food to make them a staple of their diet .  
In the 1960s the government struggled to obtain foreign exchange . Under a policy of forcefully pursuing industrial development , record numbers of trees were cut . In 1960 the Yuli Forest District Office was established , and the forest compartments upstream continued to send down such top-grade conifers as red spruce and cypress and such broad-leaved trees as the Nanmu and Formosan Michelia .  
Planning has been completed on a second science-based industrial park , designed to be a future stronghold of high-tech industry . The Ministry of Economic Affairs is promoting the development of 64 promising key technologies such as liquid crystal displays and compact disk drives .  
The rapid development of technology has resulted in a gap between the living standards of the highly industrialized countries and the underdeveloped countries . As a result , the 1.2 billion people in the advanced industrial countries consume seven-eighths of the resources . And the four billion residents of the " Third World " are faced with hunger in many areas . This is also a topic that those involved in science and technology ought to consider .  
These plans were produced by first of all bringing together a group of top-notch scientists , who would perform deep investigations , hold discussions and perform analysis and research before collectively coming up with worldwide development trends . Then related industrial departments would be mobilized to describe their scientific development needs . Finally , in accordance with the special strengths of Chinese research personnel , the three aspects would be integrated , and a most beneficial development plan would be proposed .  
In Pingtan , boats from afar : Let 's return to the fishing industry . Taiwan is surrounded by the sea on all sides , and conditions for the development of the fishing industry were originally excellent , but because of the pollution caused by industrial development and improper fishing methods , the Taiwan coastal and inshore fishing industries have fallen on hard times .  
If the birds only have a place to go , and the environmental impact assessment for the industrial zone can be brought up to requirements and implemented , " no one would oppose the locality developing an industrial park , " says one official at the COA who hopes the local government can enter into reasonable , calm dialogue . Since those closest to the black-faced spoonbill are the local residents , to protect it first requires getting local support .  
The natural distribution of heavy metals has been disturbed and they have been dispersed from their originally secure ecological position . In the course of life and industrial production people lack any real sense of alarm about all this . With the failure to take precautions the situation has gradually become harder to contain .  
Taiwan developed relatively late , so that it was somewhat behind in terms of spraying pesticides , and the most destructive and toxic chemicals had already been banned for use anywhere in the world , so the problem was not so severe as in the advanced industrial nations . This was good luck . But since all that is true , and Taiwan has had the experience of others to serve as a mirror , why is it that today this has become a pressing problem for us ?  
Mr . Bigs should clean up their heavy metal : Faced with the red , blue , green , and other variously colored liquid pollutants generated by the electroplating industry , the industrial community ten years ago thought to follow the example of Japan and establish a special electroplating industrial zone to concentrate the scattered factories in one place and treat the waste water collectively .  
Due to the close relationship between heavy metals and the soil , along with the extremely complex composition of soil , it is much harder to get rid of this kind of pollution than it is when dealing with water and air . More time is required and the technology in this field is not as mature as it is with other industrial environmental techniques . So if you want to improve the problem of soil pollution , the costs are exorbitant .  
Super alliance to explore new industrial worlds : T . H . Steve Chao , deputy director of the Visual Information Technology Division at the CCRL , who has been responsible for laying the groundwork for this alliance , notes that HDTV will be the main-stream of global visual technology in the future . The key relevant technologies include high speed digital signal handling spun off from computer technology , high resolution imaging , and so on ; this will be a major revolution in the visual industry .  
Using green goods is only one part of green thinking . Even more important is lowering demand for material goods , and treasuring the things you already have , " explains Chang Kuo-lung , a professor of physics at National Taiwan University , of the origins of the green tide . He argues that in the two hundred years since the industrial revolution , the large-scale use of non-recyclable materials by mankind has allowed modern people to enjoy the same standard of living as an ancient emperor attended by 200 servants .  
But placing so much importance on marriage and the family has n't made modern Chinese more willing to cleave together as couples . On the contrary , with the change from an agricultural society to a commercial and industrial one with an international orientation , more and more couples are living apart for the sake of pursuing a better future .  
Various units including the Industrial Development Bureau ( IDB ) and the Construction and Planning Administration at the central level to the local city and county governments have mapped out seven industrial parks , three recreational parks , new cities and towns , garbage dumps , and other projects for the west coast tidal land . It is estimated that development will go forward in 13 places , adding more than 40,000 hectares of tidal land , which is equivalent to the area of three Taichung cities .  
Broadly speaking , the work of the ITRI can be divided into two main areas . The first is that of accepting commissions from government units ( especially the Ministry of Economic Affairs ( MOEA ) which directs industrial technological development ) . This includes taking on topical special technology development projects , along with generalities such as assisting in upgrading plans for traditional industries .  
When the government came to Taiwan over 40 years ago , power was in the hands of those labelled as being from " outside the province . " The main industrial and commercial businesses , and economic power , were also primarily " mainlander . " This meant that chairmen , directors and other important leadership posts were largely held by mainlanders , so as to establish good ties between business and the central government .  
At that time , countries all over the world operated on the gold standard , and gold was also required for international trade . It was partly thanks to this shipment of gold that Taiwan , which only had commodities such as tea and sugar to export and which relied on imports for all manufactured goods , was gradually able to transform itself from an agricultural to an industrial society , and to go from having a massive trade deficit to holding foreign exchange reserves which now rank among the world 's largest .  
An expectations gapIn fact , there are some industries where economic conditions are not too bad , and people can find work in their original line . But sometimes , the needs of labor and capital collide . Therefore , despite the fact that there is a severe shortage of manufacturing labor , everywhere you can see laid-off industrial workers drifting to other areas of employment ; it 's very perplexing .  
The broad idea for this was floated two years ago . The hope is that Taiwan can take advantage of its geographic location , orthodox Chinese culture , business connections with overseas Chinese , and solid industrial base to become the regional center for foreign firms coming to the Asian region ( and especially for those firms investing in the PRC ) .  
In Kaohsiung , factories in the industrial district begin spewing out smoke of a strange color . In office buildings in the city 's commercial district , air conditioning units large and small come to a halt . It becomes impossible for more than 300,000 households in the Kaohsiung-Pingtung area to generate the enticing smells of food being cooked . . . .  
In fact , the real cause of power rationing and blackouts can be seen from even a superficial glance : Because of rapid economic growth with a corresponding increase in national wealth , commercial and industrial demand for electricity has risen while consumer electric products have become common . On top of these , Taipower has run into land-acquisition problems and local resistance for plants it planned to develop , so these plants have not been able to come on line in a timely manner .  
But these industries do not yet reflect their real social costs : There is no environmental impact assessment of those social costs , environmental laws are not strict , and industrial investment in pollution control is inadequate . It has been suggested that recently a contradiction has developed between policies governing industry and those governing energy .  
" Starting from late 1994 , as the global economy recovered , demand increased greatly , and this brought sharp rises in the international prices of some agricultural and industrial raw materials , including petrochemical feedstocks , textile fibers , paper pulp , grains , basic metals and so on . Price rises in Taiwan are part of a global chain reaction , " says Liu Fang-jung , a specialist researching prices at the Council for Economic Planning and Development .  
Kris Chen of the Taipei Computer Association , who is in charge of the Industrial Technology Research and Development Office for the VR Industrial Alliance , argues that these conditions present Taiwan with an excellent opportunity . He notes that Taiwan already has a deep foundation in personal computers and integrated circuits . Thus , if VR core technology and peripheral equipment can be developed in time , not only will this spur industrial upgrading in Taiwan , it can reduce current high production costs through mass production .  
After deciding , Yang-who studied mechanical engineering and took a course in " industrial fibers " in college-returned to Taiwan to check out a CETRA exhibition to find machinery . In Taiwan he bought machines designed for combing and laying out cotton , as well as an automated sewing machine . He sent everything over to New Zealand , and altered those parts that were not suited for wool .  
What 's really depressing about this highway is the desolate vista presented by the heavy industry lining both sides . Whatever kind of grey and ugly industrial form you can think of-concrete factories , petroleum refineries , rusting old oil drums , discarded tire dumps , corrugated-steel structures put up without regard to building codes , construction machinery parks , steel smelters , chemical companies , oil pipeline , huge storage towers-they are all here . There 's only one thing you ca n't find , in fact : a tall green tree .  
" If developed according to plan , this will be the best industrial zone in the world , " says Enrique Lai . Fort Davis is blessed by verdant scenery and level terrain ; it is a modern town surrounded by unspoiled wilderness , and yet only fifteen minutes by car from downtown Colon , and ten minutes from the Colon Free Trade Zone .  
In the industrial age , enterprises had to sell a physical product to make a buck . But now that we have entered the information age and acceptance of the idea of intellectual property rights has become widespread , firms have begun to view things as intangible and abstract as technical know-how and business acumen as their most valuable money-making tools .  
And although these kind of knowledge can be recorded in books , such books are difficult to understand and in the end , it is " technicians " who are key . In a how-to manual on industrial espionage , chapter one might mention that if a company wants to protect itself , it must be very careful with high-level technical people it has hired away from other companies .  
In the light of the problems that the case has caused for Bayer , for the DPP and for central and local governments , Taiwan 's political parties have a responsibility to face up to the problems of overcoming political disagreements and formulating a set of realistic and complete methods , which have the confidence of the public , for policymaking , investment approval and environmental impact assessment in respect of major industrial projects . Otherwise , the future may bring more debacles like the Bayer case .  
" In 1982 Chien Ssu-liang , who was then president of the Academia Sinica , visited the East Coast of the United States and gathered together a group of us overseas members of the Academia Sinica , " Luke Yuan recalls . " He noted that Taiwan was doing pretty well in terms of applied science-using science to advance industrial and commercial development . But in basic research , especially in fields dependent on scientific experiments , Taiwan was quite weak . He asked us for our opinions and advice . "  
" Not only do we need to make the environment more suitable , we also need to change our habits and thinking about leisure , " says Lin Wan-yi . Lin says that with regard to Taiwan 's leisure-time habits , you have to remember that the whole society only went from being an agricultural one to an industrial one 20 or 30 years ago . " The traditional Chinese agrarian society did n't operate on a system of weeks . People 's holidays were folk festivals and their way of celebrating them was active and noisy . "  
Taiwan is by no means unique in encountering a growing number of elderly following rapid economic gains and improvements in the quality of medical care . The experiences of the advanced industrial nations in confronting these problems can serve as a reference for us , but we still need to do some basic homework : carrying out surveys about the different elderly age groups here and achieving general recognition of these problems and a consensus about how to deal with them .  
In an industrial society , as extended families living under one roof have given way to smaller and smaller nuclear families , the family can no longer serve the same functions it once did in supporting the needs of all segments of the population . Yet traditional Eastern attitudes , morality and values rooted in thousands of years of history are not easy to change , and they have a big effect on how policy toward the elderly is set .  
He reminisces , thinking back to some of the measures that led to Taiwan 's current level of development . All of these policies , whether the all-out effort to develop the local IC industry , the establishment of the " one-stop shopping " science-based industrial parks , the importation of the concept of venture capitalism or the incentives to high-tech investment that the government provided , were hammered out in discussions between government strategists and Chinese who had studied and worked overseas .  
Unfortunately , in modern industrial society , the structure of family life has changed dramatically . One rarely sees the intimacy of the extended family living all together . Instead people are always busy and there is a feeling of distance between them . This situation not only provides grist for countless films and novels , it is a very real reason why growing numbers of young people are turning to sex .  
Such projects included the building of the Shihmen and Tsengwen Reservoirs and the Central Cross-Island Highway . The provincial government implemented compulsory education through grade nine , encouraged development of coastal marshes and hilly districts , rezoned agricultural land , took steps to prevent excessive concentration of urban land ownership , built public housing , and developed industrial parks . All these measures were taken to create the conditions that would enable Taiwan to vault from the category of developing nation into the ranks of the newly industrialized economies .  
After Taiwan 's economic development shifted to industry and commerce and cities were constructed rapidly , problems of water resource management became more complex , demand for water increased , underground water sources were excessively tapped , hillside development was allowed where soil conservation should have been exercised , and industrial pollution increased steadily . The government 's attention to the subject of water resources never kept pace with the rate at which these problems developed .  
But over recent years , in the pursuit of economic growth , Taiwan has heavily exploited its natural resources . For example , coastal land reclamation and the development of new industrial zones have destroyed valuable wetlands , and when the wetlands are lost the birds ' paradise is lost with them .  
But most worrying are the fish farms spread all over Taiwan 's coastal regions . In some places , abalone pools have been dug into the marine erosion terraces , while in others illegal and excessive pumping of groundwater for aquaculture , along with extraction for domestic , industrial and agricultural use , has caused serious land subsidence in areas covering almost 1,000 square kilometers .  
In many of the more remote mountain districts , the population drain has led to Earth Lords being consolidated together for joint worship , while in major industrial areas , and sites where large development projects are in progress , numerous Earth Lords , suddenly deprived of their own hideaways , now have to cram together at a single altar .  
" The Marshall Islands have a severe shortage of water for industrial use , so it is not appropriate to set up fish processing operations there such as canning factories . But their geographical location makes them suitable to be developed as a Pacific base for Taiwan 's fishing industry , if they are amenable to this kind of cooperation , " says Koo Kuan-min .  
" If it had n't been for the Formosa Plastics mercury waste incident in Cambodia , who knows how long the chaos in Taiwan 's management , storage and disposal of hazardous industrial wastes would have continued , along with the tremendous threat it poses to human health and the environment ? " asks Professor Lin Cheng-fang of National Taiwan University 's Graduate Institute of Environmental Engineering , giving FPG some backhanded credit for highlighting the issue .  
Under the ROC 's " Standard Criteria for Identifying Hazardous Industrial Wastes , " hazardous wastes are divided into three major categories . The first comprises specifically listed substances which are generated by industrial processes or are inherently toxic . The second comprises substances defined as hazardous by their characteristics , including those which are corrosive , flammable or infectious ( mostly medical waste ) , or contain individual non-ferrous metals . This includes substances such as powerful oxidants which may cause other materials to ignite .  
She explains : " Kaohsiung 's industrial structure has long stagnated around the petrochemical and steel industries . Not only is output value low , the environmental costs are very high , and it is almost impossible to raise the quality of life for local citizens . " Upgrading the local industrial structure , she believes , requires devoting more attention to technology . Therefore she hired experts in electronic commerce from Taiwan and from abroad and founded her own company , through which she hopes to improve the e-commerce capabilities of Kaohsiung companies .  
The introduction of foreign labor has been a mixed blessing for Taiwanese society . While helping to provide temporary relief for the labor shortage , keeping the island 's products competitive and easing pressure for firms to move offshore , the policy has also had unwelcome side-effects . Foreign labor has been blamed for undermining the local job market , putting a brake on the pace of industrial upgrading and triggering social problems .  
According to art academic Chiang Hsun , Impressionism , from which sorrow and suffering and even seriousness all seem to be absent , was a product of the first generation to enjoy the fruits of urban life following the industrial revolution . The painter Renoir was particularly fond of showing nudes posed amid nature , depicted with caressing strokes of the brush .  
If we compare him to other Nativist writers who address the tragedy of the rural elderly unable to adapt to the modern industrial world , we note that Huang is reluctant to expose his elderly characters to unmitigated suffering .  
Letting Them Go gathers together ten moving short stories which take as their theme the plight of the elderly in rural communities . The stories respond to the changing circumstances in Taiwan 's countryside , such as the departure of young people for the cities and growing industrial pollution . Speaking in this interview , Huang explicitly stated his purpose in this collection : " I want to bear witness to the plight of the senior citizens left behind in rural communities . "  
Hao Tien-hsia 's words seem a little sad , and there is no banquet of life that does n't come to an end with the guests scattering to the four winds . But what 's important is what lasts : Kao Yang still has his annual dinner , and though these old friends rarely meet , the warm feelings are still there . It 's just that , with the Li-Ku dinner on the fourth day of the year finished , in our modern industrial society , it 's time to go back to work .  
In ancient times Dongguan was covered with lichee plantations whose fruit was favored by the imperial consort Yang Guifei . Just a little more than a decade ago Dongguan was still a largely agricultural area , its landscape a patchwork of rice paddies and corn fields . It has since been completely made over into a " boundless industrial park " with an area of 2,520 square kilometers , a population of more than 5 million , and more than 3,000 Taiwan firms .  
When Taiwan was a primarily agricultural , then primarily industrial , society , most men lived off physical labor . Few bothered to worry about their external appearance . Even office workers dressed the same every day for years on end . Of course , rich kids had the ability to dress up , but they were generally seen as playboys or dandies .  
As Kung Peng-cheng sees it , modern Taiwan society is changing even more dramatically than was society in Zhu Xi 's time . It has inherited the problem of ascendant Western culture and declining Eastern culture that arose in the late Qing , and has added to this the disruptions of industrial and commercial development and rapid modernization . Yet , though Chinese have been arguing for a century about how best to cope with such changes , no very concrete systems have taken shape .  
On May 24 , Premier Tang Fei convened the first session of the new cabinet and outlined six major goals for future administration : ensuring national security and improving cross-strait relations ; eliminating " black gold " ( criminal and corrupt influence in politics and big business ) and raising the standard of living ; speeding up reconstruction work in the September 21 earthquake disaster area ; deepening the industrial structure and recreating the economic miracle ; deepening education reform and strengthening culture ; and promoting the reinvention of government and the raising of administrative efficiency .  
" The KMT lost because it was divided and because of the ' black gold ' issue , and not on account of its administrative track record , " says KMT legislator Chen Shei-saint . Viewed alongside the performance of the world 's other perennial ruling parties , the KMT 's record has been pretty good , with brisk economic growth in spite of environmental protests and the difficulties of industrial upgrading .  
But a flip side to economic growth , something the new administration needs to address , is the worsening problem of unemployment . In the first quarter of this year the number of unemployed climbed to 270,000 people , and narrowly-defined unemployment rose to a new high of 2.8% . Under the combined pressures of industrial upgrading , internationalization and liberalization , Taiwan 's economy is still facing a number of difficult challenges .  
After that fiasco , " investment " became a nasty word for many locals , who recoiled from betting on the economy at the very time when the economy entered an industrial boom that would last for decades . As the rest of Taiwan raced ahead , Chishan remained preserved in its rose-tinted memories of banana money . An agricultural adventurer After Ku 's father passed away his dwindling estate was split up between Ku and his siblings , thus splitting the Ku fortune into still smaller shares .  
The MOEA promotes economic diplomacy in coordination with overall foreign policy . Concrete measures include the following : Based on the " Guidelines for Strengthening Economic and Trade Ties with Diplomatic Partner States in Latin America , " businesses are assisted in accessing agricultural or industrial raw materials , cheap labor , or land in Latin America , and are assisted in creating an international division of labor with Latin America and in penetrating North and South American markets .  
A : Of all the wealthy and powerful countries in the world today , there is not one that does not employ overseas investment to maximize the efficiency of factors of production and to develop overseas markets . In so doing , they achieve the dual goals of improving the domestic industrial structure and raising their international economic position .  
The public is very wary of the nuclear plant , however , and environmental groups have been engaged in a raging debate with plant supporters over industrial policy and nuclear safety . There have been numerous street demonstration against the plant , and many members of the Democratic Progressive Party , including former DPP chairman Lin Yi-hsiung , are among the plant 's leading detractors . Opposition to the plant is one of the DPP 's key policy positions .  
In Taiwan , the Ministry of Economic Affairs ' Department of Industrial Technology , whose main mission is to support the development of industrial applications for new technologies , set up a major R &amp; D program at the Industrial Technology Research Institute ( ITRI ) to develop products making practical use of high-temperature superconductors . The island 's leading electrical wiring and cable manufacturers were the industrial partners for technical cooperation under the program .  
On October 14 , the cabinet 's economic task force further announced eight major economic policies . These included eliminating the business tax for financial institutions , instituting a " no tax hike " policy for this presidential term , permitting the appropriate use of foreign labor , establishing a guarantee fund to provide preferential loans , allowing foreign asset management firms to handle bad loans , assisting small and medium firms to upgrade their technology , leasing out government land in industrial zones , and taking active steps to prevent electricity and water supply shortages .  
Women were dependent , the instruments of reproduction . But the industrial revolution changed all that . Women joined the production lines , home appliances reduced the time and energy women had to spend in the home , and liberated women began to enter society . As women have become equals in terms of financial support of the family , society has been transformed , and the forms of the family have become diversified .  
Advantages that were once monopolized by Taiwan and the other Asian dragons , including close economic cooperation with the leading industrial nations , a cheap and productive workforce , and capital reserves built on the back of high savings rates , have gradually been lost to other countries .  
Plans for the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant have triggered an intense struggle between opponents of nuclear power and those more concerned about industrial development . A constitutional ruling by the Council of Grand Justices appears to have moved the debate back to square one , with the ruling and opposition parties slugging it out once again . ( photo by Hsueh Chi-kuang )  
Kuanshan Township is located in Taitung County , in the flat bottom of the East Longitudinal Valley . The Hsinwulu River runs through the township , and there are high mountains to either side . The majority of the residents are involved in farming , in particular growing Kuanshan rice , which is especially tasty because of the pristine local water . Such industrial activity as there is is of a low-polluting kind , allowing Kuanshan to retain its good natural environment .  
Since the beginning of this year the government has held a series of national conferences on economic development , administrative reform , industrial development , and science and technology . It has also adopted a dizzying array of measures designed to stimulate the economy , including plans to spur domestic demand , bolster the property market , create job opportunities , and promote mergers between financial institutions .  
The Council for Economic and Development ( CEPD ) , which is supposed to take overall charge of economic development policy , failed to play its proper coordinating role . The Ministry of Economic Affairs was consumed by the struggle over nuclear power , and failed to pay enough attention to the need to adjust Taiwan 's industrial structure . The Ministry of Finance was busy trying to support share prices on Taiwan 's stock market , but in doing so resorted to measures that violated market principles .  
Alarms are again going off over public safety hazards in Taiwan . The huge fire that burned through the Eastern Science Park , and the explosion at a chemicals plant in Hsinchu , both in mid-May , caused losses in the industrial sector approaching NT $ 10 billion , forcing both the government and the public to realize the urgent need to set up an integrated and comprehensive public safety system .  
" It 's been no easy task searching for a suitable place to live , and we eventually had to make the leap all the way from western Taiwan to Hualien here in the eastern part , " says Chang . They lived in Lukang before , but when that place started to become affected by industrial pollution , they moved to Meilun in Hualien , where they rented a house .  
These jokers just stand out in storms , posing in front of the camera and talking a bunch of unscientific nonsense . " Liu asserts that important industrial facilities throughout Taiwan need trained meteorologists to monitor atmospheric conditions where expensive equipment is installed , otherwise they will be unprepared to take preventive measures before sudden power outages , storms , or floods occur , and they wo n't be able to seek compensation afterward .  
The finance panel witnessed struggles between government officials and the corporate sector . The corporate sector made a number of proposals including cutting the tax for land value-added in half for two years , freezing collection of the stock transaction tax for one year , and giving government an upper debt limit . However , these proposals would have reduced government revenues by NT $ 95 billion per year . These were also resisted by scholars who argued that they would create a " bubble economy , " as well as by industrial elder statesman Wang Yung-ching .  
As Taiwan 's industrial structure undergoes transformation , we see the traditional manufacturing firms migrating offshore in search of cheap labor , materials , and land . Although this has reduced the ROC 's tax revenues , the industries that have stayed behind , forced to reinvent themselves , have adapted with flying colors to the new structure .  
If it is easy to find a free e-paper that is similar , or if the readers do n't really need the content , it is difficult to achieve the level of appeal required to collect fees , " says Hsu . But it can be done . Currently , e-papers at PChome that do the best with subscriber fees are for language learning and industrial reports . The publication with the most subscribers is iThome , a computer report , with about 10,000 .  
Just as the halls of government were reverberating with heated debate about the shortage of water , on May 8 Taiwan Power , as a result of the drought and increasing demand from the rebounding economy , began rationing power without prior warning . This decision has had an impact on more than 2,000 industrial users . Kuo Jan-tai , a civil engineering professor at National Taiwan University , points out that because the water reservoirs in Taiwan are naturally unreliable storehouses of water , dams usually generate only one-tenth of Taiwan 's electricity supply .  
In 1972 , UNESCO , considering the damage that war , natural disasters , and industrial development have been doing to precious cultural and natural assets , adopted the " Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage . " This set out rigorous and comprehensive conditions for determining what places are qualified to be deemed World Heritage sites ; it also encouraged signatories to apply to have the assets within their territories that are " of outstanding universal value " included on the World Heritage list .  
But those workers who have lost their jobs are quite a different group from the workers in such urgent demand in industry . Michael Hsiao pointed out that those who are out of work have lost their jobs because changes in Taiwan 's industrial structure have made their skills obsolete . Continuing the restructuring of local industry is not going to create jobs for this group . Hsiao argued that the government should instead address the unemployment problem through social assistance measures , and the shortage of workers in key industries through economic policy .  
In 1992 , Chiku Township began planning an industrial park in this area . Conservationists fought the initiative and eventually built a national consensus to " set aside a piece of pristine land for the black-faced spoonbills . " The birds ' nesting grounds were thus preserved , and scholars gradually began to get involved in research and conservation .  
The paper says that the unemployment problem results from the industrial transformation process and reform needs time . Meanwhile , unemployed workers are stuck in a trap and require basic assistance . The government has already implemented an advanced national unemployment policy that has turned from the passive stance of giving unemployment assistance to an active stance of providing employment services and professional training , government job creation , and helping workers change occupations .  
In theory , highly educated children with abundant financial resources ought to have more power to fulfill their filial duties , but an industrial and commercial society values material gain and shows little concern about separation . People of higher status often have to invest more and more energy in their careers . " Why is it that the more people study the less filial they seem ? " wonders Chang Meng-jui , a senior reporter at the Min Sheng Daily who is a long-time observer of social phenomena .  
It 's just that in comparison with the enormously powerful TNCs , domestic companies are still the runts of the litter , and only venture into relatively mature directions in their R &amp; D . Because it is impossible to alter this " hand-me-down-ism " in the short run , it is in Taiwan 's interest that foreign R &amp; D pace-setters are here , because future international industrial trends will be clearer , and local R &amp; D centers can avoid unnecessary detours .  
But the downside of having conquered these illnesses is that the number of patients is constantly falling , so most young doctors prefer to specialize in growth fields like illnesses of advanced industrial societies or problems of the elderly . Virology , bacteriology , and epidemiology are considered " sunset subjects . " The result is that there has been no one to take the baton from the previous generation , and gatherings of specialists in these fields can be mistaken for meetings of a senior citizens group .  
A new policy of " industrial Taiwan , agricultural Southeast Asia " was crafted , and Japan began to actively promote industrial development in Taiwan with an eye to making the island self-sufficient in the event of war in the Pacific . The Japanese contribution to development can be seen in three areas . In terms of basic industry , the " new city " of Kaohsiung , which the colonial authorities began building in 1904 , became the main base for moving farther into Southeast Asia .  
From his welcoming of the Japanese into Taipei in 1895 to his contributions to the Japanese colonial government and to stabilizing social order , he continually maintained good relations with the colonial regime , in return for which he received monopoly privileges for camphor , edible salt , and opium . In addition , the Koos proved bold and adept at grasping trends , making investments , and diversifying their business interests , so that today , they are the only family of these original five to remain influential in industrial and commercial circles in Taiwan .  
Although the rapid expansion of senior technical and vocational education has been able to meet student demand for degrees , another problem has arisen . With the rapid transformation of Taiwan 's industrial structure , there has been an increase in demand for individuals with specific skills . Vocational education now faces the problem of providing people with skills for which there is insufficient market demand . Supply and demand imbalance  
Sun Yung-ching observes that " in industrial education , time is money . " The central reason why technical and vocational students are unable to meet the demands of industry is that the equipment they need to train on is too expensive . Schools are unable to meet the financial burden of constantly upgrading facilities and industry is unwilling to receive students for training in their plants , on the one hand because of the possible impact on output , but also out of genuine concern that students could damage precision machinery .  
As human civilization has moved into the information age , factories , which had been designed with large-scale machinery in mind , have begun to shrink . Moreover , traditional factories , which used to be located in city centers , have been forced to move because of the pollution they cause or because the real estate value of land has come to outstrip its industrial value . This process has naturally left behind some major " industrial relics . "  
In the mid-1990 ' s , Taiwan 's IT industry began to take off , and every major company was fighting for the ever-decreasing , prime property at Hsinchu , making it nigh-on impossible to secure a spot there . Then , in July 1996 , after considering the levels of industrial development in the north and the south of Taiwan , the government began formulating a plan for a " Southern Taiwan Science Park " .  
The dominant influence of NTU-known as Taida to Taiwanese-in political circles can be seen in the fact that the " Taida Gang " accounts for more than 40 legislators , including members of both the governing and opposition parties . And the glory of Taida has not been limited to politics . As Taiwan has made the transition from agricultural to industrial to high-tech society , many NTU alums have from scratch developed chip processing , IC design , and the largest notebook computer factory in the world , similarly producing a brilliant record .  
Eric Lin / tr . by Phil Newell We may only have just opened chapter one of the 21st century , but already the twists and turns in the world are coming so fast that it makes your head spin . Taiwanese have always prided themselves on their adaptability and nose for the latest in global trends , but in an age in which even industrial technology comes and goes in the blink of an eye , even the most agile individual is likely to find him - or herself buffeted by time 's waves into unforeseen directions .  
Originally employed as a machinist , Grandfather Chen lost his job a few years ago as a result of the general industrial upgrading , which led to the closure of his factory . In recent years he has taken a succession of odd jobs to make ends meet . Currently he is unemployed and stays at home taking care of the children . Grandmother Chen , meanwhile , has been operated on for breast cancer and is in poor health .  
A : The cross-strait industrial relationship has been complementary for the past 20 years , but now economic development in the mainland is gradually bringing us into competition with one another . This is true of our ports , as well . Once completed , the mainland 's southeast coastal ports will represent a real challenge to their counterparts in Taiwan .  
Though going through the worst wave of overseas relocations by local industry in history and facing increasingly bitter competition in industrial development , this year , thanks to a turn for the better in the international economy , Taiwan 's economic performance has stabilized .  
It took the US and Europe some two to three hundred years to make the transition from preindustrial to industrial society , and this transition extended into the mid-20th century . It was during this period that the concept of retirement was born as circumstances changed . Concerned about productive forces , capitalists took into consideration the relative physical and technological backwardness of middle-aged and older workers and began to draw up retirement systems .  
head of the chinese delegation told xinhua that " the exhibition is a window aiming at promoting the mutual understanding between china and indonesia , increasing the exchange between scientific and technological as well as industrial circles of our two countries , and seeking channels of cooperation to achieve common development "  
according to experts , the satellite launched today is expected to fly in space for half a month in addition to scientific surveys , it also carries technical experimental devices for plant and animal micro cells and industrial micro gravity  
China 's abundant resources , cheap labor , sound industrial and technological foundation , advancing legal system , and the rapidly growing economy , make itself an ideal investment spot , and a broad market for the Belgian enterprises , the Vice Premier pointed out  
The Vice Premier noted that China and Nepal , as two developing nations , are economically complementary He hoped industrial and commercial circles of the two countries could work out more projects with less investment and quick results to benefit the peoples , and enhance a steady development of bilateral trade and economic cooperation  
the emphasis of the government in the development front is to build a stable , sustainable and prosperous economy where trade will be promoted , a vigorous industrial policy pursued and agriculture salvaged , she noted at her first meeting with journalists after assuming duties as prime minister today  
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 50-44 at 10,887-39 The index fell 16-52 points Tuesday , recovering from a 112 point drop that was triggered by the Federal 's warning of possible rise in interest rates in the coming months if necessary while leaving rates unchanged at present  
To meet the urgent need for increasing human capital and skills , developing countries have continued to allocate to educational services a higher proportion of central government expenditure than have industrial countries .  
To these we must add size and strategic location , economic power - both present and potential - pace of industrial growth and technological progress as well as human and natural resources .  
Growing environmental awareness worldwide has stimulated the development of a complex range of regulations and institutional mechanisms aimed at controlling the adverse environmental effects of industrial and agricultural production .  
Liquid wastes from urban and industrial pollution sources represent about 20 to 40 per cent of total liquid waste generation , but are the major sources of organic pollutants , heavy metals and hazardous toxic chemicals .  
As emphasized particularly by industrial organization explanations of FDI , TNCs generally enjoy specific competitive advantages based on their superior proprietary technological and organizational capacities .  
UNCED further emphasized that gross chemical contamination , with grave damage to human health , genetic structures , reproductive outcomes , and the environment , continues to exist in some of the world 's most important industrial areas .  
The foregoing review has demonstrated the vital importance of groundwater whether confined or not , as a source of fresh water for both human consumption and for industrial and agricultural use .  
In the medium term , this decline in the construction sector can be expected to be reversed given the potential for industrial restructuring , the need for extensive infrastructure investment , and the social pressures for a renewal of the housing stock .  
The globalization of industrial production is likely to proceed at rapid pace and innovative responses will be required to counter growing unemployment and associated social unrest in both industrial and developing countries .  
Those forces conducting port operations continued building a sustainment base , and the multinational force established a complete headquarters for the Joint Task Force commander in the PortauPrince industrial complex .  
Reforms this year included a substantial cut in corporate taxes , sharp reduction in import tariffs on capital goods and industrial inputs , financial sector liberalization and full currency convertibility on the current account .  
The probability of sustained current recovery in the industrial countries would be greatly enhanced if the international community could take credible actions to realize the tremendous growth potential of developing countries .  
They must also adapt to a new form of " upstream " industrial competition determined by specialized skills , quality products , clean technologies , compliance with demanding standards and major investments in research and development .  
Small size also means that our entire society , not just areas of it , is equally vulnerable to dislocations of the global economic system , including currency and commodity price fluctuations , new international trading arrangements , and the changing fortunes of the major industrial economies .  
We have accumulated considerable scientific , technological and industrial potential in developing detection and de-mining equipment which allows us to take part in international programmes for the development and manufacture of promising equipment and technologies in this field .  
Developing industrial and non-industrial planted forests in order to support and promote national ecologically sound afforestation and reforestation / regeneration programmes in suitable sites , including upgrading of existing planted forests of both industrial and non-industrial and commercial purpose to increase their contribution to human needs and to offset pressure on primary / old-growth forests .  
African countries , in particular , required more imaginative long-term solutions to overcome their competitive disadvantage deriving from dependency on primary exports , a weak industrial and export base and technological backwardness .  
The Protocol was a complex and detailed document which empowered the Palestinian authority in a range of fields : imports and customs ; monetary and financial issues , including taxation ; labour mobility and social insurance ; the free movement of agricultural and industrial goods between the two sides ; insurance issues ; and tourism .  
In August 1993 , IMF wrote to ministers of finance , central bank governors and heads of national statistical offices in a number of industrial and developing countries to seek their comments on the terms of reference of the Task Force ; on the role of international organizations in developing standards for finance statistics ; on current arrangements for data collection and sharing ; and on the findings of the questionnaire .  
The Task Force has reviewed current arrangements for the reporting and sharing of finance statistics by international organizations , and notes that there appears to be a considerable and probably increasing degree of data sharing of finance statistics among international organizations , especially through the use of electronic media , which have replaced the use of report forms in the industrial and major developing countries .  
The procedure includes a series of visits by IMF staff to the main international organizations concerned and to official agencies in a number of selected industrial and developing countries , as well as the distribution of an annotated outline of the manual to all member countries for comment .  
China , as a State party and particularly as a developing country with a considerable nuclear industrial capability , strictly abided by the relevant provisions of the NPT to ensure the exclusive use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and had engaged in cooperation with other developing countries in that field , which would increase as his country continued its economic reform and development . 
Conduct educational campaigns to encourage women to use their purchasing power as consumers to promote the production of environmentally safe products and encourage them to invest in environmentally sound and productive agricultural , commercial and industrial activities .  Strategic objective K . 3 .  Establish mechanisms at the national ,  
Hundreds of settlements have been set on fire and destroyed ; government institutions , agricultural facilities and industrial enterprises , medical and consumer services , educational establishments , transport , power and water supply infrastructure and other important amenities have been plundered ; and the communications of the Azerbaijani State have been disrupted .  
A meeting in 1994 of biotechnology managers from more than 40 developing countries , mostly members of the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology ( ICGEB ) , to explore emerging biotechnologies and industrial opportunities revealed that the understanding and appreciation of local entrepreneurs with regard to the economic potential of the biotechnology industry are still very low .  
Programmes dealing with biosafety have expanded beyond the scientific sector to include the concerns of workers exposed to biological agents in the workplace ( ILO ) , farmers ( FAO ) and the general public , while programmes on marine agricultural and industrial biotechnology call for closer cooperation among FAO , ILO , the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) , UNEP , UNIDO , WHO and the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) .  
Bioremediation of polluted groundwater , technologies for containing pollution , biological methods of treating pollution in the unsaturated zone above groundwaters contaminated by past industrial and military activities , and the treatment of extracted contaminated soil are among the topics of the regional ECE Seminar on the Prevention and Control of Groundwater Pollution to be held in September 1995 .  
The Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes ( Helsinki , 1992 ) contains binding obligations to parties to apply best available technologies for the treatment of industrial waste water containing hazardous substances , to apply at least biological treatment or equivalent processes for treating municipal waste water , and to carry out research on the development of new technologies and environmentally sound disposal practices .  
The major areas identified in the Plan are human rights and the promotion of equality ; employment promotion including improving the situation of women in the labour market , women workers in the formal and informal sectors ; training ; working conditions and environment ; social security ; labour legislation , labour relations , labour administration , workers ' and employers ' activities ; women in specific industrial sectors ; and in the different regions .  
As far as production is concerned , the use of input and materials ( intense or otherwise ) and the adoption of technologies ( i.e . , whether they are environmentally sound or not ) may well determine both the level of industrial waste generation and the chemical and physical properties of products , with implications for the use and disposal stages .  
In particular , the more economically advanced developing countries are in a position to transfer to other developing countries the skills and experience , including new and innovative techniques of industrial organization and production and the creative application of technology , that have proved so successful in increasing the productivity and competitiveness of their own economies .  
TACF provides assistance and training to developing countries in the use of nuclear technology for power generation , and for scientific , resource , agricultural , medical , environmental and industrial applications , as well as for activities relating to radiation protection , safety of nuclear installations and waste management .  
Apart from the moderating effect of the unsynchronized pattern of the recession in the major industrial countries , the region 's ability to withstand the adverse impact of the recession can be attributed to the growing strength of domestic markets , intraregional trade and investment links , and the competitiveness of exports from the region , which are now well diversified into a variety of manufactures . 
Within the project on " Coastal Marine Pollution Monitoring and Training : Asia Pacific Mussel Watch " , UNU is seeking to analyse and monitor key hazardous chemicals and substances in the coastal marine areas of the Asia-Pacific region , including relative levels of important agricultural and industrial halogenated hydrocarbons in the eastern Pacific .  
Sixteen recurrent publications .  ( i ) Air pollution ( 2 ) ; ( ii ) national environmental performance reviews ( 6 ) ; ( iii ) environmental series ( 2 ) ; ( iv ) water series ( 2 ) ; and ( v ) revisions to the industrial accidents manual ( 4 ) ;  
Efforts will also be directed to incorporating the secretariat into a regional network linking the main national research centres on industrial restructuring and competitiveness to conduct comparative and overall analyses on the experiences in designing industrial and technological development strategies .  
Article 1 ( c ) of the ECE Convention on the Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents refers to the adverse consequences of industrial accidents on " ( i ) human beings , flora and fauna ; ( ii ) soil , water , air and landscape ; ( iii ) the interaction between the factors in ( i ) and ( ii ) ; material assets and cultural heritage , including historical monuments " .  
Services on economic reforms in the least developed countries ; economic and financial management in Pacific island developing countries ; demographic issues in the Pacific island developing countries ; institutional capability-building , including private sector development for the promotion of industrial investment and technology transfer ; and promotion of sustainable development in small island developing States ; ( b ) Group training , including seminars and workshops .  
In addition , small and medium-sized enterprises require sectoral policies , networking and basic technical support , while the capacity for developing human resources must be built up so that emerging industries in the occupied territories can respond effectively to the new industrial development challenges .  
The SPF secretariat encourages enterprise sector participation in regional industrial development activities through various measures such as ongoing regular and consultation visits to public and private enterprises , liaison with national chambers of commerce and industry , training seminars and workshops , and provision of technical assistance facilities ( a marketing support fund scheme was set up to provide assistance to new exporters , for example ) .  
Most ECDC / TCDC promotional and supportive programmes / activities involve twinning of industrial research institutions ; identification and strengthening of centres of excellence in developing countries to provide industrial training and expert advice ; promotion of joint research and development programmes and linking of chambers of commerce and industry , industrial associations and other relevant institutions in various developing countries .  
Within the framework of ECLAC / UNDP regional project RLA / 88 / 039 , entitled " Design of policies to strengthen the capacity for technological innovation and enhance international competitiveness in the Latin American entrepreneurial environment " , ECLAC and SELA officials held meetings to analyse the possibilities for cooperation in identifying and describing the current status of industrial policy in various countries in the region .  
An effective government planning mechanism is essential if necessary social investment - especially for human-resource development - is to be well designed , and is even more essential for efficient government guidance of the investment process in those countries that choose to have activist industrial , agricultural or other sectoral policies .  
NULLThe UNEP programme dedicated to the Awareness and Preparedness for Emergencies at the Local Level ( APELL ) has been instrumental in translating the broad need for warnings into a process for developing awareness of potential technological hazards and providing effective community collaboration for responding to industrial accidents .  
Starting as a small programme implemented jointly with UNEP to assist countries to implement the prior informed consent ( PIC ) procedure for chemicals in international trade , these programmes now increasingly address a wider spectrum of chemicals management topics , relevant to sound industrial development at both national and regional levels .  
" A technical consultation on sustainable fisheries development in the area of the FAO Western Central Atlantic Fishery Commission ( WECAFC ) , held at Caraballada , Venezuela , from 18 to 22 October 1993 , agreed that the conflict between industrial and artisanal fisheries continued to be a problem in the region , given the difficulties of coming up with equitable solutions .  
Among the key issues which should be addressed were poverty eradication , global macroeconomic policy coordination , industrial development , economic diversification and the development of infrastructures , improved resource flows , including debt relief ; commodities policy ; human resource development and capacity-building .  
In the Cairo Agenda for Action adopted by the OAU Council of Ministers at its seventeenth extraordinary session , held at Cairo in March 1995 , which concerned " Relaunching African economic and social development " , industrial development was highlighted as being central to structural change and to transformation of African economies .  
The main focus of the country programmes , as determined during the missions , will be on the strategic management of industrial development , human resources development , quality control and standardization , the environment , private sector development , with emphasis on small and medium industries , and the implications of the Uruguay Round agreements for the industrialization of Africa .  
The field of basic industries requires massive capital outlay and larger markets beyond the capacity of individual African countries and can therefore be optimally established through subregional and regional cooperation arrangements of multinational / transnational industrial enterprises .  
It was necessary to acknowledge once and for all that atomic radiation was capable of causing considerable damage , but such damage could take on catastrophic proportions in small States and manifest itself in heavy loss of human life and industrial and economic collapse .  
The wireless office for travelling professionals and mobile workers of all kinds seemed to be an almost inevitable trend , as the global economy increasingly shifted from agricultural and industrial employment to service-based employment dependent upon information and data rather than physical resources and specific locations .  
Mr . RUDENSKY ( Russian Federation ) said that the problem of human settlements , which encompassed social , economic , industrial , technological , administrative and environmental aspects , had taken on a global dimension .  
Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;  
With regard to the subprogrammes on food and agriculture , economic and social planning , industrial , scientific and technological development , international trade and development finance , natural resources and energy , and social development , it would be misleading to state that any of them duplicated work done by other bodies and that ECLAC should not be involved in such activities .  
With regard to the subprogrammes on food and agriculture , economic and social planning , industrial , scientific and technological development , international trade and development finance , natural resources and energy , and social development , it would be misleading to state that any of them duplicated work done by other bodies and that ECLAC should not be involved in such activities .  
Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;  
Above and beyond the creation of a dense industrial network , the direct involvement of the State in economic management has made it possible for us to take on the considerable and manifold needs of a population deprived of essentials in the areas of education , health , jobs and housing and to set up an infrastructure even in the remotest corners of our vast territory .  
Today in my country , reform of the public administration system is being carried out in the following ways : the adoption of economic means of stimulating production and business activities ; the restructuring of the national economic sector , with emphasis on leading edge and high technology sectors ; reform of the banking sector ; the creation of conditions for stimulating long-term capital investment and for attracting direct foreign investment to modernize industrial enterprises and to create competitive new market structures ; reform of the system of social protection for citizens ; and so on .  
The immediate consequences of this were the destruction of approximately one seventh of the population , the majority of whom were in the productive labour force ; the destruction of infrastructure and equipment , both public and private ; the collapse of institutions , including the civil service , judiciary and local administration , to mention but a few ; a severe setback in economic activity , particularly agriculture and industrial activities ; the exodus of between 1-million and 2-million people to neighbouring countries as refugees ;  
In contrast with Europe , the absence of a middle class able to launch the process of economic and social development , the weakness of the industrial fabric , the well-known inadequacy of public facilities and national structure were , at the time of independence , major challenges to be met .  Hence the need for State intervention , including through protectionism , to modify the nature of comparative advantages .  
We also support the decisions of the latest summit meeting of the Group of Seven industrial Powers aimed at fighting terrorism and punishing its perpetrators , as terrorism has become a dangerous international phenomenon that has taken the lives of many innocent people , destroyed the infrastructure of many countries , disrupted tourism and the free movement of innocent people and defamed national liberation and independence movements .  
ECLAC has rendered valuable service through subprogrammes on economic development , social development , international trade , development financing and transport , industrial , agricultural , and technological modernization , environment , natural resources and human settlements , statistics and economic projections , the integration of women into development , regional integration and cooperation , economic and social planning and population .  
The full economic and social utilization of those resources for the benefit of the peoples , to uplift them and create and maintain a better way of life , has been retarded by the severe impact of external debt and , concomitantly , debt-servicing costs , declining levels of official development assistance , reduced financial flows for investment and for industrial , business and commercial development , increasing barriers to trade and impaired access to the markets of the developed countries of the world .  
The objectives of the Community , as defined in the Treaty of Chaguaramas inter alia , economic cooperation through the Caribbean Common Market ; coordinated foreign policies ; and creating joint services in such essential sectors as health , education , culture , communications and industrial relations have been methodically pursued through the establishment of appropriate Community structures by its member States . 
For example , even though calls for the promotion of the private sector , increased industrial development and foreign direct investment , and the reduction of external debt in African countries are regularly made in various forums , harsh marketplace reality shows that portfolio equity investment remains virtually absent , and that less than 5 per cent of global foreign direct investment is targeted to African countries .  
Even though it is important to reaffirm a strong commitment of the private sector , donor Governments , agencies and non-governmental organizations to genuine partnership for the accelerated industrial growth of Africa , a critical step must be made to design policies based on the real needs of individual African economies , as development will take place in Africa only when its peoples have democratic control over their own policies .  
The Republic of Belarus deeply appreciates the efforts made by all the programmes , funds and specialized agencies of the United Nations system towards providing increased , speedier and better quality assistance to the various countries and regions suffering from armed conflicts , natural disasters , industrial ecological catastrophes and other emergency circumstances .  
Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;  
A number of other actions can be noted , such as the 1993-1994 ban on the dumping of radioactive waste , sewage sludge and industrial waste and on incineration of toxic wastes at sea , as agreed in the 1972 Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter ( London Convention ) ; ( c ) In relation to programme areas C and D , the legal framework for sustainable use and conservation of living aquatic resources in the oceans has been substantially improved since UNCED .  
The raising costs of urban land and other factors prevent the poor and other vulnerable and disadvantaged groups from gaining access to suitable land , whose location does not pose economic , environmental or health risks to the residents because of its proximity to industrial facilities or susceptibility to natural disasters .  
Because industrial and agricultural activities on the Earth 's environment have reached such a level that their effects are clearly observed on a global scale , continuous and sustainable development action and policies should be carried out for the protection and maintenance of Earth 's natural environment .  
States should develop , as a matter of priority , national environmental programmes to address the protection of the atmosphere , including major local environmental air quality issues such as urban pollution emissions from industrial complexes and accidental release of hazardous material into the atmosphere .  
The scope and scale of the role of forests in providing diverse socio-economic , environmental , industrial and cultural benefits at local , national , regional as well as global levels are now better recognized , and involve many international and regional institutions and instruments .  
The plan has received strong interest from numerous major industrial corporations , national Governments , environmental groups and international agencies .  
Extended producer responsibility ( EPR ) represents one of the most innovative approaches to tackling the problems of rising industrial and household waste volumes ( which may be either physically or politically hard to dispose of ) , rising costs of disposal and human health and environmental concerns relating to the spread of toxic and hazardous substances as a result of dissipative uses of products or inadequate waste management practices .  
The aforementioned 1972 London Dumping Convention for the prevention of marine pollution by waste dumping has been significantly strengthened by amendments in 1993 banning the dumping of radioactive , industrial and incineration wastes ; a new protocol under discussion would ban all marine disposal except in specific cases that could be shown to have no adverse environmental impacts .  
The multidisciplinary mission team consisted of 10 members and included a development economist , a mineral resources expert , an industrial economist , an environmental lawyer , a sustainable agriculture analyst , a fisheries adviser , a natural resources adviser , an institutional adviser , an education adviser and a people 's participation adviser .  
Government and local business representatives should be encouraged to participate in national and international industry and technical groups as a means of facilitating technology transfer , gaining market intelligence , raising and keeping apprised of industry-wide issues and concerns and as a means of formulating long-term relationships with other industrial , government and financial leaders .  Local and national Chambers of Mines should be fully activated and supported in order to act as an effective vehicle for handling industry-wide concerns and effectively working with the appropriate governmental bodies .  
That has required close coordination of macroeconomic policies among major industrial countries to prevent the harmful effects on national economies of any adverse market reactions to actual or perceived changes in national economic situations and associated policies . 
First world environmental standards are becoming increasingly stringent and have moved from regulating obvious pollutants such as sulphur dioxide ( SO2 ) , to controlling , for example , the quality and quantity of industrial wastes , the transboundary shipment of hazardous wastes , acid mine drainage , and heavy metals releases .  
It also asked Governments and agencies of the United Nations system to promote programmes for guiding management and corrective actions to control pollution in the larger coastal urban settlements , specifically in the treatment of sewage and waste disposal , both domestic and industrial , as well as to control pollution in river systems caused by mining industries .  
Constraints to social and economical development strategies will appear and will have to be reckoned with in national planning , possibly imposing unforeseen and unwanted limitations on economic development , self-reliance in food , health , industrial development etc . 
Technical advisory services were provided by the Group on a variety of development issues , covering such areas as : inland water transport ; subregional cooperation for lake basin development ; implementation of the African Platform for Action on Women ; formulation of development priorities , programmes and projects ; economic cooperation and integration ; human resources development and utilization , and energy development ; criminal justice and crime prevention ; mineral resources and development ; agricultural development ; rural development ; industrial development ; and science and technology development . 
Regional development and global changes included published studies on the impact of the single European market on ESCWA countries ; privatization in the Gulf countries and in Arab countries with more diversified economies ; and on industrial strategies in the ESCWA region within a changing international and regional environment .  
In urban areas , it is the poor who most often are forced to live in dense squatter settlements characterized by unsanitary conditions , or near hazardous industrial plants .  
With regard to technical assistance , ESCAP has focused on strengthening national management capacities in developing the financial , industrial , infrastructural , trading and other institutional framework required in managing transition to a market economy .  
INFOTERRA , the Global Environmental Information Exchange Network , is operating through 171 government-designated national focal points ; a network of 8,000 sources of information , including national and international institutions , non-governmental organizations , industrial and commercial enterprises , academic institutions and experts ; 34 special sectoral sources , and 10 regional service centres .  
Impediments to training programmes abroad , which are of the highest importance in replacing expatriate personnel with local technical personnel trained in operating and managing high-technology production units ; this means depriving Libyan experts of the possibility of learning the advanced techniques required to follow the technological changes in the industrial sector of the industrialized countries ;  
Investment lending covers a considerable range of sectors ( industrial restructuring , energy and environment , roads and urban transport and the social sectors ) and aims at supporting private sector development via projects that can help remove bottlenecks , and at improving the efficiency of public sector investments .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 49 / 108 on industrial development cooperation , inter alia , stressed the importance of industrialization to the economic and social development of developing countries ; emphasized the importance of industrial development cooperation ; reaffirmed the central coordinating role played by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) in the United Nations system in the field of industrial development in the developing countries ; and welcomed the process of reform and restructuring of UNIDO .  
In their aspirations to raise standards of living , the developing countries are following the example of the already industrialized countries , and by seeking to build up efficient industrial capacities have chosen the only viable route to achieve lasting economic growth and escape the vicious circle of poverty .  
Since the adoption by the General Assembly of its resolution 49 / 108 , UNIDO has advanced a major process of programmatic and managerial reform , responding to changed industrial realities and support requirements both by a substantive reformulation of its priorities and focus and by internal reforms in management and organizational structure with a view to increasing effectiveness , efficiency and impact .  
The strategic reform of UNIDO , endorsed by member States at the General Conference of UNIDO in December 1995 , has emphasized UNIDO 's dual role as a worldwide forum for supporting and promoting industrial development , and a provider of specialized integrated technical cooperation services .  
In spite of the difficult world economic climate , Tunisia has also managed to achieve encouraging results , illustrated in a rate of growth in national product averaging 4.8 per cent over the last four years ; an increase in non-agricultural industrial exports at an annual rate of 13 per cent ; and an improvement in employment potential , with demand for employment fully absorbed for the first time ; while at the same time the country 's financial equilibrium has been preserved and its external debt brought under control .  
In accordance with article 1 of the Code , these include industrial , trade and agricultural establishments and their dependencies , of whatever nature , whether public or private , religious or secular , even if they are of a professional or charitable nature ; liberal professions , craft establishments , cooperatives , civil law partnerships , unions , associations and groupings of any kind .  
These committees , which operate as special committees of the works councils , are tripartite in structure : in addition to the representatives of management and staff , their members include health and safety officials , i.e . the in-house doctor , the regional health and safety information officer , the head of security and , where applicable , the establishment 's social assistant ; not to mention experts on prevention of industrial accidents and occupational diseases , whom the committee can consult at any time .  
These programmes have been accompanied by specific measures of equal importance dealing with social security , including in particular the reform of the industrial accident and occupational disease scheme , which has produced substantial improvements both in the extent of the cover and benefits , especially those paid to widows and orphans , and in the improvements made in the social security system in the agricultural sector . 
Cancelled : ( ii ) role and implications of macroeconomic policies for promotion of regional economic cooperation ; ( viii ) one issue on new and innovative ways to develop and strengthen industrial and technological skills : and ( x ) one issue on technology indicators and directories of selected research and development institutions , experts and technologies .  
They agreed that the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries should jointly sponsor draft resolutions to be presented by the Group of 77 at the fifty-first session of the General Assembly on the following agenda items : trade and development , cooperation for industrial development , environment and sustainable development , human settlements , population and development , external debt crisis and development , food and sustainable agricultural development , an Agenda for Development and renewal of the dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development through partnership .  
In 1995-1996 , the United Nations Industrial Development Organization 's ( UNIDO ) technical cooperation programmes with the front-line States focused on , inter alia , the following : developing support strategies and formulating policies for accelerated industrial development ; providing support for developing existing industries and industrial infrastructures ; private sector development with emphasis on strengthening private sector institutions ; small and medium enterprises development ; and industrial information investment and technology promotion .  
Recognize that increased use of solar energy can reduce environmental degradation caused by adverse human activities , such as industrial pollution and deforestation , and that it is the responsibility of Governments and all sectors of civil society to work together to find lasting solutions to problems threatening the sustainable development of humanity ;  
Mr . CHUNG ( Republic of Korea ) said that industrialization played a vital role as a catalyst for economic and social progress and that international cooperation had a role to play in industrial development , although the process increasingly was being driven by the laws of the market and by the private sector .  
In order to assist , in particular , small and medium enterprises which had neither the resources nor the expertise required to reduce environmental pollution , strong support should be extended to the concept of environmentally sustainable industrial development and the Area-Wide Environmental Quality Management Plan developed by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) .  
UNIDO played an active role in the implementation of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer , was an authority on environmentally sound industrial development and promoted direct contacts between government officials and representatives of the private sector on a global level .  
For example , in trade policy , when a low uniform tariff rate is applied to all products , any extra amount spent on luxury goods deprives the industrial sector of scarce foreign exchange .  
Subsequently , as the industrial base of the country in the industry concerned is developed and capabilities are acquired , the domestic sector may be exposed to import competition through gradual trade liberalization .  
Natural resource endowments , the level of development of the industrial base and of the physical and communications network , the size of the domestic market and the degree of integration of the domestic economy , the technological capacity and availability of adequate human capital in terms of skills , and the proximity to major production and consumption poles are elements in which developing countries also exhibit differences among themselves .  
Consequently , their main concerns are quite different from those of other developing countries which have already developed some industrial base but which need to improve their productivity and efficiency in order to penetrate international markets or of those developing countries which have developed competitive enterprises and significant export capacity , such as the newly industrializing countries ( NICs ) and a number of second-tier NICs , but which need to sustain their export capabilities by a process of continuous upgrading and productivity improvement .  
The task of regulating the potentially detrimental external effects of intensive industrial activities not prohibited by international law and finding a balance between the profits derived from such activities and the burden caused to third parties could be achieved in various ways , such as through the polluter-pays principle , which was not applicable in all cases , or through a regime of civil or State liability or through a combination of both .  
The issue involved mainly activities typical of modern industrial societies , such as those connected with nuclear power plants , the chemical and space industries and maritime transport of petroleum and other dangerous or polluting substances , which certainly had undeniable political and economic value , but also posed a considerable risk for the safety of human beings and protection of the environment .  
In considering applications on a case-by-case basis , the Committee viewed as inappropriate requests to supply industrial equipment and raw materials , as well as horticultural produce , except fruits and vegetables , to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , unless such applications contained , in every case , specific explanations of how the commodities and products in question were intended to meet essential humanitarian needs ( see press release SC / 6118 ) .  
Yet , foreign direct investment was urgently required in Africa and in the least developed countries for the rejuvenation of the industrial and agricultural sectors and for the effective implementation of structural adjustment programmes .  
The end of the recession in the industrial countries had favourably influenced exports from the region , which had also received a considerable inflow of foreign direct investment and other external financial flows , although these had remained concentrated in a few countries .  
A solid scientific , technological and industrial capability accumulated in developing detection and mine-clearing equipment allows us to participate in promising international programmes in the field .  
A dramatic deterioration of the social and industrial infrastructure and a sharp decline in the provision of social , health and education services , lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes , and a sharp drop in the real income of most families have combined to render large sectors of the population in Tajikistan unable to meet even their basic food needs .  
Emphasis is being given to improving the location of housing , services and employment to reduce transportation needs ; strengthening sanitary measures to reduce the environmental impacts of industrial development , fostering the use of local technologies and materials in construction ; planning and managing incremental housing programmes which minimize consumption of materials and energy ; halting the deterioration of existing housing stock ; and initiating its gradual rehabilitation .  
Implementing measures for the safe and appropriate return of the refugees , their active involvement in the social , political and economic life of the country and the provision of assistance in reconstruction of the housing and industrial and agricultural facilities destroyed by the war ;  
Of the listed persistent organic pollutant ( POP ) pesticides and industrial chemicals that are or have been intentionally produced , other than for the small number of remaining recognized uses , these POPs pose unreasonable and otherwise unmanageable risks to human health and the environment such that :  
That desire becomes even more urgent given that the boundless mind of man has produced numerous miraculous inventions , opening up a new era called the post-industrial era or the information age , while more than a quarter of the developing world 's population still lives in poverty , some 840-million go hungry or face food insecurity , and even in industrial countries more than 100-million people live below the poverty line and 37-million are jobless . 
In view of the special features of biological weapons and the complicated technical factors involved , efforts should be made to realistically formulate relevant definitions , criteria and lists ; clearly delineate activities prohibited and permitted under the Convention ; and , on this basis , explore effective and feasible verification measures , together with measures aimed at preventing abuse , protecting commercial secrets and reducing unnecessary interference in normal scientific research and industrial activities .  
When people talk of the increasing intangibility of the economy , they are speaking about developments in industrial production such as the rapid development of microprocessors for information-related products ; transactions such as communication over the Internet ; productive assets , such as software and research ; and commercial assets , such as patents , goodwill , corporate organization and skilled staff .  
In 25 years , the population debate has evolved dramatically from a narrow focus on population size and growth rates to a more integrated agenda embracing demographic structures , distribution patterns and urbanization , levels of exploitation of natural resources , and creation of viable agricultural and industrial infrastructures .  
Space telecommunications , which are the primary field of commercial applications of space , involve major economic , political , cultural , strategic and industrial stakes .  
Fourthly , FDI inflows should continue to be promoted by the per capita incomes in developing countries of the region , which are rising at higher rates than in the rest of the developing world , and increasing competition in the industrial as well as the developing countries and the resultant pressures on their transnational firms to locate abroad in search of reduced production cost and the strong likelihood of further liberalization of trade and investment policies in developing countries of the region . 
In her statement , the Chairperson-Rapporteur , Ms . Erica-Irene Daes , outlined four major concerns : ( a ) the need for a recognition of the effects of dispossession of lands and habitat on the health of indigenous peoples ; ( b ) the exposure of indigenous peoples to hazardous industrial and military activities ; ( c ) the need to improve access to national health-care systems ; ( d ) the role traditional medical practices could play in national primary health-care systems and the protection of those practices .  
Serve as a mobilizer of ideas and a catalyst for action to promote regional economic cooperation by identifying and addressing major development issues and regional concerns and priorities in trade , investment , financial , information technology , industrial and technological areas , and recommend policy options and measures to achieve tangible results and enhance national capacities to meet new challenges .  
Decide to work towards evolving principles based on sound management of hazardous wastes so as to develop national policies to phase out toxic agricultural and industrial chemicals and trade in hazardous waste ;  
Some progress has been made by the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) since 1995 with regard to drafting essential legal instruments governing economic activity in areas such as private investment , enterprise activity , banking , public finance , industrial zones , standards and safety , civil service and intellectual property .  
Operationally , the UNIDO work programmes were based on the following thematic priorities : formulation of strategies and institution-building for global economic integration ; innovation , productivity and quality to increase competitiveness ; industrial information , investment and technology promotion ; human resource development with special attention to the integration of women in industrial development ; rural industrial development ; and industry-related environment and energy issues .  
The motor of that process was the promotion of an enabling environment that would ensure increased access for the poor to economic services and industrial goods , given that the great majority of poor people in rural areas were self-employed and that their prosperity depended on their having direct access to more and improved means of production .  
Kenya appreciated the role of UNIDO in industrial development cooperation and concurred with the Secretary-General that developing countries increasingly required the policy advisory and capacity-building services of UNIDO in support of their endeavours to create an enabling environment for sustainable industrial growth and international competitiveness .  
In line with the objectives of the Second Industrial Development Decade for Africa , the international community and the United Nations system must strengthen industrial development cooperation for African industrialization in the areas of industrial policy , investment , transfer of technology , institutional and human resource development , and the development of small - and medium-scale industry .  Support was also required for the promotion of regional and sub-regional cooperation as a practical means of enlarging markets and establishing multinational projects .  
Her delegation hoped that within the framework of UNIDO , UNCTAD and other relevant United Nations bodies , adequate support would be extended to developing countries for the removal of structural deficiencies impeding the transformation of the industrial sector and the creation of the conditions necessary for sustainable self-reliant industrialization .  
Thailand believed that industrial development facilitated economic growth and technological change , as well as creating dynamic linkages with the agricultural and service sectors and contributing to foreign exchange earnings that were key to overall development .  
Developing countries increasingly required the technical assistance and capacity-building services of the united Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) , which supported endeavours to create an environment propitious for sustainable industrial growth and international competitiveness .  
Promising directions of cooperation of development of cooperative links in the mining and metallurgical , chemical and jewellery industries and light industry , mechanical engineering , building materials production , military industrial complexes and agro-industry complexes ; the establishment of inter-State industrial and financial groups and joint enterprises ; cooperation between transport department ; harmonization of the actions of the banking systems of Armenia and the Russian Federation ; and other joint actions taken in the light of the mutual economic interests of the two countries .  
The Special Rapporteur affirmed that , owing to their double marginalization as women and as migrants , women migrant workers might easily find themselves in situations in which they were vulnerable to violence and abuse , especially since women migrant workers dominated the informal labour market of most countries , working as domestic , industrial or agricultural labourers , or within the service industry . 
Countries need to systematically increase the use of renewable energy sources according to their specific social , economic , natural , geographical and climatic conditions and cleaner fuel technologies , including fossil fuel technologies , and to improve efficiency in energy production , distribution and use and in other industrial production processes that are intensive users of energy ;  
The Convention is recognized as the first truly verifiable global disarmament accord , with a unique , comprehensive and effective verification regime covering both military and industrial facilities .  
The problem of the widening industrialization and technology gap is acknowledged to be particularly acute in sub-Saharan Africa , with 33 of the world 's 48 least developed countries , while macroeconomic stabilization programmes have been adopted by most African countries since the early 1980s in an attempt to create an enabling environment for long-term growth , they have usually not included any specific measures to promote industrial development .  
In this connection , the Assembly of African Heads of State and Government of OAU at their thirty-third ordinary session , in June 1997 , adopted the Harare Declaration ( Dec . 4 ( XXXIII ) ) on African industrialization in which they , inter alia , decided to redouble efforts to promote sustainable industrial development to overcome major economic and social constraints and achieve a greater stake in the global market place as called for in the Lagos Plan of Action and the Abuja Treaty Establishing the African Economic Community .  
The leaders also reaffirmed their belief that , without sustainable industrial development , African economies would be condemned to persistent economic crisis , dependence on humanitarian relief and deepening poverty , despair and political unrest with dire consequences for global peace and stability .  
The articles in the four publications covered a wide spectrum of issues , including the critical role of the informal sector in the development of indigenous industrial capabilities ; the development of international competitiveness ; the private sector and entrepreneurship development ; privatization in Africa ; the Uruguay Round Agreements and implications for African industry ; and the current status of African metallurgy industries and prospects for the year 2000 .  
Further , implementation strategies advocated were not adopted at the country level , the nascent African private sector was not fully prepared to assume the new responsibilities in the industrial investment process and financial support , including term lending , from both domestic and foreign sources was not readily available for industrial projects .  
This is fully in line with the predominant role of the agricultural sector in African economies , the potential for long-term comparative advantage of agro-based production , the multiple linkages between the industrial and agricultural sectors and their potential socioeconomic / economic impact through SMEs and informal-sector activities , particularly in rural areas .  
At the same time , it is clear from the correlation between export expansion , inflows of foreign direct investment and industrial economic growth that countries following inappropriate policies and lacking adequate skills and technological capacities will be left behind in the globalization process .  
Other organizations interested in the process , such as governments , trade unions , industrial sectors , TNCs and other NGOs , should contribute and cooperate with each other to disseminate , as widely and as homogenously as possible , basic information on EMS in order to guarantee a common ground for achieving the opportunities for a fair development of worldwide trade and avoid negative effects that may arise from an inadequate implementation of EMS in developing countries .  
To the supplementary Ariane-5 programmes at rates ranging from 3 to 6 per cent according to the anticipated activities in these three programmes , with the aim of maintaining the high standard of the specific industrial capabilities established in Belgium since the 1970s and thus preserving their advantageous position in the industrial consortium marketing the launch vehicle .  
Emphasizes that the Business Plan marks a watershed in the history of the Organization , defines activities to be undertaken by the Organization in future , reinforces the continuation of UNIDO in global forum functions and in areas where UNIDO has comparative advantage , enabling it to function as a specialized agency within the United Nations system in the field of industrial development for supporting the endeavours of developing countries and those in transition to achieve sustainable development ;  
Requests the United Nations Industrial Development Organization , the Economic Commission for Africa and other relevant United Nations organizations , in accordance with their agreed mandates , work programmes and priorities , to work closely with Governments and the private sector in Africa at the national , regional and international levels to foster industrial production and development ;  
Emphasis is being given to improving the location of housing , services and employment in order to reduce transportation needs ; strengthening sanitary measures to reduce the environmental impact of industrial development ; fostering the use of local technologies and materials in construction ; planning and managing incremental housing programmes which minimize consumption of materials and energy ; halting the deterioration of existing housing stock ; and initiating its gradual rehabilitation .  
Now we are practically the only country of the Commonwealth of Independent States that had a stable economic growth of about 16 per cent during the first half of this year ; we have arrested the decrease in volumes of industrial production and we are a country free from religious , ethnic or civil strife . 
The Action Strategy begins with measures representing a set of possible early priority interventions , including land title reform ; a new agricultural development initiative and special agricultural economic zones ; promotion of new manufacturing investment through relocation of labour-intensive industries to create industrial estates in the region ; introduction of modern and appropriate technologies ; marketing systems ; and human resource development , including improved skills . 
Although the world community set out on the right path with the adoption of Agenda 21 in Rio , and although steps are being taken on the national and international levels towards achieving our goals , globalization , economic and social disparities , pressing agricultural and industrial needs , serious financial constraints and technological deficiencies all combine to make sustainable development an elusive target .  
In view of the increasing importance of trade and international investment as engines of growth , developed countries must provide comprehensive support , including macroeconomic support , to the efforts of developing countries , as agreed at various OECD ministerial meetings and the summits convened by the seven major industrial countries .  
Joint ventures or other forms of foreign direct investment in developing countries that combine high-tech industrial knowledge of developed countries ' companies with low-tech indigenous knowledge of the host countries ' enterprises could become effective mechanisms for stimulating the demand for ESTs and thus promoting their transfer to , and diffusion in , developing countries .  
The predominant role of the private sector in the transfer and diffusion of ESTs and , more importantly , its leading function in the transition to cleaner production , have increased the private sector 's responsibility for ensuring that technology-related investments and industrial and business operations are consistent with community requirements for sustainable lifestyles and environmental protection .  
On the contrary , experience demonstrates that excessive government interference with trade union rights and restrictions on collective bargaining leads to a progressive build-up of industrial relations tension and eventually can result in severe public protests and widespread strikes , with detrimental effects for economic and political stability .  
Dependence on aquaculture ( mainly inland ) for an important part of future net increases in fish consumption will require improved management of freshwater resources , protection of aquaculture sites from industrial and urban pollution , as well as protection of coastal areas , wetlands and mangrove swamps from irresponsible coastal aquaculture practices .  
First , once they are fully implemented , the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture , market access reforms in manufactured and industrial products , and the phasing out of the Multifibre Agreement in textiles trade are projected to raise global income substantially ( estimates range from an increase of US $ 40-billion to one of US $ 215-billion relative to the 1992 base period gross domestic product of approximately US $ 23-trillion ) .  
In developing countries with a weak industrial base , a rapid and sustained rise in the levels of income depends on increasing investment , which has a very high import content .  
Thus , adopting an integrated treatment of the bases of economic growth , by not only ensuring macroeconomic balance and stability but also directing attention to the industrial base and incentive structures , may do much to enhance the viability of policies that address the environmental and social aspects of sustainable development in individual countries .  
The overall humanitarian situation in Tajikistan has remained critical .  A dramatic deterioration of the social and industrial infrastructure and a decline in the provision of social , health and education services , the lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes , and a sharp drop in the real income of most families have combined to render large sectors of the population in Tajikistan unable to meet even their basic food needs .  
The Penal Code lays down offences of an ecological nature , dealing , for example , with the unlawful destruction of raw materials , trees , agricultural or industrial products or means of production , such destruction being detrimental to national wealth or consumption , as well as with the protection of mammals or marine vertebrates and aquatic species .  
Spain reported on initiatives to combat marine pollution , including the control and monitoring of maritime transport of pollutant products that may have an impact on the environment ; the prevention of pollution from ships ; the monitoring and control of industrial waste or waste from ships ; and active participation in the implementation of specific maritime safety plans in each port , taking into account current provisions including those of the National Regulation for the Admission , Handling and Storage of Hazardous Goods in Ports .  
Many representatives noted that the topic involved mainly activities typical of modern industrial societies , such as those connected with nuclear power plants , the chemical and space industries and maritime transport of petroleum and other dangerous or polluting substances , which certainly had undeniable political and economic value , but also posed a considerable risk for the safety of human beings and protection of the environment . 
The remark was made that the task of regulating the potentially detrimental external effects of intensive industrial activities not prohibited by international law and finding a balance between the profits derived from such activities and the burden caused to third parties could be achieved in various ways , such as through the polluter-pays principle , which was not applicable in all cases , or through a regime of civil or State liability or through a combination of both .  
The United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) has implemented HIV / AIDS prevention projects in sub-Saharan Africa , to meet the combined objectives of industrial development and the prevention of the spread of HIV / AIDS . UNIDO is supporting improved access to and affordability of products used in prevention programmes condoms , latex gloves , syringes , HIV-1 / 2 test kits through development of local manufacturing capability . 
Requests the United Nations Industrial Development Organization , the Economic Commission for Africa and other relevant United Nations organizations , in accordance with their agreed mandates , work programmes and priorities , to work closely with Governments and the private sector in Africa at the national , regional and international levels to foster industrial production and development ;  
However , in Central and Eastern Europe ( including the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ) the difficulties inherent in introducing viable market and State mechanisms ab initio to replace the defunct system of control and command took a severe toll , with sharp declines in industrial output , shortfalls in agricultural production , disruption of trade flows , external financial strains and fiscal imbalances .  
Technical advisory services on economic , demographic , social , industrial , energy and environment , and trade statistics to developing countries and countries with economies in transition ; and ad hoc provision of technical cooperation services on national accounts and computers and informatics ;  
The planned improvement of the mechanism of trade and economic relations must provide for the creation of the necessary conditions for developing market-based cooperation , broader access of Russian and Ukrainian capital to each other 's markets , the development of joint investment projects , the formation of transnational financial and industrial groups and the creation of intergovernmental special-purpose programmes .  
In the twenty-first century , megalopolises and cities of all sizes would become the main centres of efforts to achieve sustainable economic , social and environmental development and , at the same time , hubs of world trade and national and global partnership in the areas of industrial and scientific and technological cooperation .  
Countries need to systematically increase the use of renewable energy sources according to their specific social , economic , natural , geographical and climatic conditions and cleaner fuel technologies , including fossil fuel technologies , and to improve efficiency in energy production , distribution and use and in other industrial production processes that are intensive users of energy ;  
This plan is responsible for all programmes related to desertification , surface and ground water pollution , atmospheric pollution , poor sanitation suffered by rural and urban peoples , poor management of industrial and household waste and population growth and its impact on urban sprawl .  
To the contrary , if shortsighted strategies and options are forced upon us , it can mean an ever-deteriorating situation combining the consequences of war , pollution and unconscionable industrial exploitation : the conspiracy of landmines and industrial waste overwhelming the land , the people , the fragile peace and our common Earth .  
Efforts should be made by the international community and intergovernmental bodies and organizations to establish cooperative relations with the authorities in Afghanistan in order to assist in the eradication of illicit cultivation , production and trafficking of narcotic drugs , especially in the drug-producing areas of the country , and to provide them with packages of aid and the means of economic reform , such as human development and capacity-building , mobilization of resources and industrial development to enable them to resort to alternative sources of income , which would provide better economic possibilities for future generations ;  
The latter provides an incentive to market-based forms of technology and skills transfer both for industrial / infrastructural projects and resource management / preservation ( e.g . enhancing the carbon sequestration service rendered by tropical forests , natural rubber plantations and other commercial tree crops ) in developing countries .  JI projects , in particular in technical infrastructure , may also improve the living conditions of the poor or other disadvantaged groups in developing countries .  
Governments of developing countries have sought to promote industrial development and export expansion not only through macro-economic policies aimed at providing favourable framework conditions , but also through policy measures at the microeconomic level intended to reduce supply-side impediments by accelerating the dynamic process of accumulation of physical capital , skills and technology .  
The content and application of competition law and policy , and its relationship with industrial and trade policies , have varied among different countries at different times , as countries have sought with mixed success to promote the technological capacity and international competitiveness of their industries , compensate for the effects of market failures or ease structural adjustment .  
Governments in all countries that have successfully closed the gap on the leading industrial economies have pursued policies aimed at directing the form and focus of competition , be it between domestic firms or from the international market-place , to achieve specific development goals .  
To date over 80 bilateral agreements covering the economic , trade , scientific , industrial , technical and environmental fields had been signed with developing countries and countries in transition .  
Rapidly rising tariffs , from low rates for raw materials to higher rates for intermediate products and sometimes peak rates for finished industrial products , continue to hamper vertical diversification and industrialization in developing countries .  
Russia , and most of the other countries with transition economies , possessed a developed industrial , scientific and technological base , now operating under difficult transitional conditions .  
The difficulty in providing adequate health care , the continued practice of open drainage , the indiscriminate disposal of waste water and industrial effluents and rampant water pollution have resulted in the creation of mega-slums unsuitable for human living .  
International cooperation was indispensable in containing its contagious effects , but so was a resilient national economy built upon a strong industrial base ; UNIDOs mission was to help build and fortify that industrial base for the benefit of all .  
Bocalandro ( Argentina ) said that the current critical social situation which was due to unsuitable industrial structures , excessive bureaucracy and structural adjustments had been aggravated by the international financial crisis .  
Governments must provide the political and legal framework for sound environmental management and for agricultural and industrial development policies that take into account current and foreseeable health needs .  
Although demand for industrial wood raw material is expected to increase in the future , changes in the product mix and changes in production technology and sources of raw material are likely to provide opportunities for production increases consistent with constant ( or modestly increasing ) prices .  
It made it more difficult for developing countries to make use of their traditional comparative advantages , such as cheap labour and abundant natural resources , since industrial and technological capacity with a solid infrastructural base , adequate human resources and business development were increasingly determinants of economic growth and sustainable development .  
The continuing Asian crisis , which was taking place in countries considered to have dynamic economies based on sound fundamental macroeconomic variables , had clearly shown that macroeconomic stability could not by itself ensure the level of stability that a sustained development-oriented industrial strategy required .  
UNIDO , with its capacity to carry out objective and independent studies of the global , regional , national and sectoral issues that affected industrial development , could provide the developing countries with valuable sources of information and advice in that area .  
Based on past experience and the changes brought about by the rapid globalization of the economy , there had been a growing convergence of policies that encouraged investment in human resources and government responsibility in creating a dynamic domestic framework in which the private sector could play its role as the driving force of industrial development .  
A sustainable industrial policy was a crucial component of development strategies , which included a number of key objectives : open competitive economies , progressive trade liberalization , secure and productive employment , social development and environmental protection .  
The report of the Director-General of UNIDO ( A / 53 / 254 ) included a highly justified critique of the so-called gradual approach to economic and industrial development , which posited a first stage of macroeconomic reforms , followed by a second stage of socio-economic , institutional and legal reforms .  
In his delegations view , the following UNIDO activities should be strengthened : ( a ) attracting foreign investment in the industrial and technological sectors ; ( b ) developing international environmental protection standards for industry ; ( c ) enhancing the role of small and medium-sized enterprises in science and technology and in industry ; ( d ) establishing regional industrial development and ecological production centres ; and ( e ) promoting certification and standardization in industry . 
UNIDO harnesses the joint forces of government and the private sector to foster competitive industrial production , develop international industrial partnerships and promote socially equitable and environmentally friendly industrial development .  UNIDO is the only worldwide organization dealing with industry from a development perspective .  
Hospitals , schools , factories , refugee accommodation centres , private houses and farms , food depots , landmarks of priceless cultural and spiritual value , industrial facilities , and public utility services , such as water supply systems , power plants and Post , Telephone and Telegraph communication centres , have been destroyed or severely damaged .  
While ongoing efforts to reform the international financial architecture and improve economic management will reduce the risks of future crises , there is growing recognition of the need to proceed , in parallel , with efforts to strengthen social policies and institutions , including industrial relations systems and institutions for social dialogue .  
These are particularly difficult times for the families of mineworkers and industrial workers who have no revenues from the land ( poverty ratio of 44.33 per cent ) , poor urban families with a large number of children , families with mentally or physically handicapped members , adults or elderly persons without relatives unable to fend for themselves , pensioners with a minimum pension , urban families who have provided shelter to refugee families from war-torn areas of the former Yugoslavia , etc .  
Contributing factors to the marine environmental deterioration include oil exploration and exploitation , rapid economic growth , overfishing , physical alteration of the coastlines by dredging and filling , discharge of raw sewage , disposal of untreated industrial effluents , and dumping wasted oil and debris .  
These aggregate figures conceal a wide variation in national economic performance , but broadly speaking , in most of the faster-reforming and faster-growing economies of Central Europe and the Baltic States , the growth rates of industrial production have fallen considerably , while in South-eastern Europe the recession in industry worsened in the second half of the year .  
The revised budget for 1998 / 99 also provides for the replacement of obsolete and damaged refrigeration , water-purification and industrial laundry equipment required to support the MINURCA military personnel after the departure of the French logistical contingent .  
Further escalation of military action , barbaric bombings of industrial , social , cultural and civilian targets and the peaceful population are all assuming horrible proportions .  
A UNIDO policy firmly aligned with the broad United Nations global agenda of sustainable human development and poverty reduction through UNIDOs programmatic focus on the three Es of sustainable industrial development : competitive Economy , productive Employment , and sound Environment , at the policy , institutional and enterprise level ;  
The former CIA official stated in this article that the National Security Advisor , Samuel R . Berger , justified the action against the factory by claiming that the plant was part of the " Sudanese military industrial complex " , that it was heavily guarded , that it produced no medicines and that its ownership trail led to terrorist chief Osama bin Laden .  
This would seem to suggest that Governments may follow one of two paths to development , the first encompassing a vision of a free trade economy with heavy reliance on foreign investment and foreign technology , and the other centring on a vision of a deep and diverse industrial sector with predominantly nationally owned enterprises capable of autonomous innovation .  
With daily attacks on the chemical industry and electrical power plants , the NATO forces have caused numerous technological , chemical and industrial accidents throughout Yugoslavia , with wide local consequences and will all elements of transboundary environmental catastrophe .  
During that period COSPAR has also become the worlds largest professional , self-governing body of space scientists , with a membership composed of 40 national scientific institutions , 12 international learned bodies and over 4,000 individual and industrial associates .  
In spite of temporary difficulties caused by the destruction of health and education facilities and industrial and agricultural infrastructure as a result of the natural disasters of recent successive years , our people are full of courage and are firmly convinced that under the Great Leader and our social system they can repair the damage in the shortest possible time and build a rich and strong country .  
It was important to integrate in a flexible way the codified knowledge of universities and international connections with the tacit knowledge embodied in the local industrial system and in its specific production methods .  
The future of life science research in space required enhanced international and interdisciplinary cooperation , scientific excellence and terrestrial applications , which would in turn lead to numerous benefits and industrial partnerships .  
The developing countries , lagging far behind the industrial countries in technological and physical capacities , were expected to follow the same path of pursuing accumulation of wealth and production capacities through the growth of gross national product ( GNP ) and expansion of trade and payments .  
Complementary policies are needed in a number of areas , for example in respect of supporting proper access to investment financing and venture capital ; facilitating access to new technologies and to match-making with foreign partners ; active labour market policies , including retraining for new technologies and activities ; unemployment insurance ; and the provision of basic infrastructure , industrial utilities and complementary services .  
This role may be characterized in very broad terms as ( a ) meeting the rapidly growing demand for energy services in the industrial , transport , commercial , agricultural and household sectors ; ( b ) servicing developing countries rural energy requirements with modern energy carriers ; and ( c ) dealing with environmental problems at various levels .  
In other words , it should encompass the so-called 3 Es developed by the Director-General in connection with the 16 integrated service modules directed towards the long-term goals of sustainable industrial developmentnamely , competitive economy , productive employment and sound environment ( see document IDB . 21 / 10 , part one , p .  12 ) .  
As a multilateral organization with an impressive record of achievements in the industrialization of developing countries and with rich experience in cooperation with the donor countries and international organizations , UNIDO was well qualified to facilitate the flow of resources needed for industrial technical cooperation .  
It was worth noting that the decision had been taken by the Netherlands Embassy in Ethiopia , in close consultation with the Ethiopian authorities , since development experts in the field had concluded that UNIDOs new approach could make a difference at local level , and that the integrated programme would help to promote sustainable industrial development .  
The public and private sectors , civil society and NGOs had participated , together with UNIDO , in the design of that programme , whose implementation was of great importance for the countrys social , political and economic stability , sustainable industrial development being a key factor in creating a more prosperous and equitable society .  
This constitutes an adverse structural shift in the economy , though one which still could be reversed through sustained export growth driven by a combination of domestic and foreign investment and further industrial and agricultural production diversification .  
It was important to integrate in a flexible way the codified knowledge of universities and international connections with the tacit knowledge embodied in the local industrial system and in its specific production methods .  
For example , the ability of developing countries to achieve their growth potential , to close the gap in per capita income with the developed world and to maintain macroeconomic stability is significantly determined by macroeconomic policies pursued by the major industrial countries .  
While mercenaries may be recruited , trained and financed from within solid , stable countries , they are in fact used chiefly in countries affected by political violence , internal armed conflict , insurrection or insurgency and lacking the necessary financial or technical capacity to exploit their natural resources on an industrial scale .  
Thus , Africas struggle to achieve rapid economic transformation will be lost or won depending on how effectively industrial development is linked with agricultural development through enhanced manufacturing value added , productivity and competitiveness , with an accent on employment and income generation .  
The new approach stresses the need for better integrated ( or comprehensive ) technical cooperation programmes , regular dialogue with key stakeholders in the countries , especially those in the private sector , and stronger partnership among United Nations agencies and donor agencies to promote private sector-led industrial development and good corporate governance through interactive policy formulation and implementation .  
To close the income and technological gap between the region and the rest of the world requires a more comprehensive approach , including effective public and private investments in industrial infrastructure , strengthening of technological capabilities through human resource development , institution-building and effective economic governance .  
Within this food and nutritional security plan , PAHO / WHO is promoting mechanisms to ensure the enforcement of existing legislation , as well as the technical norms of the World Trade Organization with respect to food quality , processing , biological , toxicological and nutritional protection and standards for industrial food products .  Agreements have been made with respect to the standardization of laws and support from regional ( i.e .  
For example , the ability of developing countries to achieve their growth potential , to close the gap in per capita incomes with the developed world and to maintain macroeconomic stability is significantly determined by macroeconomic policies pursued by the major industrial countries .  
The two human rights workers were arrested in December 1998 in connection with a popular protest , which turned violent , against the secret import and dumping by local authorities of industrial toxic waste .  They were accused of leading an unlawful demonstration and incitement to violence .  
Fourth , the United Nations Development Programme must prepare studies on industrial projects for manufacturing basic commodities agricultural and mineral where Africa again would contribute raw materials and human resources , and the international investment firms would provide financing and technical know-how in a fair manner applied to all .  
With the acceleration in the pace of globalization in the early 1990s came the expectation that growth and development based on global market forces would be more rapid , more sustainable and more widely shared than in the past , allowing developing countries to narrow the gap with industrial countries and the poorest sections of society to close the income gap with the rich . 
Mr . Rao ( Observer for the World Intellectual Property Organization ( WIPO ) ) said that the objectives of the Decade were close to the nature and functions of WIPO , which was not only the international secretariat for existing treaty bodies relating to intellectual property but was also unique in that it provided direct access to private innovators and industry for the registration of patents , trademarks and industrial designs for the purpose of international recognition .  
At the programme level , UNIDO had developed a portfolio of integrated services to address the challenges of industrial growth in Africa , focusing on the three core dimensions of sustainable industrial development : a competitive economy , productive employment and a sound environment .  
The WTO-regime ( in the specific sense of a trade regime formulated and implemented under the organizational auspices of the WTO ) must be compared not to some idealized global economic democracy but to the most likely alternative a globalized economy shaped primarily by the bilateral efforts of the United States and other advanced industrial countries .  
Transnational organized crime includes tax evasion , the forgery of clothes and electronic equipment , fraud against international financial institutions , unfair competition on international markets , industrial espionage , the import and export of protected plants and animals , trafficking in works of art and the illegal dumping of toxic industrial waste .

The orbital network of spacecraft operated by Russia was carrying out assignments in a range of basic areas , including implementation of international agreements , organization of manned orbital flights and operation of new industrial technology in space , conduct of basic scientific research , creation of global communications and television broadcasting throughout the territory of Russia , and also environmental monitoring and disaster management .  
Regardless of its considerable benefits , nuclear energy is still problematic in one particular aspect : spent fuel and nuclear waste , its interim storage and final repository , especially in small States with limited industrial and scientific capabilities .  
It is encouraging to note that the Agencys role in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy now covers areas ranging from power generation to a diverse array of industrial , medical and agricultural applications .  
We have acquired impressive scientific , technical and industrial potential and expertise in the area of mine clearance which could be put to use in future international programmes in this sphere .  
The theme From farm to factory for a better future embodies my firm belief that Africa , with its endowment of diverse agricultural resources , most of which are industrial raw materials that could be transformed to provide adequate food for the peoples of Africa , could simultaneously improve agricultural productivity , as well as increase utilization of its manufacturing capacity for food security .  
We urge all domestic , regional and international institutions to factor international environmental concerns into mainstream decision-making regarding agriculture and industrial production , trade , economics , transportation and all other economic , social and developmental fields .  
They also take into account our national priorities in such fields as social development strategies for the twenty-first century , health and environment in the context of sustainable development , development of human resources in the field of meteorology , proper management of water resources , integrated environmental management against pollution caused by industrial activity , protection of the atmosphere and the enhancement of the capacity of the States environmental research centre .  
Emphasizing the necessity for the developing countries , in particular African countries and least developed countries , for a domestic industrial transformation of their commodity production with a view to enhancing productivity and stabilizing and increasing their export earnings , thus promoting the sustainable economic growth of developing countries in their integration into the global economy ,  
Pollution of marine and coastal areas from land-based sources of pollution is a major issue for small island developing States ; the pollution is largely from domestic sewage , industrial effluents and agricultural run-off ; in a few larger islands ( for example , Jamaica and some Melanesian countries ) , pollution from mining effluent is also a cause for concern ;

At the regional level , an expert meeting was held in Bratislava to consider national strategies for cleaner production , based on the integration of policies and programmes for industrial development and environmental protection .  
A major reason for the limited growth of agricultural trade has been protection : bound tariffs on agricultural products are , on average , at the same level as bound tariffs on industrial products 50 years ago .  
The three Es competitive economy , sound environment and productive employmentare not isolated targets , but interrelated parts that require a combined approach to achieve sustainable industrial development .  
The development of a strong domestic construction services sector should be supported by instruments of industrial policy , human resource development and macroeconomic policies , and by removing unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles internally .  
But its main task was to promote technical cooperation and implement integrated programmes , always bearing in mind the current technological revolution and the profound changes taking place in industrial organizations , especially transnational corporations .  
The development of a strong domestic construction services sector should be supported by instruments of industrial policy , human resource development and macroeconomic policies , and by removing unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles internally .
