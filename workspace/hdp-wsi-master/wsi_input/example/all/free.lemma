Chinese scientists ' research on human genome has been fully supported by the State 's Program 869 and Program 973 , Natural Science Foundation and others .  On April 21 , the relevant person in charge at the State Natural Science Foundation said in an interview that opening the human gene database to the public free of charge can allow ordinary people access to the cutting-edge science .  The person in charge said the more the public get to know about the innovative science , the more motivated scientists will feel for research .  
We have been all the while upholding the rule of law , keeping an efficient and administration-oriented government as well as honest and competent civil servants .  We have continuously improved qualifications of our working population , promoted free enterprise and free trade , ensured the free flow of information , maintained a stable budget system and healthy financial mechanism , pursued a prudent public financial policy and implemented a simple and clear low rate of taxation .

Adopt " inside the territory but outside the customs " as the jurisdiction model .  Gradually realize the free circulation of personnel , goods , funds between the zone and overseas , and realize full coupling with international markets .  
Moreover , the bonded area has implemented a series of preferential policies towards enterprises entering the area : it has established a system of " no custom accounting " and established manuals and management ; for enterprises engaged in international trade and storage processing in the area , the equipment and materials needed are duty free , and domestic trade continuing to sell out of the bonded area is regarded as export , for which customs provides tax refunds , etc .  
It can be anticipated that in a period to come , the huge demand of the Western Region for building materials , engineering machinery , industrial equipment , electronic products and other supplies will greatly stimulate the production of relevant industries and make a large number of enterprises free themselves from their current situation of operating under capacity .  
The 10-year history of Pudong development also demonstrates the adherence to the strategy of Emphasizing both on economy and ideology and of the ideological education of stressing both spiritual civilization and material civilization as a key reason of the successful development of Pudong . The adherence also is the guarantee of a Party free of corruption , and of a fine social mood .  The Pudong development project stuck to the principle of To accelerate the first-class development project with first-class Party construction .  
Giving free rein to democratic parties and non-party personalities in participating in administration and discussion of state affairs is good for the state 's policies , laws , and major decisions to embody the masses ' will to the maximum and conducive to enhancing the scientific and democratic level of the party and government 's policy decisions .  
It is necessary to safeguard the unity of leading groups to enhance the cohesion force of party committees , uphold collective leadership to strengthen the fighting force of party committees , stay honest , upright , and free from corruption to enhance the appealing force of party committees , and realistically build party committees at all levels into strong leading collectives which can consciously uphold and comprehensively practice the " three represents " .  
Fifth , we must establish a sound mechanism of management to prevent administered and controlled narcotics , psychotropic substances , and precursor chemicals from entering illegal channels .  We must gradually establish an effective mechanism of management based on supervision , control , and cooperation among different departments .  We must continue to improve the import and export inspection mechanism based on cooperation of all departments concerned to ensure trouble free in the process of producing , marketing , transporting , using , and importing and exporting precursor chemicals .  
As a friendly neighbor of ASEAN and a partner of mutual trust and cooperation , China has had a high regard all along for the positive role that ASEAN plays in regional affairs , respecting ASEAN 's efforts to establish a peaceful , free , and neutral region , supporting ASEAN 's economic integration , and hoping to consolidate and expand the multi-level exchanges and cooperation with ASEAN in the areas of economics and trade , science and technology , and society , etc . "  
Enterprises or local labor and social security departments should help military cadres ' families who were laid off because their enterprises gone bankrupt or suspended production .  Enterprises or local labor and social security departments should follow relevant policies and regulations to protect their basic livelihood condition .  Meanwhile , they should provide them with free professional guidance at least once in a year and free employment recommendation three times a year .  
Fidel Castro rose in uprising in the backyard of the United States 41 years ago .  He led the people of Cuba in waging a heroic and tenacious struggle , broke free from the shackles of the United States , overthrew the puppet dictatorial regime of Fulgencio Baptista , and established the independent regime of the Cuban people .  
It was disclosed that the entire system is likely to cost as much as $ 60-billion upon completion .  However , no one is yet sure if the system will serve as " a seamless heavenly robe " free of problems upon completion .  Moreover , as modern science and technology are still developing at lightning speed , it is difficult to tell if the NMD system will end up as a heap of waste material in future .  
The world is still not free from disturbance .  In face of the complicated situation in which international relations are undergoing profound adjustments , opportunities and challenges coexist , political parties of all countries , including the ruling , participating , and opposition parties , are keeping eyes on the 21st century in a bid to explore a development strategy that better fits the trend of the times and their respective reality .  
They should spend more time on studying than entertaining for social purposes , and should pay more attention to making contributions than considering their personal gains .  Each of them should strive to be a person who is pure , lofty , moral , free from vulgar interests and beneficial to the people .  
At this time , we must do an outstanding job on the following key links : first , we must entirely eliminate market barriers to realize self-motivated commodity trading and free commodity circulation and to ensure timely and rapid transportation of domestic agricultural products to the international market .  
The US military reconnaissance plane 's spying activities in the airspace over China 's exclusive economic waters actually overran the scope of " free over-flight " allowed by international law , and violated the relevant stipulations of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea .  
In the wake of former president Lee Teng-hui 's visit to the United States in 1995 , communist China 's air force overturned the decades-long tacit understanding that its fighter aircraft would not venture far over the sea .  After the two-state theory incident in the summer of 1999 , the communist military aircraft even considered west of the strait 's central line as the scope of their free movements .  
These provisions indicate that " other rights " of a coastal country over its exclusive economic zone include its sovereignty and territorial integrity being free from violation as well as its right to protect its national security and peace and other rights granted by international law .  
As mentioned above , the US military reconnaissance plane abused free overflight in airspace over China 's coastal waters , violated flying rules , bumped against and destroyed a Chinese plane , and entered China 's territorial airspace and landed on China 's military airfield without authorization .  That already constituted an incident of serious violation of international law .  
They maintained : On the question of whether the free trade zone plan can be implemented in 2005 , the key lies in whether the developed countries in the north can help the poverty-stricken countries in the south create conditions for participating in free trade competition .  
Economically , the ideology of the Western bourgeoisie emerging in theoretical patterns often serves its economic interests .  For example , the theory of " free trade " has long become the " moral reference " for the developed countries in the West to freely import and export their capital and commodities into and out of developing countries to seek excessive profits for monopolistic capital .  
After developing into an international financial center , with its freely convertible currency , a sound legal system , an environment for fair competition , and the tariff-free advantage , Hong Kong 's free economy will attain further development . 
After the European Union began to function as an integrated regional economic entity , and after the United States pursued trade policies to strengthen the Free Trade Area of the Americas , a new , noteworthy trend has emerged in the Asia-Pacific region since last year , with bilateral and small multilateral interaction in the region taking the place of economic globalization as a primary phenomenon in the Asian-Pacific region .  In some countries and regions , there has been a great upsurge in signing bilateral and small multilateral free trade agreements .  
Given the reality that European and American free trade areas are growing stronger by the day and that various countries and regions in the Asia-Pacific region are choosing bilateral and small multilateral regional free trade as their next best choice , both sides of the strait must consider the question of forming a unique economic area under the constraints of external influences .  
If this situation is not resolved , people will be unable to clearly distinguish between the problems of national position , the independence and reunification issue and values of political parties and ideology , and will be unable to understand that free and democratic human rights can not supersede the framework of national sovereignty and the integrity of territory .  The DPP government of Chen Shui-bian can not let go of their evil intentions in the form of a coalition government .  
We must reform the way elementary education teaching materials are published and distributed to provide rural primary and middle school students with affordable , suitable textbooks , and we must gradually begin to provide free textbooks to children of families having economic difficulties .  
To solve the problem of " insufficient services " from the government in the course of structural adjustment , the party committee and government of Linyi County have intensified market forecast and perspective study , put forward the objectives of building Linyi into a " large agricultural county free of environmental pollution " , and led the peasants in developing ecological agriculture , unique agriculture , sophisticated agriculture , and agriculture in which production is carried out on orders .  
To carry out economic construction as the central task is the basic means and fundamental way out for us to break free of poverty and backwardness , attain all-round social progress in Tibet , constantly satisfy the people 's needs materially and culturally , ensure a constant improvement in the people 's living standard and join the rest of the country in achieving a relatively comfortable standard of living .  
A relevant expert with the State Development Planning Commission has expressed the following view : The fundamental solution to the problem of illegal capital outflow driven by the desire to seek the maximum profit is to allow the free outflow of capital .  
Public feelings became jittery , the investment environment deteriorated , foreign investors showed a lack of confidence , economic depression set in , and the stock market index began its free fall .  People are finding their wealth dwindling and are having a hard time making ends meet .  They have lost their faith in the future .  
They should adapt to the new situation in the context of developing a socialist market economy and free themselves , once and for all , from the ideas , concepts , and approaches of work formed under the system of planned economy .  They should take a step further and change their function from predominantly regulating country markets to regulating the unified national market and from managing the market by mainly relying on administrative means to managing the market by law .  
The Military Region Air Force not only further increased the frequency of no-notice attacks , it also made them more difficult and intense .  When it selected air routes , it broke free of the previous method of using high altitudes and the same routes .  It made a point to select low altitudes , extra low altitudes , and new air routes , to minimize radar warning time as much as possible .  
To break out of the ideological deadlock and be free of the mode of " management by vertical lines of division , " the crucial thing to do is to proceed from the actual need of an integrated battlefield , firmly establish the mentality of the whole and , in light of the uniqueness of the essence of joint operation of various arms and services , build an organizational system that adapts to the blending of various support forces , to the release of various support capabilities and to the optimized allocation of various support resources .  
Of course , immunity is a symbol of sovereignty and its concrete exercise should be correspondingly standardized in a reasonable way .  For instance , vehicles which pass through the tunnels without paying toll should be marked " on relevant duty " whereas vehicles going for a " free ride " on the street for recreational purposes will have to pay toll .  
Fourth , various localities in the western region should work out their concrete plans according to the local conditions under the overall plan of the central authorities on the grand western development .  In drafting the concrete plans , attention should be paid to abiding by the market economic rules , giving free rein to the markets , and making the best use of their advantages while bypassing their disadvantages .  
We are making further efforts to strengthen foreign trade , taking even more flexible measures by reference to preferential policies in free trade zones , and lifting the control over and invigorating in an organized manner the markets of traditional trade with adjacent countries to intensify efforts in opening along the border .  
Therefore , in actual life , freedom of press is a free and democratic right approved [ ren ke 6126 0668 ] and protected by the law .  Meanwhile , there are also specific limiting stipulations to prevent the wanton use of freedom of press in order to more effectively protect the realization of freedom of press .  
In light of the international environment and based on China 's specific conditions , our service industry should be divided into three broad sectors , namely , totally open , totally closed , and partially open sectors , or free , non-free , and semi-free sectors .

The part of cross-strait relations in the new Taiwan leader 's inaugural speech superficially looked mild and prudent in words and phrases and involved no hackneyed and stereotyped expressions openly advocating " Taiwan independence . "  However , if we read this speech more carefully , it will not be difficult for us to find that this new leader did not make any concession on the issues related to principles , did not free himself from the keynotes of " the two-state theory , " and stubbornly adhered to the stance on " Taiwan independence . "  
It is still unknown whether the reform of the new Taiwan authorities , centered on and motivated by " democracy and human rights , " will be effective in the economic sphere to again achieve a miracle in the free market economy .  However , it is conceivable that this reform of " democracy and human rights " and " rule by law " will objectively bring greater troubles for the motherland 's peace and reunification in disregard of the people 's will .  
We have mentioned earlier in this article that the Taiwan authorities , who are holding high the " democracy and human rights " banner , have always vilified the motherland and the Chinese Communists to seek benefits for themselves .  As a result of extensive publicity and slander over a long period , a simple psychological pattern has been created in the Taiwan people that the mainland 's socialist system and the Chinese Communists ' leadership is no good and not free and democratic , whereas Taiwan 's capitalist system is good , free , and democratic .  
During this forum with the theme " Economic Globalization : Development of Asia and China , " 76 participants from China and 20 other countries and areas discussed and exchanged views on economic globalization and its impacts , on the basis of equality and in a free and realistic atmosphere .  Their discussion represented the broad , diverse , and all-embracing characteristics of this type of high-level academic forums .  
When the " 4 June " incident took place on the mother mainland in 1989 , the statements made by the then new Taiwan leader involved the phrases with Chinese historical complex , such as the " free Republic of China " " supported its patriotic compatriots , " who should " closely unite as one " to " realize democratic reunification . "  One-China that Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo followed during their rule of Taiwan for decades can " carefully be observed " in their statements .  
Both sides stand for world multipolarization .  They stressed the necessity [ English version uses " need " ] to establish an equitable , just , fair and reasonable new international political and economic order that is free of hegemonism and power politics and is based on equality .  They indicated their readiness to work together for the establishment of such a new order .  
The two sides are committed to a world free from nuclear , biological or chemical weapons .  They stressed that the international regime for eliminating and prohibiting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction should be permanently and indiscriminately applicable to all regions and countries with no exception .  
This policy forced the Kuomintang authorities in Taiwan to lift the Martial Law at the end of 1986 and to open up indirect " three links " on both sides of the strait , enabled Taiwan to have opportunities to carry out a series of social , political and economic reforms under a peaceful environment , and facilitated democratic politics and free market economy in Taiwan .  
When conducting a " strategic security tour " to Washington in April 1999 , he had extensive contacts with US congressmen and officials .  One of his purposes was to " express firmly to them that the security , dignity , and development in Taiwan must be safeguarded and supported .  A free and democratic Taiwan is the key to global strategic security and one of the links in US national interests . "  
When the Five-Starred flag rose up slowly on both banks of the Victoria Harbor three years ago , people were filled with great joy , yet there was still a faint trace of worry on their mind : After Hong Kong returns to socialist China , will this " free port " be able to retain its original vigor and appeal , and will it continue to enjoy prosperity and stability ?  
( 2 ) Such arenas and facilities as " patriotic education bases , " " science and technology education bases for teenagers , " and " moral education bases " named by the state and relevant provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal departments must be open to teenage students at low rates or , given attempts are vigorously made to create the conditions , for free .  
( 3 ) All other types of public cultural facilities - - museums , memorial halls , science and technology halls , cultural centers ( stations ) , sports arenas ( gymnasiums ) , theaters , workers ' cultural palaces ( clubs ) - - and enterprises and institutions , cultural and sports facilities affiliated with social group , and extracurricular education facilities must uphold the principle of public welfare , extend the hours opened to teenage students , and be open to teenage students for free or at low rates during festivals and holidays .  
It has been revealed that each test costs some $ 100 million , a preliminary system would cost $ 10 billion , and the entire system could cost as much as $ 60 billion .  Even after spending so much money , no one can say with certainty that the completed system would be flawless and problem free .  Besides , with the rapid development of modern science and technology , it is difficult to predict that the NMD would not become a pile of trash in the future .  
In addition , through strengthening bilateral ties , Russia has correspondingly established a partial balancing mechanism within east and west , with the result that its own activities on the international stage have become more free and its international influence has further expanded .  
He said : China has consistently pursued the principle of non-interference in other countries ' internal affairs and respected the choice of the Yugoslav people .  China believes that the Yugoslav people are fully capable of solving their current problem free from external interference .  
After comparing the completely different prospects for the stock markets across the Taiwan strait , Kao Ching-yuan , chairman of Taiwan 's President Group , and Wang You-zen , chairman of Taiwan 's Libar group , pointed out in a clear-cut manner at a forum sponsored by the TAIEX and attended by heads of Taiwan 's listed companies that the free fall of Taiwan 's stock market was not due to the economic factors .  Wang You-zen was more direct , saying " human factor " was the cause of Taiwan 's stock market blue .  
For a long period of time , people in China are accustomed to regarding culture as a social welfare undertaking ; and the government has spent money on running the cultural undertaking and provided it as a free welfare service for its residents , unaware that culture itself is also a precious social and economic resource .  
However , it is expected to be nearly impossible that the two sides will sign any substantive agreement on forming free trade ties in the near future , and even less probable they will establish a " China-ASEAN free trade zone , " because that will involve a lot of complicated issues .  
When carrying out education on the " three stresses , " the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee has remained in close contact with the reality of state-run enterprise reform , has enhanced its understanding , has united its thinking , and has adopted vigorous measures in the areas of adjusting structures , reforming organizations and systems , and focusing on the restructuring of large enterprises while giving free hand to small ones .  It has provided a powerful force for promoting reform of the state-run enterprises and for extricating them from their difficulties .  
After going through the " three stresses " campaign , the thinking of every locality is much more free and the spirit is much more inspired ; conspicuous problems , problems of hotspots , and problems of difficult points that all appeared in the process of reform and development have been solved ; the cohesive power and fighting strength of Party organizations have been strengthened ;  
in particular , political forces standing for human rights and environmental protection and opposing free trade have continually expanded , with the result that it was very difficult for Gore to build a broad and close-knit Democratic Party campaign alliance . 
while trade unions , environmental protection and human rights organizations within the Democratic Party are quite active in recent years , opposing free trade and intensifying their liberal stand on many social issues .  
Schools must actively mobilize themselves , proceed on the basis of their own situations , study and formulate realistic and feasible plans for logistical socialization and reform , transform ideas , thoroughly eliminate the old way of thinking of higher education of taking on everything in society , resolutely break free from traditional logistical management models , and set up a new type of logistical safeguard system for higher education that is suited to the national situation of China .  
It is understood that Fujian is quite interested in tourism that the mini three links may bring , but thinks that if free travel is restricted to residents of Kinmen , Matsu , Xiamen and Fuzhou , it will not be sufficient to exploit tourist resources .  Assuming that 700 people are going to Kinmen everyday , it will not take long for every Xiamen resident to have visited Kinmen once .  Tourists from Kinmen are fewer in number .  
Authoritative figures point out that tariff concessions are a basic obligation on WTO members ; on the basis of mutual benefit and concession , these are aimed at lowering the general level of important and export tariffs , and in particular reducing high tariffs hampering imports , and also at setting the maximum tariffs for certain commodities , that is , constraining tariff rates and not levying tariffs in excess of those limits , so as to promote the free development of international trade .  
Charged with a heavy task , the women 's federations or their organizations at all levels should give full scope to the unique superiority of the broad masses of women and families in resisting an evil cult ; should help " Falungong " practitioners free themselves from the spiritual control of the evil cult ideologically , organizationally , and once and for all ; and should help them keep abreast with the pace of the times by enjoying to the full a warm or progressive life brought by science and civilization as well .  
The gradual and conditional opening of the B share market in China will greatly promote the process of internationalization of the Chinese securities markets and make good preparations for the realization of an unified , and open international securities markets , where the free exchange of renminbi for foreign money can be realized while dealing with capital items in the future .  
Although it is impossible to make a concrete judgment before the detailed rules for the implementation of the policy are promulgated , yet the fact that foreign and domestic investors compete with one another to trade B shares in the same markets and their profits and losses are inevitably reflected in the balance of international payments in foreign exchange shows that , after all , extremely important progress has been made even though we can not say that the free convertibility of renminbi is right under our noses . 
In our struggle against the " Falungong " cult , we conscientiously implemented the spirit of a series of instructions from the party center , gave full play to the advantage of ideological and political work , and offered all-dimensional help and education .  We managed to transform an overwhelming majority of those who practiced " Falungong " and , in particular , helped 43 fanatic followers of " Falungong " free themselves from their spiritual shackles .  
First , it is necessary to link such activities with developing the rural economy and guiding farmers to free themselves from poverty and achieve a better-off level of moderate prosperity .  It is necessary to firmly instill grass-roots cadres in rural areas with the idea of taking economic development as the central task and to make them concentrate their energy on developing the rural economy and on raising farmers ' incomes .  
After its return to the motherland , Hong Kong will retain the status of a free port and an international financial , trade and shipping centre while continuing to maintain and develop its economic and cultural relations with other countries , regions and relevant international organisations so that this international economic metropolis will forever be vigorous and dynamic .  
Its advantageous geographical location , its free port policy of complete openness , its well-developed legal system and highly efficient team of civil service , and its effective economic management and civic administration have all facilitated Hong Kong 's economic development .  
These four crucial factors which are not going to change include the legal system ; the free entrepreneurial spirit that Hong Kong upholds and a level playing field thus created ; the clean and efficient Special Administrative Region ( SAR ) civil service ; and the free flow of information .  
The spokesman also said the Government is determined to protect the cornerstones of Hong Kong 's success .  These include the rule of law , an independent judiciary , a level playing field , an honest , efficient and politically neutral civil service , a first class economic infrastructure and the free flow of information .  
" Against our free trade philosophy , the prime objectives of Hong Kong for the international trade forums are two-fold : first , to further the benefits of trade liberalisation with a view to achieving the global free trade and second , to maintain a rule-based multilateral trading system which is relevant and responsive to the needs of the modern business world , " he said .  
" It is inappropriate and often misleading to describe the actual change in households ' well-being without taking into account the various welfare provisions by the Government including free-subsidised education service , low cost public housing , free medical care , retraining and other government subvented welfare services all of which contribute to improving the living standard of the disabled , the elderly , the single parents and the low income households , " the spokesman added . 
The four important pillars which underpinned Hong Kong 's economic success before the changeover , which are the rule of law , a level playing field for all who do business in Hong Kong , a corruption-free public service and free flow of information , have all remained to ensure Hong Kong 's continued success as it takes on its new role as China 's premier international financial centre . 
Part of Hong Kong 's success is also as a result of our promotion of free competitive environment , the strict adherence to the rule of law , minimum bureaucracy and a level playing field and a strong commitment against corruption - all provided and supported by an efficient civil service .  
Hong Kong , in its continued capacity as a free port and an international financial , trade and shipping center , will play an even more active role in strengthening the economic cooperation between China 's mainland and other countries in the world .  
" We are the freest society and most vibrant economy of our time because Hong Kong has always practised free enterprise and free trade , insisted on prudent financial management policies and keeping a low taxation system , upheld the rule of law and placed emphasis on an efficient , executive-led government and a quality oriented civil service , " he said .  
" As stated by our Secretary , it is in HKSAR 's own economic and commercial interest to maintain effective controls over strategic commodities trade because only by so doing can we ensure our free access to sophisticated goods and technologies essential for Hong Kong 's economic development , " Mr Lai said . 
- investigate diseases and unusual deaths reported in wholesale and retail markets ; - improve environmental hygiene at wholesale markets ; - work on the issue of a prohibition order to prevent the importation of live chickens other than those that are derived from farms certified free from the disease by the Veterinary Officer of the exporting country .  
Hong Kong has a sound and effective financial monitoring system ; ample fiscal reserves as well as prudent financial management policies .  The Government is free of any foreign debts .  Private firms also exercise financial prudence when seeking foreign loans .  
All election advertisements must be marked with serial numbers except a single sheet of paper not larger than A4 size bearing printing details , materials sent through the free postage service or by electronic means , and balloons .  
" I think , if anything , Hong Kong represents a model of economic management others in Asia are now realising they should try to follow : a free market under the rule of law ; a clean government which believes in prudent financial management and in not directing the economy ; a well-regulated and well-managed financial sector ; a reputation for playing by the rules ; openness and accountability , " Mr Tsang concluded .  
We have a free and open economy ; excellent regulatory systems ; huge fiscal and foreign reserves ; tried , tested and successful fiscal policies ; level playing field for all who do business here ; a vigorous anti-corruption commission ; a versatile and flexible workforce ; and world class infrastructure and communication .  
At the same time , the Civil Service has learned to work together with an increasingly proactive legislature , subject ourselves to vigorous monitoring by independent watchdog bodies such as the Ombudsman 's Office , opened ourselves up to a free and aggressive media , and enhanced our transparency through the promulgation of the Code of Access to Information .  
I am confident that , with our strong fundamentals , coupled with our flexibility of adaptation to external shock , and with the extent of price and cost adjustment that our free market economy has allowed us to go through up to now , our economy should be able to rebound expeditiously from the current doldrums , once the regional situation has settled , and our outlook beyond that remains bright . 
Furthermore , there are the rule of law , a low and predictable tax regime , an efficient and honest civil service , free flow of information and an efficient and sound financial system .  
" We represent the model of sound economic management in the region : a truly free market operating under the rule of law ; a well-regulated financial sector ; and a clean government that has exercised great prudence in fiscal management , " he said .  
At public swimming pools , the Urban Services Department and Regional Services Department had strictly implemented the hourly sampling of the pool water ensuring that the free residual chlorine level is maintained at the level sufficient to kill the virus .  
Holders of valid Dumping Licences for public filling areas may be permitted to dump materials such as earth , building debris , broken rock and concrete at the barging point provided that the materials are free from marine mud , household refuse , plastic , metal , industrial and chemical waste , animal and vegetable matter and other materials considered unsuitable . 
In short , our commitment to an open and free market and to the linked exchange rate system is paramount .  We will be vigilant in safeguarding them .  And we will make sure they will continue to work well to the benefit of the public and all local and overseas investors even when external economic conditions are turbulent .  It is our duty to the local community and to the stability of the regional markets .  
The swimming team has achieved outstanding results .  Mr Fu Tai-chun netted a total of five medals , with four new World Masters Games records .  These included a gold in 50-metre breast stroke , a silver in 50-metre back stroke and three bronze medals in 50-metre free style , 100-metre free style and 50-metre butterfly .  His team-mate Mr Chan Kam-por also won for himself a bronze medal in the 100 - metre breast stroke .  
Apart from the free legal aid advisory service , there were also exhibition panels featuring colourful illustrations and statistical graphs on the scope of service , and video presentation on divorce proceedings and personal injury claims , as well as a specially designed quiz with attractive prizes for successful entrants .  
" It is too simplistic - and also unfair - to judge our commitment to the free market by a single , extraordinary battle at a time of great economic turmoil , and when massive , secretive and destructive capital flows were creating havoc in the markets . "  
To ensure that the pool worker is clean and hygienic , the free residual chlorine level is maintained at the level of 0.5-1.0 parts per million ( ppm ) for adequate disinfection ; whereas the pH value is maintained at a level of 7.2-7.8 to provide swimmers with the desirable water quality .  
The following hygiene standard on water quality of swimming pools is set by the Department of Health : for pools using ozone as disinfectant , the free residual chlorine level should be kept at a minimum of 0.5 parts per million ( ppm ) ; while for pools using chlorine as disinfectant , the free residual chlorine level should be kept at a minimum of 1.0 ppm .  
We also are determined to uphold the rule of law , the free market principles , clean and efficient government , sound and transparent regulations and prudent fiscal management , the hallmarks of our past success .  
( c ) Apart from offering nine years ' free and universal basic education to all children between the ages of 6 and 15 , the Government has been raising the education level of the public through various measures .  For example , the Adult Education Section of the Education Department provides adult education at primary and secondary levels and English courses for interested persons aged 15 or above .  It also subvents non-government organisations in providing adult education courses , including literacy class .  
" We are a model of sound economic management , with a free market operating under the rule of law , a well-regulated financial sector and a clean government that exercises prudence in its fiscal policies .  
These include a well developed financial infrastructure , a conducive regulatory environment and sound supervisory process , free and open markets , a modern and effective legal system and a high degree of transparency .  
More importantly , Hong Kong 's edge over the other East Asian economies has been underpinned by a host of other factors , such as a good quality labour force , a low and simple taxation system , a stable government , a corruption free society , an efficient transport and telecommunications infrastructure , sound legal and regulatory systems , free flow of information , and most important of all , a huge and rapidly growing hinterland just to the north of Hong Kong , " Mr Tsang said .  
According to the Statement on Competition Policy promulgated by the Government , in determining whether HKTDC has contravened the principle of fair competition in providing exhibition services , we should consider whether HKTDC or its ES has been involved in practices which are restrictive , detrimental to economic efficiency or free trade , and against the overall interest of Hong Kong .

In future things will be clearer , with free competition in agricultural production whereby prices will be fixed by supply and demand . Those unable to compete will be eliminated , while those who can will find a welcome market for their produce . In this way farmers ' labor , resources and investment will be directed towards higher added value products . Meanwhile ordinary farmers working smaller , weaker family farms will receive government aid , but this will be completely divorced from their production .  
Brazil was an attractive enough place for immigrants then . With excellent public facilities , a free open economy and plentiful natural resources , it was a paradise offering unlimited opportunities for the immigrant with energy to spare . "  
Having just celebrated the anniversary of commissioner Lin 's burning of British opium which triggered the Opium War , Chinese readers might be smiling quietly to themselves at the fact that neighboring Japan is not only supplying the British with cheap and attractive household goods , but is also spending a large amount of money on their cultural education . lt is difficult not to conclude , however , that the only way to avoid accusations of " charm and stealth " might be to send in gunboats selling heroin under the flag of free trade .  
As for Hong kong , it is also a center of capitalism , has a special culture brought about by the mix of Orient and Occident , has highly developed communications and access to a wealth of information ; it is very free and people do n't interfere in each other 's lives ; it is very liberal , and no one cares about your political position ; already thirty percent of its broadcasting is Mandarin music , and it will take at least five years before its creative capabilities catch up to Taiwan .  
This traditional " matchmaker " field , which one would have thought would have been wiped out by free choice in love and marriage , is not only alive and kicking ; in the last ten years it has experienced a complete turnaround to become a hot profession . Besides the matchmaking columns and programs popular in the media , an even greater number of specialized , commercialized " modern super matchmakers " are popping up everywhere .  
Koo Chen-fu , who has long been known as an " ambassador of trade " holds a similar view : " The main global economic organizations that we 're fighting to join at present now are GATT , which regulates the world 's free trading system ; the International Monetary Fund , which regulates the world 's financial system ; the World Bank , which assists in the development of developing countries ; and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , which is made up of the world 's leading industrialized countries . "  
Moreover , Hong Kong has become an international free port in the last twenty years and a financial center . Apart from its explosion of wealth , it has also been very hard to resist the temptations of the flow of imported luxuries from all over the world . Thus , generally speaking , most Hong Kong people like to boast about what they love to enjoy ; enjoyment ( usually material ) has become a very important social value .  
In the free democratic societies that have mostly replaced authoritarian societies , the upper level is formed from the middle level and the middle level from the lower level . No one 's position is permanently occupied , and there are no strong authoritarian forces blocking interaction and communication . Mutual understanding is n't difficult .  
For remote areas where treatment is not easily accessible , the hospital 's Departtment of Family Medicine works with volunteers to organize a roving medical team , which goes deep into poor remote areas to deliver free care to the people . Dr . Lai Yu-chia has just completed a half-year stint on the roving volunteer team .  
Fortyeight-year-old Li Feng-chin is already a grandma and takes care of a sizable vegetable garden ; as for Cheng Mei-hsia , born in 1970 , after having a child she resigned her full time accounting job and entered the relatively free puma company ; Liao Chiu-hsiang , born in 1969 , hated the dull routine of factory work and after working in northern Taiwan for more than a year decided to return to Hsiluo to dance with the cloth horse .  
In this situation the government decided to set up a special project , enlisting the ITRI 's Mechanical Industry Research Laboratories to bring in American technology for combined research and development . When the development was finished , hands were joined again with the private sector to establish a compressor factory , with joint production and distribution free of Japanese control .  
In line with this policy the Ministry of Justice has prepared an Anti-Corruption Plan , the four main aims of which are to make public officials " afraid to be corrupt , unable to be corrupt , unwilling to be corrupt and free of the need to be corrupt . "  
However , Chou Yu-kou says she had no wish to take on the solemn mission of the " biographer of a historical figure , " but rather that as a news reporter she simply wished to make discussion of political topics more free and information more open . Also , by writing in a style " closer to real life and to ordinary people , " she hoped to give the general public a closer understanding of politicians ' joys and sorrows and the way they think .  
He says , " True religion takes the self-awareness of the innateness of individual being as its foundation . This either calls up innate understanding and comprehension , or establishes active and positive beliefs , providing the truth about the end of the universe , the ultimate purpose of human life , and paths to follow to achieve the liberation of the soul , and other specific answers . Individual beings then make a choice depending upon their free will and their spiritual needs " ( p . 185 ) .  
Perhaps a philosophy of life and death can be free from objectivity , formality , and rigidity , but it has the opposite critical problem of becoming personalized , and freely verified only in one 's own mind , so it is impossible to come to a common spiritual consensus .  
Today 's society is even more complex , and the powers ascribed to the tiger have also become more diverse . As people 's understanding of nature has increased , the tiger has lost its mystique , and with so few tigers left there is no longer any likelihood of people finding themselves in a face-to-face struggle with a tiger . Thus people are free to develop their own human perspective and let the tiger symbolize whatever they want it to .  
China 's Minority Peoples For photographers anxious to free themselves from commonplace and boring subjects , China 's ethnic minorities , with their unique customs , rustic appearances , colorful , varied clothing , and rugged , lofty mountains as a backdrop , hold a glamor that is difficult to express .  
The people complained that insurance premiums were too high . In the past an insurance policy allowed for free treatment ; now it has for no apparent reason taken a leap upward in cost due to the " partial cost sharing " regulation . And in the past you could go directly to a hospital to see a doctor with a good reputation for something as simple as a cold ; now with the medical referral system , you ca n't get through the front door .  
( Xinshi , meaning " new poetry , " refers to all modern free verse in the vernacular . This form , pioneered in the 1920s and 1930s , is called " new " to distinguish it from the traditional Chinese poetic forms described above . ) Before the 1950s , xinshi was romantic and emotive . Just look back at works like Hsu Chih-mo 's " Coincidentally , " Liu Pan-nung 's " How Can I Not Miss Her , " or Luo Chia-lun 's " A Passage Through the Great Wall . "  
A food supply is the most basic of human needs , and farm produce is the last bastion of protectionism in the ROC ; it is also the segment most prone to sensitive price fluctuations . This situation is not unique to Taiwan , but is common throughout the world . Fortunately , except for agricultural produce , most household items , domestic appliances , cosmetics and so on were thrown open to free competition earlier , and so have already entered an era of more stable prices in line with those in advanced countries worldwide .  
Briton Dennis Casey , managing director of drugstore chain Watson 's The Chemist Taiwan , and a long-time resident in the Asia-Pacific region , observes that a few years ago prices in Taiwan were almost as high as in Japan . But with the fast opening of Taiwan 's markets and free competition , " the most efficient and modern international retailers are all setting up in Taiwan , bringing with them their international experience and vision , and seeking out low - price , high-quality products from all over the world to supply to local consumers . "  
" Although Air Macau has its strong points , we are also increasing our efforts , " comments TransAsia Airway 's public relations office . After passengers reach Macao , in addition to the conventional method of disembarking and boarding a second flight to mainland China , TransAsia also offers a free bus service which takes their customers straight to Guangdong 's Zhuhai City in little more than an hour . From Zhuhai 's newly completed Sanzao International Airport , one can then fly to all the major cities in mainland China .  
When Hsiu Ping-shan " retired " from politics , he drew inspiration from the recently popular " all-you-can-eat " restaurants to establish his own " all-you-can-write " center . The store is replete with brushes , ink , paper and ink stone , as well as exemplary calligraphy from all the great masters . Air conditioning and tea are provided , and a teacher even gives free instruction . Customers can arrive empty-handed and write to their hearts ' content .  
Wei recalls that he started reading the magazine in his freshman year at college , before people were free to speak as they pleased , yet the magazine was very bold about what it published . The historical documents were more stimulating and comprehensive than his formal history education at university .  
In 1994 , when the Council for Cultural Planning and Development first expanded its arts festival to include all of Taiwan , Paoankung ( listed as a temple ) put on the " Paosheng Culture Festival . " Apart from a neighborhood parade typical of a temple fair , fire jumping , and plays sponsored by people with the same surname , the temple also held a photography exhibit , a children 's painting competition , and free traditional Chinese medical consultations . The excitement went on for a whole month .  
To attract followers , such groups employ methods of " intensive instruction , therapy and guidance , an isolated environment , and worship of the religious leader , " which are akin to brainwashing techniques . These cause people to identify with the doctrine and ceremonies of the religion , so that believers fully believe themselves to be acting of their own free will . Yet outsiders find their behavior inexplicable . The end result is tragedy , with society paying enormous costs .  
Whether concerned about knowing love at least once , or about attaining everlasting love , the true meaning of " free love " is listening to your own genuine needs and making responsible choices . The same is also true of Sun Chung-hsing 's personal mission in the " cause " of love .  
Currently , the problem is that " there are no rules of the game . Just looking at circulation tricks to expand or maintain sales , apart from giving discounts , giving papers away for free is also common , " suggests mass communications scholar Hsu Chia-shih . There is no mutual trust in the newspaper industry , and there is no objective standard to determine " number of newspapers sold . " That is why they are so chilly toward the ABC .  
When you enter temples , the bodhi-sattvas , smiling and downward gazing , sit cross-legged in the " lotus position " on their lotus pedestals . Guanyin , the Buddhist Goddess of Mercy who relieves hardships and suffering , sprinkles sweet water onto the fire raging in the house of humanity while treading on lotuses . A booklet free for the taking in sidewalk arcades features on its cover a lotus blossom surrounded by drooping lotus leaves .  
" The Colon Free Trade Zone , the world 's longest running and most successful free trade zone , handled US $ 10 billion in transshipment trade in 1995 , a figure equivalent to Taiwan 's total yearly trade with Southeast Asia .  
One educational reformer has commented that , in this age of " free market education " where textbooks have become " intellectual commodities , " it is difficult to expect publishers not to concern themselves with business and other factors not related to education . But the bigger question is , are the rules of the new privatized education game fair ? Are they consistent ?  
Today the free political environment , developed economy and diversified society in Hong Kong and Taiwan have allowed the media to break free from the shackles of the traditional strict authoritarian order and nurture a free and independent press .  
Today journalists are part of the salaried middle class , well trained , with stable lives . The improved social position means that they no longer have to write to please authority to ensure their livelihood . They also do n't need to unrealistically regard all the troubles of the world as their responsibility . What is more important is doing their specialized job and allowing the free competition of the market to decide their success or failure .  
After returning from New York with his MFA degree and restarting the Kuang Huan Dance Circle , Liou drew upon his extensive practice of taijiquan , qigong and yoga , and made " qi , " " body " and " mind " the troupe 's new guiding principles-when free circulation of the qi ( breath or vital energy ) is achieved , a person becomes light and nimble , and develops a greater sensitivity toward nuances of space and time ; body refers the physical body , and mind to one 's thoughts , will and intentions .  
Liou has advertised the " baby oil series " as being free of complex or obscure meaning , taking it on frequent tours to rural areas in an effort to bridge the gap with audiences and make modern dance more accessible to the average person .  
A : For a long time now , our government has been plainly telling the Communist Chinese authorities that our final goal is a free , democratic , and prosperous reunified China . But before reunification , the ROC must continue to seek survival and development in international society . This is the basic right of survival of the people living in the Taiwan area . And this can create a model for the Chinese on both sides to pursue a better future way of life and system .  
The move toward open agricultural markets was agreed upon by the WTO member nations in the Uruguay round of GATT . With this international consensus and the global trend toward free trade in agriculture , Taiwan is finding it difficult to swim against the current by maintaining its protectionist agricultural policies .  
One way , reveals a veterinarian , is that many people whose pets become seriously ill just abandon them at the animal hospital , never returning to pick them up . There is no system in place in Taiwan to take in stray animals . Given operational constraints on a hospital , the only thing a vet can do is to set these unhealthy animals free in the wild . But this turns the problem from being an implicitly contractual one ( between owner and vet ) , or personal moral one , into one foisted on society .  
If employees feel this is not enough , they will be free to negotiate increased amounts with their employers , " says Anita Liu . For example , if the boss and workers each pay an additional 2% , then the workers will be doing a bit of " enforced saving " for their pensions . The most important reform envisaged under the new system is the change from a collective retirement fund account opened by the firm , to an individual account for each worker .  
From Laozi it borrows the concepts of non-action , clear understanding , and acting in harmony with nature . From Zhuangzi come the concepts of total freedom and life-for-the-fun-of-it . Combining these concepts , religious Daoism holds that in order to become an immortal , one must be free of joy and anger , eliminate desire , live in quietude and non-action , maintain primitive simplicity , and act in harmony with the natural laws of the universe .  
Research has revealed that human metabolic processes produce something known as a " free radical . " These free radicals cause a kind of oxidation which damages normal cells and weakens the body 's immune response . This can lead to illness , aging and even death . Free radicals have also been implicated as a possible cause of cancer .  
" This is something that both sexes want , " avers Wang Hao-wei , psychiatrist and author of the book Taiwan Men . Women , he notes , are experiencing rising self-consciousness , and want equal status and a fairer division of labor . Men , meanwhile , are hoping to escape rigid traditional roles and to have the chance to be more relaxed , more free to express their true selves . Men and women together have built up and share a common image of a new man .  
He recalls how in the 1960s , when Taiwan and mainland China were engaged in a propaganda battle on the airwaves , and listening to mainland broadcasts was forbidden in Taiwan , the government encouraged the establishment of private radio stations . The number of radio stations quickly grew to over 80 , and there was an enormous demand for programs . Father Bourret produced classical music programs , five-minute stories , and short radio dramas , all of which he made available to radio stations free of charge .  
" With this behavioral outlet , people do n't consider the more important question of improvement . " Yeh says that the stray dogs " set free " onto Taiwan 's streets are symptomatic of people 's ingrained reluctance to face up to the real suffering of living things .  
Once again , his team of several older women , wearing their usual uniforms of rubber sandals , face masks , and gloves , make their way into the tiny back alleys of the busy city . Today , they will clean house for an old veteran called " Old Yu . " No more free lunch Old Yu 's rented residence is dank and dark .  
While other painters created in their personal studios , she was usually at one hospital or another personally looking after her eldest son who was often on the edge of death . Wang would use her free moments to paint on hospital rags , towels , or cloth that she brought with her . Her paintings were nevertheless serene and joyful , like a rainbow reflecting off a cloud , and filled the room with the freshness of a spring breeze . You could say that she is Taiwan 's most legendary brush and ink artist .  
According to Hsinchu mayor Tsai Jen-chien , " There is little free space within the city limits , so we can only carry out rationalization and renewal on present scale . But the city enjoys many other assets due to its long history and culture . " From the Qing dynasty through to the Japanese colonial period , Hsinchu was one of northern Taiwan 's key political and economic centers , and this has left the city with a rich legacy of cultural assets .  
The narrowing of international space in turn sparked the rise of " nativist ideology " in Taiwan-nascent Taiwanese nationalism . Now that Taiwan is free , democratic , and prosperous , the old policy of refusing to coexist in the international community with mainland China has been abandoned , and the government hopes to create a " win-win " situation . But mainland China still has the mindset from the civil war half a century ago .  
But as Hsueh Cheng-tai points out , when you consider the daily routine of most foreign workers and how little free time it leaves them for breaking the law , and bear in mind that the crime rate among illegal foreign workers is far higher than for the legal ones , the problem does indeed merit attention . Especially given that in 1997 rape accounted for the largest share of serious crime committed by overseas workers , causing widespread anxiety among the public .  
How can people make a wise choice among the many value systems on offer ? How can they monitor their new leader to ensure that Taiwan has a peaceful future free of the influence of " black gold politics " ? These are not only questions for this election , but eternal challenges for the whole people in any democratic society .  
" Palliative care , " or " natural death , " as it is often referred to , means that in accordance with a patient 's expressed free will , medical staff will refrain from using cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) , artificial respirators , heart stimulants and other invasive medical technologies to prolong the dying process of patients with untreatable conditions .  
T'ienti at regular times provides free " cosmic qi healing . " Wearing their " struggle suits " - yellow shirts with blue pants-the envoys of T'ienti first chant the 20-character mantra before turning themselves into mediums that use the " Great Spirit of the Universe " to cleanse their patients ' bodies . From time to time they extend their arms to accept invisible golden pills into paper cups , which their patients wash down with water .  
After the job of damage appraisal was finished , the association established a " home repair task force . " A lot of families were living in basically safe structures that were nevertheless in need of repairs . The association lent its assistance free of charge to families lacking the resources to undertake such repairs on their own . They reinforced beams and posts , and repaired damaged walls , plumbing , and electrical wiring .  
The first is globalization , which has had a dual impact . For one thing it has led to a massive expansion of the international labor force , with developing countries that previously shunned capitalist competition now hurling themselves into it , adding over a billion workers from places like mainland China , India and Eastern Europe . At the same time we have the globalization of international trade , with capital and technology increasingly free to circulate rapidly around the world .  
Sadly , development is causing the diversity of Taiwan 's wetlands to decline rapidly . Since the banks of the small lake in the Tatun Nature Park in Yangmingshan National Park , formerly overgrown with lush aquatic plants , were tidied up , and visitors released turtles and koi carp there , in a short time the number of dragonfly species in the area has fallen from over 20 to only five or six . Taiwan 's beautiful mountain lakes have also become places where religious believers set animals " free . " Island ecologies are fragile .  
" During this period his running script was no longer as lean as it had been , " says Ho Chuan-hsing . " It began slanting rightwards and spreading out a little . Overall , his characters became more free and unconstrained , with swooping spaces where the brush was running dry of ink . He had well and truly shaken off the earlier fixation with exquisite perfection . "  
Much to his surprise , someone showed up in the middle of the night with bolt cutters and set him free . Fully awake to the treacherous intentions of his relatives , Wang decided to head for southern China and make a life there together with Yueh-ching , the sweet and innocent daughter of a tenant farmer . The two married , and warfare continued .  
When the KMT was voted out of the presidency last year after a half century in power , many worried that the Republic of China had come to an end , but our national identity is only clearer now that the Taiwan-oriented DPP has come to power . The ROC comprises the territory of Taiwan , Penghu , Kinmen , and Matsu . Only a ruling party free of historical baggage can take the bold surgical steps needed to rid the country of long-festering tumors .  
" Let me take you soaring over a stretch of green fields / Piercing a tunnel of greenery bathed in the setting sun / Let the cool breeze and the fragrance of oranges run through your fingers / Cast off your worries and let your mind go free . The great peak beckons to me with a gesture / The secondary peak nods in my direction / The mountain coffee sends your troubles packing / The winding highland roads call : Hurry up and get started ! "  
Over the last few years , Li Hsien-wen 's life has changed quite a lot . He not only eats vegetarian , but he has also moved to the countryside and abandoned burdensome clothing such as suit and tie . At the same time , he has influenced his wife , who began practicing calligraphy three years ago . When she is free she copies a bit of traditional poetry , and able to settle in at her house , she no longer feels lonely .  
Although the government has now decided to move in the direction of liberalization , the numerous " technical issues " that remain continue to make difficult any easing of the current political impasse . Proposals to allow " three links , " to permit Taiwanese firms to invest in semiconductor or upstream petrochemicals production in China , to allow Chinese capital and workers into Taiwan , and even to establish a free port that would make it easier to bring semi-finished goods from China to Taiwan for processing , still remain just that : proposals .  
This July , planning will be completed for the first free port in Taiwan , which should increase the efficiency of the movement of goods significantly . This will be helpful to Taiwan 's becoming a regional operations center for both local businesses and multinational companies .  
If it is easy to find a free e-paper that is similar , or if the readers do n't really need the content , it is difficult to achieve the level of appeal required to collect fees , " says Hsu . But it can be done . Currently , e-papers at PChome that do the best with subscriber fees are for language learning and industrial reports . The publication with the most subscribers is iThome , a computer report , with about 10,000 .  
From the moment they say " I do , " they should be ready in their hearts and willing to take the bad along with the good . Why is it , then , that today 's couples , free to choose their partners , find it so difficult to honor their vows ? Some find it impossible to deal with hardship , and others , even after struggling to make it through a difficult stretch , are somehow unable to enjoy the sweet yields of their struggle .  
" People in society do not understand the costs of divorce , " says Chen . Reading about scandals and breakups among celebrities every day in the media , many people get the erroneous impression that divorce is something fashionable , even an essential part of an interesting and colorful life . They imagine that after divorce a man will be surrounded by beautiful women , while a divorced wife will be free to travel to some romantic location , and both will enjoy a new lease on life .  
That very night he departed from the world without a warning or farewell . His passage was free and easy , but those whom he left behind were reluctant to let go . Liu 's biographer Yang Meng-yu once asked Liu whether he worried about not being able to wrap up loose ends should something befall him during one of his romps through some remote corner of the world .  
And an LNG procurement worth several hundred billion New Taiwan dollars is an affair which can be carried out only through a public bidding process in conformance with the WTO spirit of free competition , not one which can be decided by anyone 's personal say-so . Such issues must , as ever , be handled in accordance with legal procedure together with consideration of the national interest .  
But commercial considerations aside , as mainland media professionals are hoping , media from outside the mainland should not just play the role of furthering business . A more exciting question and one worth waiting for and answer is : Can the media culture fostered in the free environments of Hong Kong and Taiwan capable of stimulating mainland China in a positive way ?  
" Parents should set their kids free , and not just so as to lighten the burdens on their kids , " Lu says . " In the past , while putting all their expectations on their kids , parents stifled their own potential for growth . " He discovered that many seniors felt bitter upon entering old age and discovering that they could not live close to their children . It affected their mental outlook for the entire latter period of their lives .  
Thanks to the experience accumulated by the ICDF and other aid groups , NGOs providing medical aid need no longer be limited to satisfying the ambition of some romantically minded individuals to do good deeds . For example , the cleft lip and cleft palate surgery program of the Noordhoff Craniofacial Foundation ( NCF ) in Vietnam , Cambodia , the Philippines , and elsewhere includes free consultations , technical instruction , equipment donation , post-surgery speech therapy , and so on , so that medical resources are applied in a systematic manner .  
Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon 's exquisite imagery and dramatic plot , and its rhythm which alternates between moments of understatement and boisterousness , have helped to inject new life into an ailing genre . However , Crouching Tiger 's success in breaking free of the previous martial arts mold must be viewed in light of its hybrid origins .  
Taiwan , on the other hand , has strict laws restricting flying and has yet to issue hot-air balloon licenses , not to mention licenses for nine-seater aircraft , the most common type of recreational plane . If any engineers addicted to flying do make it to Taiwan , where can they give their passion free rein ?  
Early this March , Tzu Chi branches from Singapore , Malaysia , Indonesia , and Taiwan joined together for Tzu Chi 's fourth free clinic on the Indonesian island of Batam . On each occasion so far , the number of local volunteers has grown , and patients and their families who have been helped in previous years have come forward on their own to lend a hand . At the clinic site , you can hear Mandarin Chinese , English , Indonesian , Malaysian , and Hokkien rising and falling .  
Wang Dan 's identity gives his creative writing a free pass to the public , and even more to the mainstream media . But at the same time this also is a problem for him . It makes it unnecessary for him to pursue perfection in his literary life , and his obscure and emotional essay style readily reveals a literary technique that is not yet mature , and indeed a character that is equally childlike .  
Apart from the medicinal herb exhibition and the free clinics ( Paosheng is , after all , the god of medicine ) , there was also a photo exhibition ( " The Beauty of Paoan Temple " ) by master photographer Ko Hsi-chieh , as well as seminars on religious ceremonies , a guided tour to the art of altars , and folk arts and crafts workshops designed for the 3-day chingcheng jiao that began on June 13th . These varied activities were aimed at giving people deeper understanding into the inner meaning of religious culture .  
Yet , while his improvements on traditional designs were meeting with great approval , they were n't satisfying his creative desires . From an early age he had been a great lover of painting and very familiar with historical folktales , so he decided to leave the ranks of craftsmen , breaking free from the shackles of tradition , and to adopt innovative styles using Western realism to create new works that more richly displayed a purely artistic creativity .  
To most people , railroad warehouses are nothing but dark and dilapidated buildings , but to artists such spaces exert a primordial attraction not found in conventional art galleries . These surreal art sanctuaries give free rein to the imagination , enable the artistic vanguard to enter the mainstream , and function as alternative spaces for the experimental showcasing of new designs prior to commercial exhibition .  
" Before I was 50 , I dedicated myself to public service , but today I am living for myself , " says Yeh Chin-chuan . No longer burdened with public office , Yeh is manifestly free and unrestrained . He has fulfilled a number of dreams he has had for many years , including climbing a mountain in Kyrgyzstan , competing in the Ironman Triathlon , swimming across Sun Moon Lake , and taking part in the Taroko marathon .  
Under the old system of economic planning , the distribution of published works in the mainland was all handled through a single state-owned channel ( known as the " first channel " ) - every region in the country had a Xinhua bookstore and supply unit . These Xinhua stores held sole control of delivery and distribution , a system entirely inappropriate for a free market .  
In the first place , they maintain , people are driven by their own individual interests and are frequently unable to take the broad view in considering public affairs . This " me first " attitude exacerbates conflicts of interest . Secondly , to avoid referendum issues being controlled by special-interest groups , laws must be passed to regulate public announcements , provide for the balanced presentation of information and guarantee the free flow of information .  
Thinking back on his childhood , Yeh says that his father often used the free time outside the busy farming season to recite Chinese historical serial novels to his neighbors . Yeh was deeply influenced by his father and loved reading . Under the supervision of NTNU professor Tang Tsu-chung , he read a lot of biographical literature . For this reason Yeh learned that modern Chinese history is made up of heroic figures whose successful deeds were all made possible by " idealism , hope , and determination . "  
He gives half the income from the restaurant to charity , and once a month he hosts a free dinner for a guest list that includes volunteer teachers and lonely elderly people with no families . He also works to promote environmental , conservation , and animal-rights values in the PRC , so that the vegetarian outlook on life can set down deeper roots , and not just be limited to eating habits or health .  
In a survey of the dreams of youth taken by Sinorama in December among 19 to 30-year-olds , nearly half ( 46.7% ) included " live as I please , free and unrestrained " as one of their life dreams , far beyond the second most popular choice of " a happy family life " ( 29.8% ) and the third of " a stable job " ( 26.6% ) .  
Cheng points out that although such ideas have a contagious element about them , people who are mentally healthy or who have a strong " psychological immunity " will not easily be " infected " by suicide reports . But people who are themselves suffering from severe depression or who have suffered a serious setback in life , are more likely to be contaminated by an unhealthy suicidal frame of mind and to be unable to free themselves from it .  
Although this winter Mingcheng 's Murcott production was not very high , the quality was excellent . Thanks to a high 13-degree sugar / acid ratio ( sugar content / free acid content ) and free media publicity thrown in by the home distribution company , the day after the ads appeared the borough head , Chang Jui-tuan , who was responsible for taking phone orders , spent the whole day on the phone .  
But in fifth grade , his teacher discovered that this " problem student " could draw powerful and intriguing pictures . The teacher signed Lee up for a province-wide primary-school drawing competition in which , incredibly , he won a prize . This prize seemed to set free the previously locked-up spirit of this small Aboriginal child .  
The groups he leads typically have " free time " scheduled for half a day or a full day so as to allow his charges to deeply experience and probe nature . " The special quality of ecotourism lies in its leisureliness , " stresses Chen Chang-po . When the travel itinerary is too tight , it fosters anxiety among the tourists and tour operators . Only when the mood is relaxed can one discard the pressures and cares of work and everyday life and allow one 's heart and mind to converse with and reconnect to nature .  
These schools provide a support base for the museum , helping to recover personnel and other costs . The museum provides the ideological foundation for the classes , the education being based on the ideas espoused by the gallery and put into practice in the classes . Lin has been running these two organizations for years now in her effort to try and free people 's artistry from the shackles it has been placed in , and to let children be able to sample the emotional qualities inherent in real art .  
When the company took control of the Bears this year , it immediately adopted Kaohsiung 's Cheng-Ching Lake Baseball Stadium and took a more professional tack in managing the team , improving the diet , clothing , living arrangements and transportation it provided to the players . Such sweeping actions not only made a strong impression on the players themselves , but garnered media attention . " They received free promotion of their corporate image , " observes Central Broadcasting System 's Fan Chung-kuang , who has covered professional baseball for eight years .  
Hu herself admits to having a very active disposition , and she ca n't stand being idle . Her free time at home was limited , and during the downtime after the housework was finished she was always a bit edgy and thinking about how she could further her learning , so she took on the volunteer work at the library . Later she joined up with a study group run by the Mandarin Daily News , and finally , ten years ago , she moved on to the volunteer service at NTUH .  
Once the ink has been formed into lengths that are free of cracks and joints , those lengths must be pressed and shaped in a mold .

At the beginning of the 1990s , the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung took the landmark initiative of demolishing the concrete walls built up on the south side of the military demarcation line , allowing free travel between the north and the south , and holding north-south high-level talks and the north-south summit talks to remove the root cause of the war and accelerate the process of peaceful reunification on the Korean peninsula in the next few years .  
The individual elements of a culture of peace are therefore : non-violence and respect for human rights , respect and solidarity among all peoples and dialogue between cultures , the linkage of peace to democratic participation and sustainable human development , the free flow and sharing of information and knowledge , contribution to conflict-prevention and post-conflict peace-building , and equality between women and men , all best supported through projects in which people take an active role in transforming their values , attitudes and behaviours .  
After peaceful relations and reconciliation are established among all States in the region , Israel will endeavour to establish in the Middle East _ through direct negotiations among all its members _ a zone free of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons , as well as ballistic missiles , based on mutual and effective verification .  
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaimed that all human beings were born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone was entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in the Declaration without distinction of any kind such as race , colour or national origin , yet violations continued daily .  
One level involves selective bilateral / trilateral free trade and integration agreements between interested countries outside the framework of existing subregional / regional integration groupings , mirroring the economic growth zone phenomenon in South-East Asia .

The integrated global system that has been established for the monitoring and warning of hydrometeorlogical hazards through the coordinated activities of national services is dependent on the free and unrestricted exchange of data and the communication of information .  
The Rio Group stands convinced that these treaties will not only strengthen the international non-proliferation regime but will also promote the establishment of other nuclear-weapon-free zones in other parts of the world , which will lead to the gradual expansion of nuclear-weapon-free zones until the ultimate objective of all the States Members of the Organization has been attained a world that is entirely free of nuclear weapons . 
We have noted that the countries involved in the Ottawa process have , of their own free will , arrived at a Convention on the total ban of anti-personnel landmines , and we would like to express our respect for their choice , and our understanding for the humanitarian concern they have demonstrated .

One delegation , also speaking on behalf of a large group , advanced some specific suggestions to the Task Force , among which was that the free flow of accurate and up-to-date information , taking into account the linguistic diversity of the Organization , must remain the primary function of the Department and that the dissemination of relevant information about the United Nations and its programmes should continue to be a core activity of the Department , particularly in developing countries .

Acknowledging that United Nations electoral assistance has facilitated the holding of successful elections in several Member States which resulted in the orderly and non-violent assumption of office by elected officials , recognizing that elections can be free and fair only if held free of coercion and intimidation , and underlining the importance of respect for the results of elections that have been verified as free and fair ,  
It was suggested that further examination may be required of the principle of special and differential treatment for developing countries in the light of the evolving changes relating inter alia to trade preferences , emergence of regional free trade areas between developed and developing countries based on reciprocity , and the interrelationships between these free trade areas and future multilateral trade liberalization .  
The aim of mine-action programmes , therefore , is not only technical - to survey , mark and eradicate mines - but also humanitarian and developmental - to create an environment in which people can live more safely and in which economic and social development can occur free from the constraints imposed by landmine contamination . 
Taking note of the statement by the President of the Security Council of 30 July 1997 [ 4 ] in which the Council , inter alia , welcomed the successful holding of presidential and legislative elections in Liberia on 19 July 1997 , and noted with satisfaction the declaration in the joint certification statement by the Secretary-General and the Chairman of the Economic Community of West African States that the electoral process had been free , fair and credible and that the outcome of the elections reflected the will of the Liberian people ,  
In this context , the Special Rapporteur recalls the need for accurate , balanced and impartial coverage of current affairs including , inter alia , by allocating air time to parties and candidates on a fair and non-discriminatory basis during the period preceding elections , referenda or other important political events when it is essential that voters and candidates alike engage in a free and open discussion of views on pertinent issues . 
Those engaged in such activities make free use of fake end-user certificates , exploit loopholes in the law , evade customs and other airport controls by making clandestine night take-offs and landings , file false flight plans and conceal their movements by using fabricated zone permits , evading radar tracking and observing radio silence in flight .

We have been enthusiastic supporters of all initiatives aimed at limiting the arms trade , in addition to being aware that there are free markets often beyond Government control , we are concerned that the industrialized countries , by lifting embargoes in this field , may begin moving towards the opposite extreme and promote the sale of weapons everywhere , under pressure from the military industry , which has an extremely powerful lobby . 
After nearly eight years of fratricidal civil war and the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) Monitoring Group ( ECOMOG ) intervention in Liberia , countries of the subregion , with only the limited assistance of the international community , finally succeeded in supervising the conduct of presidential and legislative elections in the country in July 1997 , under conditions generally acknowledged to be free and fair .  
This encouraging trend has been achieved through the adoption and pursuit by Governments of policies and measures aimed at ensuring , among others , macroeconomic stability , inflows of foreign direct investment , open and free markets and stable and transparent legal and regulatory frameworks .  
Malta fully supports the efforts of the Organization in the promotion of environmental protection and the sustainable use of the world \ x { e5b8 } natural resources to ensure a more equitable distribution of wealth , and of an international trade regime free of restrictive or discriminatory practices .  
Such rampant speculation or manipulation of hedge funds in the currency and equity markets of developing countries , at a time when they are still feeling their way in a world of fierce global competition , would trigger off a defensive reflex on the part of the affected countries , thereby arousing anti-liberalization , which would be detrimental to free trade .  
After the establishment , as we hope , of peace treaties between Israel and every country of the region , it will be possible to create a regional security system that would provide multilateral and shared solutions to the range of security problems in the Middle East , including a mutually and effectively verifiable Middle East free of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles .  
All the endeavours to establish a new , just and equitable economic world order , free of humiliating conditions and restrictive and onerous practices , are brutally challenged by a powerful minority that reserves the worst and cruellest of the infernos for the rest of the planet . 
In order to put an end to this distressing situation , Africa 's development partners should envisage a comprehensive and integrated mechanism for flexible , operational and effective financing , free of bureaucratic impediments and red tape , with the aim of establishing a centralized funding entity to receive resources from all sources to be devoted to economic and social development .  
However , we know that we can rely on international cooperation , founded not only on solidarity , but on mutual interest and partnership , to overcome the difficulties confronting us , to support our efforts at economic and social recovery , to build a State genuinely based on the rule of law and to construct a free , democratic , modern and prosperous nation .  
In the context of these changes , and more than half a century after the United Nations was established , there is an urgent need for the Organization to undergo drastic reforms , both structural and functional , so as to establish rules and principles for a new international order free of double standards .  
Now we are practically the only country of the Commonwealth of Independent States that had a stable economic growth of about 16 per cent during the first half of this year ; we have arrested the decrease in volumes of industrial production and we are a country free from religious , ethnic or civil strife . 
In the sphere of collective security and the maintenance of world peace , although major catastrophes have been averted , the United Nations has not succeeded in making real the dream of every human being to live in peace in a world free from the pestilence of war and all the attendant horrors of human carnage and the senseless destruction of everything we hold dear .

Nonetheless , it must be explicitly stated that , in Grenada 's view , the Uruguay Round Agreements have created for small developing States significantly more burdens than the benefits they are proclaimed to bring under the banner of global free trade at least now , and for the foreseeable future , unless corrective measures are soon instituted .  
There is strong dissatisfaction in the international community about the fact that while we have a fully functional Tribunal in The Hague , the military and political leaders responsible for the grave violations of humanitarian law and the acts of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Herzegovina remain free .  
Even with the passing years , we can not forget how the international community erred in addressing this crisis by involuntarily encouraging those who , over the course of time , felt increasingly comfortable in giving free rein to their ethnocentric and inhumane aspirations , coldly established as systematic theory .  
That outcome was averted thanks to initiatives taken and to the resolve of the Governments of Central America and friendly countries , which took the proper steps to find a negotiated political solution that responded to the aspirations of the Central American peoples , and in particular to the sovereign right of States to live in peace and freely to determine their own future free from any foreign interference in matters that are essentially within their internal jurisdiction . 
Subsequent developments have continued to be positive , and in 1997 we are witnessing for the first time in many years a Central America free of armed conflict , with legitimate Governments chosen through the free expression of popular will in transparent and pluralistic elections , thus strengthening democratic institutions and , as result , the rule of law . 
Central America has made great progress in demilitarization and in the strengthening of civil society , holding free , transparent and pluralist elections ; integrating former combatants into national political processes ; strengthening democratic institutions and the rule of law ; and implementing a development programme whose central focus is the human being .  
This could well be the real meaning of democracy : constant improvement in living conditions and moving from one level to another through successive Governments with the free vote of the people being the final judge of what is to be done .  
General and complete disarmament is now a universal need , and it should be perceived in its original terms , namely , that there is not nor can there be any alternative to the achievement of true nuclear disarmament , which alone can free mankind from apocalypse , ensure security for all and channel nuclear energy to economic and social development by using it exclusively for peaceful means .  
The intimate relationship between disarmament and non-proliferation commitments , on the one hand , and free trade and cooperation for peaceful purposes , on the other , is reflected in this article , and it is thus essential that the careful balance be preserved as the Convention is implemented .  
The denial of basic human rights , the confiscation of one 's rightful property and ancestral home , the denial of free movement , the obstruction of necessary economic activity , the importation of thousands of foreigners to be settled in confiscated land in occupied territory , the systematic and deliberate splitting of the West Bank through streams of bypass highways and indiscriminately placed settlements all these , in our view , amount to a clear record of violence against the Palestinians by the Israeli authorities .  
It also refers to the arbitrary and coercive measures undertaken against the Arab population , such as administrative detention , collective punishment , the demolition of homes , curfews , the forcible transfer of Bedouin population , closures , impeding the free movement of people and , in particular , the restriction that prevents them from travelling through Jerusalem between the north and south of the country .  
The coalition 's basic aims are : general amnesty for political prisoners ; total respect for the laws in force ; fulfilment by the Government of its international human rights commitments ; adoption by the Government of the measures required to establish a system of free employment and free enterprise ; and free and direct elections .  
The first was the signing at Cairo of the African Nuclear _ Weapon _ Free Zone Treaty as a testimony to the developing countries ' commitment to the cause of nuclear disarmament worldwide and also as a positive and encouraging step which should be followed soon by the negotiation of the establishment of another zone in the Middle East in conformity with the relevant United Nations General Assembly resolutions and as a step towards the implementation of President Mubarak 's proposal concerning the establishment of a zone free from all weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East .  
The Committee urged the Government of the Philippines to adopt a top-priority policy of creating safe and protected jobs for women as a viable economic alternative to the current unemployment of women and their participation as subcontractors and in the informal sector , as workers in free trade zones or as in commercial sex , or as migrant overseas contract workers .

Article 187 further stipulates that : Anyone who has sexual intercourse with a woman without using force , threats or deception but knowing her to be insane , feeble _ minded , under 15 years of age , incapable of exercising her own free will for any reason , or knowing her to be unaware of the nature or unlawfulness of the act to which she is being subjected , shall be liable to a penalty of life imprisonment .

Its President 's statement to the Special Rapporteur , the documentation he turned over and his account of the company 's background in the countries where it has concluded specialized service contracts offer an alternate way of looking at things in which military sciences are likely to be taken out of the State context and to move into the private sector where they offer skilled professional services in a free and global market .  
Regarding data processing and archiving , the Subcommittee noted that to fully exploit the potential of already acquired and future research data , more international cooperation was needed for their proper archiving , to ensure global free access to databases , to develop mechanisms for improving access to meta-data , and to agree on formats and software packages for data conversion that were necessary for scientific research .

The Convention on the Rights of the Child being a point of departure to guarantee child rights ; taking into consideration the progressive character of the implementation of certain social , economic and cultural rights as recognized in article 4 of the Convention , the Government of the Kingdom of Swaziland would undertake the implementation of the right to free primary education to the maximum extent of available resources and expects to obtain the cooperation of the international community for its full satisfaction as soon as possible .  
FITDH urges the working group on a draft optional protocol to fix the minimum age for recruitment into armed forces at 18 in respect of compulsory service as well as voluntary enlistment , since in many cases a minor 's decision to enlist in the armed forces is anything but free , being dictated by various circumstances , such as poverty , coercion , insecurity , a broken home or lack of alternatives , and parental consent is not enough of a guarantee .  
Taking note of the presidential statement of 30 July 1997 [ 1 ] in which the Security Council , inter alia , welcomed the successful holding of presidential and legislative elections in Liberia on 19 July 1997 , noted with satisfaction the declaration in the Joint Certification Statement by the Secretary-General and the Chairman of the Economic Community of West African States that the electoral process had been free , fair and credible and that the outcome of the elections reflected the will of the Liberian people ,

With regard to the right to education ( arts . 28 and 29 ) , while noting that the principle of free , universal and compulsory basic education for all children is recognized by the State party , the Committee is concerned that this fundamental right is not yet fully and equally implemented throughout the country .

The occupation of East Timor , systematically condemned by the relevant bodies of the United Nations , makes abusive and illegitimate any and all attempts to appropriate the genuine collective will of the Timorense People that does not pass through a free process of self-determination , approved by the relevant mechanisms and organs of the United Nations . The Secretary-General has been following with concern reports of recent violent incidents in East Timor which have resulted in loss of life and are causing considerable human suffering .  
Requests the administering Powers to transmit to the Secretary-General information called for under Article 73 e of the Charter of the General Assembly and other updated information and reports , including reports on the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories regarding their future political status as expressed in fair and free referendums and other forms of popular consultation , as well as the results of any informed and democratic processes consistent with practice under the Charter which indicate the clear and freely expressed wish of the people to change the existing status of the Territories ;

The preamble common to the two International Covenants on Human Rights recognizes that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his civil and political rights .

I will not recall here the scale of the guarantees already afforded by my country , whether they be positive or negative , in the latter case through the relevant protocols to treaties establishing nuclear _ weapon _ free zones which have all been ratified by France , which therefore cover more than 100 countries , but as far as the Conference on Disarmament is concerned , the question was more simply whether an ad hoc committee on security assurances with a mandate drawn up in 1992 was still the order of the day .  
The next ministerial meeting of WTO , to be held in Singapore by the end of the year , should assess the implementation of the Uruguay Round agreements , focusing on the difficulties of the developing countries , especially the least developed and net food-importing countries , so as to ensure that all countries benefited from free trade and to sweep away any remaining protectionist or discriminatory notions .  
In that connection , his delegation was deeply concerned that , using the pretext of freedom , democracy or the environment , laws were being promulgated and unilateral restrictions were being imposed which undermined free trade and violated international law and the trading practices negotiated at the multilateral level . 
That was of particular importance in the preparatory process for the World Food Summit , which would deal with the fundamental right of every human being to be free from hunger and malnutrition , international cooperation for the elimination of unilateral economic and trade measures , eradication of poverty , and international mobilization and channelling of technical , technological and financial resources so as to improve access to food for all .

Negotiation of a free _ standing new legal instrument dealing exclusively with a transfer ban , even in a fully compatible way with the provisions of the Ottawa Convention , would raise a number of political and legal problems , such as lack of global vocation , setting a precedent by negotiating a partial ban after a clear majority of States has signed a comprehensive one , proliferation of legal instruments dealing with the same content , just to name a few .

More recently , MERCOSUR has adopted a protocol on competition policy proscribing individual conduct or concerted agreements impeding , restricting or distorting competition or free access to markets or abusing a dominant position in a relevant regional market within MERCOSUR and affecting trade between its member States .

The readiness demonstrated by the Arab States to take practical steps towards the establishment of an effectively verifiable Middle East zone free from all weapons of mass destruction - nuclear , chemical and biological - and to refrain from taking any measures that preclude the achievement of this objective in accordance with paragraph 5 of the 1995 resolution on the Middle East as well as paragraph 14 of Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) should not go unnoticed .  
The supplementary agreements stipulate that 8 August 1999 will be the date for the ballot to take place , both inside and outside East Timor , and that a secure environment devoid of violence or other forms of intimidation is a prerequisite for the holding of a free and fair popular consultation .

This would seem to suggest that Governments may follow one of two paths to development , the first encompassing a vision of a free trade economy with heavy reliance on foreign investment and foreign technology , and the other centring on a vision of a deep and diverse industrial sector with predominantly nationally owned enterprises capable of autonomous innovation .  
Following these informal consultations , the President made a statement to the media , on behalf of the members of the Council , expressing their concern at renewed fighting and their support for ECOWAS and other international efforts to bring peace ; calling upon all parties to halt military operations and allow the free flow of humanitarian assistance ; and urging all parties to renew their commitments to the Abuja peace process and to respect the ceasefire of 3 February .

However , to legitimize beyond any doubt the ways and means used to take issues that originally belonged to the realm of international law away from it and to justify making them subject solely to domestic legislation unilaterally passed by the States and adjudicated by domestic non-indigenous courts , States should produce unassailable proof that the indigenous peoples in question have expressly and of their own free will renounced their sovereign attributes .  
During short-term microgravity experiments on board aeroplanes , research will be conducted on the correlation between the electrophoretic direct current field and the variable gravity field with electrophoretic instruments for continuous free current stream in space and equipment for life science experiments on manned space missions will be developed and relevant scientific research initiated .  
The main features of globalization have been an increasing reliance on a deregulated global market , maximally free trade , uncontrolled flow of investment , and the paramount role of the international financial market , with the IMF and the World Bank moving to the centre stage of world power .

This is particularly visible with regard to the eradication of poverty , which needs a human rights underpinning , as well as concerning economic , social and cultural rights for which operationalization wavers between an unrealistic expectation that the Government will provide necessary services to all free of charge , and surrender in the face of the combined obstacles of poverty and debt servicing . 
Allow me also to express the hope that this recently adopted decision will constitute a spur to promote the work of the Conference on Disarmament and afford us a real opportunity to share with the five new members the arduous work which the international community expects of us in negotiating multilateral disarmament treaties with particular attention to the objective of achieving a world which is free of nuclear weapons .

The independent expert expresses the hope that all actors will help to create conditions that will allow the electoral process to continue without incident so that free , democratic and transparent elections can be held with the broadest possible participation by the Haitian people .  
The independent expert encourages all the actors involved to pursue the political dialogue that they have already begun , but he can not insist enough on the current priority : the holding of free , democratic and transparent elections , without which it will be impossible to ensure the institutional stability that is essential if the innumerable challenges facing the Government and people of Haiti are to be met .

The General Assembly , Considering that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights1 proclaims that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out therein , without distinction of any kind , in particular as to race , colour or national origin ,  
Globalization was the newest form of economic colonialism ; it made possible the efficient exploitation of vulnerable nations in the name of free markets and allowed transnational capitalists to rampage through the developing world , sometimes with the connivance , and even the active participation , of the rich elite of those poor countries .

As a staunch advocate of free trade and relations between nations , on the basis of respect for the norms and principles of international law , and consistent with its own cherished values and traditions , the United States clearly can not persist in its current policy against Cuba , with its serious humanitarian impact on the lives of the valiant Cuban people .  
In the context of the process of growing interdependence , even as calls are being made for free access to financial markets , goods , services , it is paradoxical to witness situations in which obstacles to such interaction are erected unilaterally and without regard for their effects upon the human development of a people even more so when we see that those obstacles are erected by applying internal norms with extraterritorial scope or effects that run counter to international public law .

Such activities should promote the free dissemination and mutual exchange of information and knowledge in cultural and scientific fields , assist in educational , social and economic development , particularly in the developing countries , enhance the qualities of life of all peoples and provide recreation with due respect to the political and cultural integrity of States .  
Initiatives in this area include safe delivery and neo-natal assistance , cervical and breast cancer prevention , voluntary access to contraceptive methods , regulation of surgical male and female sterilization , assistance within the public health system for legal abortion and adequate treatment of incomplete abortion.The number of free pre-natal care visits in Brazil increased almost threefold in the last four years .

Development is unsustainable where the rule of law and equity do not exist ; where ethnic , religious or sexual discrimination are rampant ; where there are restrictions on free speech , free association and the media ; or where large numbers of people live in abject and degrading poverty .  
The draft should use as its starting point the preamble common to the two international Covenants of 1966 , as well as other relevant instruments which recognize that the ideal of the free individual , delivered from fear and poverty , can not be achieved without the creation of conditions allowing each person to enjoy all human rights .

For the next election process to be perceived as free and fair , and for the full recognition of legitimacy in the authorities elected , the international community expects a stable environment , where fundamental rights can be guaranteed , where freedom of movement and expression is assured and where democracy can indeed be exercised .

The 10-year history of Pudong development also demonstrates the adherence to the strategy of Emphasizing both on economy and ideology and of the ideological education of stressing both spiritual civilization and material civilization as a key reason of the successful development of Pudong . The adherence also is the guarantee of a Party free of corruption , and of a fine social mood .  The Pudong development project stuck to the principle of To accelerate the first-class development project with first-class Party construction .  
Giving free rein to democratic parties and non-party personalities in participating in administration and discussion of state affairs is good for the state 's policies , laws , and major decisions to embody the masses ' will to the maximum and conducive to enhancing the scientific and democratic level of the party and government 's policy decisions .  
It is necessary to safeguard the unity of leading groups to enhance the cohesion force of party committees , uphold collective leadership to strengthen the fighting force of party committees , stay honest , upright , and free from corruption to enhance the appealing force of party committees , and realistically build party committees at all levels into strong leading collectives which can consciously uphold and comprehensively practice the " three represents " .  
Fifth , we must establish a sound mechanism of management to prevent administered and controlled narcotics , psychotropic substances , and precursor chemicals from entering illegal channels .  We must gradually establish an effective mechanism of management based on supervision , control , and cooperation among different departments .  We must continue to improve the import and export inspection mechanism based on cooperation of all departments concerned to ensure trouble free in the process of producing , marketing , transporting , using , and importing and exporting precursor chemicals .  
As a friendly neighbor of ASEAN and a partner of mutual trust and cooperation , China has had a high regard all along for the positive role that ASEAN plays in regional affairs , respecting ASEAN 's efforts to establish a peaceful , free , and neutral region , supporting ASEAN 's economic integration , and hoping to consolidate and expand the multi-level exchanges and cooperation with ASEAN in the areas of economics and trade , science and technology , and society , etc . "  
Enterprises or local labor and social security departments should help military cadres ' families who were laid off because their enterprises gone bankrupt or suspended production .  Enterprises or local labor and social security departments should follow relevant policies and regulations to protect their basic livelihood condition .  Meanwhile , they should provide them with free professional guidance at least once in a year and free employment recommendation three times a year .  
Fidel Castro rose in uprising in the backyard of the United States 41 years ago .  He led the people of Cuba in waging a heroic and tenacious struggle , broke free from the shackles of the United States , overthrew the puppet dictatorial regime of Fulgencio Baptista , and established the independent regime of the Cuban people .  
It was disclosed that the entire system is likely to cost as much as $ 60-billion upon completion .  However , no one is yet sure if the system will serve as " a seamless heavenly robe " free of problems upon completion .  Moreover , as modern science and technology are still developing at lightning speed , it is difficult to tell if the NMD system will end up as a heap of waste material in future .  
The world is still not free from disturbance .  In face of the complicated situation in which international relations are undergoing profound adjustments , opportunities and challenges coexist , political parties of all countries , including the ruling , participating , and opposition parties , are keeping eyes on the 21st century in a bid to explore a development strategy that better fits the trend of the times and their respective reality .  
They should spend more time on studying than entertaining for social purposes , and should pay more attention to making contributions than considering their personal gains .  Each of them should strive to be a person who is pure , lofty , moral , free from vulgar interests and beneficial to the people .  
At this time , we must do an outstanding job on the following key links : first , we must entirely eliminate market barriers to realize self-motivated commodity trading and free commodity circulation and to ensure timely and rapid transportation of domestic agricultural products to the international market .  
The US military reconnaissance plane 's spying activities in the airspace over China 's exclusive economic waters actually overran the scope of " free over-flight " allowed by international law , and violated the relevant stipulations of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea .  
In the wake of former president Lee Teng-hui 's visit to the United States in 1995 , communist China 's air force overturned the decades-long tacit understanding that its fighter aircraft would not venture far over the sea .  After the two-state theory incident in the summer of 1999 , the communist military aircraft even considered west of the strait 's central line as the scope of their free movements .  
These provisions indicate that " other rights " of a coastal country over its exclusive economic zone include its sovereignty and territorial integrity being free from violation as well as its right to protect its national security and peace and other rights granted by international law .  
As mentioned above , the US military reconnaissance plane abused free overflight in airspace over China 's coastal waters , violated flying rules , bumped against and destroyed a Chinese plane , and entered China 's territorial airspace and landed on China 's military airfield without authorization .  That already constituted an incident of serious violation of international law .  
They maintained : On the question of whether the free trade zone plan can be implemented in 2005 , the key lies in whether the developed countries in the north can help the poverty-stricken countries in the south create conditions for participating in free trade competition .  
Economically , the ideology of the Western bourgeoisie emerging in theoretical patterns often serves its economic interests .  For example , the theory of " free trade " has long become the " moral reference " for the developed countries in the West to freely import and export their capital and commodities into and out of developing countries to seek excessive profits for monopolistic capital .  
After developing into an international financial center , with its freely convertible currency , a sound legal system , an environment for fair competition , and the tariff-free advantage , Hong Kong 's free economy will attain further development . 
After the European Union began to function as an integrated regional economic entity , and after the United States pursued trade policies to strengthen the Free Trade Area of the Americas , a new , noteworthy trend has emerged in the Asia-Pacific region since last year , with bilateral and small multilateral interaction in the region taking the place of economic globalization as a primary phenomenon in the Asian-Pacific region .  In some countries and regions , there has been a great upsurge in signing bilateral and small multilateral free trade agreements .  
Given the reality that European and American free trade areas are growing stronger by the day and that various countries and regions in the Asia-Pacific region are choosing bilateral and small multilateral regional free trade as their next best choice , both sides of the strait must consider the question of forming a unique economic area under the constraints of external influences .  
If this situation is not resolved , people will be unable to clearly distinguish between the problems of national position , the independence and reunification issue and values of political parties and ideology , and will be unable to understand that free and democratic human rights can not supersede the framework of national sovereignty and the integrity of territory .  The DPP government of Chen Shui-bian can not let go of their evil intentions in the form of a coalition government .  
We must reform the way elementary education teaching materials are published and distributed to provide rural primary and middle school students with affordable , suitable textbooks , and we must gradually begin to provide free textbooks to children of families having economic difficulties .  
To solve the problem of " insufficient services " from the government in the course of structural adjustment , the party committee and government of Linyi County have intensified market forecast and perspective study , put forward the objectives of building Linyi into a " large agricultural county free of environmental pollution " , and led the peasants in developing ecological agriculture , unique agriculture , sophisticated agriculture , and agriculture in which production is carried out on orders .  
To carry out economic construction as the central task is the basic means and fundamental way out for us to break free of poverty and backwardness , attain all-round social progress in Tibet , constantly satisfy the people 's needs materially and culturally , ensure a constant improvement in the people 's living standard and join the rest of the country in achieving a relatively comfortable standard of living .  
A relevant expert with the State Development Planning Commission has expressed the following view : The fundamental solution to the problem of illegal capital outflow driven by the desire to seek the maximum profit is to allow the free outflow of capital .  
Public feelings became jittery , the investment environment deteriorated , foreign investors showed a lack of confidence , economic depression set in , and the stock market index began its free fall .  People are finding their wealth dwindling and are having a hard time making ends meet .  They have lost their faith in the future .  
They should adapt to the new situation in the context of developing a socialist market economy and free themselves , once and for all , from the ideas , concepts , and approaches of work formed under the system of planned economy .  They should take a step further and change their function from predominantly regulating country markets to regulating the unified national market and from managing the market by mainly relying on administrative means to managing the market by law .  
The Military Region Air Force not only further increased the frequency of no-notice attacks , it also made them more difficult and intense .  When it selected air routes , it broke free of the previous method of using high altitudes and the same routes .  It made a point to select low altitudes , extra low altitudes , and new air routes , to minimize radar warning time as much as possible .  
To break out of the ideological deadlock and be free of the mode of " management by vertical lines of division , " the crucial thing to do is to proceed from the actual need of an integrated battlefield , firmly establish the mentality of the whole and , in light of the uniqueness of the essence of joint operation of various arms and services , build an organizational system that adapts to the blending of various support forces , to the release of various support capabilities and to the optimized allocation of various support resources .  
Of course , immunity is a symbol of sovereignty and its concrete exercise should be correspondingly standardized in a reasonable way .  For instance , vehicles which pass through the tunnels without paying toll should be marked " on relevant duty " whereas vehicles going for a " free ride " on the street for recreational purposes will have to pay toll .  
Fourth , various localities in the western region should work out their concrete plans according to the local conditions under the overall plan of the central authorities on the grand western development .  In drafting the concrete plans , attention should be paid to abiding by the market economic rules , giving free rein to the markets , and making the best use of their advantages while bypassing their disadvantages .  
We are making further efforts to strengthen foreign trade , taking even more flexible measures by reference to preferential policies in free trade zones , and lifting the control over and invigorating in an organized manner the markets of traditional trade with adjacent countries to intensify efforts in opening along the border .  
Therefore , in actual life , freedom of press is a free and democratic right approved [ ren ke 6126 0668 ] and protected by the law .  Meanwhile , there are also specific limiting stipulations to prevent the wanton use of freedom of press in order to more effectively protect the realization of freedom of press .  
In light of the international environment and based on China 's specific conditions , our service industry should be divided into three broad sectors , namely , totally open , totally closed , and partially open sectors , or free , non-free , and semi-free sectors .

The part of cross-strait relations in the new Taiwan leader 's inaugural speech superficially looked mild and prudent in words and phrases and involved no hackneyed and stereotyped expressions openly advocating " Taiwan independence . "  However , if we read this speech more carefully , it will not be difficult for us to find that this new leader did not make any concession on the issues related to principles , did not free himself from the keynotes of " the two-state theory , " and stubbornly adhered to the stance on " Taiwan independence . "  
It is still unknown whether the reform of the new Taiwan authorities , centered on and motivated by " democracy and human rights , " will be effective in the economic sphere to again achieve a miracle in the free market economy .  However , it is conceivable that this reform of " democracy and human rights " and " rule by law " will objectively bring greater troubles for the motherland 's peace and reunification in disregard of the people 's will .  
We have mentioned earlier in this article that the Taiwan authorities , who are holding high the " democracy and human rights " banner , have always vilified the motherland and the Chinese Communists to seek benefits for themselves .  As a result of extensive publicity and slander over a long period , a simple psychological pattern has been created in the Taiwan people that the mainland 's socialist system and the Chinese Communists ' leadership is no good and not free and democratic , whereas Taiwan 's capitalist system is good , free , and democratic .  
During this forum with the theme " Economic Globalization : Development of Asia and China , " 76 participants from China and 20 other countries and areas discussed and exchanged views on economic globalization and its impacts , on the basis of equality and in a free and realistic atmosphere .  Their discussion represented the broad , diverse , and all-embracing characteristics of this type of high-level academic forums .  
When the " 4 June " incident took place on the mother mainland in 1989 , the statements made by the then new Taiwan leader involved the phrases with Chinese historical complex , such as the " free Republic of China " " supported its patriotic compatriots , " who should " closely unite as one " to " realize democratic reunification . "  One-China that Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo followed during their rule of Taiwan for decades can " carefully be observed " in their statements .  
Both sides stand for world multipolarization .  They stressed the necessity [ English version uses " need " ] to establish an equitable , just , fair and reasonable new international political and economic order that is free of hegemonism and power politics and is based on equality .  They indicated their readiness to work together for the establishment of such a new order .  
The two sides are committed to a world free from nuclear , biological or chemical weapons .  They stressed that the international regime for eliminating and prohibiting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction should be permanently and indiscriminately applicable to all regions and countries with no exception .  
This policy forced the Kuomintang authorities in Taiwan to lift the Martial Law at the end of 1986 and to open up indirect " three links " on both sides of the strait , enabled Taiwan to have opportunities to carry out a series of social , political and economic reforms under a peaceful environment , and facilitated democratic politics and free market economy in Taiwan .  
When conducting a " strategic security tour " to Washington in April 1999 , he had extensive contacts with US congressmen and officials .  One of his purposes was to " express firmly to them that the security , dignity , and development in Taiwan must be safeguarded and supported .  A free and democratic Taiwan is the key to global strategic security and one of the links in US national interests . "  
When the Five-Starred flag rose up slowly on both banks of the Victoria Harbor three years ago , people were filled with great joy , yet there was still a faint trace of worry on their mind : After Hong Kong returns to socialist China , will this " free port " be able to retain its original vigor and appeal , and will it continue to enjoy prosperity and stability ?  
( 2 ) Such arenas and facilities as " patriotic education bases , " " science and technology education bases for teenagers , " and " moral education bases " named by the state and relevant provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal departments must be open to teenage students at low rates or , given attempts are vigorously made to create the conditions , for free .  
( 3 ) All other types of public cultural facilities - - museums , memorial halls , science and technology halls , cultural centers ( stations ) , sports arenas ( gymnasiums ) , theaters , workers ' cultural palaces ( clubs ) - - and enterprises and institutions , cultural and sports facilities affiliated with social group , and extracurricular education facilities must uphold the principle of public welfare , extend the hours opened to teenage students , and be open to teenage students for free or at low rates during festivals and holidays .  
It has been revealed that each test costs some $ 100 million , a preliminary system would cost $ 10 billion , and the entire system could cost as much as $ 60 billion .  Even after spending so much money , no one can say with certainty that the completed system would be flawless and problem free .  Besides , with the rapid development of modern science and technology , it is difficult to predict that the NMD would not become a pile of trash in the future .  
In addition , through strengthening bilateral ties , Russia has correspondingly established a partial balancing mechanism within east and west , with the result that its own activities on the international stage have become more free and its international influence has further expanded .  
He said : China has consistently pursued the principle of non-interference in other countries ' internal affairs and respected the choice of the Yugoslav people .  China believes that the Yugoslav people are fully capable of solving their current problem free from external interference .  
After comparing the completely different prospects for the stock markets across the Taiwan strait , Kao Ching-yuan , chairman of Taiwan 's President Group , and Wang You-zen , chairman of Taiwan 's Libar group , pointed out in a clear-cut manner at a forum sponsored by the TAIEX and attended by heads of Taiwan 's listed companies that the free fall of Taiwan 's stock market was not due to the economic factors .  Wang You-zen was more direct , saying " human factor " was the cause of Taiwan 's stock market blue .  
For a long period of time , people in China are accustomed to regarding culture as a social welfare undertaking ; and the government has spent money on running the cultural undertaking and provided it as a free welfare service for its residents , unaware that culture itself is also a precious social and economic resource .  
However , it is expected to be nearly impossible that the two sides will sign any substantive agreement on forming free trade ties in the near future , and even less probable they will establish a " China-ASEAN free trade zone , " because that will involve a lot of complicated issues .  
When carrying out education on the " three stresses , " the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee has remained in close contact with the reality of state-run enterprise reform , has enhanced its understanding , has united its thinking , and has adopted vigorous measures in the areas of adjusting structures , reforming organizations and systems , and focusing on the restructuring of large enterprises while giving free hand to small ones .  It has provided a powerful force for promoting reform of the state-run enterprises and for extricating them from their difficulties .  
After going through the " three stresses " campaign , the thinking of every locality is much more free and the spirit is much more inspired ; conspicuous problems , problems of hotspots , and problems of difficult points that all appeared in the process of reform and development have been solved ; the cohesive power and fighting strength of Party organizations have been strengthened ;  
in particular , political forces standing for human rights and environmental protection and opposing free trade have continually expanded , with the result that it was very difficult for Gore to build a broad and close-knit Democratic Party campaign alliance . 
while trade unions , environmental protection and human rights organizations within the Democratic Party are quite active in recent years , opposing free trade and intensifying their liberal stand on many social issues .  
Schools must actively mobilize themselves , proceed on the basis of their own situations , study and formulate realistic and feasible plans for logistical socialization and reform , transform ideas , thoroughly eliminate the old way of thinking of higher education of taking on everything in society , resolutely break free from traditional logistical management models , and set up a new type of logistical safeguard system for higher education that is suited to the national situation of China .  
It is understood that Fujian is quite interested in tourism that the mini three links may bring , but thinks that if free travel is restricted to residents of Kinmen , Matsu , Xiamen and Fuzhou , it will not be sufficient to exploit tourist resources .  Assuming that 700 people are going to Kinmen everyday , it will not take long for every Xiamen resident to have visited Kinmen once .  Tourists from Kinmen are fewer in number .  
Authoritative figures point out that tariff concessions are a basic obligation on WTO members ; on the basis of mutual benefit and concession , these are aimed at lowering the general level of important and export tariffs , and in particular reducing high tariffs hampering imports , and also at setting the maximum tariffs for certain commodities , that is , constraining tariff rates and not levying tariffs in excess of those limits , so as to promote the free development of international trade .  
Charged with a heavy task , the women 's federations or their organizations at all levels should give full scope to the unique superiority of the broad masses of women and families in resisting an evil cult ; should help " Falungong " practitioners free themselves from the spiritual control of the evil cult ideologically , organizationally , and once and for all ; and should help them keep abreast with the pace of the times by enjoying to the full a warm or progressive life brought by science and civilization as well .  
The gradual and conditional opening of the B share market in China will greatly promote the process of internationalization of the Chinese securities markets and make good preparations for the realization of an unified , and open international securities markets , where the free exchange of renminbi for foreign money can be realized while dealing with capital items in the future .  
Although it is impossible to make a concrete judgment before the detailed rules for the implementation of the policy are promulgated , yet the fact that foreign and domestic investors compete with one another to trade B shares in the same markets and their profits and losses are inevitably reflected in the balance of international payments in foreign exchange shows that , after all , extremely important progress has been made even though we can not say that the free convertibility of renminbi is right under our noses . 
In our struggle against the " Falungong " cult , we conscientiously implemented the spirit of a series of instructions from the party center , gave full play to the advantage of ideological and political work , and offered all-dimensional help and education .  We managed to transform an overwhelming majority of those who practiced " Falungong " and , in particular , helped 43 fanatic followers of " Falungong " free themselves from their spiritual shackles .  
First , it is necessary to link such activities with developing the rural economy and guiding farmers to free themselves from poverty and achieve a better-off level of moderate prosperity .  It is necessary to firmly instill grass-roots cadres in rural areas with the idea of taking economic development as the central task and to make them concentrate their energy on developing the rural economy and on raising farmers ' incomes .  
After its return to the motherland , Hong Kong will retain the status of a free port and an international financial , trade and shipping centre while continuing to maintain and develop its economic and cultural relations with other countries , regions and relevant international organisations so that this international economic metropolis will forever be vigorous and dynamic .  
Its advantageous geographical location , its free port policy of complete openness , its well-developed legal system and highly efficient team of civil service , and its effective economic management and civic administration have all facilitated Hong Kong 's economic development .  
These four crucial factors which are not going to change include the legal system ; the free entrepreneurial spirit that Hong Kong upholds and a level playing field thus created ; the clean and efficient Special Administrative Region ( SAR ) civil service ; and the free flow of information .  
The spokesman also said the Government is determined to protect the cornerstones of Hong Kong 's success .  These include the rule of law , an independent judiciary , a level playing field , an honest , efficient and politically neutral civil service , a first class economic infrastructure and the free flow of information .  
" Against our free trade philosophy , the prime objectives of Hong Kong for the international trade forums are two-fold : first , to further the benefits of trade liberalisation with a view to achieving the global free trade and second , to maintain a rule-based multilateral trading system which is relevant and responsive to the needs of the modern business world , " he said .  
" It is inappropriate and often misleading to describe the actual change in households ' well-being without taking into account the various welfare provisions by the Government including free-subsidised education service , low cost public housing , free medical care , retraining and other government subvented welfare services all of which contribute to improving the living standard of the disabled , the elderly , the single parents and the low income households , " the spokesman added . 
The four important pillars which underpinned Hong Kong 's economic success before the changeover , which are the rule of law , a level playing field for all who do business in Hong Kong , a corruption-free public service and free flow of information , have all remained to ensure Hong Kong 's continued success as it takes on its new role as China 's premier international financial centre . 
Part of Hong Kong 's success is also as a result of our promotion of free competitive environment , the strict adherence to the rule of law , minimum bureaucracy and a level playing field and a strong commitment against corruption - all provided and supported by an efficient civil service .  
Hong Kong , in its continued capacity as a free port and an international financial , trade and shipping center , will play an even more active role in strengthening the economic cooperation between China 's mainland and other countries in the world .  
" We are the freest society and most vibrant economy of our time because Hong Kong has always practised free enterprise and free trade , insisted on prudent financial management policies and keeping a low taxation system , upheld the rule of law and placed emphasis on an efficient , executive-led government and a quality oriented civil service , " he said .  
" As stated by our Secretary , it is in HKSAR 's own economic and commercial interest to maintain effective controls over strategic commodities trade because only by so doing can we ensure our free access to sophisticated goods and technologies essential for Hong Kong 's economic development , " Mr Lai said . 
- investigate diseases and unusual deaths reported in wholesale and retail markets ; - improve environmental hygiene at wholesale markets ; - work on the issue of a prohibition order to prevent the importation of live chickens other than those that are derived from farms certified free from the disease by the Veterinary Officer of the exporting country .  
Hong Kong has a sound and effective financial monitoring system ; ample fiscal reserves as well as prudent financial management policies .  The Government is free of any foreign debts .  Private firms also exercise financial prudence when seeking foreign loans .  
All election advertisements must be marked with serial numbers except a single sheet of paper not larger than A4 size bearing printing details , materials sent through the free postage service or by electronic means , and balloons .  
" I think , if anything , Hong Kong represents a model of economic management others in Asia are now realising they should try to follow : a free market under the rule of law ; a clean government which believes in prudent financial management and in not directing the economy ; a well-regulated and well-managed financial sector ; a reputation for playing by the rules ; openness and accountability , " Mr Tsang concluded .  
We have a free and open economy ; excellent regulatory systems ; huge fiscal and foreign reserves ; tried , tested and successful fiscal policies ; level playing field for all who do business here ; a vigorous anti-corruption commission ; a versatile and flexible workforce ; and world class infrastructure and communication .  
At the same time , the Civil Service has learned to work together with an increasingly proactive legislature , subject ourselves to vigorous monitoring by independent watchdog bodies such as the Ombudsman 's Office , opened ourselves up to a free and aggressive media , and enhanced our transparency through the promulgation of the Code of Access to Information .  
I am confident that , with our strong fundamentals , coupled with our flexibility of adaptation to external shock , and with the extent of price and cost adjustment that our free market economy has allowed us to go through up to now , our economy should be able to rebound expeditiously from the current doldrums , once the regional situation has settled , and our outlook beyond that remains bright . 
Furthermore , there are the rule of law , a low and predictable tax regime , an efficient and honest civil service , free flow of information and an efficient and sound financial system .  
" We represent the model of sound economic management in the region : a truly free market operating under the rule of law ; a well-regulated financial sector ; and a clean government that has exercised great prudence in fiscal management , " he said .  
At public swimming pools , the Urban Services Department and Regional Services Department had strictly implemented the hourly sampling of the pool water ensuring that the free residual chlorine level is maintained at the level sufficient to kill the virus .  
Holders of valid Dumping Licences for public filling areas may be permitted to dump materials such as earth , building debris , broken rock and concrete at the barging point provided that the materials are free from marine mud , household refuse , plastic , metal , industrial and chemical waste , animal and vegetable matter and other materials considered unsuitable . 
In short , our commitment to an open and free market and to the linked exchange rate system is paramount .  We will be vigilant in safeguarding them .  And we will make sure they will continue to work well to the benefit of the public and all local and overseas investors even when external economic conditions are turbulent .  It is our duty to the local community and to the stability of the regional markets .  
The swimming team has achieved outstanding results .  Mr Fu Tai-chun netted a total of five medals , with four new World Masters Games records .  These included a gold in 50-metre breast stroke , a silver in 50-metre back stroke and three bronze medals in 50-metre free style , 100-metre free style and 50-metre butterfly .  His team-mate Mr Chan Kam-por also won for himself a bronze medal in the 100 - metre breast stroke .  
Apart from the free legal aid advisory service , there were also exhibition panels featuring colourful illustrations and statistical graphs on the scope of service , and video presentation on divorce proceedings and personal injury claims , as well as a specially designed quiz with attractive prizes for successful entrants .  
" It is too simplistic - and also unfair - to judge our commitment to the free market by a single , extraordinary battle at a time of great economic turmoil , and when massive , secretive and destructive capital flows were creating havoc in the markets . "  
To ensure that the pool worker is clean and hygienic , the free residual chlorine level is maintained at the level of 0.5-1.0 parts per million ( ppm ) for adequate disinfection ; whereas the pH value is maintained at a level of 7.2-7.8 to provide swimmers with the desirable water quality .  
The following hygiene standard on water quality of swimming pools is set by the Department of Health : for pools using ozone as disinfectant , the free residual chlorine level should be kept at a minimum of 0.5 parts per million ( ppm ) ; while for pools using chlorine as disinfectant , the free residual chlorine level should be kept at a minimum of 1.0 ppm .  
We also are determined to uphold the rule of law , the free market principles , clean and efficient government , sound and transparent regulations and prudent fiscal management , the hallmarks of our past success .  
( c ) Apart from offering nine years ' free and universal basic education to all children between the ages of 6 and 15 , the Government has been raising the education level of the public through various measures .  For example , the Adult Education Section of the Education Department provides adult education at primary and secondary levels and English courses for interested persons aged 15 or above .  It also subvents non-government organisations in providing adult education courses , including literacy class .  
" We are a model of sound economic management , with a free market operating under the rule of law , a well-regulated financial sector and a clean government that exercises prudence in its fiscal policies .  
These include a well developed financial infrastructure , a conducive regulatory environment and sound supervisory process , free and open markets , a modern and effective legal system and a high degree of transparency .  
More importantly , Hong Kong 's edge over the other East Asian economies has been underpinned by a host of other factors , such as a good quality labour force , a low and simple taxation system , a stable government , a corruption free society , an efficient transport and telecommunications infrastructure , sound legal and regulatory systems , free flow of information , and most important of all , a huge and rapidly growing hinterland just to the north of Hong Kong , " Mr Tsang said .  
According to the Statement on Competition Policy promulgated by the Government , in determining whether HKTDC has contravened the principle of fair competition in providing exhibition services , we should consider whether HKTDC or its ES has been involved in practices which are restrictive , detrimental to economic efficiency or free trade , and against the overall interest of Hong Kong .  
To achieve an attractive environment , conventional high-rise office-type development will be replaced by a comprehensively designed commercial ' groundscraper ' with a landscaped deck providing free pedestrian access from Statute Square to the future recreational / tourism - related facilities along the waterfront .  
" The passionate , informed and civilized argument which took place over this issue only goes to show that Hong Kong remains a free and vigilant society where decisions critical to the foundations of our civil society must be debated , discussed and dissected in an open and transparent manner . 
The competition , jointly held for the first time by the two Municipal Councils , was divided into three groups : ( 1 ) free standing litter container for outdoor , ( ii ) hanging type litter container for outdoor , and ( iii ) free standing litter container for indoor . 
* All election advertisements must be marked with serial numbers starting from " one " .  Printed materials on a single sheet of paper not larger than A4 size and bearing printing details , materials sent through the free postage service or transmitted by electronic means , balloons , T-shirts , caps , badges and carrier bags are exempted from this requirement .  
We have one of the most modern airports in the world .  We are at the doorstep of the vast and yet untapped market of the Mainland of China ; a duty free port in the middle of East Asia ; and half of the world 's population is within a flying time of five hours from Hong Kong , " he said .

As for Hong kong , it is also a center of capitalism , has a special culture brought about by the mix of Orient and Occident , has highly developed communications and access to a wealth of information ; it is very free and people do n't interfere in each other 's lives ; it is very liberal , and no one cares about your political position ; already thirty percent of its broadcasting is Mandarin music , and it will take at least five years before its creative capabilities catch up to Taiwan .  
This traditional " matchmaker " field , which one would have thought would have been wiped out by free choice in love and marriage , is not only alive and kicking ; in the last ten years it has experienced a complete turnaround to become a hot profession . Besides the matchmaking columns and programs popular in the media , an even greater number of specialized , commercialized " modern super matchmakers " are popping up everywhere .  
Koo Chen-fu , who has long been known as an " ambassador of trade " holds a similar view : " The main global economic organizations that we 're fighting to join at present now are GATT , which regulates the world 's free trading system ; the International Monetary Fund , which regulates the world 's financial system ; the World Bank , which assists in the development of developing countries ; and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , which is made up of the world 's leading industrialized countries . "  
Moreover , Hong Kong has become an international free port in the last twenty years and a financial center . Apart from its explosion of wealth , it has also been very hard to resist the temptations of the flow of imported luxuries from all over the world . Thus , generally speaking , most Hong Kong people like to boast about what they love to enjoy ; enjoyment ( usually material ) has become a very important social value .  
In the free democratic societies that have mostly replaced authoritarian societies , the upper level is formed from the middle level and the middle level from the lower level . No one 's position is permanently occupied , and there are no strong authoritarian forces blocking interaction and communication . Mutual understanding is n't difficult .  
For remote areas where treatment is not easily accessible , the hospital 's Departtment of Family Medicine works with volunteers to organize a roving medical team , which goes deep into poor remote areas to deliver free care to the people . Dr . Lai Yu-chia has just completed a half-year stint on the roving volunteer team .  
Fortyeight-year-old Li Feng-chin is already a grandma and takes care of a sizable vegetable garden ; as for Cheng Mei-hsia , born in 1970 , after having a child she resigned her full time accounting job and entered the relatively free puma company ; Liao Chiu-hsiang , born in 1969 , hated the dull routine of factory work and after working in northern Taiwan for more than a year decided to return to Hsiluo to dance with the cloth horse .  
In this situation the government decided to set up a special project , enlisting the ITRI 's Mechanical Industry Research Laboratories to bring in American technology for combined research and development . When the development was finished , hands were joined again with the private sector to establish a compressor factory , with joint production and distribution free of Japanese control .  
In line with this policy the Ministry of Justice has prepared an Anti-Corruption Plan , the four main aims of which are to make public officials " afraid to be corrupt , unable to be corrupt , unwilling to be corrupt and free of the need to be corrupt . "  
However , Chou Yu-kou says she had no wish to take on the solemn mission of the " biographer of a historical figure , " but rather that as a news reporter she simply wished to make discussion of political topics more free and information more open . Also , by writing in a style " closer to real life and to ordinary people , " she hoped to give the general public a closer understanding of politicians ' joys and sorrows and the way they think .  
He says , " True religion takes the self-awareness of the innateness of individual being as its foundation . This either calls up innate understanding and comprehension , or establishes active and positive beliefs , providing the truth about the end of the universe , the ultimate purpose of human life , and paths to follow to achieve the liberation of the soul , and other specific answers . Individual beings then make a choice depending upon their free will and their spiritual needs " ( p . 185 ) .  
Perhaps a philosophy of life and death can be free from objectivity , formality , and rigidity , but it has the opposite critical problem of becoming personalized , and freely verified only in one 's own mind , so it is impossible to come to a common spiritual consensus .  
Today 's society is even more complex , and the powers ascribed to the tiger have also become more diverse . As people 's understanding of nature has increased , the tiger has lost its mystique , and with so few tigers left there is no longer any likelihood of people finding themselves in a face-to-face struggle with a tiger . Thus people are free to develop their own human perspective and let the tiger symbolize whatever they want it to .  
China 's Minority Peoples For photographers anxious to free themselves from commonplace and boring subjects , China 's ethnic minorities , with their unique customs , rustic appearances , colorful , varied clothing , and rugged , lofty mountains as a backdrop , hold a glamor that is difficult to express .  
The people complained that insurance premiums were too high . In the past an insurance policy allowed for free treatment ; now it has for no apparent reason taken a leap upward in cost due to the " partial cost sharing " regulation . And in the past you could go directly to a hospital to see a doctor with a good reputation for something as simple as a cold ; now with the medical referral system , you ca n't get through the front door .  
( Xinshi , meaning " new poetry , " refers to all modern free verse in the vernacular . This form , pioneered in the 1920s and 1930s , is called " new " to distinguish it from the traditional Chinese poetic forms described above . ) Before the 1950s , xinshi was romantic and emotive . Just look back at works like Hsu Chih-mo 's " Coincidentally , " Liu Pan-nung 's " How Can I Not Miss Her , " or Luo Chia-lun 's " A Passage Through the Great Wall . "  
A food supply is the most basic of human needs , and farm produce is the last bastion of protectionism in the ROC ; it is also the segment most prone to sensitive price fluctuations . This situation is not unique to Taiwan , but is common throughout the world . Fortunately , except for agricultural produce , most household items , domestic appliances , cosmetics and so on were thrown open to free competition earlier , and so have already entered an era of more stable prices in line with those in advanced countries worldwide .  
Briton Dennis Casey , managing director of drugstore chain Watson 's The Chemist Taiwan , and a long-time resident in the Asia-Pacific region , observes that a few years ago prices in Taiwan were almost as high as in Japan . But with the fast opening of Taiwan 's markets and free competition , " the most efficient and modern international retailers are all setting up in Taiwan , bringing with them their international experience and vision , and seeking out low - price , high-quality products from all over the world to supply to local consumers . "  
" Although Air Macau has its strong points , we are also increasing our efforts , " comments TransAsia Airway 's public relations office . After passengers reach Macao , in addition to the conventional method of disembarking and boarding a second flight to mainland China , TransAsia also offers a free bus service which takes their customers straight to Guangdong 's Zhuhai City in little more than an hour . From Zhuhai 's newly completed Sanzao International Airport , one can then fly to all the major cities in mainland China .  
When Hsiu Ping-shan " retired " from politics , he drew inspiration from the recently popular " all-you-can-eat " restaurants to establish his own " all-you-can-write " center . The store is replete with brushes , ink , paper and ink stone , as well as exemplary calligraphy from all the great masters . Air conditioning and tea are provided , and a teacher even gives free instruction . Customers can arrive empty-handed and write to their hearts ' content .  
Wei recalls that he started reading the magazine in his freshman year at college , before people were free to speak as they pleased , yet the magazine was very bold about what it published . The historical documents were more stimulating and comprehensive than his formal history education at university .  
In 1994 , when the Council for Cultural Planning and Development first expanded its arts festival to include all of Taiwan , Paoankung ( listed as a temple ) put on the " Paosheng Culture Festival . " Apart from a neighborhood parade typical of a temple fair , fire jumping , and plays sponsored by people with the same surname , the temple also held a photography exhibit , a children 's painting competition , and free traditional Chinese medical consultations . The excitement went on for a whole month .  
To attract followers , such groups employ methods of " intensive instruction , therapy and guidance , an isolated environment , and worship of the religious leader , " which are akin to brainwashing techniques . These cause people to identify with the doctrine and ceremonies of the religion , so that believers fully believe themselves to be acting of their own free will . Yet outsiders find their behavior inexplicable . The end result is tragedy , with society paying enormous costs .  
Whether concerned about knowing love at least once , or about attaining everlasting love , the true meaning of " free love " is listening to your own genuine needs and making responsible choices . The same is also true of Sun Chung-hsing 's personal mission in the " cause " of love .  
Currently , the problem is that " there are no rules of the game . Just looking at circulation tricks to expand or maintain sales , apart from giving discounts , giving papers away for free is also common , " suggests mass communications scholar Hsu Chia-shih . There is no mutual trust in the newspaper industry , and there is no objective standard to determine " number of newspapers sold . " That is why they are so chilly toward the ABC .  
When you enter temples , the bodhi-sattvas , smiling and downward gazing , sit cross-legged in the " lotus position " on their lotus pedestals . Guanyin , the Buddhist Goddess of Mercy who relieves hardships and suffering , sprinkles sweet water onto the fire raging in the house of humanity while treading on lotuses . A booklet free for the taking in sidewalk arcades features on its cover a lotus blossom surrounded by drooping lotus leaves .  
" The Colon Free Trade Zone , the world 's longest running and most successful free trade zone , handled US $ 10 billion in transshipment trade in 1995 , a figure equivalent to Taiwan 's total yearly trade with Southeast Asia .  
One educational reformer has commented that , in this age of " free market education " where textbooks have become " intellectual commodities , " it is difficult to expect publishers not to concern themselves with business and other factors not related to education . But the bigger question is , are the rules of the new privatized education game fair ? Are they consistent ?  
Today the free political environment , developed economy and diversified society in Hong Kong and Taiwan have allowed the media to break free from the shackles of the traditional strict authoritarian order and nurture a free and independent press .  
Today journalists are part of the salaried middle class , well trained , with stable lives . The improved social position means that they no longer have to write to please authority to ensure their livelihood . They also do n't need to unrealistically regard all the troubles of the world as their responsibility . What is more important is doing their specialized job and allowing the free competition of the market to decide their success or failure .  
After returning from New York with his MFA degree and restarting the Kuang Huan Dance Circle , Liou drew upon his extensive practice of taijiquan , qigong and yoga , and made " qi , " " body " and " mind " the troupe 's new guiding principles-when free circulation of the qi ( breath or vital energy ) is achieved , a person becomes light and nimble , and develops a greater sensitivity toward nuances of space and time ; body refers the physical body , and mind to one 's thoughts , will and intentions .  
Liou has advertised the " baby oil series " as being free of complex or obscure meaning , taking it on frequent tours to rural areas in an effort to bridge the gap with audiences and make modern dance more accessible to the average person .  
A : For a long time now , our government has been plainly telling the Communist Chinese authorities that our final goal is a free , democratic , and prosperous reunified China . But before reunification , the ROC must continue to seek survival and development in international society . This is the basic right of survival of the people living in the Taiwan area . And this can create a model for the Chinese on both sides to pursue a better future way of life and system .  
The move toward open agricultural markets was agreed upon by the WTO member nations in the Uruguay round of GATT . With this international consensus and the global trend toward free trade in agriculture , Taiwan is finding it difficult to swim against the current by maintaining its protectionist agricultural policies .  
One way , reveals a veterinarian , is that many people whose pets become seriously ill just abandon them at the animal hospital , never returning to pick them up . There is no system in place in Taiwan to take in stray animals . Given operational constraints on a hospital , the only thing a vet can do is to set these unhealthy animals free in the wild . But this turns the problem from being an implicitly contractual one ( between owner and vet ) , or personal moral one , into one foisted on society .  
If employees feel this is not enough , they will be free to negotiate increased amounts with their employers , " says Anita Liu . For example , if the boss and workers each pay an additional 2% , then the workers will be doing a bit of " enforced saving " for their pensions . The most important reform envisaged under the new system is the change from a collective retirement fund account opened by the firm , to an individual account for each worker .  
From Laozi it borrows the concepts of non-action , clear understanding , and acting in harmony with nature . From Zhuangzi come the concepts of total freedom and life-for-the-fun-of-it . Combining these concepts , religious Daoism holds that in order to become an immortal , one must be free of joy and anger , eliminate desire , live in quietude and non-action , maintain primitive simplicity , and act in harmony with the natural laws of the universe .  
Research has revealed that human metabolic processes produce something known as a " free radical . " These free radicals cause a kind of oxidation which damages normal cells and weakens the body 's immune response . This can lead to illness , aging and even death . Free radicals have also been implicated as a possible cause of cancer .  
" This is something that both sexes want , " avers Wang Hao-wei , psychiatrist and author of the book Taiwan Men . Women , he notes , are experiencing rising self-consciousness , and want equal status and a fairer division of labor . Men , meanwhile , are hoping to escape rigid traditional roles and to have the chance to be more relaxed , more free to express their true selves . Men and women together have built up and share a common image of a new man .  
He recalls how in the 1960s , when Taiwan and mainland China were engaged in a propaganda battle on the airwaves , and listening to mainland broadcasts was forbidden in Taiwan , the government encouraged the establishment of private radio stations . The number of radio stations quickly grew to over 80 , and there was an enormous demand for programs . Father Bourret produced classical music programs , five-minute stories , and short radio dramas , all of which he made available to radio stations free of charge .  
" With this behavioral outlet , people do n't consider the more important question of improvement . " Yeh says that the stray dogs " set free " onto Taiwan 's streets are symptomatic of people 's ingrained reluctance to face up to the real suffering of living things .  
Once again , his team of several older women , wearing their usual uniforms of rubber sandals , face masks , and gloves , make their way into the tiny back alleys of the busy city . Today , they will clean house for an old veteran called " Old Yu . " No more free lunch Old Yu 's rented residence is dank and dark .  
While other painters created in their personal studios , she was usually at one hospital or another personally looking after her eldest son who was often on the edge of death . Wang would use her free moments to paint on hospital rags , towels , or cloth that she brought with her . Her paintings were nevertheless serene and joyful , like a rainbow reflecting off a cloud , and filled the room with the freshness of a spring breeze . You could say that she is Taiwan 's most legendary brush and ink artist .  
According to Hsinchu mayor Tsai Jen-chien , " There is little free space within the city limits , so we can only carry out rationalization and renewal on present scale . But the city enjoys many other assets due to its long history and culture . " From the Qing dynasty through to the Japanese colonial period , Hsinchu was one of northern Taiwan 's key political and economic centers , and this has left the city with a rich legacy of cultural assets .  
The narrowing of international space in turn sparked the rise of " nativist ideology " in Taiwan-nascent Taiwanese nationalism . Now that Taiwan is free , democratic , and prosperous , the old policy of refusing to coexist in the international community with mainland China has been abandoned , and the government hopes to create a " win-win " situation . But mainland China still has the mindset from the civil war half a century ago .  
But as Hsueh Cheng-tai points out , when you consider the daily routine of most foreign workers and how little free time it leaves them for breaking the law , and bear in mind that the crime rate among illegal foreign workers is far higher than for the legal ones , the problem does indeed merit attention . Especially given that in 1997 rape accounted for the largest share of serious crime committed by overseas workers , causing widespread anxiety among the public .  
How can people make a wise choice among the many value systems on offer ? How can they monitor their new leader to ensure that Taiwan has a peaceful future free of the influence of " black gold politics " ? These are not only questions for this election , but eternal challenges for the whole people in any democratic society .  
" Palliative care , " or " natural death , " as it is often referred to , means that in accordance with a patient 's expressed free will , medical staff will refrain from using cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) , artificial respirators , heart stimulants and other invasive medical technologies to prolong the dying process of patients with untreatable conditions .  
T'ienti at regular times provides free " cosmic qi healing . " Wearing their " struggle suits " - yellow shirts with blue pants-the envoys of T'ienti first chant the 20-character mantra before turning themselves into mediums that use the " Great Spirit of the Universe " to cleanse their patients ' bodies . From time to time they extend their arms to accept invisible golden pills into paper cups , which their patients wash down with water .  
After the job of damage appraisal was finished , the association established a " home repair task force . " A lot of families were living in basically safe structures that were nevertheless in need of repairs . The association lent its assistance free of charge to families lacking the resources to undertake such repairs on their own . They reinforced beams and posts , and repaired damaged walls , plumbing , and electrical wiring .  
The first is globalization , which has had a dual impact . For one thing it has led to a massive expansion of the international labor force , with developing countries that previously shunned capitalist competition now hurling themselves into it , adding over a billion workers from places like mainland China , India and Eastern Europe . At the same time we have the globalization of international trade , with capital and technology increasingly free to circulate rapidly around the world .  
Sadly , development is causing the diversity of Taiwan 's wetlands to decline rapidly . Since the banks of the small lake in the Tatun Nature Park in Yangmingshan National Park , formerly overgrown with lush aquatic plants , were tidied up , and visitors released turtles and koi carp there , in a short time the number of dragonfly species in the area has fallen from over 20 to only five or six . Taiwan 's beautiful mountain lakes have also become places where religious believers set animals " free . " Island ecologies are fragile .  
" During this period his running script was no longer as lean as it had been , " says Ho Chuan-hsing . " It began slanting rightwards and spreading out a little . Overall , his characters became more free and unconstrained , with swooping spaces where the brush was running dry of ink . He had well and truly shaken off the earlier fixation with exquisite perfection . "  
Much to his surprise , someone showed up in the middle of the night with bolt cutters and set him free . Fully awake to the treacherous intentions of his relatives , Wang decided to head for southern China and make a life there together with Yueh-ching , the sweet and innocent daughter of a tenant farmer . The two married , and warfare continued .  
When the KMT was voted out of the presidency last year after a half century in power , many worried that the Republic of China had come to an end , but our national identity is only clearer now that the Taiwan-oriented DPP has come to power . The ROC comprises the territory of Taiwan , Penghu , Kinmen , and Matsu . Only a ruling party free of historical baggage can take the bold surgical steps needed to rid the country of long-festering tumors .  
" Let me take you soaring over a stretch of green fields / Piercing a tunnel of greenery bathed in the setting sun / Let the cool breeze and the fragrance of oranges run through your fingers / Cast off your worries and let your mind go free . The great peak beckons to me with a gesture / The secondary peak nods in my direction / The mountain coffee sends your troubles packing / The winding highland roads call : Hurry up and get started ! "  
Over the last few years , Li Hsien-wen 's life has changed quite a lot . He not only eats vegetarian , but he has also moved to the countryside and abandoned burdensome clothing such as suit and tie . At the same time , he has influenced his wife , who began practicing calligraphy three years ago . When she is free she copies a bit of traditional poetry , and able to settle in at her house , she no longer feels lonely .  
Although the government has now decided to move in the direction of liberalization , the numerous " technical issues " that remain continue to make difficult any easing of the current political impasse . Proposals to allow " three links , " to permit Taiwanese firms to invest in semiconductor or upstream petrochemicals production in China , to allow Chinese capital and workers into Taiwan , and even to establish a free port that would make it easier to bring semi-finished goods from China to Taiwan for processing , still remain just that : proposals .  
This July , planning will be completed for the first free port in Taiwan , which should increase the efficiency of the movement of goods significantly . This will be helpful to Taiwan 's becoming a regional operations center for both local businesses and multinational companies .  
If it is easy to find a free e-paper that is similar , or if the readers do n't really need the content , it is difficult to achieve the level of appeal required to collect fees , " says Hsu . But it can be done . Currently , e-papers at PChome that do the best with subscriber fees are for language learning and industrial reports . The publication with the most subscribers is iThome , a computer report , with about 10,000 .  
From the moment they say " I do , " they should be ready in their hearts and willing to take the bad along with the good . Why is it , then , that today 's couples , free to choose their partners , find it so difficult to honor their vows ? Some find it impossible to deal with hardship , and others , even after struggling to make it through a difficult stretch , are somehow unable to enjoy the sweet yields of their struggle .  
" People in society do not understand the costs of divorce , " says Chen . Reading about scandals and breakups among celebrities every day in the media , many people get the erroneous impression that divorce is something fashionable , even an essential part of an interesting and colorful life . They imagine that after divorce a man will be surrounded by beautiful women , while a divorced wife will be free to travel to some romantic location , and both will enjoy a new lease on life .  
That very night he departed from the world without a warning or farewell . His passage was free and easy , but those whom he left behind were reluctant to let go . Liu 's biographer Yang Meng-yu once asked Liu whether he worried about not being able to wrap up loose ends should something befall him during one of his romps through some remote corner of the world .  
And an LNG procurement worth several hundred billion New Taiwan dollars is an affair which can be carried out only through a public bidding process in conformance with the WTO spirit of free competition , not one which can be decided by anyone 's personal say-so . Such issues must , as ever , be handled in accordance with legal procedure together with consideration of the national interest .  
But commercial considerations aside , as mainland media professionals are hoping , media from outside the mainland should not just play the role of furthering business . A more exciting question and one worth waiting for and answer is : Can the media culture fostered in the free environments of Hong Kong and Taiwan capable of stimulating mainland China in a positive way ?  
" Parents should set their kids free , and not just so as to lighten the burdens on their kids , " Lu says . " In the past , while putting all their expectations on their kids , parents stifled their own potential for growth . " He discovered that many seniors felt bitter upon entering old age and discovering that they could not live close to their children . It affected their mental outlook for the entire latter period of their lives .  
Thanks to the experience accumulated by the ICDF and other aid groups , NGOs providing medical aid need no longer be limited to satisfying the ambition of some romantically minded individuals to do good deeds . For example , the cleft lip and cleft palate surgery program of the Noordhoff Craniofacial Foundation ( NCF ) in Vietnam , Cambodia , the Philippines , and elsewhere includes free consultations , technical instruction , equipment donation , post-surgery speech therapy , and so on , so that medical resources are applied in a systematic manner .  
Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon 's exquisite imagery and dramatic plot , and its rhythm which alternates between moments of understatement and boisterousness , have helped to inject new life into an ailing genre . However , Crouching Tiger 's success in breaking free of the previous martial arts mold must be viewed in light of its hybrid origins .  
Taiwan , on the other hand , has strict laws restricting flying and has yet to issue hot-air balloon licenses , not to mention licenses for nine-seater aircraft , the most common type of recreational plane . If any engineers addicted to flying do make it to Taiwan , where can they give their passion free rein ?  
Early this March , Tzu Chi branches from Singapore , Malaysia , Indonesia , and Taiwan joined together for Tzu Chi 's fourth free clinic on the Indonesian island of Batam . On each occasion so far , the number of local volunteers has grown , and patients and their families who have been helped in previous years have come forward on their own to lend a hand . At the clinic site , you can hear Mandarin Chinese , English , Indonesian , Malaysian , and Hokkien rising and falling .  
Wang Dan 's identity gives his creative writing a free pass to the public , and even more to the mainstream media . But at the same time this also is a problem for him . It makes it unnecessary for him to pursue perfection in his literary life , and his obscure and emotional essay style readily reveals a literary technique that is not yet mature , and indeed a character that is equally childlike .  
Apart from the medicinal herb exhibition and the free clinics ( Paosheng is , after all , the god of medicine ) , there was also a photo exhibition ( " The Beauty of Paoan Temple " ) by master photographer Ko Hsi-chieh , as well as seminars on religious ceremonies , a guided tour to the art of altars , and folk arts and crafts workshops designed for the 3-day chingcheng jiao that began on June 13th . These varied activities were aimed at giving people deeper understanding into the inner meaning of religious culture .  
Yet , while his improvements on traditional designs were meeting with great approval , they were n't satisfying his creative desires . From an early age he had been a great lover of painting and very familiar with historical folktales , so he decided to leave the ranks of craftsmen , breaking free from the shackles of tradition , and to adopt innovative styles using Western realism to create new works that more richly displayed a purely artistic creativity .  
To most people , railroad warehouses are nothing but dark and dilapidated buildings , but to artists such spaces exert a primordial attraction not found in conventional art galleries . These surreal art sanctuaries give free rein to the imagination , enable the artistic vanguard to enter the mainstream , and function as alternative spaces for the experimental showcasing of new designs prior to commercial exhibition .  
" Before I was 50 , I dedicated myself to public service , but today I am living for myself , " says Yeh Chin-chuan . No longer burdened with public office , Yeh is manifestly free and unrestrained . He has fulfilled a number of dreams he has had for many years , including climbing a mountain in Kyrgyzstan , competing in the Ironman Triathlon , swimming across Sun Moon Lake , and taking part in the Taroko marathon .  
Under the old system of economic planning , the distribution of published works in the mainland was all handled through a single state-owned channel ( known as the " first channel " ) - every region in the country had a Xinhua bookstore and supply unit . These Xinhua stores held sole control of delivery and distribution , a system entirely inappropriate for a free market .  
In the first place , they maintain , people are driven by their own individual interests and are frequently unable to take the broad view in considering public affairs . This " me first " attitude exacerbates conflicts of interest . Secondly , to avoid referendum issues being controlled by special-interest groups , laws must be passed to regulate public announcements , provide for the balanced presentation of information and guarantee the free flow of information .  
Thinking back on his childhood , Yeh says that his father often used the free time outside the busy farming season to recite Chinese historical serial novels to his neighbors . Yeh was deeply influenced by his father and loved reading . Under the supervision of NTNU professor Tang Tsu-chung , he read a lot of biographical literature . For this reason Yeh learned that modern Chinese history is made up of heroic figures whose successful deeds were all made possible by " idealism , hope , and determination . "  
He gives half the income from the restaurant to charity , and once a month he hosts a free dinner for a guest list that includes volunteer teachers and lonely elderly people with no families . He also works to promote environmental , conservation , and animal-rights values in the PRC , so that the vegetarian outlook on life can set down deeper roots , and not just be limited to eating habits or health .  
In a survey of the dreams of youth taken by Sinorama in December among 19 to 30-year-olds , nearly half ( 46.7% ) included " live as I please , free and unrestrained " as one of their life dreams , far beyond the second most popular choice of " a happy family life " ( 29.8% ) and the third of " a stable job " ( 26.6% ) .  
Cheng points out that although such ideas have a contagious element about them , people who are mentally healthy or who have a strong " psychological immunity " will not easily be " infected " by suicide reports . But people who are themselves suffering from severe depression or who have suffered a serious setback in life , are more likely to be contaminated by an unhealthy suicidal frame of mind and to be unable to free themselves from it .  
Although this winter Mingcheng 's Murcott production was not very high , the quality was excellent . Thanks to a high 13-degree sugar / acid ratio ( sugar content / free acid content ) and free media publicity thrown in by the home distribution company , the day after the ads appeared the borough head , Chang Jui-tuan , who was responsible for taking phone orders , spent the whole day on the phone .  
But in fifth grade , his teacher discovered that this " problem student " could draw powerful and intriguing pictures . The teacher signed Lee up for a province-wide primary-school drawing competition in which , incredibly , he won a prize . This prize seemed to set free the previously locked-up spirit of this small Aboriginal child .  
The groups he leads typically have " free time " scheduled for half a day or a full day so as to allow his charges to deeply experience and probe nature . " The special quality of ecotourism lies in its leisureliness , " stresses Chen Chang-po . When the travel itinerary is too tight , it fosters anxiety among the tourists and tour operators . Only when the mood is relaxed can one discard the pressures and cares of work and everyday life and allow one 's heart and mind to converse with and reconnect to nature .  
These schools provide a support base for the museum , helping to recover personnel and other costs . The museum provides the ideological foundation for the classes , the education being based on the ideas espoused by the gallery and put into practice in the classes . Lin has been running these two organizations for years now in her effort to try and free people 's artistry from the shackles it has been placed in , and to let children be able to sample the emotional qualities inherent in real art .  
When the company took control of the Bears this year , it immediately adopted Kaohsiung 's Cheng-Ching Lake Baseball Stadium and took a more professional tack in managing the team , improving the diet , clothing , living arrangements and transportation it provided to the players . Such sweeping actions not only made a strong impression on the players themselves , but garnered media attention . " They received free promotion of their corporate image , " observes Central Broadcasting System 's Fan Chung-kuang , who has covered professional baseball for eight years .  
Hu herself admits to having a very active disposition , and she ca n't stand being idle . Her free time at home was limited , and during the downtime after the housework was finished she was always a bit edgy and thinking about how she could further her learning , so she took on the volunteer work at the library . Later she joined up with a study group run by the Mandarin Daily News , and finally , ten years ago , she moved on to the volunteer service at NTUH .  
Once the ink has been formed into lengths that are free of cracks and joints , those lengths must be pressed and shaped in a mold . Wooden molds play a crucial role in producing aesthetically pleasing ink sticks . The best are made from pomegranate , a fine-grained , sturdy wood that can be carved with delicate , vivid patterns without splitting . Not only do the patterns wear well , but the wood itself also holds up well to the repeated forceful tapping needed to break the molds open .  
It may have been because she was overwhelmed by the beautiful scenery , but Fu Chieh left her knapsack on a mountain top . She only noticed that she 'd lost it when we planned to go the free market . We rushed back to the mountain to look for the knapsack , and came across a good-hearted person who had found it and who returned it to Fu Chieh .

Reaffirming that development is a comprehensive economic , social , cultural and political progress , which aims at the constant improvement of the well-being of the entire population and of all individuals on the basis of their active , free and meaningful participation in development and in the fair distribution of benefits resulting therefrom ,  
At the beginning of the 1990s , the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung took the landmark initiative of demolishing the concrete walls built up on the south side of the military demarcation line , allowing free travel between the north and the south , and holding north-south high-level talks and the north-south summit talks to remove the root cause of the war and accelerate the process of peaceful reunification on the Korean peninsula in the next few years .  
The individual elements of a culture of peace are therefore : non-violence and respect for human rights , respect and solidarity among all peoples and dialogue between cultures , the linkage of peace to democratic participation and sustainable human development , the free flow and sharing of information and knowledge , contribution to conflict-prevention and post-conflict peace-building , and equality between women and men , all best supported through projects in which people take an active role in transforming their values , attitudes and behaviours .  
After peaceful relations and reconciliation are established among all States in the region , Israel will endeavour to establish in the Middle East _ through direct negotiations among all its members _ a zone free of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons , as well as ballistic missiles , based on mutual and effective verification .  
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaimed that all human beings were born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone was entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in the Declaration without distinction of any kind such as race , colour or national origin , yet violations continued daily .  
One level involves selective bilateral / trilateral free trade and integration agreements between interested countries outside the framework of existing subregional / regional integration groupings , mirroring the economic growth zone phenomenon in South-East Asia .  
Equal attention was being paid to the renaissance and free development of the Ukrainian nation and to the promotion and protection of the spiritual and cultural heritage of other ethnic , linguistic and religious groups living in Ukraine .  
The safeguarding of peace and the promotion of closer and sustained cooperation among Mediterranean countries should enable the enjoyment of complete sovereignty by all the peoples of the region , free and protected by established and accepted territorial borders and adhering to a mutual policy of non-interference and non-intervention in the internal affairs of each other .  
The Security Council reiterates the importance of a political settlement and national reconciliation and calls upon the parties to cooperate with the International Mediation Committee chaired by the President of Gabon and with the Joint United Nations / Organization of African Unity Special Envoy in reaching rapid agreement on peaceful transitional arrangements leading to the holding of democratic and free and fair elections with the participation of all parties .  
The Assembly welcomed the proposed measures outlined by the Government of Cambodia in its comments5 on the report of the Special Representative , to ensure that the forthcoming communal and national elections were free and fair , that members of the armed forces remained neutral during the election campaign , that the individual vote was confidential and that local and international observers were welcomed .  
If , by a democratic regime , we mean one in which human rights are respected , power is vested in the Government by the people through free elections , there is a separation of powers , the law is enforced by the authorities , there is equality under the law , the armed forces and police are at the service of everyone , the courts perform their functions independently , political parties express themselves freely , and there is freedom of the press , then this report shows that none of these conditions are being met .  
Education was free at all levels and compulsory at the primary level , health care was provided free to all sectors of the population without exception , special attention being paid to vulnerable groups , and young people played an important part in the development and execution of development plans . 
A world free of foreign colonization and occupation , in which relations between States were based on mutual understanding and equality , would be more peaceful , secure and stable . 
Moreover , the Register must be expanded to include nuclear weapons and sophisticated technology with military applications if it is to become a more balanced instrument , free of all discriminatory criteria , and to have a more global scope and the highest possible number of participants .  
The integrated global system that has been established for the monitoring and warning of hydrometeorlogical hazards through the coordinated activities of national services is dependent on the free and unrestricted exchange of data and the communication of information .  
The Rio Group stands convinced that these treaties will not only strengthen the international non-proliferation regime but will also promote the establishment of other nuclear-weapon-free zones in other parts of the world , which will lead to the gradual expansion of nuclear-weapon-free zones until the ultimate objective of all the States Members of the Organization has been attained a world that is entirely free of nuclear weapons . 
We have noted that the countries involved in the Ottawa process have , of their own free will , arrived at a Convention on the total ban of anti-personnel landmines , and we would like to express our respect for their choice , and our understanding for the humanitarian concern they have demonstrated . 
A number of speakers pointed to the continuing importance of a new world information and communication order , based on a free and balanced flow of information , in a world where disparities in technological advances were widespread and the gap between the developed and developing countries was ever-widening .  
One delegation , also speaking on behalf of a large group , advanced some specific suggestions to the Task Force , among which was that the free flow of accurate and up-to-date information , taking into account the linguistic diversity of the Organization , must remain the primary function of the Department and that the dissemination of relevant information about the United Nations and its programmes should continue to be a core activity of the Department , particularly in developing countries .

Acknowledging that United Nations electoral assistance has facilitated the holding of successful elections in several Member States which resulted in the orderly and non-violent assumption of office by elected officials , recognizing that elections can be free and fair only if held free of coercion and intimidation , and underlining the importance of respect for the results of elections that have been verified as free and fair ,  
It was suggested that further examination may be required of the principle of special and differential treatment for developing countries in the light of the evolving changes relating inter alia to trade preferences , emergence of regional free trade areas between developed and developing countries based on reciprocity , and the interrelationships between these free trade areas and future multilateral trade liberalization .  
The aim of mine-action programmes , therefore , is not only technical - to survey , mark and eradicate mines - but also humanitarian and developmental - to create an environment in which people can live more safely and in which economic and social development can occur free from the constraints imposed by landmine contamination . 
Taking note of the statement by the President of the Security Council of 30 July 1997 [ 4 ] in which the Council , inter alia , welcomed the successful holding of presidential and legislative elections in Liberia on 19 July 1997 , and noted with satisfaction the declaration in the joint certification statement by the Secretary-General and the Chairman of the Economic Community of West African States that the electoral process had been free , fair and credible and that the outcome of the elections reflected the will of the Liberian people ,  
In this context , the Special Rapporteur recalls the need for accurate , balanced and impartial coverage of current affairs including , inter alia , by allocating air time to parties and candidates on a fair and non-discriminatory basis during the period preceding elections , referenda or other important political events when it is essential that voters and candidates alike engage in a free and open discussion of views on pertinent issues . 
Those engaged in such activities make free use of fake end-user certificates , exploit loopholes in the law , evade customs and other airport controls by making clandestine night take-offs and landings , file false flight plans and conceal their movements by using fabricated zone permits , evading radar tracking and observing radio silence in flight .  
Concerned by the climate in which the electoral process has taken place , the European Union expresses its firm hope that the Haitian people will be able as soon as possible to express its will in free , honest and transparent elections , held in accordance with rules and procedures accepted by all , in which citizens have the widest possible range of options and choices .  
We have been enthusiastic supporters of all initiatives aimed at limiting the arms trade , in addition to being aware that there are free markets often beyond Government control , we are concerned that the industrialized countries , by lifting embargoes in this field , may begin moving towards the opposite extreme and promote the sale of weapons everywhere , under pressure from the military industry , which has an extremely powerful lobby . 
After nearly eight years of fratricidal civil war and the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) Monitoring Group ( ECOMOG ) intervention in Liberia , countries of the subregion , with only the limited assistance of the international community , finally succeeded in supervising the conduct of presidential and legislative elections in the country in July 1997 , under conditions generally acknowledged to be free and fair .  
This encouraging trend has been achieved through the adoption and pursuit by Governments of policies and measures aimed at ensuring , among others , macroeconomic stability , inflows of foreign direct investment , open and free markets and stable and transparent legal and regulatory frameworks .  
Malta fully supports the efforts of the Organization in the promotion of environmental protection and the sustainable use of the world \ x { e5b8 } natural resources to ensure a more equitable distribution of wealth , and of an international trade regime free of restrictive or discriminatory practices .  
Such rampant speculation or manipulation of hedge funds in the currency and equity markets of developing countries , at a time when they are still feeling their way in a world of fierce global competition , would trigger off a defensive reflex on the part of the affected countries , thereby arousing anti-liberalization , which would be detrimental to free trade .  
After the establishment , as we hope , of peace treaties between Israel and every country of the region , it will be possible to create a regional security system that would provide multilateral and shared solutions to the range of security problems in the Middle East , including a mutually and effectively verifiable Middle East free of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles .  
All the endeavours to establish a new , just and equitable economic world order , free of humiliating conditions and restrictive and onerous practices , are brutally challenged by a powerful minority that reserves the worst and cruellest of the infernos for the rest of the planet . 
In order to put an end to this distressing situation , Africa 's development partners should envisage a comprehensive and integrated mechanism for flexible , operational and effective financing , free of bureaucratic impediments and red tape , with the aim of establishing a centralized funding entity to receive resources from all sources to be devoted to economic and social development .  
However , we know that we can rely on international cooperation , founded not only on solidarity , but on mutual interest and partnership , to overcome the difficulties confronting us , to support our efforts at economic and social recovery , to build a State genuinely based on the rule of law and to construct a free , democratic , modern and prosperous nation .  
In the context of these changes , and more than half a century after the United Nations was established , there is an urgent need for the Organization to undergo drastic reforms , both structural and functional , so as to establish rules and principles for a new international order free of double standards .  
Now we are practically the only country of the Commonwealth of Independent States that had a stable economic growth of about 16 per cent during the first half of this year ; we have arrested the decrease in volumes of industrial production and we are a country free from religious , ethnic or civil strife . 
In the sphere of collective security and the maintenance of world peace , although major catastrophes have been averted , the United Nations has not succeeded in making real the dream of every human being to live in peace in a world free from the pestilence of war and all the attendant horrors of human carnage and the senseless destruction of everything we hold dear .  
A credible and independent human rights commission , along with a genuinely independent national electoral commission , could make an important contribution to protecting stability and promoting the observance of human rights in Cambodia in the lead-up to what we strongly hope will be free , fair and credible elections in May next year .

Nonetheless , it must be explicitly stated that , in Grenada 's view , the Uruguay Round Agreements have created for small developing States significantly more burdens than the benefits they are proclaimed to bring under the banner of global free trade at least now , and for the foreseeable future , unless corrective measures are soon instituted .  
There is strong dissatisfaction in the international community about the fact that while we have a fully functional Tribunal in The Hague , the military and political leaders responsible for the grave violations of humanitarian law and the acts of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Herzegovina remain free .  
Even with the passing years , we can not forget how the international community erred in addressing this crisis by involuntarily encouraging those who , over the course of time , felt increasingly comfortable in giving free rein to their ethnocentric and inhumane aspirations , coldly established as systematic theory .  
That outcome was averted thanks to initiatives taken and to the resolve of the Governments of Central America and friendly countries , which took the proper steps to find a negotiated political solution that responded to the aspirations of the Central American peoples , and in particular to the sovereign right of States to live in peace and freely to determine their own future free from any foreign interference in matters that are essentially within their internal jurisdiction . 
Subsequent developments have continued to be positive , and in 1997 we are witnessing for the first time in many years a Central America free of armed conflict , with legitimate Governments chosen through the free expression of popular will in transparent and pluralistic elections , thus strengthening democratic institutions and , as result , the rule of law . 
Central America has made great progress in demilitarization and in the strengthening of civil society , holding free , transparent and pluralist elections ; integrating former combatants into national political processes ; strengthening democratic institutions and the rule of law ; and implementing a development programme whose central focus is the human being .  
This could well be the real meaning of democracy : constant improvement in living conditions and moving from one level to another through successive Governments with the free vote of the people being the final judge of what is to be done .  
General and complete disarmament is now a universal need , and it should be perceived in its original terms , namely , that there is not nor can there be any alternative to the achievement of true nuclear disarmament , which alone can free mankind from apocalypse , ensure security for all and channel nuclear energy to economic and social development by using it exclusively for peaceful means .  
The intimate relationship between disarmament and non-proliferation commitments , on the one hand , and free trade and cooperation for peaceful purposes , on the other , is reflected in this article , and it is thus essential that the careful balance be preserved as the Convention is implemented .  
The denial of basic human rights , the confiscation of one 's rightful property and ancestral home , the denial of free movement , the obstruction of necessary economic activity , the importation of thousands of foreigners to be settled in confiscated land in occupied territory , the systematic and deliberate splitting of the West Bank through streams of bypass highways and indiscriminately placed settlements all these , in our view , amount to a clear record of violence against the Palestinians by the Israeli authorities .  
It also refers to the arbitrary and coercive measures undertaken against the Arab population , such as administrative detention , collective punishment , the demolition of homes , curfews , the forcible transfer of Bedouin population , closures , impeding the free movement of people and , in particular , the restriction that prevents them from travelling through Jerusalem between the north and south of the country .  
The coalition 's basic aims are : general amnesty for political prisoners ; total respect for the laws in force ; fulfilment by the Government of its international human rights commitments ; adoption by the Government of the measures required to establish a system of free employment and free enterprise ; and free and direct elections .  
The first was the signing at Cairo of the African Nuclear _ Weapon _ Free Zone Treaty as a testimony to the developing countries ' commitment to the cause of nuclear disarmament worldwide and also as a positive and encouraging step which should be followed soon by the negotiation of the establishment of another zone in the Middle East in conformity with the relevant United Nations General Assembly resolutions and as a step towards the implementation of President Mubarak 's proposal concerning the establishment of a zone free from all weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East .  
The Committee urged the Government of the Philippines to adopt a top-priority policy of creating safe and protected jobs for women as a viable economic alternative to the current unemployment of women and their participation as subcontractors and in the informal sector , as workers in free trade zones or as in commercial sex , or as migrant overseas contract workers .

Article 187 further stipulates that : Anyone who has sexual intercourse with a woman without using force , threats or deception but knowing her to be insane , feeble _ minded , under 15 years of age , incapable of exercising her own free will for any reason , or knowing her to be unaware of the nature or unlawfulness of the act to which she is being subjected , shall be liable to a penalty of life imprisonment .  
Many of us believe that a multilateral , effectively verifiable treaty to prohibit the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices will constitute a prerequisite step in the way towards a nuclear _ weapon _ free world .  
Its President 's statement to the Special Rapporteur , the documentation he turned over and his account of the company 's background in the countries where it has concluded specialized service contracts offer an alternate way of looking at things in which military sciences are likely to be taken out of the State context and to move into the private sector where they offer skilled professional services in a free and global market .  
Regarding data processing and archiving , the Subcommittee noted that to fully exploit the potential of already acquired and future research data , more international cooperation was needed for their proper archiving , to ensure global free access to databases , to develop mechanisms for improving access to meta-data , and to agree on formats and software packages for data conversion that were necessary for scientific research .

The Convention on the Rights of the Child being a point of departure to guarantee child rights ; taking into consideration the progressive character of the implementation of certain social , economic and cultural rights as recognized in article 4 of the Convention , the Government of the Kingdom of Swaziland would undertake the implementation of the right to free primary education to the maximum extent of available resources and expects to obtain the cooperation of the international community for its full satisfaction as soon as possible .  
FITDH urges the working group on a draft optional protocol to fix the minimum age for recruitment into armed forces at 18 in respect of compulsory service as well as voluntary enlistment , since in many cases a minor 's decision to enlist in the armed forces is anything but free , being dictated by various circumstances , such as poverty , coercion , insecurity , a broken home or lack of alternatives , and parental consent is not enough of a guarantee .  
Taking note of the presidential statement of 30 July 1997 [ 1 ] in which the Security Council , inter alia , welcomed the successful holding of presidential and legislative elections in Liberia on 19 July 1997 , noted with satisfaction the declaration in the Joint Certification Statement by the Secretary-General and the Chairman of the Economic Community of West African States that the electoral process had been free , fair and credible and that the outcome of the elections reflected the will of the Liberian people ,

This military putsch , contrary to the basic principles of democracy , is a grave assault against the dignity and free choice of a people who rightly aspire to build a state based on the rule of law after having undergone so many years of instability and civil war .

With regard to the right to education ( arts . 28 and 29 ) , while noting that the principle of free , universal and compulsory basic education for all children is recognized by the State party , the Committee is concerned that this fundamental right is not yet fully and equally implemented throughout the country .

The occupation of East Timor , systematically condemned by the relevant bodies of the United Nations , makes abusive and illegitimate any and all attempts to appropriate the genuine collective will of the Timorense People that does not pass through a free process of self-determination , approved by the relevant mechanisms and organs of the United Nations . The Secretary-General has been following with concern reports of recent violent incidents in East Timor which have resulted in loss of life and are causing considerable human suffering .  
Requests the administering Powers to transmit to the Secretary-General information called for under Article 73 e of the Charter of the General Assembly and other updated information and reports , including reports on the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories regarding their future political status as expressed in fair and free referendums and other forms of popular consultation , as well as the results of any informed and democratic processes consistent with practice under the Charter which indicate the clear and freely expressed wish of the people to change the existing status of the Territories ;

The preamble common to the two International Covenants on Human Rights recognizes that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his civil and political rights .

The Seminar pointed out the fundamental contradiction between the increasing restrictions to individual mobility and the free flow of goods and services as encouraged by transnational corporations and international financial institutions .  
I will not recall here the scale of the guarantees already afforded by my country , whether they be positive or negative , in the latter case through the relevant protocols to treaties establishing nuclear _ weapon _ free zones which have all been ratified by France , which therefore cover more than 100 countries , but as far as the Conference on Disarmament is concerned , the question was more simply whether an ad hoc committee on security assurances with a mandate drawn up in 1992 was still the order of the day .  
The next ministerial meeting of WTO , to be held in Singapore by the end of the year , should assess the implementation of the Uruguay Round agreements , focusing on the difficulties of the developing countries , especially the least developed and net food-importing countries , so as to ensure that all countries benefited from free trade and to sweep away any remaining protectionist or discriminatory notions .  
In that connection , his delegation was deeply concerned that , using the pretext of freedom , democracy or the environment , laws were being promulgated and unilateral restrictions were being imposed which undermined free trade and violated international law and the trading practices negotiated at the multilateral level . 
That was of particular importance in the preparatory process for the World Food Summit , which would deal with the fundamental right of every human being to be free from hunger and malnutrition , international cooperation for the elimination of unilateral economic and trade measures , eradication of poverty , and international mobilization and channelling of technical , technological and financial resources so as to improve access to food for all .

The Government of Mexico , in full respect for the sovereignty of States and the right of self-determination of peoples , and the norms and principles which govern peaceful and friendly relations and cooperation among nations , believes that it is for the people of Cuba alone , in exercise of their inalienable rights , to continue to determine their own political , economic and social organization in a free , sovereign and independent manner .

In view of the upcoming tourist season , tourism being the major economic staple in the area , it is essential to allow free movement of civilians throughout the entire territory on both sides of the international border and over the border crossing points , and thus take another important step towards full normalization of relations . 
The specialized agencies should seek innovative ways of communicating ideas that reinforced democratic processes and spurred development initiatives ; utilizing communication networks , particularly radio and electronic networks , to increase public access to information and facilitate free and fair participation in decision-making processes ; and enhancing participation by people at the grass roots level , who were the hardest hit by poverty .  
More recently , MERCOSUR has adopted a protocol on competition policy proscribing individual conduct or concerted agreements impeding , restricting or distorting competition or free access to markets or abusing a dominant position in a relevant regional market within MERCOSUR and affecting trade between its member States .

To recognize the right to education on the basis of equal opportunities by making primary education compulsory and ensuring that all children have access to free and relevant primary education , as well as making secondary education generally available and accessible to all , and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education ;  
Considering that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out therein , without distinction of any kind , in particular as to race , colour or national origin ,  
Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food , consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger so as to be able fully to develop and maintain their physical and mental capacities ;

The proposed Convention would be built on the following main pillars : the creation of free trade zones , building on existing regional groups to facilitate the liberalization process , and the granting of special and differential treatment for the least developed ACP countries to facilitate their integration into the multilateral trading system , reinforce their institutional capacity and create a favourable policy framework to attract foreign investment and develop a dynamic private sector .  
The readiness demonstrated by the Arab States to take practical steps towards the establishment of an effectively verifiable Middle East zone free from all weapons of mass destruction - nuclear , chemical and biological - and to refrain from taking any measures that preclude the achievement of this objective in accordance with paragraph 5 of the 1995 resolution on the Middle East as well as paragraph 14 of Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) should not go unnoticed .  
The supplementary agreements stipulate that 8 August 1999 will be the date for the ballot to take place , both inside and outside East Timor , and that a secure environment devoid of violence or other forms of intimidation is a prerequisite for the holding of a free and fair popular consultation .  
The Security Council must endorse the proposals which , among other things , would pave the way for a verifiable end to violence and ethnic cleansing in Kosovo , the withdrawal of Yugoslav military , police and paramilitary forces , the establishment of an interim administration in the province , the safe and free return of refugees and a political settlement providing self-government for Kosovo .  
This would seem to suggest that Governments may follow one of two paths to development , the first encompassing a vision of a free trade economy with heavy reliance on foreign investment and foreign technology , and the other centring on a vision of a deep and diverse industrial sector with predominantly nationally owned enterprises capable of autonomous innovation .  
Following these informal consultations , the President made a statement to the media , on behalf of the members of the Council , expressing their concern at renewed fighting and their support for ECOWAS and other international efforts to bring peace ; calling upon all parties to halt military operations and allow the free flow of humanitarian assistance ; and urging all parties to renew their commitments to the Abuja peace process and to respect the ceasefire of 3 February .

Two supplementary agreements were also signed , on the modalities for the popular consultation and on security arrangements , by which the parties agreed that a secure environment , devoid of violence or other forms of intimidation , is a prerequisite for the holding of a free and fair popular consultation and that the appropriate Indonesian authorities have the responsibility to ensure such an environment and to maintain law and order in the Territory .  
This , I presume , will require a balanced approach , susceptible to reconciling enlightened pragmatism with the ideals that have inspired the creation of this forum _ first and foremost , the achievement of a nuclear _ weapon _ free world in the not _ so _ distant future .  
This includes the right to maintain , protect and develop the past , present and future manifestations of their cultures , such as archaeological and historical sites , artifacts , designs , ceremonies , technologies and visual and performing arts and literature , as well as the right to the restitution of cultural , intellectual , religious and spiritual property taken without their free and informed consent or in violation of their laws , traditions and customs .  
Proceeding from these ideas , it is assumed that a democratic society requires the existence and free exercise of certain basic individual and group rights and freedoms , which the Universal Declaration and the International Covenants - not to mention at this juncture other international , regional and national human rights instruments , norms and standards - define and thereby indicate their limits .  
On the one hand , they are expected to hurt the economy because of the shortfall in revenue and the loss of jobs , while on the other , a more expedient handover of deteriorating facilities on lands held by the military would expedite land development projects , including a proposed free trade zone and the construction of affordable housing .  17 .

However , to legitimize beyond any doubt the ways and means used to take issues that originally belonged to the realm of international law away from it and to justify making them subject solely to domestic legislation unilaterally passed by the States and adjudicated by domestic non-indigenous courts , States should produce unassailable proof that the indigenous peoples in question have expressly and of their own free will renounced their sovereign attributes .  
During short-term microgravity experiments on board aeroplanes , research will be conducted on the correlation between the electrophoretic direct current field and the variable gravity field with electrophoretic instruments for continuous free current stream in space and equipment for life science experiments on manned space missions will be developed and relevant scientific research initiated .  
The main features of globalization have been an increasing reliance on a deregulated global market , maximally free trade , uncontrolled flow of investment , and the paramount role of the international financial market , with the IMF and the World Bank moving to the centre stage of world power .  
A broad set of actions is also being developed to ensure universal access to an increasingly broad range of integrated and high-quality reproductive health services , which are offered with full respect for the dignity of individuals and couples and the right to free choice .

The Special Rapporteur stressed that in order for a legal act to be valid under international law , it must be attributable to a State , the representative of that State must have the capacity to engage it at the international level , the act must be the expression of its will and free of irregularities and it must be formulated in the proper manner .

In accordance with the objective of health for all , the State spent tremendous sums of money on the health sector with a view to providing a health service for every male and female citizen , without distinction , and developing health services , medicines and free treatment in line with the latest international scientific developments and in quantities and qualities proportionate to the needs of all citizens .  
Proceeding from the concern of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to raise the standard of physical , psychological and social health of mothers and children , several maternal and child care centres were established , offering women free premarital and antenatal care , which continues until after delivery in view of the close link between a child 's health and that of its mother .

They had also given themselves a goal of full cost recovery within five years , and the objective was being realized by providing their target group of firms at the initial stage of operation with a free diagnostic service ( based on the diagnostic tools developed by CODETI , among others ) ; thereafter , a fee based on the outcome of the diagnostic exercise and the projected savings to be made by each firm would be negotiated with the particular client enterprise .  
Consolidate democracy through the promotion of pluralism , the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms , maximizing the participation of citizens in decision-making and the development of competent public institutions , including an independent judiciary , responsible legislature and public service and an electoral system that ensures free and fair elections .

This is particularly visible with regard to the eradication of poverty , which needs a human rights underpinning , as well as concerning economic , social and cultural rights for which operationalization wavers between an unrealistic expectation that the Government will provide necessary services to all free of charge , and surrender in the face of the combined obstacles of poverty and debt servicing . 
Allow me also to express the hope that this recently adopted decision will constitute a spur to promote the work of the Conference on Disarmament and afford us a real opportunity to share with the five new members the arduous work which the international community expects of us in negotiating multilateral disarmament treaties with particular attention to the objective of achieving a world which is free of nuclear weapons .

The Special Rapporteurs point of view has already been stated : the international community can not , without undermining the principles on which its very existence is based , allow the globalized market to function as well for the free and unrestricted sale of military assistance and active peacekeeping and peace-building operations that are the province of international organizations .  
UNFPA-supported mobile reproductive health clinics in several Asian programme countries also benefit women migrant workers , particularly those in the agricultural sector , as do services provided by non-governmental organization-driven programmes at the community level which target poor women , including migrant women , in marginalized urban areas and free trade zones .

We are sure that , given your skilful and widely recognized abilities and leadership , our deliberations will reach a positive conclusion that will be highly beneficial to the international community , and particularly to the nations deprived of free and sovereign access to the sea .  
Measures which should be taken to ensure the right to health are understood to be effective administration of available resources to improve health , establishment of health policies with an emphasis on prevention , increased primary health care , special attention to the health needs of the most vulnerable and free health care for the most economically disadvantaged .  
The independent expert expresses the hope that all actors will help to create conditions that will allow the electoral process to continue without incident so that free , democratic and transparent elections can be held with the broadest possible participation by the Haitian people .  
The independent expert encourages all the actors involved to pursue the political dialogue that they have already begun , but he can not insist enough on the current priority : the holding of free , democratic and transparent elections , without which it will be impossible to ensure the institutional stability that is essential if the innumerable challenges facing the Government and people of Haiti are to be met . 
From the IAEA perspective , the universal application of strengthened safeguards , and effective verification of compliance with agreements to eliminate existing nuclear arsenals , would provide a sound basis for verifying a world free from nuclear weapons .

The General Assembly , Considering that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights1 proclaims that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out therein , without distinction of any kind , in particular as to race , colour or national origin ,  
Globalization was the newest form of economic colonialism ; it made possible the efficient exploitation of vulnerable nations in the name of free markets and allowed transnational capitalists to rampage through the developing world , sometimes with the connivance , and even the active participation , of the rich elite of those poor countries .

I have been struck by the deep historical resonances of this process , for when the United Nations was established at the end of the Second World War , part of its rationale as an organization was to have been the impartial and objective resolution of international problems , free of the old cycles of retribution through resort to aggression .  
The inherent burdens of a weak banking and financial system , insignificant foreign investment , unfavourable market conditions and inefficient State enterprises , coupled with a lack of free - market traditions and experience , have compounded the reform challenge .

Conflicts will continue as long as the North continues to impose an imperfect and environmentally and economically unsustainable political model that may , perhaps , work in the North a model reached after centuries of absolute monarchies , without free or just elections , without universal suffrage , without women having the vote , without eight-hour work days , without what today is called good governance , though this concept has yet to be defined or agreed on by anybody .

The Argentine Republic has promulgated an act establishing that foreign legislation which is aimed , directly or indirectly , at restricting or impending the free flow of trade and the movement of capital , goods or persons to the detriment of a given country or group of countries shall neither be applicable nor have legal effects of any kind within Argentine territory .

As a staunch advocate of free trade and relations between nations , on the basis of respect for the norms and principles of international law , and consistent with its own cherished values and traditions , the United States clearly can not persist in its current policy against Cuba , with its serious humanitarian impact on the lives of the valiant Cuban people .  
In the context of the process of growing interdependence , even as calls are being made for free access to financial markets , goods , services , it is paradoxical to witness situations in which obstacles to such interaction are erected unilaterally and without regard for their effects upon the human development of a people even more so when we see that those obstacles are erected by applying internal norms with extraterritorial scope or effects that run counter to international public law .

Due to the magnitude of the problem and the climatic and geographic characteristics of mined zones , we believe that this stage can be executed within the time-frame stipulated by the Ottawa Convention only if we can gain access to technical and financial cooperation and to logistical support given by other States parties to the Ottawa Convention , non-governmental organizations and international organizations that are committed to the cause of achieving a world free of anti-personnel mines .  
Did not Baron de Coubertin aware as he was of the immense potential contribution of Africa to the Olympic Movement and the necessity to open up sport as a universal language and a permanent school of life to the colonized people of Africa advocated unsuccessfully the organization in 1928 of African games at Algiers , which were not held until half a century later in 1978 , bringing together the countries of the continent which were finally free .

More immediately , in this prestigious forum of the United Nations , the dynamic and dialogue of peace must allow us , Palestinians and Israelis , to free ourselves from the doctrinaire shackles of preserving a mindless ritual : that of periodically pillorying Israel through the persistence of certain obsolete resolutions that refuse to disappear , pillorying by United Nations opprobrium based on a majority follow the leader attitude that rarely changes .  
Such activities should promote the free dissemination and mutual exchange of information and knowledge in cultural and scientific fields , assist in educational , social and economic development , particularly in the developing countries , enhance the qualities of life of all peoples and provide recreation with due respect to the political and cultural integrity of States .  
Initiatives in this area include safe delivery and neo-natal assistance , cervical and breast cancer prevention , voluntary access to contraceptive methods , regulation of surgical male and female sterilization , assistance within the public health system for legal abortion and adequate treatment of incomplete abortion.The number of free pre-natal care visits in Brazil increased almost threefold in the last four years .

Protect the health of women workers in all sectors , including agricultural and domestic household workers , through effective environmental and occupational health policies for gender-sensitive work environments , free from sexual harassment and discrimination , which are safe and ergonomically designed to prevent occupational hazards ;

She deplored the fact that resource allocation and financial decisions were sometimes motivated by ideological choices which were opposed to the principle of universal , free and compulsory education even at the primary level .

Of course , they would love to see a world free of weapons of mass destruction , stockpiles of fissile material and above all , many fewer conventional weapons , to enable them to live a peaceful life.Are we anywhere near these objectives and aspirations ?  
The Commission attached priority to primary education , with the explicit objective to contribute to the attainment of compulsory primary education free of charge for all as required by international human rights law .  
In the light of the aforementioned , Lebanese law guarantees the exercise of the fundamental human rights contained in the international instruments ratified by Lebanon , free of all discrimination .  
While it is evident that there is a continued need for the international community to support the strengthening of national and local capacities in terms of health _ care expertise , infrastructure and supplies , it is also incumbent upon the national and local authorities to do their part to ensure that what is in principle free access to State _ sponsored medical services actually exists in practice .

Eight Foreign Ministers of delegations represented in this Council Chamber came together on 9 June 1998 to issue a Joint Ministerial Declaration which contained the call for a new international agenda to achieve a nuclear _ weapon _ free world , through the pursuit , in parallel , of a series of mutually reinforcing measures at the bilateral , plurilateral and multilateral levels .  
All indigenous peoples have a collective and individual right to free , comprehensive and diversified education at all levels and in all forms of basic , middle and higher education in their own languages , including bilingual education .

Development is unsustainable where the rule of law and equity do not exist ; where ethnic , religious or sexual discrimination are rampant ; where there are restrictions on free speech , free association and the media ; or where large numbers of people live in abject and degrading poverty .  
The draft should use as its starting point the preamble common to the two international Covenants of 1966 , as well as other relevant instruments which recognize that the ideal of the free individual , delivered from fear and poverty , can not be achieved without the creation of conditions allowing each person to enjoy all human rights .  
The objective of Act I on Radio and Television Broadcasting is to ensure : ( i ) free and independent radio and television broadcasting ; ( ii ) the freedom to disseminate objective and impartial information ; ( iii ) the promotion of culture at the national and international levels ; ( iv ) the prevention of the creation of a monopoly in the provision of information .

Corruption in both the public sector and the private sector , regardless of the level at which it occurs , can jeopardize free trade , distort competitiveness and undermine the stability upon which the free market system is based . 12 Companies may resort to bribery as a means of bypassing existing trade barriers or reducing national tariffs and expediting international trade .  
It may also be true that our continent is not yet free from this blight , which has drained some of our countries of resources , both material and human , which should have been used to improve the quality of life of the poor and the disadvantaged .  
In the Declaration , we also expressed our intention to carry out all the efforts required to ensure the Treatys full and universal implementation in order to promote the final objective , a world free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction .

Societies in which citizens can openly air their grievances ; choose their governments in free , open elections ; have a say , through elected local bodies , in aspects of governance that touch their daily lives the most ; and get redress when they need it from an independent judiciary that upholds the rule of law , are far less likely to erupt into domestic conflict than those under totalitarian or military rule .  
Thirdly , the failure of the Security Council to play any meaningful role during the past nine months regarding the ongoing events in the occupied Palestinian territories , including Jerusalem , in the face of the oppression and brutality inflicted upon the Palestinians , and the failure to provide international protection for the Palestinian people , indeed represent a challenge to the credibility of the Security Council and its ability to fulfil its duties in a firm and consistent manner that is free of double standards .

For the next election process to be perceived as free and fair , and for the full recognition of legitimacy in the authorities elected , the international community expects a stable environment , where fundamental rights can be guaranteed , where freedom of movement and expression is assured and where democracy can indeed be exercised .  Brazil is confident that the Government of Angola will make the best of the situation , in the benefit of the people and the future of the country .  
In this context , we see the reported achievements especially as establishing conditions on the ground allowing the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina to be free to decide to return to their pre-war homes or to choose to live elsewhere , and as developing a modern , independent and effective judiciary system as well as responsible and non-political police structures .
