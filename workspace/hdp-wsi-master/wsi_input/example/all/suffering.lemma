All sorts of feelings welled up in the mind of deputy Zhu Wenquan at the mention of units ' particular ability to endure hardship , special proficiency in combat , and combat style of stubborn and heroic fighting , fearing no sacrifice ; he recalled how he had led his units to take part in a combined exercise , saying : " We traveled from our barracks to the exercise ground without suffering one casualty or having one vehicle overturning , and completely fulfilled our mission .  
The number one men of the party and government occupy the key position in the leadership groups and shoulder heavy responsibilities ; if supervision over them is lost , they will become privileged figures without control or constraint , which will result in suggestions being stifled , criticism being suppressed , and healthy trends suffering setbacks , and it will be impossible to curb the phenomena of corruption .  
Today , with the reforms and opening to the outside , only when leading cadres at all levels possess noble values , strive to become pure people , noble people , people detached from base interests , people benefiting the people , thinking what the masses think , feeling the anxiety of the masses , suffering first , enjoying later , content to live an austere life , and having far-reaching ambitions , can they unite and lead the masses to approach common prosperity sooner .

With the passage of time , the sequence of historical evolution became even more discernible , and the inevitable occurrence of this historical phenomenon became even clearer : first , the development of capitalism got all countries involved in the capitalist system , and as developed capitalist countries were engaged in the export of commodities and capital , they at the same time exported their internal contradictions , the human suffering brought along by capitalism .  
This meant that they were subject to double suffering and double tragic fate , which made the social and class contradictions of the undeveloped nations even more acute , such that they had no other way out except revolution , and outbursts of democratic revolutions in these countries became an inevitable necessity .  
For the past year , Taiwan 's politics and economy have been in a state of constant chaos , the economic situation has gone from bad to worse , the unemployment rate has climbed steadily , the public 's index of suffering has continuously gone up , cross-strait relations have fallen behind as a result of their inability to advance , and the Taiwan public has already completely lost hope for the new government .  
Chen noted : Taiwan is currently in an economic recession , suffering from declining industries and a rising unemployment rate , and this has caused pains to the people .  Truly , Taiwan is faced , it can be said , with " a myriad of political issues and countless pressing problems . "  
In that period , China just witnessed the feudal dynasty 's surrendering of the nation 's sovereign rights under humiliating terms , the imperialist foreign powers ' despotic and domineering practice on its land , unceasing social turbulences , and the people 's miserable lives of suffering from hunger and cold . 
Had we been conservative , restrained by the routine , and not brave enough to do anything , we would still be suffering from the restraints of " two any-and-alls " and caught in endless discussions on whether this or that is " socialist " or " capitalist . "  We would be unable to blaze this new trail of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
He also expressed his thorough approval of the positive work done by Henan Province .

A not-so-advanced agricultural county has gone so far as to create , by means of giving administrative orders , more than 140 scientific and technological demonstration parks and nearly 2,700 scientific and technological demonstration points in total disregard of either its objective conditions or the bearing capacity of its masses .  Voices of grievances can be heard everywhere among local cadres and masses , and the public are suffering indescribable misery and are all trying to keep clear of the whole thing as much as they can .  
As Zhang was advanced in years and was in an unstable condition , a nurse had to fine-tune his respirator according to the reading on the monitor .

To blame the Chinese for the long-term depletion of the rhinoceros because they use its horn as medicine , or the British for having hunted it for pleasure , is not as good as reflecting on the overall influence on nature of industrialization . Faced with the extinction of numerous endangered species and with millions of people still suffering in reform-through-labor camps , we all have good reasons to feel despondent and dejected .  
And the cost of making installations far exceeds paintings or sculptures . " This is an extravagant way of opposing commercialism , refusing to be coerced in any way , determinedly pursuing one 's own ideas and boldly striking out in new directions . But it is also possible that the artist will just give up when facing the setbacks of the real world , " says a suffering Huang Wen-hao , sounding sometimes high spirited and sometimes down and out .  
When they play matchmaker for unsuspecting foreign firms , they often introduce them to inefficient enterprises .

The cat 's owner wanted to invoke the " vicious dog law " to have Lucy destroyed , but Lucy 's owner held that the law was intended to punish dogs whose bad deeds had hurt humans , and was not applicable to conflicts between animals . Fur Ball 's owner , however , claimed personal suffering as the result of Fur Ball 's cruel death , and thus argued that Lucy had caused injury to a person , making the vicious dog law applicable to this case .  
For instance , in recording oral history about the February 28 incident , people previously put the stress on external facts , such as witnesses who saw people being tortured , etc . Now the focus has turned to the suffering imposed by the entire process and how the experience affected people inside . This is a change in historical perspective .  
A few years ago there was an incident which shook society . A Buddhist medical worker who could not bear to witness the suffering of the severely ill in their last stages and the hardships imposed on families for the long-term care of " human vegetables , " " played God " and let some of them die . He was discovered and prosecuted .  
Li describes a six-hour procedure in which he participated : The patient was suffering from a malignant tumor on the common bile duct , which connects to the hepatic duct , bile duct , and pancreatic duct . Because it affected so many organs , the surgery was extremely difficult . Seven persons-the assistant chief of the hospital , a chief resident , a resident , an anesthe-siologist , and three nurses-labored for those six hours to complete the job .  
When you enter temples , the bodhi-sattvas , smiling and downward gazing , sit cross-legged in the " lotus position " on their lotus pedestals . Guanyin , the Buddhist Goddess of Mercy who relieves hardships and suffering , sprinkles sweet water onto the fire raging in the house of humanity while treading on lotuses . A booklet free for the taking in sidewalk arcades features on its cover a lotus blossom surrounded by drooping lotus leaves .  
By paying for each procedure carried out , NHI is encouraging the medical community to emphasize quantity rather than quality of treatment . It is also encouraging doctors to go into easier fields which pay well . For this reason , dermatology , pediatrics and physical rehabilitation have become hot areas to work in , and doctors are leaving hospitals to set up their own private clinics . On the other hand , more difficult areas of medicine such as surgery are suffering from a shortage of doctors .  
The Chinese place great importance on eventually returning to their roots , and always hope to be buried close to home .

Dr . Sheih says that kidney disease has long been one of the ten leading causes of death in Taiwan . " Both kidney transplant patients and dialysis patients have to endure considerable pain , " he observes .

The medical community gives two main reasons why there is such wide acceptance of alternative treatments : superstition , and inadequate understanding of cancer treatment . But patients point mostly to the fact that they are tired of suffering .  
Their owners are not only required to provide them with sufficient food and drinking water and a safe living environment with adequate shelter , air and light , but must also prevent them suffering unnecessary disturbance , abuse or injury . Animals must not be subjected to fear or pain when being transported , and they may only be slaughtered by humane methods which cause the least possible suffering .  
In future manual butchering will have to give way to mechanized slaughtering with electric stunning . The well over 100,000 chickens and ducks consumed in Greater Taipei each day will also have to be slaughtered electrically close to the farms in central and southern Taiwan , to reduce the suffering they now endure when transported tightly packed in cages .  
When animal protection has to be implemented in specific legal regulations the assistance of scientific research is usually required , so that concepts such as cruelty and pain are no longer vague or left to the kind of subjective judgements to which Zhuangzi retorted " I am not a fish-how can I know a fish 's suffering ? " Science also allows appropriate protective rules to be drafted according to the specific needs of different animals .

Misery and suffering left in the wake of the 21 September Chichi earthquake are still apparent over a wide area , but rebuilding continues non-stop , and appraisal of damage to buildings in the disaster areas has been completed . The government has been busy distributing financial help and contributions sent by sympathetic onlookers , and temporary housing for 4,500 families will be completed by the middle of November . These are just the first steps in post-disaster relief efforts however ; full-scale recovery still has a long way to go .  
In the early years of ROC rule in Taiwan , the government sent political prisoners to Green Island . Those inmates lucky enough to survive that era of oppression and return to their normal lives , as well as family members of prisoners and other citizens concerned about human rights , joined together to create the foundation . So that the suffering of that period would not be forgotten , they raised money to establish this memorial , which bears witness to the government 's past mistakes and the pain of those who suffered under its oppression .  
According to art academic Chiang Hsun , Impressionism , from which sorrow and suffering and even seriousness all seem to be absent , was a product of the first generation to enjoy the fruits of urban life following the industrial revolution . The painter Renoir was particularly fond of showing nudes posed amid nature , depicted with caressing strokes of the brush .  
If we compare him to other Nativist writers who address the tragedy of the rural elderly unable to adapt to the modern industrial world , we note that Huang is reluctant to expose his elderly characters to unmitigated suffering .  
He explains : " From both the psychiatric literature and clinical experience , doctors discovered that there 's a peculiar phenomenon with people suffering psychological disorders . Once they 're in hospital , the disorders can be controlled quite well , but when they return home , not long thereafter the symptoms re-emerge . " Doctors thus became curious about the family backgrounds of their patients , and social workers were sent to investigate . The result has been the discovery of many dysfunctional families .  
Also , in the future , whole historic settlements or streets can be considered monuments to be preserved . Finally , a law governing control and treatment of rare diseases , will allow importation of appropriate medications , treatments , and essential life-saving nutritional supplements for those suffering from tens of unusual ailments .  
" National sovereignty " is reflected in a country 's ability to engage in diplomatic relations , but in this most critical area for national survival , Taiwan has long been suffering from PRC efforts to undercut Taiwan 's international status . Indeed , as Levi C . Ying , an overseas Chinese legislator from the New Party , says , mainland China is the only real obstacle and enemy to Taiwan 's foreign relations .  
In Christian culture the mother is a sacred figure , symbolizing purity , charity , and tolerance . In traditional Chinese culture , by contrast , mothers not only were supposed to have certain moral virtues , but were also bearers of heavy burdens of pain and suffering . A mother was fated to cry endless tears and submit to countless indignities .  
Calligraphy certainly does have the ability to cure disease . Once suffering from a hyperactive thyroid due to the pressures of a fast-paced life , Lin Jui-yao was diagnosed by his doctor as needing to take medicine for the long term . But he abandoned drugs completely , practicing calligraphy eight hours daily and immersing himself in his inner world . His endocrine system gradually became balanced and he was healed .  
Liao Ching-pi , an associate professor of social work at Soochow University and director of the Yoyuen Social Work Foundation , holds strongly to the newer view . Studies done overseas , says Liao , " show that affairs are most likely to happen with men who are unsuccessful in their careers , suffering from sexual dysfunction , or faced with problems in their family or personal relationships that they ca n't handle . "  
According to the data , aside from persons suffering from chronic liver , lung and kidney diseases and the old and infirm , those who exhibit the most severe symptoms are adults aged 20 to 50 . Conversely , children whose immune system has not yet fully developed are able to escape this scourge . This provides evidence for the inference that it is the reaction of the immune system and not the SARS virus itself that kills a person .  
In March 2003 the Chinese edition of Scientific American magazine published an article entitled " Suicide : Why Do They Do It ? , " which pointed out that research by American scientists has shown that a type of neurotransmitter in the brain-serotonin-is related to emotional stability in humans , and that people suffering from depression who exhibit aggressive behavior , as well as people with compulsive and obsessive personalities , have lower levels of serotonin than normal people .  
Cheng points out that although such ideas have a contagious element about them , people who are mentally healthy or who have a strong " psychological immunity " will not easily be " infected " by suicide reports . But people who are themselves suffering from severe depression or who have suffered a serious setback in life , are more likely to be contaminated by an unhealthy suicidal frame of mind and to be unable to free themselves from it .  
This typhoon caused the people of Taoyuan a great deal of pain and suffering as they were forced to go without water for many days . Industrial losses are estimated at NT $ 10 billion .

The changed pattern of adult morbidity is reflected in the increased number of patients suffering from noncontagious mass chronic diseases but also in the renewed incidence of contagious diseases .  
Such determined arguments in the face of widespread and increasing suffering are clearly reprehensible and underlie a gross violation of the fundamental human rights of millions of innocent persons .  
But as ethnic conflicts spread and political solutions become more elusive , there is a risk that humanitarian operations could become prolonged , draining limited resources and causing untold suffering .  
The Executive Committee expressed its deep concern and preoccupation with the immense human suffering and loss of life in recent crises and the scale and complexity of current refugee problems , and deplored the incidence of armed attack and of murder , rape and other violations of fundamental rights , as well as refoulement and denial of access to safety .  
We know how difficult was the road leading to the establishment of lasting peace in view of the level of distrust and the acute , accumulated suffering involved .  
I ask the Secretary-General of the United Nations whether he is obliged to defend the moral principles in the United Nations Charter or whether he should console the dying and the bereaved by saying that there are others elsewhere who are suffering worse fates .  Is there not , in the context of the larger picture , a special role for the United Nations to provide international leadership ?  
The tragedy of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina , which is suffering the consequences of Belgrade 's ambition to create a Greater Serbia inspired by the philosophy of national chauvinism , the policy of ethnic cleansing and the forceful changing of borders lies at the centre of the present-day Balkan crisis , concentrated in the former Yugoslavia . 
The point is that , in such cases , there should be a minimum level of safeguards , through the application of a set of agreed , uniform rules and procedures , in order for the imposing and lifting of sanctions to take place in a manner that strikes a balance between , on the one hand , the interests of the international community and , on the other , the extent of the human suffering endured by peoples on whom the sanctions are imposed .  
Nonetheless , we are extremely pleased to underscore the admirable example offered to us by the South Africans who , moving beyond racial or cultural motivations , in a long and heroic effort that has caused so much suffering , have put an end to the most odious form of discrimination apartheid .

Despite the end of the cold war , which has lessened the probability of nuclear conflict , the Earth continues to be an arena of murderous conflicts that cause unspeakable suffering and vast humanitarian tragedies .  
We have clearly stated , on previous occasions , that the deteriorating economies of the developing countries and the widening gap between the rich and poor countries are the two principal causes of the proliferation of hotbeds of tension and bloody wars that , more often than not , wipe out every economic achievement , plunge the peoples of developing countries into cruel suffering and deprive them of the right to lead a decent life of security , stability , and development towards a better future . 
Regrettably , this great historic victory was attained at a high price : the heavy of loss of human lives , incredible suffering , unprecedented material losses .  
The terrible images of the Second World War , of horrible combats , of massive destruction , of endless suffering inflicted on innocent civilians and on combatants , remind us of the kind of events and dangers that brought the representatives of 51 allied countries to San Francisco to sign , on 26 June 1945 , the Charter that established the United Nations .  
Notwithstanding the impressive achievements of the human race we are forced to live at the same time with unspeakable suffering that mocks all material and spiritual progress in which we might feel some pride as we approach the new century .  
The tragic human suffering and the terrible material destruction brought about by more than 20 years of conflict also require that the international community following the round table on Angola being held in Brussels under the auspices of the United Nations Development Programme continues to respond generously to the humanitarian aid needs and the challenge of reconstructing the country , particularly in the areas of demining and the social reintegration of the displaced and the demobilized . 
We see with great concern how ethnic , geographical and utopian myths and revisionisms are becoming a boundless source of suffering for millions of men and women in our time , gravely disturbing fragile international balances .  
The challenge the international community now faces is threefold : to ensure that recent positive developments do not founder for lack of economic and political support , to nurture progress on the other bilateral tracks of negotiations to match that achieved between Israel and the PLO and to prevent acts of violence and terrorism by extremist groups that seek to endanger the peace process and threaten to drive the Middle East back into conflict and suffering .  
However , we have been helpless witnesses to unacceptable suffering , to shameful operations of so-called ethnic cleansing and to crimes against humanity , which the international community was unable to prevent and before which it remained passive .  
In addition , the European Union adopted , on 18 September , a common position with the aim of fostering the adoption of a new protocol on blinding lasers , which satisfies the humanitarian concern to avoid unnecessary suffering without limiting the legitimate military use of lasers .  
The European Union takes note of the progress made during the first part of the Review Conference , held in Vienna from 25 September to 13 October , with the adoption of a new Protocol IV on blinding laser weapons , which responds to humanitarian concerns to avoid unnecessary suffering without limiting the legitimate military use of lasers .  
So I ask Member States , when they hear us speaking out about the perils of radiation , to think about these in terms of human suffering and to try to visualize Marshallese children being born faceless , with no bones , or with missing or extra limbs the jellyfish babies , as some have come to call them and the irreparable damage wreaked upon the reproductive health of their mothers .

Recognizing that the grave suffering of the great majority of human beings who live in conditions of poverty demands the immediate attention of the international community and the adoption of concrete actions and measures towards the eradication of poverty within the framework of relevant forthcoming United Nations conferences , particularly the World Summit for Social Development , and within the context of the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty ,

These confidence-building measures , which could lead to an informal suspension of offensive military operations , would constitute a demonstration of good will aimed at alleviating the suffering of the civilian population in areas affected by the armed confrontation , protecting human rights and facilitating the work of MINUGUA as well as all national entities devoted to the protection and promotion of human rights . 
With regard to military operations , until such time as a cease-fire is agreed to and takes effect , URNG insists on the commitment to respect the provisions of the comprehensive agreement on human rights intended to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population , protect human rights and facilitate the work of MINUGUA and of all national bodies devoted to the protection and promotion of human rights and the rights deriving from international humanitarian law .

The extraordinary ferocity of the war , the physical devastation , the deliberate massacre of civilians and the wanton indifference to human suffering have continued unabated for three years now .  
The objective of the subprogramme is to support the mechanisms for operational coordination and inter-agency programming through IASC , other forums and the United Nations resident coordinators in the field in order to facilitate a coordinated and coherent response to major complex emergencies affecting large numbers of persons suffering from famine or displaced by civil strife or other disorders .  
The adoption of General Assembly resolution 49 / 139 B , in the light of the growing demands for manpower and funds to mitigate the suffering and destruction caused by numerous emergencies , represents an innovative opportunity for the effective , efficient and economical provision of assistance to the intended beneficiaries of the United Nations system 's operations , tapping existing but as yet unstructured and therefore unrealized sources of volunteer expertise .  
Consequently , in the Agreement , URNG undertook " to respect the inherent attributes of the human person and to contribute to the effective enjoyment of human rights " and , like the Government , it recognized the need to end the suffering of the civilian population and to respect the human rights of wounded , captured and disabled combatants . 
During the period covered by this report , the Mission verified complaints of alleged violations by both parties of the commitment to respect the human rights of wounded , captured and disabled combatants , as well as to end the suffering of the civilian population .  
The Mission believes that URNG has committed human rights violations and has failed to observe the commitment to end the suffering of the civilian population , by making threats and taking action against civilian property for the purpose of collecting the " war tax " ; by unnecessarily endangering civilians not involved in the conflict during attacks on military bases and units ; by laying mines or explosive devices in places where civilians work , live or circulate ; and by taking reprisals . 
There is no doubt , as we indicated in our previous letter , that the Iraqi regime is unaware of the scale of the human suffering caused by the illegal imprisonment of the Kuwaiti and other prisoners because that regime is itself responsible for the suffering of its own people , about which it is totally unconcerned , as is proved by the following facts :  
The increased importance of transparency in the transfer and possession of conventional arms and the growing international interest in such transparency are justified by the fact that such weapons are virtually untouched by existing legislation and can cause serious human suffering .  
In paragraph 12 ( g ) , making economic growth and the interaction of market forces more conducive to social development requires " ensuring substantial public and private investment in human resource development and in capacity-building in health and education , as well as in empowerment and participation , especially for people living in poverty or suffering from social exclusion " .  
Thus , while we fully share the pain and suffering experienced by the peoples of both Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia because of the wars raging in their countries , we have at the same time maintained a balanced position vis - - vis the conflicts in those countries .  We have joined in the condemnation of all violations of international humanitarian law committed in these conflicts irrespective of who may have committed them .  
The report also noted that URNG had committed human rights violations and had failed to observe the commitment to end the suffering of the civilian population by making threats and taking action against civilian property for the purpose of collecting " war tax " ; by unnecessarily endangering civilians not involved in the conflict during attacks on military bases and units ; by laying mines and explosive devices in places where civilians work , live or circulate ; and by taking reprisals . 
During a certain period in the not too distant past , Japan , following a mistaken national policy , advanced along the road to war , only to ensnare the Japanese people in a fateful crisis , and , through its colonial rule and aggression , caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries , particularly to those of Asian nations .  
Although true , Mr . van der Stoel 's words are intentionally misleading in that he claims to feel sorry for the children of Iraq , yet at the same time fails to request the lifting of the embargo against them ; on the contrary , he holds the Government of Iraq responsible for such human suffering on account of its non-implementation of Security Council resolutions 706 ( 1991 ) and 712 ( 1991 ) , despite being satisfied as to their political objectives .  
The resolution encompasses dubious political objectives such as deceiving world public opinion in order to eliminate the growing pressure to end the suffering of the Iraqi people and lift the unjust embargo imposed on it in a bid to divert efforts to that end within the Security Council and thus ensuring the continued imposition of the embargo for as long as possible .  
The resolution encompasses dubious political objectives such as deceiving world public opinion in order to eliminate the growing pressure to end the suffering of the Iraqi people and lift the unjust embargo imposed on it in a bid to divert efforts to that end within the Security Council and thus ensuring the continued imposition of the embargo for as long as possible .  
Whereas the focus has been on the provision of humanitarian assistance to those people , the countries receiving the refugees , despite their limited resources , have made substantial contributions by accepting the refugees and assisting in catering to their essential needs , while experiencing rising social tension and suffering nearly irreparable environmental degradation , notably in the United Republic of Tanzania and Zaire . 
NULLIn the meantime , human suffering of considerable gravity persists in the form of murder , disappearances and infliction of conditions that cause physical destruction , thus depriving people of fundamental human rights such as the right to life , the right to be free from torture and the right to be free from cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment .  
I am convinced that , notwithstanding the acute financial crisis currently facing the Organization , the provision of additional resources to UNOMIL , at a level that is modest by comparison with peace-keeping operations elsewhere , is justified by the hope that the Abuja Agreement at last offers a chance of ending the cruel war in Liberia and alleviating the terrible suffering it has caused .  
They noted that this dangerous situation has led to tremendous losses in human lives , considerable material damage and unspeakable suffering among the population , including the massive movement of refugees .  
In addition , the phenomenon of the caste system , which could be characterized as multiple apartheid , also must be addressed openly with a view to mitigating the suffering of millions of people living a life of bondage and discrimination which divided them into upper and lower echelons , segregated them and excluded them from the political , economic , social and cultural spheres of society . 
Certainly , the human tragedy of this continuing matter is enormous both in terms of any remaining detainees who are no doubt suffering untold emotional anguish and possibly enduring physical hardship and in terms of the relatives of the missing persons who are suffering severe mental distress because they are without knowledge of the whereabouts and condition of their loved ones .  
Pinning the responsibility for the suffering of the population of the former Bosnia and Herzegovina exclusively on the " Pale regime supported by Serbia " , as deliberately stated by the Muslim representative , can not divert the culpability of the Muslim-Croat authorities and free them from their role in starting the civil war , which has unleashed an unprecedented humanitarian tragedy and the continuation of the war option .  
" Distressed at the continued suffering of refugees for whom a solution has yet to be found , and noting with deep concern that refugee protection continues to be jeopardized in many situations as a result of denial of admission , unlawful expulsion , refoulement , unjustified detention , other threats to their physical security , dignity and well-being and failure to respect and ensure their fundamental freedoms and human rights ,  
The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , for its part , had paid its assessed contribution up to the end of the current year , despite the difficult economic circumstances it was suffering ; those difficulties , as everyone knew , had been considerably worsened by the consequences of the embargo and unjust sanctions imposed by the Security Council .  
While there was a need to stress the primary responsibility of the Security Council for imposing economic and trade sanctions in order to punish anyone who threatened international peace and security , target such sanctions to those whom they were intended to punish and lift them speedily whenever conditions so warranted , practical ways and means must be found to avoid unnecessary suffering by third States which applied such sanctions .  
about continuing indiscriminate and deliberate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers ,  
concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by sixteen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a land-locked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
most disadvantaged developing countries were the most seriously affected by the reduced United Nations programmes in particular , where net flows of official development assistance had decreased ; those of sub-Saharan Africa received only an insignificant proportion of direct foreign investment devoted to developing countries and were suffering a continued decline in exports .

obstacles remained , however : harsh economic conditions , the building and expansion of Israeli settlements , the isolation and closure of areas of the occupied territory , including Jerusalem , and land and water confiscation all had a detrimental effect on the situation of Palestinian women and children , who were already suffering from the disastrous consequences of long years of occupation ( rising numbers of refugees and displaced persons , break-up of families , deterioration of health conditions , poor education , rising unemployment and depletion of the environment ) .  
It was essential for the international community to define and implement a global approach to refugee problems , based on prevention , the reduction of the negative effects of the presence of refugees on the host country and the search for durable solutions , in order to alleviate the suffering of millions of human beings and prevent other humanitarian crises .  
that end , the Supreme Council called on the international community to maintain the pressures on the Iraqi Government until Iraq gave proof of its peaceful intentions and completed implementation of the provisions of resolution 687 ( 1991 ) and other pertinent United Nations resolutions , in particular those relating to the release of prisoners and detainees , both Kuwaitis and nationals of other States , whose extended suffering was in blatant violation of resolution 687 ( 1991 ) and the third and fourth Geneva Conventions .  
The destruction , massacres and immeasurable suffering in Lebanon reported by the mass media , which show human bodies that have been cut up and mutilated , is unequivocal proof of the barbaric nature of the aggression taking place at the hands of the Israelis .  
The failure of the Security Council to act at the appropriate time , in response to Lebanon 's request , makes the Council responsible for the heavy human toll , the severe human suffering and the substantial physical damage sustained by Lebanon .  
It is difficult for us to see how the firing of Katyusha rockets by Hezbollah into northern Israel , condemnable as it is , can be equated with the Israeli artillery bombardments , sea and air attacks and other missile attacks directed at the civilian populations in Lebanese villages , towns and cities , resulting in many deaths , enormous suffering and extensive destruction of property .  
Despite the end of the cold war , regional , religious and ethnic disputes are being further aggravated in various parts of our planet , and consequently world peace and security are gravely disturbed and peoples are suffering from untold misfortunes resulting from them .  
We therefore share the anguish of the international community for those countries where internal strife and regional conflict , and their attendant human suffering , continue to deny economic and social progress to millions of their people . 
The tension brought about by the presence of armed groups across the borders of other States , the tragedy of refugees and displaced persons seeking shelter in neighbouring countries and very often the consequent destruction of the environment , the spread of disease , the degeneration of moral values , the horror of suffering and behaviours far removed from human values are all situations not confined to the territorial limits of the States where conflicts occur .  
This joint effort is most appropriate when we recall that we are living in an era in which society realizes that big government and its programmes sometimes give rise to more expenditure than advantages and that fiscal responsibility is of more benefit to the economy than is the multiplication of governmental departments , especially in the developing countries , where the public sector is still suffering the consequences of large-scale programmes that have not produced the results expected .  
We deem it vital to ensure an orderly transition between peace-keeping operations and the work of reconstruction aimed at reversing the economic , political and social damage caused by conflicts and to offer effective humanitarian assistance so as to reduce the suffering of the populations affected .  
My delegation has on numerous occasions called for an end to the embargo that has crippled the Cuban economy and , as members heard from the Secretary of the Council of Ministers of Cuba , cruelly endangered the lives of many innocent people , including children , the sick and the elderly , who have had to bear the brunt of untold suffering .  
On another level , this blockade , which has continued for more than 35 years , constitutes a violation of international humanitarian law , because it has led to unimaginable human suffering among the Cuban civilian population by imposing restrictions on the sovereign right of Cuba to develop economic relations with other countries .  
The situation in the Great Lakes region of Africa , now so dramatically changed in the space of a few days , underlines the importance of being prepared to respond in a timely , coordinated and effective manner to humanitarian crises in order to alleviate the suffering of our fellow human beings .  
In its resolution 46 / 182 of 19 December 1991 , the General Assembly stated its deep concern about the suffering of the victims of disasters and emergency situations , the loss in human lives , the flow of refugees , the mass displacement of people and the material destruction , and set forth a number of guiding principles and measures to strengthen the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations system .  
The Republic of Belarus deeply appreciates the efforts made by all the programmes , funds and specialized agencies of the United Nations system towards providing increased , speedier and better quality assistance to the various countries and regions suffering from armed conflicts , natural disasters , industrial ecological catastrophes and other emergency circumstances .  
Concerned by the increasing suffering of millions of victims of natural disasters , emergency situations and armed conflicts and by the attendant loss of life , flows of refugees , mass displacement of populations and infrastructure devastation , the United Arab Emirates declares its support for international efforts to assess and enhance the capacity of the United Nations and its specialized agencies to address these grave international humanitarian problems and to strengthen the participation of the international community .  
The application of the kind of measures referred to in the draft resolution introduced today by the delegation of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya not only represents an attack on the identity of the State concerned and on its political , economic and cultural elements , but also affects other sensitive areas such as the ability of the peoples suffering from those unilateral policies fully to enjoy their human rights .  
Furthermore , pursuant to resolution 1994 / 47 of the Commission on Human Rights , the Secretary-General informed that body , in his report contained in document E / CN . 4 / 1995 / 43 , that application of unilateral coercive measures is incompatible with the principle of international cooperation , has an adverse impact on the economies of developing countries suffering under the measures and constitutes a serious violation of the human rights of the individuals , groups and peoples affected .  
Secondly , I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to remind the international community that my country is suffering from an inhuman , illegal and unjust economic blockade imposed by the neighbouring States under a pretext involving my country 's domestic policies a question that has already become nugatory .  
The suffering they inflict upon civilian populations , their detrimental effects on economic and social development , especially in areas infested with landmines , and the hefty financial burdens , as well as the technological limitations involved in their detection and de-activation , are undeniable . 
As I have stated before , Japan , which has experienced the calamity of atomic bombing , fervently hopes that nuclear weapons , which cause incomparable human suffering , will never again be used and firmly believes that continuous efforts should be made towards a nuclear-weapon-free world .  
We also welcome the remarkable work carried out every day , frequently in dangerous conditions on the ground , by local and foreign humanitarian organizations and the various programmes , United Nations organs and international institutions to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population and to aid in the rebuilding of the country .  
The adoption of the draft resolution will affirm that the international community has actually derived benefit from the lessons of the recent past and is convinced that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure : had we moved at the right time within the ambit of preventive diplomacy , we could have prevented catastrophes such as those that have afflicted the Great Lakes region of Africa for about two years now , with Rwanda still suffering their scourge .  
Lightly armed peace-keepers and unarmed civilians were sent into areas of active warfare , where their courageous efforts helped to save untold human lives and to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population .  
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by sixteen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a land-locked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
Although only the Government can put most of these commitments into effect , URNG , in addition to recognizing the need to put an end to the suffering of the civilian population and to respect the human rights of wounded , captured and disabled combatants , also undertook , inter alia , " to respect the inherent attributes of the human person and to contribute to the effective enjoyment of human rights " ( Comprehensive Agreement , fourth preambular paragraph ) .  
With regard to the ICAO investigation , although it is part of the United Nations manoeuvre to bring the incident before the Security Council , we are not afraid of it ; on the contrary , we accept it and we demand that it should be rapid and impartial , and that it should take into account all the background information and the gross provocations we are suffering from as a result of the repeated violation of our airspace and the risks they entailed to air traffic and to our country . 
Concerned about continuing indiscriminate and deliberate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers ,  
If certain reforms are necessary , we should remember that our sole task is to ensure that the United Nations becomes the most efficient , flexible , transparent and suitable instrument to serve humanity when it is in danger or suffering , to prevent evil or to free humanity from evil when evil is upon it .  
The Islamic Republic of Iran condemns the recent cowardly , though savage , attacks against defenceless civilians in Lebanon , and calls on the Security Council to condemn Israel 's recent terrorist acts in Lebanon , which have caused tremendous suffering for a country whose sovereignty and territorial integrity have for a long time been violated by the Israeli occupation forces .  It is incumbent upon the Security Council to adopt specific measures to deal with Israeli intransigence in its non-compliance with Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) .  
It adopted the Declaration 's definition of violence against women as " any act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life " .  The Group agreed that economic exploitation can be a form of violence .  
In its resolution 46 / 182 of 19 December 1991 , the General Assembly stated its deep concern about the suffering of the victims of disasters and emergency situations , the loss in human lives , the flow of refugees , the mass displacement of people and the material destruction , and set forth a number of guiding principles and measures to strengthen the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations system .  
The progress achieved in the peace negotiations and the temporary suspension of offensive and counterrevolutionary activity have created new conditions capable of permitting decisive progress in fulfilling the commitment to eradicate the suffering the internal armed confrontation has caused for the civilian population and of building confidence in the peace process .  
In other words , the regulation provided in article 7 is satisfactory neither to the State planning a new activity ( since it will be held liable for any harm caused even though the activity may constitute equitable and reasonable utilization ) nor to the State suffering harm from this activity ( which is entitled only to consultations if the first State has exercised due diligence ) .  
The view was expressed that the accused should be allowed to enter a plea of guilty which would have the procedural effect of obviating the need for a lengthy and costly trial : the accused would be allowed to admit his wrongdoing and accept his sentence ; the victims and witnesses would be spared any additional suffering ; and the Court would be allowed to take the guilty plea into account in sentencing the convicted person .  
In another sense , however , the distinction between relief and rehabilitation assistance in Somalia is becoming increasingly blurred , as the main underlying causes of human suffering and emergency needs remain the population 's lack of purchasing power and employment opportunities combined with the absence of civil and social infrastructure and institutions of governance .  
Some 15,750 persons living in the Jamahiriya are suffering from serious medical conditions ( cardiovascular disease ; fractures of the spinal column and thorax ; fractured skulls ; chronic eye diseases ; detached retinas ; serious burns ; cancer and malignant tumours ) which require emergency treatment ( neurosurgery ; spinal marrow transplants ; kidney transplants ; corneal transplants ; fitting of prostheses ) .  
Over half a century of occupation of south Korea by United States military forces has created the tragedy of a divided nation , put grave obstacles in the way of peace and reunification of the Korean peninsula , even in the current post-cold war era , and inflicted immeasurable misery and suffering on the entire Korean population .  
It adopted the Declaration 's definition of violence against women as " any act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life " . d / The Group agreed that economic exploitation can be a form of violence .  
The fact that our Kurdish people sought help from its national Government in order to end its suffering exposes the persistent claims of the Special Rapporteur and certain of the allied States , principally the United States , that their military intervention in the northern part of Iraq was intended to protect the Kurds , and supports our previous assertions , namely , that the secret but true intention behind that intervention is to tear apart Iraq and fragment its territorial integrity .  
Van der Stoel attempts to invoke the issue of missing Kuwaitis for obvious political purposes unrelated to human rights with a view to the continued exercise of pressure on the Government of Iraq and prolongation of the economic embargo and hence the suffering of the Iraqi people .  
Torture , which is an aggravated and deliberate form of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , is defined in article 1 of the Declaration as follows : " any act by which severe pain or suffering , whether physical or mental , is intentionally inflicted by or at the instigation of a public official on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or confession , punishing him for an act he has committed or is suspected of having committed , or intimidating him or other persons " .  
The United Nations should emphasize the formulation of policies aimed at fostering a consensus on development strategy as a vital step towards the building of a new global partnership , and should develop specific programmes to assist the least developed countries - most of which had yet to benefit from increased flows of private capital - and the African countries , which were suffering from a heavy debt burden and a lack of basic infrastructure for development .  
The objectives of the Independent Bureau have remained the same as those pursued by the Independent Commission , i.e . , to study specific humanitarian issues that have been inadequately dealt with to date or that call for solutions in line with new realities ; to identify opportunities for more effective action by the international community and to make practical , action-oriented proposals to that end ; to enhance public awareness of the conditions that create and perpetuate human suffering ; and to strengthen efforts at governmental and non-governmental level to bring about appropriate changes and adjustments . 
A realistic beginning could be to address a few selected humanitarian issues which , in recent years , have caused deep concern to Governments and unnecessary suffering to millions of people that could be mitigated or avoided if the world community were to ensure the observance of a set of basic rules of conduct . 
Distinct from the framework of fundamental human rights and freedoms , such an approach would concentrate on practical humanitarian problems whose continuing growth needs to be vigorously discouraged through solidarity with the victims as much as the human suffering they entail needs to be alleviated .  
In recent years , owing to fragmentation of States into newly independent countries , the twin problems of forced relocation of populations and mass expulsions , including the so-called " ethnic cleansing " operations , have resulted in the involuntary displacement of millions of people as well as considerable suffering and loss of life and property .  
In the short term , there was an urgent need for additional financial resources to alleviate human suffering and environmental damage and to find solutions to the political problems that caused population displacements .  
Being aware that involuntary , mass displacement , in addition to the human suffering involved , imposes significant economic and social burdens and may affect security and stability at the regional level ,  
Sudan Airways carries thousands of elderly patients suffering from intractable diseases such as cancer , liver failure , heart disease and arterial diseases on a weekly basis to London , Cairo , Amman and Jedda on travel tickets that are discounted by 50 per cent and are paid for in local currency .  
Aware that involuntary , mass displacement , in addition to the human suffering involved , imposes significant economic and social burdens and may affect security and stability at the regional level ,  
" Being aware that involuntary , mass displacement , in addition to the human suffering involved , imposes significant economic and social burdens and may affect security and stability at the regional level ,  
Aware that involuntary , mass displacement , in addition to the human suffering involved , imposes significant economic and social burdens and may affect security and stability at the regional level ,  
The representative of Norway , a country with which Burundi had excellent cooperative relations , had , at a previous meeting , said that the coup d ' \ x { 5f4b } at that had taken place in Burundi in 1995 had not improved the security or human rights situation but , on the contrary , had exacerbated the suffering of the people .  
Concerned about continuing deliberate and indiscriminate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers involved in Operation Lifeline Sudan and international private voluntary agencies ,  
Expresses its deep concern at the intense suffering of the victims of genocide and crimes against humanity , recognizes the ongoing suffering of their survivors , particularly the extremely high number of traumatized children and women victims of rape and sexual violence , and urges the international community to provide adequate assistance to them and to note the priorities identified by the Government of Rwanda in this area ;  
Intensive humanitarian assistance was required from the international community to improve the living conditions and relieve their suffering until a just and comprehensive solution was reached in accordance with General Assembly resolution 194 ( III ) of 11 December 1948 .  Lebanon considered that the presence of Palestine refugees in its territory was temporary and was a consequence of Israeli occupation and the continuation of the Middle East crisis .  
Expresses its deep concern at the intense suffering of the victims of genocide and crimes against humanity , recognizes the ongoing suffering of their survivors , particularly the extremely high number of traumatized children and women victims of rape and sexual violence , and urges the international community to provide adequate assistance to them and to note the priorities identified by the Government of Rwanda in this area ;  
The suffering of the Afghan civilian population , who continue to bear the main brunt of the civil war , and the dangers that that war creates for regional stability , oblige the international community to intensify its search for a peaceful solution , despite the fact that certain Afghan parties seem to continue to favour the military option .

Deeply deplore the loss of so many human lives , the material damage and the indescribable suffering caused by armed conflicts in the subregion , which are generating millions of refugees and displaced persons , and express our deep gratitude to the countries and peoples of the subregion for their generous and fraternal hospitality and welcome . 
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by seventeen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a land-locked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
Security Council resolution 1080 ( 1996 ) established a two-part mandate for the multinational force : facilitating the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the effective delivery by civilian relief organizations of humanitarian aid to alleviate the immediate suffering of displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire ; and facilitating the voluntary , orderly repatriation of refugees by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as well as the voluntary return of displaced persons .  
The same was true of other violations of the law of armed conflict mentioned in the new draft , i.e . , the employment of poisonous weapons calculated to cause unnecessary suffering or the wanton destruction of cities , towns or villages not justified by military necessity .  
Not only treatment causing bodily injury , but also , for example , treatment causing mental suffering and feelings of fear , anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing the victim and possibly breaking their physical and moral resistance may amount to such proscribed treatment .  
The developments which took place prior to the Dayton Peace Agreement proved once again that a lack of firm and prompt international response to aggression leads to further aggravation of crises , causes untold human suffering and makes it all the more difficult to find solutions .  
He considered the creative freedom for women to express themselves , to create and nourish culture and to bring into the light suffering that stays hidden because of societal taboos an essential means to overcome the many manifestations of the use of violence against women , which can negatively affect their enjoyment of the right of freedom of opinion and expression .  
Cuba considers that the unfair and unequal international political and economic order , underdevelopment , the unequal distribution of income among countries and within countries and , in some cases , the actions of other States and the implementation of measures of coercion are also responsible for the outbreak and continuation of internal conflicts and the suffering they cause .  
With that perception , we believe that it is high time to completely do away with the obsolete ways of thinking and acting of the past , namely , the imposition of inequitable terms of economic and trade relations , sanctions and embargoes , and so forth , which distort international relations , cause suffering to the people and seriously violate the minimum right of human beings the right to a peaceful life .  
Unfortunately , the world continues to witness many , not fewer , incidents of just and unjust wars , regional conflicts , civil and ethnic strife , acute forms of suffering , environmental degradation and unmitigated endangerment of life itself .  
The need for that assistance and support remains urgent amid the current difficult circumstances faced by the Palestinian people of the occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip , in view of the stagnation of the peace process and Israeli coercive measures , including closures and restrictions on the movement of workers and commodities to and from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip which represent an additional burden increasing the suffering of the Palestinian people .  
This is the response of the international community aimed at achieving a complete ban on these treacherous and barbarous weapons , which are contrary to international humanitarian law , so that future generations will be free from the suffering of today \ x { e5b8 } civilian victims , in particular children .  
The treaty represents a solid international humanitarian commitment to alleviate the cruel and indiscriminate suffering caused by mines which have been placed throughout the world , affecting innocent civilian populations , and also to provide assistance to facilitate their rehabilitation and their social reintegration .  
Japan , which experienced the calamity of atomic bombing , fervently desires that the use of nuclear weapons , which cause incomparable human suffering , should never be repeated and firmly believes that continuous efforts should be made towards creating a world free of nuclear weapons .  
Over 120-million people worldwide are officially unemployed and many more underemployed , causing massive personal suffering , widespread social disintegration and huge economic waste .  
The continued presence of Rwandan refugees in neighbouring countries has had a number of serious , closely linked consequences of several kinds : humanitarian ( suffering endured ) , economic ( depleted humanitarian assistance ) , political and strategic ( interests of States ) , ecological ( destruction of host States ' ecosystems ) and security ( military and paramilitary activities of former FAR and militia members , as well as border insecurity ) . 
However , recent outbreaks of cholera in Peru and a " plague scare " in India ( see box 4 ) have clearly demonstrated the human suffering and loss of life that may result from poor waste management and the disastrous effect that waste-related diseases may have on the trade and tourism vital for national economy .  
It follows that any sanctions should be part of the search for a long-term political settlement of the conflict , reflect the strategic goals of the entire international community , take account of the political and " physical " ( in terms of death and suffering among the civilian population and the destruction of material values ) cost of such actions .  
At the Workshop , which was held in the form of a free discussion , the participants agreed on the urgent need to protect those who were exposed to extreme suffering resulting from a lack of sufficient protection .  
As the Secretary-General pointed out in his annual report to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session , 1 preventive measures are highly cost-effective , as the sums they require are paltry by comparison with the huge costs in human suffering and material damage which war always brings , and they also compare favourably " with the less huge , but nevertheless substantial , cost of deploying a peacekeeping operation after hostilities have broken out " .  
Aware that involuntary , mass displacement , in addition to the human suffering involved , imposes significant economic and social burdens and may affect security and stability at the regional level ,  
He made it clear in his previous report to the General Assembly that those measures were beginning to have a real impact on the people in the towns , particularly the urban elite , and that they were adding to the suffering in rural areas , where people are often poor and where , owing to the violence and the civil war , regular access to , inter alia , health care , hygiene , various essential goods and primary and secondary education have become even more curtailed .  
Concerned about continuing deliberate and indiscriminate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers involved in Operation Lifeline Sudan and with international private voluntary agencies ,  
Over 120-million people worldwide are officially unemployed and many more underemployed , causing massive personal suffering , widespread social disintegration and huge economic waste .  
Expresses its deep concern at the intense suffering of the victims of genocide and crimes against humanity , recognizes the ongoing suffering of their survivors , particularly the extremely high number of traumatized children and women victims of rape and sexual violence , and urges the international community to provide adequate assistance to them and to note the priorities identified by the Government of Rwanda in this area ;  
While maintaining a war mentality in the vain hope of crushing the rebels in the field ( and thereby nullifying any attempt to begin the negotiations which Major Buyoya has himself advocated ) the Burundi de facto authorities are systematically resettling rural populations using an outdated strategy of forced villagization , whose weaknesses and the suffering entailed for the populations concerned have been demonstrated in other conflicts , particularly in Viet Nam . 
This concern has found expression at the meetings , seminars and study groups held in various parts of the world that have considered the grievous suffering caused by the sanctions and by the embargo and that have addressed urgent appeals to the United Nations and the international community as a whole for action to lift the sanctions imposed on the Iraqi people and to enable that people , through the use of its own resources and capacities , to secure the provision of its basic civilian needs . 
Expressing its grave concern at the enormous human suffering and material damage sustained by the Libyan Arab people and neighbouring peoples as a result of the maintenance of the coercive measures imposed on the Great Jamahiriya under Security Council resolutions 748 ( 1992 ) and 883 ( 1993 ) ,  
Regretting the human rights violations , both individual and collective , the marginalization and discrimination that the indigenous populations in Guatemala suffered and are suffering , together with the continued deterioration of the economic and social situation , with its serious consequences for the great majority of the population , particularly for the indigenous peoples of Guatemala and the most vulnerable sectors of Guatemalan society ,  
As a result of this initiative by Ethiopia , leaders of 26 Somali political organizations were able to meet for a high-level consultation in Sodere , Ethiopia , and after eight weeks of intensive , frank and responsible negotiations , agreed on a common course of action to resolve the crisis in their country and to put an end to the misery and suffering of their people .  
Urges all States to be guided in their national policies by the need to curb the testing , the production and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , or with indiscriminate effect , or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering ;  
Decides to authorize Ms . Ferero Ucros to prepare , without financial implications , a working paper , in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms , assessing the utility , scope and structure of a study on weapons of mass destruction or with indiscriminate effect , or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering .  
The international community is fully entitled to become impatient and even forgive the word exasperated , for it has devoted much of its energy and means to try to help this beautiful and potentially prosperous country , which has been torn by so much war and suffering .  
Attention is drawn to the definition of violence against women contained in article 1 of the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women ( General Assembly resolution 48 / 104 ) : [ A ] ny act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm and suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life .  
Notwithstanding these positive indications , the continent as a whole is still suffering from an increasing external debt burden , receding standards of living , low-level social services and health care for its citizens and a diminishing capability to compete and to attract foreign investments .  
They needed to be applied impartially , on the basis of specific criteria and a clear timetable , and only when there was a real threat to international peace and security .  The possibility of adopting smart sanctions , which would not affect innocent civilians or cause undue suffering , had been discussed .  
Prevention and preparedness strategies , based on scientific and technological applications as well as on social equity , and including the full involvement of civil society , must be put in place to protect national assets and property and especially to reduce human suffering , the loss of life , and the disruption of livelihoods .  
A matter of particular concern was that the unregulated use of sanctions had resulted in unnecessary suffering for innocent civilian populations ; sanctions should be imposed only as a last resort , and the proposals for ameliorating the plight of third States must be carefully studied .  
It is our view that we should seek every opportunity in every forum to address the issue of landmines , in the hope that by our concerted and combined efforts we will realize the ultimate humanitarian objective we all share : to bring an end to the dreadful suffering those mines wreak on their innocent victims .  
Deplores the immense human suffering and loss of life that have accompanied refugee flows and other forced displacements , in particular numerous serious threats to the security or well-being of refugees , refoulement , unlawful expulsion , physical attacks and detention under unacceptable conditions , and calls upon States to take all measures necessary to ensure respect for the principles of refugee protection , including the humane treatment of asylum-seekers in accordance with internationally recognized human rights and humanitarian norms ;  
The issue of human rights was of particular importance for Kuwait , because the entire population was suffering as a result of the delay by the Iraqi regime in freeing prisoners and detainees from Kuwait and elsewhere , as well as its uncooperative attitude at the meetings in Geneva of the Tripartite Commission and of its technical committee .  14 .  The human , social and psychological consequences of the Iraqi occupation continued to be felt .  
Deplores the immense human suffering and loss of life that have accompanied refugee flows and other forced displacements , in particular the numerous serious threats to the security or well-being of refugees , such as refoulement , unlawful expulsion , physical attacks and detention under unacceptable conditions , and calls upon States to take all measures necessary to ensure respect for the principles of refugee protection , including the humane treatment of asylum-seekers in accordance with internationally recognized human rights and humanitarian norms ;  
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by eighteen years of war , and underlining the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards a sustainable economic and social development , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a landlocked , least-developed and war-stricken country ,  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in the last few years , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , particularly those of developing countries ,  
In this respect , we stress the need to foster technical cooperation in this field on the broadest possible basis , both to develop economical , safe techniques for mine detection and removal and to provide access to such techniques by those requiring them , with a view to developing international cooperation to mitigate the suffering of those who have fallen victim to the random and indiscriminate use of such mines , and who must be rehabilitated and fully reintegrated into society .  
It follows that any sanctions should be part of the search for a long-term political settlement of the conflict , reflect the strategic goals of the entire international community , take account of the political and ' physical ' ( in terms of death and suffering among the civilian population and the destruction of material values ) cost of such actions .  
As the Secretary-General pointed out in his annual report to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session , 11 preventive measures are highly cost-effective , as the sums they require are paltry by comparison with the huge costs in human suffering and material damage which war always brings , and they also compare favourably ' with the less huge , but nevertheless substantial , cost of deploying a peacekeeping operation after hostilities have broken out ' .  
By building peace , reducing unsustainable military expenditures , promoting equitable and sustainable development and encouraging stable , democratic societies which respect human rights , we not only limit human suffering , but we also address the root causes of conflict itself .  
The world is currently passing through highly interwoven and complicated circumstances , where progress and its horizons mingle with backwardness and its dangers while humanity takes pride in such achievements as economic progress and the development of technology and informatics , it is still suffering from the practices of terrorism , drug trafficking , organized crime , the spread of corruption , the overflow of refugees , the challenges posed by war criminals , crimes of genocide and mass murder , and the negative effects of racism and religious discrimination . 
The Democratic Republic of the Congo is among the few countries that from time immemorial , owing to its geostrategic placement and its vast human and natural resources , has borne the burden of a sombre history of suffering and outrageous violations of human rights and the rights of peoples .  
They have also stressed that such sanctions should not be based merely on political expediency , but rather should be firmly based on international law ; that they should be implemented according to the principles of justice and international law ; that they should not serve individual or factional interests ; that in their implementation , consideration should be given to the human suffering that they cause ; and that a time limit should be set for their lifting .  
My country understands and agrees with the principles that motivate today \ x { e5b8 } action by the international community : prohibiting parties to a conflict from choosing from an unlimited range of ways and means of combat ; prohibiting the use of weapons and means of combat that cause excessive damage or unnecessary suffering ; and drawing the essential distinction between combatants and civilians not involved in the fighting .  
The use of conventional arms , often random and always indiscriminate , takes the sad credit for the death and suffering of thousands of innocent victims of local and regional conflicts .  
This situation calls for urgent legal and humanitarian measures to establish a comprehensive global legal system banning all kinds of anti-personnel mines and to allay the pain and suffering caused to innocent civilians by the mines , which impede the social and economic activities of these peoples .  
Egypt is aware of the magnitude and severity of the problems related to the proliferation of anti _ personnel landmines , which is above all a humanitarian issue given the suffering they inflict on civilian populations , the heavy financial burden and the limited nature of the technology used in the detection and deactivation of these mines . 
Torture is defined in the latter Declaration as any act by which severe pain or suffering , whether physical or mental , is intentionally inflicted by or at the instigation of a public official on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or confession , punishing him for an act he has committed or is suspected of having committed , or intimidating him or other persons .  
Having had the privilege of meeting with a wide variety of brilliant people in Turkey and having seen the horrendous pain and needless suffering stemming from the tragedy that terrorism today imposes on this country of limitless potential , the Special Rapporteur is convinced that the safeguarding of the right to freedom of opinion and expression by the Government and the support for such a policy by society as a whole have the potential to become the foundation for the building of a peaceful , prosperous and just future for Turkey . 
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by seventeen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a landlocked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
That included all violent acts against female victims that resulted in , or could result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , as well as threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivations of liberty , whether occurring in public or private life .  
The overall objective of the programme emergency humanitarian assistance , derived from these General Assembly resolutions , is " to ensure better preparation for , as well as a rapid and coherent response to , emergencies , natural and man-made , thus reducing the suffering and loss of human lives and material destruction ; promoting prevention and preparedness ; and ensuring smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation and development " . b  
Foreign aggression , ethnic conflicts , and massive human rights abuses continued to threaten the territorial integrity of newly independent States in the region leading to enormous suffering and grief .  
In 1996 , a number of African countries encountered special development situations with the collapse of public and social services , disruption of economic activities , insecurity and armed conflict , the breakdown of law and order , massive population displacement and widespread human suffering .  
The objectives will be met by providing support to the mechanisms for humanitarian coordination , emergency response and inter-agency collaboration at Headquarters and in the field through the Emergency Relief Coordinator , the Inter-Agency Standing Committee and the United Nations humanitarian or resident coordinators in order to facilitate a coordinated and coherent approach to major complex emergencies affecting large numbers of people suffering from famine , displacement and human deprivation as a result of civil strife or other conflict-driven situations .  
These facts have not been enough to persuade the representative of the United States of America to desist from using irresponsible methods to prevent thousands of sick children , older persons and women from obtaining the medicines they need to alleviate the suffering brought on by the diseases they have contracted as a result of the maintenance of the unjust embargo against Iraq , which has taken on a political and biased character and which has the goal of undermining the national political regime in Iraq .  
These facts have not been enough to persuade the representative of the United States of America to desist from using irresponsible methods to prevent thousands of sick children , older persons and women from obtaining the drugs they need to alleviate the suffering brought on by the diseases they have contracted as a result of the maintenance of the unjust embargo against Iraq , which has taken on a political and biased character and which has the goal of undermining the national political regime in Iraq . 
The occupation of East Timor , systematically condemned by the relevant bodies of the United Nations , makes abusive and illegitimate any and all attempts to appropriate the genuine collective will of the Timorense People that does not pass through a free process of self-determination , approved by the relevant mechanisms and organs of the United Nations . The Secretary-General has been following with concern reports of recent violent incidents in East Timor which have resulted in loss of life and are causing considerable human suffering .  
However , illegal weapons do not have that protection , and their war-time use easily meets the rest of the definition of torture : their use causes severe pain and suffering , both physical and mental ; their use is intentional ; they are used to unduly coerce the enemy or the civilian population into surrender , submission or other state favourable to the user of the weapons ; and their use is under the direct order of public officials .  
Deeply concerned by the numerous reports from a large number of reliable sources attesting that , regardless of human dignity , armed groups of religious extremists , who act in flagrant violation of the principles of tolerance of Islam , are terrorising civilian populations in order to force them to support their cause , by resorting , inter alia , to summary executions , the cruelty of which adds futile suffering to the fate of innocent victims of decapitation or throat cutting , including old people , women and children ,  
The agreements reached by Committee members to set up a subregional early warning mechanism , to control the illicit trade in arms and drugs , to retrain demobilized troops for civilian life and to enhance the capacity of Central African States to participate more effectively in future peace missions in the area would , if implemented , contribute significantly to continuing efforts to end the scourge of violence , destruction and suffering in the subregion . 
Decides to authorize the inclusion of this question in the preliminary document concerning a study in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms , on weapons of mass destruction or with indiscriminate effect , or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering , to be submitted to the Sub _ Commission at its fiftieth session .  
However , the increased international attention to , and importance of , transparency of transfers and possession of conventional arms are justified by the fact that these conventional arms cause serious human suffering in international and internal conflicts and are not subject to legal regimes in many parts of the world .  
Some countries were still suffering from the negative impact of structural adjustment programmes , particularly with regard to health and educational infrastructure and services , which necessitated strengthening of international cooperation based on the adoption and implementation of concrete measures aimed at mitigating and completely eliminating their adverse impact .  
The United Nations and the League of Arab States expressed their concern over the continuing problem of landmines and other unexploded devices that are causing serious human suffering and which have negative social and economic effects on mine-infested countries over an extended period .  
Those suffering the most are the civilian population of the occupied territories , whose standard of living has been eroded steadily as a result of the very serious economic and social situation .  
Iraq is a developing country that is suffering greatly as a result of the coercive economic policies and measures exemplified in the complete economic embargo imposed on it more than seven years ago that affect the health of the Iraqi people and every aspect of its economic , social and cultural life .  
These unresolved conflicts undermine the political , economic and social fabric of the States concerned , bringing destruction and untold human suffering to the victims of war .  
Their ultimate sacrifice reminds us that human beings are capable of great altruism in the face of suffering and of calm when faced with the destructive passion of armed conflict , even at the risk of their own lives .  
The fighting is again causing enormous suffering for the Afghan people and adds to their misery , while human rights , fundamental freedoms and international humanitarian law continue to be violated with impunity .  
These measures , which were very hastily decided upon on 31 July 1996 , are unlimited with regard to their objective and duration and are illegal and unfair , added a series of misfortunes and suffering to the already pitiable drama caused by the civil conflict .  
Gravely concerned that the continuation of armed conflicts in the continent threatens regional peace , causes massive human displacement , suffering and poverty , perpetuates instability and diverts scarce resources from long-term development ,  
Gravely concerned that the continuation of armed conflicts in the continent threatens regional peace , causes massive human displacement , suffering and poverty , perpetuates instability and diverts scarce resources from long-term development ,  
They were guided not only by legal terminology and the compromises of diplomatic conferences ; before their very eyes was irrefutable proof of unprecedented of human suffering .  
Good governance , which is an important prerequisite for sustained socio-economic development , is undermined through lost economic productivity , the destruction of physical and social infrastructure , refugees , environmental degradation and human suffering .  
He said that the current economic outlook for Africa was not encouraging , as the region was suffering from the effects of the international financial crisis , reduced export demand and falling commodity prices .  
Expressing its grave concern about the continuation of the military confrontation in Afghanistan , threatening regional peace and security and causing massive loss of life and extensive human suffering , further destruction of property , serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure , refugee flows and other forcible displacements of large numbers of people ,  
Of equal concern to the international community is the growing threat faced by humanitarian workers , who risk their personal safety for the noble purpose of alleviating suffering and hardship .  
Canada has always distinguished itself by an honourable , consistent and outstanding involvement in United Nations efforts to achieve international peace and security , in particular by its humanitarian devotion to alleviating the suffering of civilian populations in armed conflicts .  
The intensification of armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the increasingly ethnic and religious nature of the conflict , which have resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement , and which hinder the return of the internally displaced to their homes ;  
It was , therefore , discouraging to note that , in addition to suffering from long-standing problems , such as declining commodity prices and worsening terms of trade , the developing countries were also having to face new problems as a result of developments in the world economy , current international economic problems and even natural phenomena , the direct and indirect effects of which had exacerbated their problems . 
The Special Rapporteur observes that the human tragedy of this unresolved matter is enormous , both in terms of any remaining detainees who are no doubt suffering untold emotional anguish and possibly enduring physical hardship , and in terms of the families of the missing persons who are suffering severe mental distress because they are without knowledge of the whereabouts and condition of their loved ones .  
As a neighbouring country which had suffered a similar experience of population displacements and economic calamity , Cyprus understood the importance of alleviating suffering and creating proper conditions for social and economic development , and it was keenly aware of the permanent and inalienable right of people to return to their homes and recover their property .  
imperative to maintain and enhance humanitarian assistance not only to meet basic human needs and thus to uphold the right to life of millions of suffering Afghans , but also to provide incentives for ending or significantly relaxing the existing restrictions which were violative of human rights . 
Iraq , in particular , is suffering from the effects of a disease that is incurring large-scale economic costs in terms of the quantities of red meat and dairy products lost , thereby exacerbating the suffering of many Iraqis already undernourished owing to the maintenance of the unjust embargo imposed on the country .  
All major gynaecological centres in the country report an increase in the number of pregnant women suffering from threatened abortion , premature deliveries , slow foetal growth , higher Caesarean section incidence , etc .  
Encourages the continuing efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reduce the prison population by releasing minors , elderly prisoners , prisoners suffering from terminal illnesses and suspects with incomplete files who were detained for their alleged involvement in genocide and other abuses of human rights , and reaffirms the urgent need to complete a dossier for every detainee with a view to identifying those who should be released immediately , early or conditionally ;  
At the end of his testimony , each man requested that compensation be paid for the consequent material damage and mental suffering , as did all those others who attended the sessions of the Chamber in order to pursue civil claims .  
The persisting armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering , forced displacement , including on the grounds of ethnicity , and which hinder the return of the internally displaced to their homes ;  
Encourages the continuing efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reduce the prison population by releasing minors , elderly prisoners , prisoners suffering from terminal illnesses and suspects with incomplete files who were detained for their alleged involvement in genocide and other abuses of human rights , and reaffirms the urgent need to complete a dossier for every detainee with a view to identifying those who should be released immediately , early or conditionally ;  
Despite having adopted outward looking strategies and liberal market oriented policies for integration in the global economy , many of them are suffering economic setbacks as a result of the continuing turmoil in financial and currency markets .  
As reflected in the aforementioned resolutions , from the outset , the Security Council gave early recognition to the suffering of the Iraqi civilians under a very rigorous sanctions regime and , concerned with the serious nutritional and health situation of the Iraqi civilian population , laid down the foundation for establishing a humanitarian programme .  
It observes with the deepest concern that guerrilla activities continue to be directed against civilians ( in particular the totally unacceptable practice of hostage _ taking under the threat of death among nationals or foreigners who are neither personally involved in nor responsible for the conflict or its conduct ) and attacks on infrastructure , including the bombing of pipelines , which have caused numerous deaths , great suffering amongst the civilian population and grave destruction .  
We appeal to the members of NATO to think before it is too late and to immediately halt their military action which has already brought such untold suffering to hundreds of thousands of people , created a humanitarian catastrophe and thrown Europe backwards into the distant past .  
Thus , the international community , especially the United Nations , must step up its activities to end the humanitarian suffering of the victims of the situation and of those States that have sheltered a large number of refugees and displaced persons , thereby assuming a significant additional material and logistical burden .  
In its resolution 1997 / 36 , of 28 August 1997 , the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities authorized Ms . Clemencia Forero Ucros to prepare a working paper , in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms , assessing the utility , scope and structure of a study on weapons of mass destruction or with indiscriminate effect , or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering , for submission to the Sub _ Commission at its fiftieth session .  
The crisis in Kosovo has resulted in the mass forced displacement and deportation of hundreds of thousands of civilians , wholesale destruction of property and means of livelihood , wanton lawlessness and violence , thousands of documented killings , countless as-yet undocumented deaths , and immeasurable human suffering .  
The Committee made an important point by emphasizing that in considering sanctions , it is essential to distinguish between the basic objective of applying political and economic pressure upon the governing lite of the country to persuade them to conform to international law , and the collateral infliction of suffering upon the most vulnerable groups within the targeted country .  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems . 72 bis .  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems .  
It had been urged that it was imperative to maintain and enhance humanitarian assistance not only to meet basic human needs and thus to uphold the right to life of millions of suffering Afghans , but also to provide incentives for ending or significantly relaxing the existing restrictions which were violative of human rights .  
That the proposed Decade was both a moral imperative and an opportunity for the world community , in a spirit of global cooperation , to use existing scientific and technical knowledge to alleviate human suffering and enhance economic security ;  
This cooperation is not confined to official endeavours undertaken by the Kuwaiti Government ; the State is also encouraging national institutions and individuals to provide aid and assistance to those in need thereof in other countries , regardless of the origin or cause of that need which might be attributable to poverty , natural disasters , human conflicts or other causes of human suffering which the State of Kuwait is endeavouring to combat and alleviate .  
The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that while the international community is directing its efforts towards resolving tensions and the further promotion and expansion of commercial relations at global level , the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba has caused the Cuban people serious suffering and also created difficulties in global commercial and financial relations .  
The objectives of the joint action are : ( a ) to combat and contribute to ending the destabilizing accumulation and spread of small arms and light weapons ; ( b ) to contribute to the reduction of existing accumulations of these weapons to levels consistent with the legitimate security needs of countries ; and ( c ) to help those regions suffering from the problems associated with excessive accumulation and spread of small arms to tackle them .  
Such action is needed in order to enhance international and regional security ; reduce the risk of armed conflict , political violence , terrorism and violent crime ; combat and suppress the illicit trafficking in small arms ; promote sustainable peace settlements and good governance ; and , above all , stop human suffering . 
" The Security Council expresses its deep concern at the deteriorating political , military and humanitarian situation in Angola , at the suffering of the people and at the dramatic increase in the number of internally displaced persons , which has now reached well over two-million people , not including the unknown number of internally displaced persons in areas which are currently inaccessible to humanitarian agencies .  
He was held responsible for 11 counts of murder , torture , rape , causing great suffering or serious injury and inhumane acts and a number of concurrent sentences were imposed by the Trial Chamber , the maximum being 20 years ' imprisonment for murder and wilful killing .  
Subsequent to two amendments , the indictment includes some 37 counts pertaining to alleged crimes of , inter alia , persecution on political , racial and religious grounds , unlawful deportation and transfer , murder , wilful killing , torture , rape , inhumane acts , cruel treatment and wilfully causing great suffering .  
We are confident that with disinterested assistance by the international community the Government of Indonesia will be able to bring the situation under control through tangible efforts including control of the armed elements , maintenance of security and extension of humanitarian assistance to alleviate the suffering of the refugees and the disadvantaged civilians with the help of the International Red Cross .  
It again expressed regret that the Iraqi regime was continuing to defy resolutions that had the force of international law and to reject the initiatives taken and proposals made at the inter-Arab and international levels for the creation of an effective mechanism and a workable procedure , within the framework of the United Nations , for the lifting of the international economic embargo being maintained against Iraq and for ending the suffering of the Iraqi people .  
OCHA is mandated to mobilize and coordinate the collective efforts of the international community , in particular those of the United Nations system , to meet in a coherent and timely manner the needs of those exposed to human suffering and material destruction in disasters and emergencies .  
While we recognize the difficulty of achieving smart sanctions in the real world , we also believe that there is a continuing need to minimize collateral , unintended humanitarian suffering through the imposition of more specifically targeted sanctions and mechanisms for periodic substantive reviews .  
We also join the call to move away from double standards in the field of human rights , and we believe that the same attention should be devoted to those situations , wherever they may arise , that involve a loss of civilian life in armed conflict or which are a source of untold suffering , without allowing the political considerations of Council members , and especially of the permanent ones , to prevail over the collective considerations of the Council and of the United Nations as a whole .  
The consequences are plain : lives that could have been saved are lost ; suffering that could have been lessened is left to follow its course .  105 .  What is " reasonable and doable " is far from being a question of money alone .  
Nevertheless , in spite of the picture of suffering and contrasts which the continent presents to the world ; in spite of the upheavals that wrack its civil societies ; and in spite of all the difficulties draining its capacity to steer its own way through a troublesome environment , Africa has taken the costly and demanding road of renewal that is so necessary if it is to assume control of its own destiny and to achieve a balanced world situation in the future .  
While we recognize the difficulty in the real world of achieving smart sanctions , we believe that there is a recurring need to minimize the collateral though unintended human suffering , through the imposition of more specifically targeted sanctions and periodic review mechanisms .  
My Government makes a solemn and emotional appeal to the entire international community in general , and to the Security Council in particular , inviting them to become fully involved in the immediate implementation of the Lusaka Agreement so as to put an end to the untold suffering of my people .  
Human-centred development , the concept outlined at Copenhagen , would enable the poor to enjoy basic political and economic freedoms while focusing on practical and effective ways of alleviating their suffering .  
The intensification of armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including its ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement , including on the ground of ethnicity ;  
After a further massive loss of human lives , increased suffering of the civilian population and immense physical destruction , the two sides found themselves roughly at the same positions they held in late 1998 .  
There are also seven institutions for the intellectual development of mentally retarded persons , as well as two schools run by charitable associations , which admit children suffering from slight to moderate mental retardation and , after their readaptation , provide them with education in accordance with the syllabuses of the Ministry of Education in a manner consistent with their abilities .  
This political confrontation has effectively pitted local communities against each other , and as a consequence the indigenous population has paid a heavy price in terms of human suffering and remains under the constant threat of renewed violence .  
Noting with concern the resulting exacerbation of the enormous suffering of the Afghan people , resulting in the massive loss of human life , summary executions , the deliberate abuse and arbitrary detention of civilians , refugee flows , the use of child soldiers , harassment , the forcible displacement of innocent civilians and extensive destruction ,  
Expressing its grave concern about the continuation of the military confrontation in Afghanistan , threatening regional peace and security and causing massive loss of life and extensive human suffering , further destruction of property , serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure , refugee flows and other forcible displacements of large numbers of people ,  
The intensification of armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including its ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement , including on the grounds of ethnicity ;  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies in the last few years , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , in particular of civilians , the suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , in particular those of developing countries ,  
For instance , there may be concomitantly higher levels of street and ( low visibility ) intra-familial violence , large proportions of the population that are severely disadvantaged and young ( that is , in the age groups perpetrating and suffering crime ) , rapid migration into urban areas , lack of trust in law enforcement , inefficient justice systems , corruption , limited good governance and severe competition for scarce resources .  
Article 40 of the Military Service Act provides that any person who fails to present himself for the military service medical examination to determine his physical fitness and ascertain whether he is suffering from any contagious disease or disability that would preclude his enlistment for military service is liable to a fine ranging from 30 to 100 dinars .  
The Permanent Mission of Kuwait also informed the Secretary-General that ( i ) n the few cases in which objection is expressed to compulsory military service , most of the persons concerned are found to be suffering from psychological and nervous disorders and such cases are exempted from military service .  
The failure of the international community to prevent such massive suffering in the half century since the trials in Tokyo and Nuremberg makes tragically clear the urgency of developing comprehensive measures for combating impunity as well as strong and effective early-warning and conflict-prevention measures to prevent genocide .  
Humanitarian agencies fear increased suffering of the most vulnerable , particularly refugees , internationally displaced persons , the disabled , children , the chronically ill , urban elderly and social cases .  
Taking the opportunity offered by Articles 10 and 11 of the Charter , my delegation would also like to make all the Members of our universal Organization aware of the genuine motives behind the armed aggression that the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its peace-loving people are suffering and to ask them to contribute to the establishment of a peaceful and lasting solution to the conflict that is currently tearing my country apart .  
The continuing sanctions and embargo imposed by the United States Government have posed great difficulties for the Cuban people in their endeavour to achieve economic and social development and reform , thus seriously constraining the Cuban Governments efforts to eradicate poverty and enhance its peoples living standards.Cuban women and children have borne the brunt of the suffering , especially in terms of their health and welfare . 
These included reduction of the infant mortality and under-five child mortality by one third and of maternal mortality by half , cutting down by 50 per cent the number of children under five suffering from malnutrition , enabling every child to attend primary school , immunizing 90 percent of the worlds infants and protecting children in especially difficult circumstances , particularly in situations of armed conflict .  
This fact has always prompted us to restate the principle of full respect for the delicate balance between the major organs of the international Organization as set out in the Charter , in particular the inherent role of the General Assembly in considering principles of cooperation aimed at relieving human suffering , including addressing the causes of conflict and the strengthening of lasting peace and sustainable development .  
The unfortunate consequences of deterioration in the economic environment , particularly in connection with the global financial crisis , brought , in some cases , a reversal of social gains , while there was an increase in human suffering and deprivation.In the affected countries , the impact of economic adversity was felt at all levels of society , but the poorest segments carry a disproportionate burden .  
The purpose of the 1991 revised criteria for least developed country status was to designate those low-income countries that were suffering from a low level of human resources and from structural weaknesses , specifically as reflected in a low degree of economic diversification .

When animal protection has to be implemented in specific legal regulations the assistance of scientific research is usually required , so that concepts such as cruelty and pain are no longer vague or left to the kind of subjective judgements to which Zhuangzi retorted " I am not a fish-how can I know a fish 's suffering ? " Science also allows appropriate protective rules to be drafted according to the specific needs of different animals .  
" With this behavioral outlet , people do n't consider the more important question of improvement . " Yeh says that the stray dogs " set free " onto Taiwan 's streets are symptomatic of people 's ingrained reluctance to face up to the real suffering of living things .  
Across the broken outer wall of the Puli Distillery , someone painted in crooked and irregular letters : " What does n't kill you , makes you stronger ! " People were n't surrendering in the face of disaster . What 's more , there was a growing sense of compassion , of concern for the suffering of others . A true civil society must not be far off .  
Misery and suffering left in the wake of the 21 September Chichi earthquake are still apparent over a wide area , but rebuilding continues non-stop , and appraisal of damage to buildings in the disaster areas has been completed . The government has been busy distributing financial help and contributions sent by sympathetic onlookers , and temporary housing for 4,500 families will be completed by the middle of November . These are just the first steps in post-disaster relief efforts however ; full-scale recovery still has a long way to go .  
In the early years of ROC rule in Taiwan , the government sent political prisoners to Green Island . Those inmates lucky enough to survive that era of oppression and return to their normal lives , as well as family members of prisoners and other citizens concerned about human rights , joined together to create the foundation . So that the suffering of that period would not be forgotten , they raised money to establish this memorial , which bears witness to the government 's past mistakes and the pain of those who suffered under its oppression .  
According to art academic Chiang Hsun , Impressionism , from which sorrow and suffering and even seriousness all seem to be absent , was a product of the first generation to enjoy the fruits of urban life following the industrial revolution . The painter Renoir was particularly fond of showing nudes posed amid nature , depicted with caressing strokes of the brush .  
If we compare him to other Nativist writers who address the tragedy of the rural elderly unable to adapt to the modern industrial world , we note that Huang is reluctant to expose his elderly characters to unmitigated suffering .  
He explains : " From both the psychiatric literature and clinical experience , doctors discovered that there 's a peculiar phenomenon with people suffering psychological disorders . Once they 're in hospital , the disorders can be controlled quite well , but when they return home , not long thereafter the symptoms re-emerge . " Doctors thus became curious about the family backgrounds of their patients , and social workers were sent to investigate . The result has been the discovery of many dysfunctional families .  
Also , in the future , whole historic settlements or streets can be considered monuments to be preserved . Finally , a law governing control and treatment of rare diseases , will allow importation of appropriate medications , treatments , and essential life-saving nutritional supplements for those suffering from tens of unusual ailments .  
" National sovereignty " is reflected in a country 's ability to engage in diplomatic relations , but in this most critical area for national survival , Taiwan has long been suffering from PRC efforts to undercut Taiwan 's international status . Indeed , as Levi C . Ying , an overseas Chinese legislator from the New Party , says , mainland China is the only real obstacle and enemy to Taiwan 's foreign relations .  
In Christian culture the mother is a sacred figure , symbolizing purity , charity , and tolerance . In traditional Chinese culture , by contrast , mothers not only were supposed to have certain moral virtues , but were also bearers of heavy burdens of pain and suffering . A mother was fated to cry endless tears and submit to countless indignities .  
Calligraphy certainly does have the ability to cure disease . Once suffering from a hyperactive thyroid due to the pressures of a fast-paced life , Lin Jui-yao was diagnosed by his doctor as needing to take medicine for the long term . But he abandoned drugs completely , practicing calligraphy eight hours daily and immersing himself in his inner world . His endocrine system gradually became balanced and he was healed .  
Liao Ching-pi , an associate professor of social work at Soochow University and director of the Yoyuen Social Work Foundation , holds strongly to the newer view . Studies done overseas , says Liao , " show that affairs are most likely to happen with men who are unsuccessful in their careers , suffering from sexual dysfunction , or faced with problems in their family or personal relationships that they ca n't handle . "  
According to the data , aside from persons suffering from chronic liver , lung and kidney diseases and the old and infirm , those who exhibit the most severe symptoms are adults aged 20 to 50 . Conversely , children whose immune system has not yet fully developed are able to escape this scourge . This provides evidence for the inference that it is the reaction of the immune system and not the SARS virus itself that kills a person .  
In March 2003 the Chinese edition of Scientific American magazine published an article entitled " Suicide : Why Do They Do It ? , " which pointed out that research by American scientists has shown that a type of neurotransmitter in the brain-serotonin-is related to emotional stability in humans , and that people suffering from depression who exhibit aggressive behavior , as well as people with compulsive and obsessive personalities , have lower levels of serotonin than normal people .  
Cheng points out that although such ideas have a contagious element about them , people who are mentally healthy or who have a strong " psychological immunity " will not easily be " infected " by suicide reports . But people who are themselves suffering from severe depression or who have suffered a serious setback in life , are more likely to be contaminated by an unhealthy suicidal frame of mind and to be unable to free themselves from it .  
This typhoon caused the people of Taoyuan a great deal of pain and suffering as they were forced to go without water for many days . Industrial losses are estimated at NT $ 10 billion . Heads of agencies at the local and central government level are exhausted by their efforts . The chairman and the CEO of Taiwan Water Corporation stepped down , and there was a strong reaction among the corporation 's employees .

To the infinite regret and dismay of the whole international community , we have continued to witness the outbreak of a great number of ethnic and national conflicts , accompanied by the untold suffering of innocent people .  
Administered in accordance with the state of medical art they are indispensable , but if they are abused they can lead to enormous human suffering , loss of social status and disastrous economic consequences .  
The ongoing fighting and bitter hostilities in Bosnia and Herzegovina pose a serious threat to international peace and security , causing immense and unacceptable human suffering .  
The flagrant disregard for basic human rights and international humanitarian law is continuing to expand the range of human suffering , often placing fragile political and social structures in neighbouring regions and countries under unbearable pressure .  
The changed pattern of adult morbidity is reflected in the increased number of patients suffering from noncontagious mass chronic diseases but also in the renewed incidence of contagious diseases .  
Such determined arguments in the face of widespread and increasing suffering are clearly reprehensible and underlie a gross violation of the fundamental human rights of millions of innocent persons .  
But as ethnic conflicts spread and political solutions become more elusive , there is a risk that humanitarian operations could become prolonged , draining limited resources and causing untold suffering .  
The Executive Committee expressed its deep concern and preoccupation with the immense human suffering and loss of life in recent crises and the scale and complexity of current refugee problems , and deplored the incidence of armed attack and of murder , rape and other violations of fundamental rights , as well as refoulement and denial of access to safety .  
We know how difficult was the road leading to the establishment of lasting peace in view of the level of distrust and the acute , accumulated suffering involved .  
I ask the Secretary-General of the United Nations whether he is obliged to defend the moral principles in the United Nations Charter or whether he should console the dying and the bereaved by saying that there are others elsewhere who are suffering worse fates .  Is there not , in the context of the larger picture , a special role for the United Nations to provide international leadership ?  
The tragedy of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina , which is suffering the consequences of Belgrade 's ambition to create a Greater Serbia inspired by the philosophy of national chauvinism , the policy of ethnic cleansing and the forceful changing of borders lies at the centre of the present-day Balkan crisis , concentrated in the former Yugoslavia . 
The point is that , in such cases , there should be a minimum level of safeguards , through the application of a set of agreed , uniform rules and procedures , in order for the imposing and lifting of sanctions to take place in a manner that strikes a balance between , on the one hand , the interests of the international community and , on the other , the extent of the human suffering endured by peoples on whom the sanctions are imposed .  
Nonetheless , we are extremely pleased to underscore the admirable example offered to us by the South Africans who , moving beyond racial or cultural motivations , in a long and heroic effort that has caused so much suffering , have put an end to the most odious form of discrimination apartheid .  
The need to stabilize the political situation in that country is strictly linked to the future prospects of the ongoing political stabilization in neighbouring Rwanda , where mankind has recently witnessed horrible crimes and the untold suffering of innocent civilians . 
Despite the end of the cold war , which has lessened the probability of nuclear conflict , the Earth continues to be an arena of murderous conflicts that cause unspeakable suffering and vast humanitarian tragedies .  
We have clearly stated , on previous occasions , that the deteriorating economies of the developing countries and the widening gap between the rich and poor countries are the two principal causes of the proliferation of hotbeds of tension and bloody wars that , more often than not , wipe out every economic achievement , plunge the peoples of developing countries into cruel suffering and deprive them of the right to lead a decent life of security , stability , and development towards a better future . 
Regrettably , this great historic victory was attained at a high price : the heavy of loss of human lives , incredible suffering , unprecedented material losses .  
The terrible images of the Second World War , of horrible combats , of massive destruction , of endless suffering inflicted on innocent civilians and on combatants , remind us of the kind of events and dangers that brought the representatives of 51 allied countries to San Francisco to sign , on 26 June 1945 , the Charter that established the United Nations .  
Notwithstanding the impressive achievements of the human race we are forced to live at the same time with unspeakable suffering that mocks all material and spiritual progress in which we might feel some pride as we approach the new century .  
The tragic human suffering and the terrible material destruction brought about by more than 20 years of conflict also require that the international community following the round table on Angola being held in Brussels under the auspices of the United Nations Development Programme continues to respond generously to the humanitarian aid needs and the challenge of reconstructing the country , particularly in the areas of demining and the social reintegration of the displaced and the demobilized . 
We see with great concern how ethnic , geographical and utopian myths and revisionisms are becoming a boundless source of suffering for millions of men and women in our time , gravely disturbing fragile international balances .  
The challenge the international community now faces is threefold : to ensure that recent positive developments do not founder for lack of economic and political support , to nurture progress on the other bilateral tracks of negotiations to match that achieved between Israel and the PLO and to prevent acts of violence and terrorism by extremist groups that seek to endanger the peace process and threaten to drive the Middle East back into conflict and suffering .  
However , we have been helpless witnesses to unacceptable suffering , to shameful operations of so-called ethnic cleansing and to crimes against humanity , which the international community was unable to prevent and before which it remained passive .  
In addition , the European Union adopted , on 18 September , a common position with the aim of fostering the adoption of a new protocol on blinding lasers , which satisfies the humanitarian concern to avoid unnecessary suffering without limiting the legitimate military use of lasers .  
The European Union takes note of the progress made during the first part of the Review Conference , held in Vienna from 25 September to 13 October , with the adoption of a new Protocol IV on blinding laser weapons , which responds to humanitarian concerns to avoid unnecessary suffering without limiting the legitimate military use of lasers .  
So I ask Member States , when they hear us speaking out about the perils of radiation , to think about these in terms of human suffering and to try to visualize Marshallese children being born faceless , with no bones , or with missing or extra limbs the jellyfish babies , as some have come to call them and the irreparable damage wreaked upon the reproductive health of their mothers .  
To include within programme activities in 1994 and 1995 national case-studies of experience in the formulation and implementation of comprehensive social policies , especially in countries suffering from severe economic , political , cultural and environmental pressures , and to ensure the wide dissemination of the results of such studies ;  
He wished to draw attention to the suffering caused to the Libyan people by the unjust imposition of the sanctions , which had endangered many innocent lives , particularly those of the most vulnerable members of society , in blatant violation of human rights guaranteed under international human rights instruments .  
Countries should take urgent measures to avert the ongoing rapid environmental and economic degradation in developing countries that generally affects the lives of women and children in rural areas suffering drought , desertification and deforestation , armed hostilities , natural disasters , toxic waste and the aftermath of the use of unsuitable agro-chemical products .  
But if there is not strict and sacred adherence to them , we shall lose from sight the minimum flexibility that is indispensable to saving or protecting lives , particularly of civilians or of those who generously expose themselves to danger so that our Organization can accomplish its mission or so that humanitarian assistance can be given to those who are suffering the consequences of war .  
Recognizing that the grave suffering of the great majority of human beings who live in conditions of poverty demands the immediate attention of the international community and the adoption of concrete actions and measures towards the eradication of poverty within the framework of relevant forthcoming United Nations conferences , particularly the World Summit for Social Development , and within the context of the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty ,  
This important event is a worthy culmination of Mozambique 's progress along the difficult road to peace and consent and has marked the end of a lengthy period of destructive internecine conflict that brought untold suffering to the people of that country .  
Expressing deep concern at the immense human suffering and loss of life which have accompanied recent crises involving refugee flows and other forced displacements , as well as the magnitude and complexity of current refugee problems , which have made more difficult the accomplishment of the High Commissioner 's crucial functions of ensuring international protection for refugees and achieving timely and durable solutions to their plight ,  
Deeply concerned also about the serious consequences of the presence of refugees and externally displaced persons for the already difficult economic and social situation in Djibouti , which is suffering from prolonged drought and the negative effects of the critical situation in the Horn of Africa ,  
Persons of all categories and walks of life and all ages - peasant farmers executives and militant members of political parties , government agents , medical and paramedical personnel , and lay and religious persons - were killed in atrocious ways in the bloodthirsty madness which caused the people of Burundi enormous suffering and which can not in any way be justified . 
These confidence-building measures , which could lead to an informal suspension of offensive military operations , would constitute a demonstration of good will aimed at alleviating the suffering of the civilian population in areas affected by the armed confrontation , protecting human rights and facilitating the work of MINUGUA as well as all national entities devoted to the protection and promotion of human rights . 
With regard to military operations , until such time as a cease-fire is agreed to and takes effect , URNG insists on the commitment to respect the provisions of the comprehensive agreement on human rights intended to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population , protect human rights and facilitate the work of MINUGUA and of all national bodies devoted to the protection and promotion of human rights and the rights deriving from international humanitarian law .  
To include within programme activities in 1994 and 1995 national case-studies of experience in the formulation and implementation of comprehensive social policies , especially in countries suffering from severe economic , political , cultural and environmental pressures , and to ensure the wide dissemination of the results of such studies ;  
The extraordinary ferocity of the war , the physical devastation , the deliberate massacre of civilians and the wanton indifference to human suffering have continued unabated for three years now .  
The objective of the subprogramme is to support the mechanisms for operational coordination and inter-agency programming through IASC , other forums and the United Nations resident coordinators in the field in order to facilitate a coordinated and coherent response to major complex emergencies affecting large numbers of persons suffering from famine or displaced by civil strife or other disorders .  
The adoption of General Assembly resolution 49 / 139 B , in the light of the growing demands for manpower and funds to mitigate the suffering and destruction caused by numerous emergencies , represents an innovative opportunity for the effective , efficient and economical provision of assistance to the intended beneficiaries of the United Nations system 's operations , tapping existing but as yet unstructured and therefore unrealized sources of volunteer expertise .  
Consequently , in the Agreement , URNG undertook " to respect the inherent attributes of the human person and to contribute to the effective enjoyment of human rights " and , like the Government , it recognized the need to end the suffering of the civilian population and to respect the human rights of wounded , captured and disabled combatants . 
During the period covered by this report , the Mission verified complaints of alleged violations by both parties of the commitment to respect the human rights of wounded , captured and disabled combatants , as well as to end the suffering of the civilian population .  
The Mission believes that URNG has committed human rights violations and has failed to observe the commitment to end the suffering of the civilian population , by making threats and taking action against civilian property for the purpose of collecting the " war tax " ; by unnecessarily endangering civilians not involved in the conflict during attacks on military bases and units ; by laying mines or explosive devices in places where civilians work , live or circulate ; and by taking reprisals . 
There is no doubt , as we indicated in our previous letter , that the Iraqi regime is unaware of the scale of the human suffering caused by the illegal imprisonment of the Kuwaiti and other prisoners because that regime is itself responsible for the suffering of its own people , about which it is totally unconcerned , as is proved by the following facts :  
The increased importance of transparency in the transfer and possession of conventional arms and the growing international interest in such transparency are justified by the fact that such weapons are virtually untouched by existing legislation and can cause serious human suffering .  
In paragraph 12 ( g ) , making economic growth and the interaction of market forces more conducive to social development requires " ensuring substantial public and private investment in human resource development and in capacity-building in health and education , as well as in empowerment and participation , especially for people living in poverty or suffering from social exclusion " .  
Thus , while we fully share the pain and suffering experienced by the peoples of both Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia because of the wars raging in their countries , we have at the same time maintained a balanced position vis - - vis the conflicts in those countries .  We have joined in the condemnation of all violations of international humanitarian law committed in these conflicts irrespective of who may have committed them .  
The report also noted that URNG had committed human rights violations and had failed to observe the commitment to end the suffering of the civilian population by making threats and taking action against civilian property for the purpose of collecting " war tax " ; by unnecessarily endangering civilians not involved in the conflict during attacks on military bases and units ; by laying mines and explosive devices in places where civilians work , live or circulate ; and by taking reprisals . 
During a certain period in the not too distant past , Japan , following a mistaken national policy , advanced along the road to war , only to ensnare the Japanese people in a fateful crisis , and , through its colonial rule and aggression , caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries , particularly to those of Asian nations .  
Although true , Mr . van der Stoel 's words are intentionally misleading in that he claims to feel sorry for the children of Iraq , yet at the same time fails to request the lifting of the embargo against them ; on the contrary , he holds the Government of Iraq responsible for such human suffering on account of its non-implementation of Security Council resolutions 706 ( 1991 ) and 712 ( 1991 ) , despite being satisfied as to their political objectives .  
The resolution encompasses dubious political objectives such as deceiving world public opinion in order to eliminate the growing pressure to end the suffering of the Iraqi people and lift the unjust embargo imposed on it in a bid to divert efforts to that end within the Security Council and thus ensuring the continued imposition of the embargo for as long as possible .  
The resolution encompasses dubious political objectives such as deceiving world public opinion in order to eliminate the growing pressure to end the suffering of the Iraqi people and lift the unjust embargo imposed on it in a bid to divert efforts to that end within the Security Council and thus ensuring the continued imposition of the embargo for as long as possible .  
Whereas the focus has been on the provision of humanitarian assistance to those people , the countries receiving the refugees , despite their limited resources , have made substantial contributions by accepting the refugees and assisting in catering to their essential needs , while experiencing rising social tension and suffering nearly irreparable environmental degradation , notably in the United Republic of Tanzania and Zaire . 
NULLIn the meantime , human suffering of considerable gravity persists in the form of murder , disappearances and infliction of conditions that cause physical destruction , thus depriving people of fundamental human rights such as the right to life , the right to be free from torture and the right to be free from cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment .  
I am convinced that , notwithstanding the acute financial crisis currently facing the Organization , the provision of additional resources to UNOMIL , at a level that is modest by comparison with peace-keeping operations elsewhere , is justified by the hope that the Abuja Agreement at last offers a chance of ending the cruel war in Liberia and alleviating the terrible suffering it has caused .  
They noted that this dangerous situation has led to tremendous losses in human lives , considerable material damage and unspeakable suffering among the population , including the massive movement of refugees .  
In addition , the phenomenon of the caste system , which could be characterized as multiple apartheid , also must be addressed openly with a view to mitigating the suffering of millions of people living a life of bondage and discrimination which divided them into upper and lower echelons , segregated them and excluded them from the political , economic , social and cultural spheres of society . 
Certainly , the human tragedy of this continuing matter is enormous both in terms of any remaining detainees who are no doubt suffering untold emotional anguish and possibly enduring physical hardship and in terms of the relatives of the missing persons who are suffering severe mental distress because they are without knowledge of the whereabouts and condition of their loved ones .  
Pinning the responsibility for the suffering of the population of the former Bosnia and Herzegovina exclusively on the " Pale regime supported by Serbia " , as deliberately stated by the Muslim representative , can not divert the culpability of the Muslim-Croat authorities and free them from their role in starting the civil war , which has unleashed an unprecedented humanitarian tragedy and the continuation of the war option .  
" Distressed at the continued suffering of refugees for whom a solution has yet to be found , and noting with deep concern that refugee protection continues to be jeopardized in many situations as a result of denial of admission , unlawful expulsion , refoulement , unjustified detention , other threats to their physical security , dignity and well-being and failure to respect and ensure their fundamental freedoms and human rights ,  
The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , for its part , had paid its assessed contribution up to the end of the current year , despite the difficult economic circumstances it was suffering ; those difficulties , as everyone knew , had been considerably worsened by the consequences of the embargo and unjust sanctions imposed by the Security Council .  
While there was a need to stress the primary responsibility of the Security Council for imposing economic and trade sanctions in order to punish anyone who threatened international peace and security , target such sanctions to those whom they were intended to punish and lift them speedily whenever conditions so warranted , practical ways and means must be found to avoid unnecessary suffering by third States which applied such sanctions .  
about continuing indiscriminate and deliberate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers ,  
concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by sixteen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a land-locked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
most disadvantaged developing countries were the most seriously affected by the reduced United Nations programmes in particular , where net flows of official development assistance had decreased ; those of sub-Saharan Africa received only an insignificant proportion of direct foreign investment devoted to developing countries and were suffering a continued decline in exports .

obstacles remained , however : harsh economic conditions , the building and expansion of Israeli settlements , the isolation and closure of areas of the occupied territory , including Jerusalem , and land and water confiscation all had a detrimental effect on the situation of Palestinian women and children , who were already suffering from the disastrous consequences of long years of occupation ( rising numbers of refugees and displaced persons , break-up of families , deterioration of health conditions , poor education , rising unemployment and depletion of the environment ) .  
It was essential for the international community to define and implement a global approach to refugee problems , based on prevention , the reduction of the negative effects of the presence of refugees on the host country and the search for durable solutions , in order to alleviate the suffering of millions of human beings and prevent other humanitarian crises .  
that end , the Supreme Council called on the international community to maintain the pressures on the Iraqi Government until Iraq gave proof of its peaceful intentions and completed implementation of the provisions of resolution 687 ( 1991 ) and other pertinent United Nations resolutions , in particular those relating to the release of prisoners and detainees , both Kuwaitis and nationals of other States , whose extended suffering was in blatant violation of resolution 687 ( 1991 ) and the third and fourth Geneva Conventions .  
The destruction , massacres and immeasurable suffering in Lebanon reported by the mass media , which show human bodies that have been cut up and mutilated , is unequivocal proof of the barbaric nature of the aggression taking place at the hands of the Israelis .  
The failure of the Security Council to act at the appropriate time , in response to Lebanon 's request , makes the Council responsible for the heavy human toll , the severe human suffering and the substantial physical damage sustained by Lebanon .  
It is difficult for us to see how the firing of Katyusha rockets by Hezbollah into northern Israel , condemnable as it is , can be equated with the Israeli artillery bombardments , sea and air attacks and other missile attacks directed at the civilian populations in Lebanese villages , towns and cities , resulting in many deaths , enormous suffering and extensive destruction of property .  
Despite the end of the cold war , regional , religious and ethnic disputes are being further aggravated in various parts of our planet , and consequently world peace and security are gravely disturbed and peoples are suffering from untold misfortunes resulting from them .  
We therefore share the anguish of the international community for those countries where internal strife and regional conflict , and their attendant human suffering , continue to deny economic and social progress to millions of their people . 
The tension brought about by the presence of armed groups across the borders of other States , the tragedy of refugees and displaced persons seeking shelter in neighbouring countries and very often the consequent destruction of the environment , the spread of disease , the degeneration of moral values , the horror of suffering and behaviours far removed from human values are all situations not confined to the territorial limits of the States where conflicts occur .  
This joint effort is most appropriate when we recall that we are living in an era in which society realizes that big government and its programmes sometimes give rise to more expenditure than advantages and that fiscal responsibility is of more benefit to the economy than is the multiplication of governmental departments , especially in the developing countries , where the public sector is still suffering the consequences of large-scale programmes that have not produced the results expected .  
We deem it vital to ensure an orderly transition between peace-keeping operations and the work of reconstruction aimed at reversing the economic , political and social damage caused by conflicts and to offer effective humanitarian assistance so as to reduce the suffering of the populations affected .  
My delegation has on numerous occasions called for an end to the embargo that has crippled the Cuban economy and , as members heard from the Secretary of the Council of Ministers of Cuba , cruelly endangered the lives of many innocent people , including children , the sick and the elderly , who have had to bear the brunt of untold suffering .  
On another level , this blockade , which has continued for more than 35 years , constitutes a violation of international humanitarian law , because it has led to unimaginable human suffering among the Cuban civilian population by imposing restrictions on the sovereign right of Cuba to develop economic relations with other countries .  
The situation in the Great Lakes region of Africa , now so dramatically changed in the space of a few days , underlines the importance of being prepared to respond in a timely , coordinated and effective manner to humanitarian crises in order to alleviate the suffering of our fellow human beings .  
In its resolution 46 / 182 of 19 December 1991 , the General Assembly stated its deep concern about the suffering of the victims of disasters and emergency situations , the loss in human lives , the flow of refugees , the mass displacement of people and the material destruction , and set forth a number of guiding principles and measures to strengthen the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations system .  
The Republic of Belarus deeply appreciates the efforts made by all the programmes , funds and specialized agencies of the United Nations system towards providing increased , speedier and better quality assistance to the various countries and regions suffering from armed conflicts , natural disasters , industrial ecological catastrophes and other emergency circumstances .  
Concerned by the increasing suffering of millions of victims of natural disasters , emergency situations and armed conflicts and by the attendant loss of life , flows of refugees , mass displacement of populations and infrastructure devastation , the United Arab Emirates declares its support for international efforts to assess and enhance the capacity of the United Nations and its specialized agencies to address these grave international humanitarian problems and to strengthen the participation of the international community .  
The application of the kind of measures referred to in the draft resolution introduced today by the delegation of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya not only represents an attack on the identity of the State concerned and on its political , economic and cultural elements , but also affects other sensitive areas such as the ability of the peoples suffering from those unilateral policies fully to enjoy their human rights .  
Furthermore , pursuant to resolution 1994 / 47 of the Commission on Human Rights , the Secretary-General informed that body , in his report contained in document E / CN . 4 / 1995 / 43 , that application of unilateral coercive measures is incompatible with the principle of international cooperation , has an adverse impact on the economies of developing countries suffering under the measures and constitutes a serious violation of the human rights of the individuals , groups and peoples affected .  
Secondly , I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to remind the international community that my country is suffering from an inhuman , illegal and unjust economic blockade imposed by the neighbouring States under a pretext involving my country 's domestic policies a question that has already become nugatory .  
The suffering they inflict upon civilian populations , their detrimental effects on economic and social development , especially in areas infested with landmines , and the hefty financial burdens , as well as the technological limitations involved in their detection and de-activation , are undeniable . 
As I have stated before , Japan , which has experienced the calamity of atomic bombing , fervently hopes that nuclear weapons , which cause incomparable human suffering , will never again be used and firmly believes that continuous efforts should be made towards a nuclear-weapon-free world .  
We also welcome the remarkable work carried out every day , frequently in dangerous conditions on the ground , by local and foreign humanitarian organizations and the various programmes , United Nations organs and international institutions to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population and to aid in the rebuilding of the country .  
The adoption of the draft resolution will affirm that the international community has actually derived benefit from the lessons of the recent past and is convinced that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure : had we moved at the right time within the ambit of preventive diplomacy , we could have prevented catastrophes such as those that have afflicted the Great Lakes region of Africa for about two years now , with Rwanda still suffering their scourge .  
Lightly armed peace-keepers and unarmed civilians were sent into areas of active warfare , where their courageous efforts helped to save untold human lives and to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population .  
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by sixteen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a land-locked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
Although only the Government can put most of these commitments into effect , URNG , in addition to recognizing the need to put an end to the suffering of the civilian population and to respect the human rights of wounded , captured and disabled combatants , also undertook , inter alia , " to respect the inherent attributes of the human person and to contribute to the effective enjoyment of human rights " ( Comprehensive Agreement , fourth preambular paragraph ) .  
With regard to the ICAO investigation , although it is part of the United Nations manoeuvre to bring the incident before the Security Council , we are not afraid of it ; on the contrary , we accept it and we demand that it should be rapid and impartial , and that it should take into account all the background information and the gross provocations we are suffering from as a result of the repeated violation of our airspace and the risks they entailed to air traffic and to our country . 
Concerned about continuing indiscriminate and deliberate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers ,  
If certain reforms are necessary , we should remember that our sole task is to ensure that the United Nations becomes the most efficient , flexible , transparent and suitable instrument to serve humanity when it is in danger or suffering , to prevent evil or to free humanity from evil when evil is upon it .  
The Islamic Republic of Iran condemns the recent cowardly , though savage , attacks against defenceless civilians in Lebanon , and calls on the Security Council to condemn Israel 's recent terrorist acts in Lebanon , which have caused tremendous suffering for a country whose sovereignty and territorial integrity have for a long time been violated by the Israeli occupation forces .  It is incumbent upon the Security Council to adopt specific measures to deal with Israeli intransigence in its non-compliance with Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) .  
It adopted the Declaration 's definition of violence against women as " any act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life " .

The progress achieved in the peace negotiations and the temporary suspension of offensive and counterrevolutionary activity have created new conditions capable of permitting decisive progress in fulfilling the commitment to eradicate the suffering the internal armed confrontation has caused for the civilian population and of building confidence in the peace process .  
In other words , the regulation provided in article 7 is satisfactory neither to the State planning a new activity ( since it will be held liable for any harm caused even though the activity may constitute equitable and reasonable utilization ) nor to the State suffering harm from this activity ( which is entitled only to consultations if the first State has exercised due diligence ) .  
The view was expressed that the accused should be allowed to enter a plea of guilty which would have the procedural effect of obviating the need for a lengthy and costly trial : the accused would be allowed to admit his wrongdoing and accept his sentence ; the victims and witnesses would be spared any additional suffering ; and the Court would be allowed to take the guilty plea into account in sentencing the convicted person .  
In another sense , however , the distinction between relief and rehabilitation assistance in Somalia is becoming increasingly blurred , as the main underlying causes of human suffering and emergency needs remain the population 's lack of purchasing power and employment opportunities combined with the absence of civil and social infrastructure and institutions of governance .  
Some 15,750 persons living in the Jamahiriya are suffering from serious medical conditions ( cardiovascular disease ; fractures of the spinal column and thorax ; fractured skulls ; chronic eye diseases ; detached retinas ; serious burns ; cancer and malignant tumours ) which require emergency treatment ( neurosurgery ; spinal marrow transplants ; kidney transplants ; corneal transplants ; fitting of prostheses ) .  
Over half a century of occupation of south Korea by United States military forces has created the tragedy of a divided nation , put grave obstacles in the way of peace and reunification of the Korean peninsula , even in the current post-cold war era , and inflicted immeasurable misery and suffering on the entire Korean population .

The fact that our Kurdish people sought help from its national Government in order to end its suffering exposes the persistent claims of the Special Rapporteur and certain of the allied States , principally the United States , that their military intervention in the northern part of Iraq was intended to protect the Kurds , and supports our previous assertions , namely , that the secret but true intention behind that intervention is to tear apart Iraq and fragment its territorial integrity .  
Van der Stoel attempts to invoke the issue of missing Kuwaitis for obvious political purposes unrelated to human rights with a view to the continued exercise of pressure on the Government of Iraq and prolongation of the economic embargo and hence the suffering of the Iraqi people .  
Torture , which is an aggravated and deliberate form of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , is defined in article 1 of the Declaration as follows : " any act by which severe pain or suffering , whether physical or mental , is intentionally inflicted by or at the instigation of a public official on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or confession , punishing him for an act he has committed or is suspected of having committed , or intimidating him or other persons " .  
The United Nations should emphasize the formulation of policies aimed at fostering a consensus on development strategy as a vital step towards the building of a new global partnership , and should develop specific programmes to assist the least developed countries - most of which had yet to benefit from increased flows of private capital - and the African countries , which were suffering from a heavy debt burden and a lack of basic infrastructure for development .  
The objectives of the Independent Bureau have remained the same as those pursued by the Independent Commission , i.e . , to study specific humanitarian issues that have been inadequately dealt with to date or that call for solutions in line with new realities ; to identify opportunities for more effective action by the international community and to make practical , action-oriented proposals to that end ; to enhance public awareness of the conditions that create and perpetuate human suffering ; and to strengthen efforts at governmental and non-governmental level to bring about appropriate changes and adjustments . 
A realistic beginning could be to address a few selected humanitarian issues which , in recent years , have caused deep concern to Governments and unnecessary suffering to millions of people that could be mitigated or avoided if the world community were to ensure the observance of a set of basic rules of conduct . 
Distinct from the framework of fundamental human rights and freedoms , such an approach would concentrate on practical humanitarian problems whose continuing growth needs to be vigorously discouraged through solidarity with the victims as much as the human suffering they entail needs to be alleviated .  
In recent years , owing to fragmentation of States into newly independent countries , the twin problems of forced relocation of populations and mass expulsions , including the so-called " ethnic cleansing " operations , have resulted in the involuntary displacement of millions of people as well as considerable suffering and loss of life and property .  
In the short term , there was an urgent need for additional financial resources to alleviate human suffering and environmental damage and to find solutions to the political problems that caused population displacements .  
Being aware that involuntary , mass displacement , in addition to the human suffering involved , imposes significant economic and social burdens and may affect security and stability at the regional level ,

Deeply deplore the loss of so many human lives , the material damage and the indescribable suffering caused by armed conflicts in the subregion , which are generating millions of refugees and displaced persons , and express our deep gratitude to the countries and peoples of the subregion for their generous and fraternal hospitality and welcome . 
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by seventeen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a land-locked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
Security Council resolution 1080 ( 1996 ) established a two-part mandate for the multinational force : facilitating the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the effective delivery by civilian relief organizations of humanitarian aid to alleviate the immediate suffering of displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire ; and facilitating the voluntary , orderly repatriation of refugees by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as well as the voluntary return of displaced persons .  
The same was true of other violations of the law of armed conflict mentioned in the new draft , i.e . , the employment of poisonous weapons calculated to cause unnecessary suffering or the wanton destruction of cities , towns or villages not justified by military necessity .  
Not only treatment causing bodily injury , but also , for example , treatment causing mental suffering and feelings of fear , anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing the victim and possibly breaking their physical and moral resistance may amount to such proscribed treatment .  
The developments which took place prior to the Dayton Peace Agreement proved once again that a lack of firm and prompt international response to aggression leads to further aggravation of crises , causes untold human suffering and makes it all the more difficult to find solutions .

Cuba considers that the unfair and unequal international political and economic order , underdevelopment , the unequal distribution of income among countries and within countries and , in some cases , the actions of other States and the implementation of measures of coercion are also responsible for the outbreak and continuation of internal conflicts and the suffering they cause .  
With that perception , we believe that it is high time to completely do away with the obsolete ways of thinking and acting of the past , namely , the imposition of inequitable terms of economic and trade relations , sanctions and embargoes , and so forth , which distort international relations , cause suffering to the people and seriously violate the minimum right of human beings the right to a peaceful life .  
Unfortunately , the world continues to witness many , not fewer , incidents of just and unjust wars , regional conflicts , civil and ethnic strife , acute forms of suffering , environmental degradation and unmitigated endangerment of life itself .  
The need for that assistance and support remains urgent amid the current difficult circumstances faced by the Palestinian people of the occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip , in view of the stagnation of the peace process and Israeli coercive measures , including closures and restrictions on the movement of workers and commodities to and from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip which represent an additional burden increasing the suffering of the Palestinian people .

Over 120-million people worldwide are officially unemployed and many more underemployed , causing massive personal suffering , widespread social disintegration and huge economic waste .  
The continued presence of Rwandan refugees in neighbouring countries has had a number of serious , closely linked consequences of several kinds : humanitarian ( suffering endured ) , economic ( depleted humanitarian assistance ) , political and strategic ( interests of States ) , ecological ( destruction of host States ' ecosystems ) and security ( military and paramilitary activities of former FAR and militia members , as well as border insecurity ) . 
However , recent outbreaks of cholera in Peru and a " plague scare " in India ( see box 4 ) have clearly demonstrated the human suffering and loss of life that may result from poor waste management and the disastrous effect that waste-related diseases may have on the trade and tourism vital for national economy .  
It follows that any sanctions should be part of the search for a long-term political settlement of the conflict , reflect the strategic goals of the entire international community , take account of the political and " physical " ( in terms of death and suffering among the civilian population and the destruction of material values ) cost of such actions .  
At the Workshop , which was held in the form of a free discussion , the participants agreed on the urgent need to protect those who were exposed to extreme suffering resulting from a lack of sufficient protection .  
As the Secretary-General pointed out in his annual report to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session , 1 preventive measures are highly cost-effective , as the sums they require are paltry by comparison with the huge costs in human suffering and material damage which war always brings , and they also compare favourably " with the less huge , but nevertheless substantial , cost of deploying a peacekeeping operation after hostilities have broken out " .  
Aware that involuntary , mass displacement , in addition to the human suffering involved , imposes significant economic and social burdens and may affect security and stability at the regional level ,  
He made it clear in his previous report to the General Assembly that those measures were beginning to have a real impact on the people in the towns , particularly the urban elite , and that they were adding to the suffering in rural areas , where people are often poor and where , owing to the violence and the civil war , regular access to , inter alia , health care , hygiene , various essential goods and primary and secondary education have become even more curtailed .  
Concerned about continuing deliberate and indiscriminate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers involved in Operation Lifeline Sudan and with international private voluntary agencies ,  
Over 120-million people worldwide are officially unemployed and many more underemployed , causing massive personal suffering , widespread social disintegration and huge economic waste .  
Expresses its deep concern at the intense suffering of the victims of genocide and crimes against humanity , recognizes the ongoing suffering of their survivors , particularly the extremely high number of traumatized children and women victims of rape and sexual violence , and urges the international community to provide adequate assistance to them and to note the priorities identified by the Government of Rwanda in this area ;  
While maintaining a war mentality in the vain hope of crushing the rebels in the field ( and thereby nullifying any attempt to begin the negotiations which Major Buyoya has himself advocated ) the Burundi de facto authorities are systematically resettling rural populations using an outdated strategy of forced villagization , whose weaknesses and the suffering entailed for the populations concerned have been demonstrated in other conflicts , particularly in Viet Nam . 
This concern has found expression at the meetings , seminars and study groups held in various parts of the world that have considered the grievous suffering caused by the sanctions and by the embargo and that have addressed urgent appeals to the United Nations and the international community as a whole for action to lift the sanctions imposed on the Iraqi people and to enable that people , through the use of its own resources and capacities , to secure the provision of its basic civilian needs . 
Expressing its grave concern at the enormous human suffering and material damage sustained by the Libyan Arab people and neighbouring peoples as a result of the maintenance of the coercive measures imposed on the Great Jamahiriya under Security Council resolutions 748 ( 1992 ) and 883 ( 1993 ) ,  
Regretting the human rights violations , both individual and collective , the marginalization and discrimination that the indigenous populations in Guatemala suffered and are suffering , together with the continued deterioration of the economic and social situation , with its serious consequences for the great majority of the population , particularly for the indigenous peoples of Guatemala and the most vulnerable sectors of Guatemalan society ,

Decides to authorize Ms . Ferero Ucros to prepare , without financial implications , a working paper , in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms , assessing the utility , scope and structure of a study on weapons of mass destruction or with indiscriminate effect , or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering .  
The international community is fully entitled to become impatient and even forgive the word exasperated , for it has devoted much of its energy and means to try to help this beautiful and potentially prosperous country , which has been torn by so much war and suffering .  
Attention is drawn to the definition of violence against women contained in article 1 of the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women ( General Assembly resolution 48 / 104 ) : [ A ] ny act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm and suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life .  
Notwithstanding these positive indications , the continent as a whole is still suffering from an increasing external debt burden , receding standards of living , low-level social services and health care for its citizens and a diminishing capability to compete and to attract foreign investments .  
They needed to be applied impartially , on the basis of specific criteria and a clear timetable , and only when there was a real threat to international peace and security .  The possibility of adopting smart sanctions , which would not affect innocent civilians or cause undue suffering , had been discussed .  
Prevention and preparedness strategies , based on scientific and technological applications as well as on social equity , and including the full involvement of civil society , must be put in place to protect national assets and property and especially to reduce human suffering , the loss of life , and the disruption of livelihoods .  
A matter of particular concern was that the unregulated use of sanctions had resulted in unnecessary suffering for innocent civilian populations ; sanctions should be imposed only as a last resort , and the proposals for ameliorating the plight of third States must be carefully studied .  
It is our view that we should seek every opportunity in every forum to address the issue of landmines , in the hope that by our concerted and combined efforts we will realize the ultimate humanitarian objective we all share : to bring an end to the dreadful suffering those mines wreak on their innocent victims .  
Deplores the immense human suffering and loss of life that have accompanied refugee flows and other forced displacements , in particular numerous serious threats to the security or well-being of refugees , refoulement , unlawful expulsion , physical attacks and detention under unacceptable conditions , and calls upon States to take all measures necessary to ensure respect for the principles of refugee protection , including the humane treatment of asylum-seekers in accordance with internationally recognized human rights and humanitarian norms ;  
The issue of human rights was of particular importance for Kuwait , because the entire population was suffering as a result of the delay by the Iraqi regime in freeing prisoners and detainees from Kuwait and elsewhere , as well as its uncooperative attitude at the meetings in Geneva of the Tripartite Commission and of its technical committee .  14 .  The human , social and psychological consequences of the Iraqi occupation continued to be felt .  
Deplores the immense human suffering and loss of life that have accompanied refugee flows and other forced displacements , in particular the numerous serious threats to the security or well-being of refugees , such as refoulement , unlawful expulsion , physical attacks and detention under unacceptable conditions , and calls upon States to take all measures necessary to ensure respect for the principles of refugee protection , including the humane treatment of asylum-seekers in accordance with internationally recognized human rights and humanitarian norms ;  
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by eighteen years of war , and underlining the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards a sustainable economic and social development , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a landlocked , least-developed and war-stricken country ,  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in the last few years , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , particularly those of developing countries ,  
In this respect , we stress the need to foster technical cooperation in this field on the broadest possible basis , both to develop economical , safe techniques for mine detection and removal and to provide access to such techniques by those requiring them , with a view to developing international cooperation to mitigate the suffering of those who have fallen victim to the random and indiscriminate use of such mines , and who must be rehabilitated and fully reintegrated into society .  
It follows that any sanctions should be part of the search for a long-term political settlement of the conflict , reflect the strategic goals of the entire international community , take account of the political and ' physical ' ( in terms of death and suffering among the civilian population and the destruction of material values ) cost of such actions .  
As the Secretary-General pointed out in his annual report to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session , 11 preventive measures are highly cost-effective , as the sums they require are paltry by comparison with the huge costs in human suffering and material damage which war always brings , and they also compare favourably ' with the less huge , but nevertheless substantial , cost of deploying a peacekeeping operation after hostilities have broken out ' .  
By building peace , reducing unsustainable military expenditures , promoting equitable and sustainable development and encouraging stable , democratic societies which respect human rights , we not only limit human suffering , but we also address the root causes of conflict itself .  
The world is currently passing through highly interwoven and complicated circumstances , where progress and its horizons mingle with backwardness and its dangers while humanity takes pride in such achievements as economic progress and the development of technology and informatics , it is still suffering from the practices of terrorism , drug trafficking , organized crime , the spread of corruption , the overflow of refugees , the challenges posed by war criminals , crimes of genocide and mass murder , and the negative effects of racism and religious discrimination . 
The Democratic Republic of the Congo is among the few countries that from time immemorial , owing to its geostrategic placement and its vast human and natural resources , has borne the burden of a sombre history of suffering and outrageous violations of human rights and the rights of peoples .  
They have also stressed that such sanctions should not be based merely on political expediency , but rather should be firmly based on international law ; that they should be implemented according to the principles of justice and international law ; that they should not serve individual or factional interests ; that in their implementation , consideration should be given to the human suffering that they cause ; and that a time limit should be set for their lifting .  
My country understands and agrees with the principles that motivate today \ x { e5b8 } action by the international community : prohibiting parties to a conflict from choosing from an unlimited range of ways and means of combat ; prohibiting the use of weapons and means of combat that cause excessive damage or unnecessary suffering ; and drawing the essential distinction between combatants and civilians not involved in the fighting .  
The use of conventional arms , often random and always indiscriminate , takes the sad credit for the death and suffering of thousands of innocent victims of local and regional conflicts .  
This situation calls for urgent legal and humanitarian measures to establish a comprehensive global legal system banning all kinds of anti-personnel mines and to allay the pain and suffering caused to innocent civilians by the mines , which impede the social and economic activities of these peoples .  
Egypt is aware of the magnitude and severity of the problems related to the proliferation of anti _ personnel landmines , which is above all a humanitarian issue given the suffering they inflict on civilian populations , the heavy financial burden and the limited nature of the technology used in the detection and deactivation of these mines . 
Torture is defined in the latter Declaration as any act by which severe pain or suffering , whether physical or mental , is intentionally inflicted by or at the instigation of a public official on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or confession , punishing him for an act he has committed or is suspected of having committed , or intimidating him or other persons .  
Having had the privilege of meeting with a wide variety of brilliant people in Turkey and having seen the horrendous pain and needless suffering stemming from the tragedy that terrorism today imposes on this country of limitless potential , the Special Rapporteur is convinced that the safeguarding of the right to freedom of opinion and expression by the Government and the support for such a policy by society as a whole have the potential to become the foundation for the building of a peaceful , prosperous and just future for Turkey . 
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by seventeen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a landlocked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
That included all violent acts against female victims that resulted in , or could result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , as well as threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivations of liberty , whether occurring in public or private life .  
The overall objective of the programme emergency humanitarian assistance , derived from these General Assembly resolutions , is " to ensure better preparation for , as well as a rapid and coherent response to , emergencies , natural and man-made , thus reducing the suffering and loss of human lives and material destruction ; promoting prevention and preparedness ; and ensuring smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation and development " . b  
Foreign aggression , ethnic conflicts , and massive human rights abuses continued to threaten the territorial integrity of newly independent States in the region leading to enormous suffering and grief .  
In 1996 , a number of African countries encountered special development situations with the collapse of public and social services , disruption of economic activities , insecurity and armed conflict , the breakdown of law and order , massive population displacement and widespread human suffering .  
The objectives will be met by providing support to the mechanisms for humanitarian coordination , emergency response and inter-agency collaboration at Headquarters and in the field through the Emergency Relief Coordinator , the Inter-Agency Standing Committee and the United Nations humanitarian or resident coordinators in order to facilitate a coordinated and coherent approach to major complex emergencies affecting large numbers of people suffering from famine , displacement and human deprivation as a result of civil strife or other conflict-driven situations .  
These facts have not been enough to persuade the representative of the United States of America to desist from using irresponsible methods to prevent thousands of sick children , older persons and women from obtaining the medicines they need to alleviate the suffering brought on by the diseases they have contracted as a result of the maintenance of the unjust embargo against Iraq , which has taken on a political and biased character and which has the goal of undermining the national political regime in Iraq .  
These facts have not been enough to persuade the representative of the United States of America to desist from using irresponsible methods to prevent thousands of sick children , older persons and women from obtaining the drugs they need to alleviate the suffering brought on by the diseases they have contracted as a result of the maintenance of the unjust embargo against Iraq , which has taken on a political and biased character and which has the goal of undermining the national political regime in Iraq . 
The occupation of East Timor , systematically condemned by the relevant bodies of the United Nations , makes abusive and illegitimate any and all attempts to appropriate the genuine collective will of the Timorense People that does not pass through a free process of self-determination , approved by the relevant mechanisms and organs of the United Nations . The Secretary-General has been following with concern reports of recent violent incidents in East Timor which have resulted in loss of life and are causing considerable human suffering .  
However , illegal weapons do not have that protection , and their war-time use easily meets the rest of the definition of torture : their use causes severe pain and suffering , both physical and mental ; their use is intentional ; they are used to unduly coerce the enemy or the civilian population into surrender , submission or other state favourable to the user of the weapons ; and their use is under the direct order of public officials .  
Deeply concerned by the numerous reports from a large number of reliable sources attesting that , regardless of human dignity , armed groups of religious extremists , who act in flagrant violation of the principles of tolerance of Islam , are terrorising civilian populations in order to force them to support their cause , by resorting , inter alia , to summary executions , the cruelty of which adds futile suffering to the fate of innocent victims of decapitation or throat cutting , including old people , women and children ,  
The agreements reached by Committee members to set up a subregional early warning mechanism , to control the illicit trade in arms and drugs , to retrain demobilized troops for civilian life and to enhance the capacity of Central African States to participate more effectively in future peace missions in the area would , if implemented , contribute significantly to continuing efforts to end the scourge of violence , destruction and suffering in the subregion . 
Decides to authorize the inclusion of this question in the preliminary document concerning a study in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms , on weapons of mass destruction or with indiscriminate effect , or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering , to be submitted to the Sub _ Commission at its fiftieth session .  
However , the increased international attention to , and importance of , transparency of transfers and possession of conventional arms are justified by the fact that these conventional arms cause serious human suffering in international and internal conflicts and are not subject to legal regimes in many parts of the world .  
Some countries were still suffering from the negative impact of structural adjustment programmes , particularly with regard to health and educational infrastructure and services , which necessitated strengthening of international cooperation based on the adoption and implementation of concrete measures aimed at mitigating and completely eliminating their adverse impact .  
The United Nations and the League of Arab States expressed their concern over the continuing problem of landmines and other unexploded devices that are causing serious human suffering and which have negative social and economic effects on mine-infested countries over an extended period .  
Those suffering the most are the civilian population of the occupied territories , whose standard of living has been eroded steadily as a result of the very serious economic and social situation .  
Iraq is a developing country that is suffering greatly as a result of the coercive economic policies and measures exemplified in the complete economic embargo imposed on it more than seven years ago that affect the health of the Iraqi people and every aspect of its economic , social and cultural life .  
These unresolved conflicts undermine the political , economic and social fabric of the States concerned , bringing destruction and untold human suffering to the victims of war .  
Their ultimate sacrifice reminds us that human beings are capable of great altruism in the face of suffering and of calm when faced with the destructive passion of armed conflict , even at the risk of their own lives .  
The fighting is again causing enormous suffering for the Afghan people and adds to their misery , while human rights , fundamental freedoms and international humanitarian law continue to be violated with impunity .  
These measures , which were very hastily decided upon on 31 July 1996 , are unlimited with regard to their objective and duration and are illegal and unfair , added a series of misfortunes and suffering to the already pitiable drama caused by the civil conflict .  
Gravely concerned that the continuation of armed conflicts in the continent threatens regional peace , causes massive human displacement , suffering and poverty , perpetuates instability and diverts scarce resources from long-term development ,  
Gravely concerned that the continuation of armed conflicts in the continent threatens regional peace , causes massive human displacement , suffering and poverty , perpetuates instability and diverts scarce resources from long-term development ,  
They were guided not only by legal terminology and the compromises of diplomatic conferences ; before their very eyes was irrefutable proof of unprecedented of human suffering .  
Good governance , which is an important prerequisite for sustained socio-economic development , is undermined through lost economic productivity , the destruction of physical and social infrastructure , refugees , environmental degradation and human suffering .  
He said that the current economic outlook for Africa was not encouraging , as the region was suffering from the effects of the international financial crisis , reduced export demand and falling commodity prices .  
Expressing its grave concern about the continuation of the military confrontation in Afghanistan , threatening regional peace and security and causing massive loss of life and extensive human suffering , further destruction of property , serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure , refugee flows and other forcible displacements of large numbers of people ,  
Of equal concern to the international community is the growing threat faced by humanitarian workers , who risk their personal safety for the noble purpose of alleviating suffering and hardship .  
Canada has always distinguished itself by an honourable , consistent and outstanding involvement in United Nations efforts to achieve international peace and security , in particular by its humanitarian devotion to alleviating the suffering of civilian populations in armed conflicts .  
The intensification of armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the increasingly ethnic and religious nature of the conflict , which have resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement , and which hinder the return of the internally displaced to their homes ;  
It was , therefore , discouraging to note that , in addition to suffering from long-standing problems , such as declining commodity prices and worsening terms of trade , the developing countries were also having to face new problems as a result of developments in the world economy , current international economic problems and even natural phenomena , the direct and indirect effects of which had exacerbated their problems . 
The Special Rapporteur observes that the human tragedy of this unresolved matter is enormous , both in terms of any remaining detainees who are no doubt suffering untold emotional anguish and possibly enduring physical hardship , and in terms of the families of the missing persons who are suffering severe mental distress because they are without knowledge of the whereabouts and condition of their loved ones .  
As a neighbouring country which had suffered a similar experience of population displacements and economic calamity , Cyprus understood the importance of alleviating suffering and creating proper conditions for social and economic development , and it was keenly aware of the permanent and inalienable right of people to return to their homes and recover their property .  
imperative to maintain and enhance humanitarian assistance not only to meet basic human needs and thus to uphold the right to life of millions of suffering Afghans , but also to provide incentives for ending or significantly relaxing the existing restrictions which were violative of human rights . 
Iraq , in particular , is suffering from the effects of a disease that is incurring large-scale economic costs in terms of the quantities of red meat and dairy products lost , thereby exacerbating the suffering of many Iraqis already undernourished owing to the maintenance of the unjust embargo imposed on the country .  
All major gynaecological centres in the country report an increase in the number of pregnant women suffering from threatened abortion , premature deliveries , slow foetal growth , higher Caesarean section incidence , etc .  
Encourages the continuing efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reduce the prison population by releasing minors , elderly prisoners , prisoners suffering from terminal illnesses and suspects with incomplete files who were detained for their alleged involvement in genocide and other abuses of human rights , and reaffirms the urgent need to complete a dossier for every detainee with a view to identifying those who should be released immediately , early or conditionally ;  
At the end of his testimony , each man requested that compensation be paid for the consequent material damage and mental suffering , as did all those others who attended the sessions of the Chamber in order to pursue civil claims .  
The persisting armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering , forced displacement , including on the grounds of ethnicity , and which hinder the return of the internally displaced to their homes ;  
Encourages the continuing efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reduce the prison population by releasing minors , elderly prisoners , prisoners suffering from terminal illnesses and suspects with incomplete files who were detained for their alleged involvement in genocide and other abuses of human rights , and reaffirms the urgent need to complete a dossier for every detainee with a view to identifying those who should be released immediately , early or conditionally ;  
Despite having adopted outward looking strategies and liberal market oriented policies for integration in the global economy , many of them are suffering economic setbacks as a result of the continuing turmoil in financial and currency markets .  
As reflected in the aforementioned resolutions , from the outset , the Security Council gave early recognition to the suffering of the Iraqi civilians under a very rigorous sanctions regime and , concerned with the serious nutritional and health situation of the Iraqi civilian population , laid down the foundation for establishing a humanitarian programme .  
It observes with the deepest concern that guerrilla activities continue to be directed against civilians ( in particular the totally unacceptable practice of hostage _ taking under the threat of death among nationals or foreigners who are neither personally involved in nor responsible for the conflict or its conduct ) and attacks on infrastructure , including the bombing of pipelines , which have caused numerous deaths , great suffering amongst the civilian population and grave destruction .  
We appeal to the members of NATO to think before it is too late and to immediately halt their military action which has already brought such untold suffering to hundreds of thousands of people , created a humanitarian catastrophe and thrown Europe backwards into the distant past .  
Thus , the international community , especially the United Nations , must step up its activities to end the humanitarian suffering of the victims of the situation and of those States that have sheltered a large number of refugees and displaced persons , thereby assuming a significant additional material and logistical burden .  
In its resolution 1997 / 36 , of 28 August 1997 , the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities authorized Ms . Clemencia Forero Ucros to prepare a working paper , in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms , assessing the utility , scope and structure of a study on weapons of mass destruction or with indiscriminate effect , or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering , for submission to the Sub _ Commission at its fiftieth session .  
The crisis in Kosovo has resulted in the mass forced displacement and deportation of hundreds of thousands of civilians , wholesale destruction of property and means of livelihood , wanton lawlessness and violence , thousands of documented killings , countless as-yet undocumented deaths , and immeasurable human suffering .  
The Committee made an important point by emphasizing that in considering sanctions , it is essential to distinguish between the basic objective of applying political and economic pressure upon the governing lite of the country to persuade them to conform to international law , and the collateral infliction of suffering upon the most vulnerable groups within the targeted country .  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems . 72 bis .  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems .  
It had been urged that it was imperative to maintain and enhance humanitarian assistance not only to meet basic human needs and thus to uphold the right to life of millions of suffering Afghans , but also to provide incentives for ending or significantly relaxing the existing restrictions which were violative of human rights .  
That the proposed Decade was both a moral imperative and an opportunity for the world community , in a spirit of global cooperation , to use existing scientific and technical knowledge to alleviate human suffering and enhance economic security ;  
This cooperation is not confined to official endeavours undertaken by the Kuwaiti Government ; the State is also encouraging national institutions and individuals to provide aid and assistance to those in need thereof in other countries , regardless of the origin or cause of that need which might be attributable to poverty , natural disasters , human conflicts or other causes of human suffering which the State of Kuwait is endeavouring to combat and alleviate .  
The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that while the international community is directing its efforts towards resolving tensions and the further promotion and expansion of commercial relations at global level , the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba has caused the Cuban people serious suffering and also created difficulties in global commercial and financial relations .  
The objectives of the joint action are : ( a ) to combat and contribute to ending the destabilizing accumulation and spread of small arms and light weapons ; ( b ) to contribute to the reduction of existing accumulations of these weapons to levels consistent with the legitimate security needs of countries ; and ( c ) to help those regions suffering from the problems associated with excessive accumulation and spread of small arms to tackle them .  
Such action is needed in order to enhance international and regional security ; reduce the risk of armed conflict , political violence , terrorism and violent crime ; combat and suppress the illicit trafficking in small arms ; promote sustainable peace settlements and good governance ; and , above all , stop human suffering . 
" The Security Council expresses its deep concern at the deteriorating political , military and humanitarian situation in Angola , at the suffering of the people and at the dramatic increase in the number of internally displaced persons , which has now reached well over two-million people , not including the unknown number of internally displaced persons in areas which are currently inaccessible to humanitarian agencies .  
He was held responsible for 11 counts of murder , torture , rape , causing great suffering or serious injury and inhumane acts and a number of concurrent sentences were imposed by the Trial Chamber , the maximum being 20 years ' imprisonment for murder and wilful killing .  
Subsequent to two amendments , the indictment includes some 37 counts pertaining to alleged crimes of , inter alia , persecution on political , racial and religious grounds , unlawful deportation and transfer , murder , wilful killing , torture , rape , inhumane acts , cruel treatment and wilfully causing great suffering .  
We are confident that with disinterested assistance by the international community the Government of Indonesia will be able to bring the situation under control through tangible efforts including control of the armed elements , maintenance of security and extension of humanitarian assistance to alleviate the suffering of the refugees and the disadvantaged civilians with the help of the International Red Cross .  
It again expressed regret that the Iraqi regime was continuing to defy resolutions that had the force of international law and to reject the initiatives taken and proposals made at the inter-Arab and international levels for the creation of an effective mechanism and a workable procedure , within the framework of the United Nations , for the lifting of the international economic embargo being maintained against Iraq and for ending the suffering of the Iraqi people .  
OCHA is mandated to mobilize and coordinate the collective efforts of the international community , in particular those of the United Nations system , to meet in a coherent and timely manner the needs of those exposed to human suffering and material destruction in disasters and emergencies .  
While we recognize the difficulty of achieving smart sanctions in the real world , we also believe that there is a continuing need to minimize collateral , unintended humanitarian suffering through the imposition of more specifically targeted sanctions and mechanisms for periodic substantive reviews .  
We also join the call to move away from double standards in the field of human rights , and we believe that the same attention should be devoted to those situations , wherever they may arise , that involve a loss of civilian life in armed conflict or which are a source of untold suffering , without allowing the political considerations of Council members , and especially of the permanent ones , to prevail over the collective considerations of the Council and of the United Nations as a whole .  
The consequences are plain : lives that could have been saved are lost ; suffering that could have been lessened is left to follow its course .  105 .  What is " reasonable and doable " is far from being a question of money alone .  
Nevertheless , in spite of the picture of suffering and contrasts which the continent presents to the world ; in spite of the upheavals that wrack its civil societies ; and in spite of all the difficulties draining its capacity to steer its own way through a troublesome environment , Africa has taken the costly and demanding road of renewal that is so necessary if it is to assume control of its own destiny and to achieve a balanced world situation in the future .  
While we recognize the difficulty in the real world of achieving smart sanctions , we believe that there is a recurring need to minimize the collateral though unintended human suffering , through the imposition of more specifically targeted sanctions and periodic review mechanisms .  
My Government makes a solemn and emotional appeal to the entire international community in general , and to the Security Council in particular , inviting them to become fully involved in the immediate implementation of the Lusaka Agreement so as to put an end to the untold suffering of my people .  
Human-centred development , the concept outlined at Copenhagen , would enable the poor to enjoy basic political and economic freedoms while focusing on practical and effective ways of alleviating their suffering .  
The intensification of armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including its ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement , including on the ground of ethnicity ;  
After a further massive loss of human lives , increased suffering of the civilian population and immense physical destruction , the two sides found themselves roughly at the same positions they held in late 1998 .  
There are also seven institutions for the intellectual development of mentally retarded persons , as well as two schools run by charitable associations , which admit children suffering from slight to moderate mental retardation and , after their readaptation , provide them with education in accordance with the syllabuses of the Ministry of Education in a manner consistent with their abilities .  
This political confrontation has effectively pitted local communities against each other , and as a consequence the indigenous population has paid a heavy price in terms of human suffering and remains under the constant threat of renewed violence .  
Noting with concern the resulting exacerbation of the enormous suffering of the Afghan people , resulting in the massive loss of human life , summary executions , the deliberate abuse and arbitrary detention of civilians , refugee flows , the use of child soldiers , harassment , the forcible displacement of innocent civilians and extensive destruction ,  
Expressing its grave concern about the continuation of the military confrontation in Afghanistan , threatening regional peace and security and causing massive loss of life and extensive human suffering , further destruction of property , serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure , refugee flows and other forcible displacements of large numbers of people ,  
The intensification of armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including its ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement , including on the grounds of ethnicity ;  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies in the last few years , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , in particular of civilians , the suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , in particular those of developing countries ,  
For instance , there may be concomitantly higher levels of street and ( low visibility ) intra-familial violence , large proportions of the population that are severely disadvantaged and young ( that is , in the age groups perpetrating and suffering crime ) , rapid migration into urban areas , lack of trust in law enforcement , inefficient justice systems , corruption , limited good governance and severe competition for scarce resources .  
Article 40 of the Military Service Act provides that any person who fails to present himself for the military service medical examination to determine his physical fitness and ascertain whether he is suffering from any contagious disease or disability that would preclude his enlistment for military service is liable to a fine ranging from 30 to 100 dinars .  
The Permanent Mission of Kuwait also informed the Secretary-General that ( i ) n the few cases in which objection is expressed to compulsory military service , most of the persons concerned are found to be suffering from psychological and nervous disorders and such cases are exempted from military service .  
The failure of the international community to prevent such massive suffering in the half century since the trials in Tokyo and Nuremberg makes tragically clear the urgency of developing comprehensive measures for combating impunity as well as strong and effective early-warning and conflict-prevention measures to prevent genocide .  
Humanitarian agencies fear increased suffering of the most vulnerable , particularly refugees , internationally displaced persons , the disabled , children , the chronically ill , urban elderly and social cases .  
Taking the opportunity offered by Articles 10 and 11 of the Charter , my delegation would also like to make all the Members of our universal Organization aware of the genuine motives behind the armed aggression that the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its peace-loving people are suffering and to ask them to contribute to the establishment of a peaceful and lasting solution to the conflict that is currently tearing my country apart .  
The continuing sanctions and embargo imposed by the United States Government have posed great difficulties for the Cuban people in their endeavour to achieve economic and social development and reform , thus seriously constraining the Cuban Governments efforts to eradicate poverty and enhance its peoples living standards.Cuban women and children have borne the brunt of the suffering , especially in terms of their health and welfare . 
These included reduction of the infant mortality and under-five child mortality by one third and of maternal mortality by half , cutting down by 50 per cent the number of children under five suffering from malnutrition , enabling every child to attend primary school , immunizing 90 percent of the worlds infants and protecting children in especially difficult circumstances , particularly in situations of armed conflict .  
This fact has always prompted us to restate the principle of full respect for the delicate balance between the major organs of the international Organization as set out in the Charter , in particular the inherent role of the General Assembly in considering principles of cooperation aimed at relieving human suffering , including addressing the causes of conflict and the strengthening of lasting peace and sustainable development .  
The unfortunate consequences of deterioration in the economic environment , particularly in connection with the global financial crisis , brought , in some cases , a reversal of social gains , while there was an increase in human suffering and deprivation.In the affected countries , the impact of economic adversity was felt at all levels of society , but the poorest segments carry a disproportionate burden .  
The purpose of the 1991 revised criteria for least developed country status was to designate those low-income countries that were suffering from a low level of human resources and from structural weaknesses , specifically as reflected in a low degree of economic diversification .  
Since all of these conditions have been met , the illegal , brutal and massive economic sanctions imposed on Burundi by the neighbouring countries should be lifted because the country is on the verge of suffocation and the suffering of innocent people is indescribable ; famine is imminent ; and diseases such as meningitis and cholera are epidemic due to a lack of medication .  
To the contrary , tensions have increased in many parts of the world and have intensified human suffering because of a resurgence of the arms race with the attendant death , exodus , ethnic cleansing and famine .  
As members of an organization responsible for the protection of and assistance to more than 26-million people who have sought safety from persecution , war or massive human rights abuses , UNHCR staff members around the world witness daily the untold suffering caused by landmines.Not only do landmines force people to leave their homes in search of safety , they also imperil their flight and later hinder their return .  
As my delegation has stated on various occasions , including during the general debate in this Committee , we share the deep concern of the international community over the scourge of anti-personnel landmines , which not only inflict great suffering and death on innocent civilians , especially children , but also pose a tremendous obstacle to the economic and social development and reconstruction of affected regions .  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in the last few years , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , in particular those of developing countries ,  
The Government of the Republic of Zambia wishes to confirm that on 14 January 1999 , it received a letter from the Government of Angola in which the latter alleged that it has in its possession " credible information " confirming substantial involvement of the Zambian authorities in the logistic and military support sent to Dr . Savimbi inside Angola to perpetuate the war and the suffering of the Angolan people .  
Not only does the use of arms complicate the search for a peaceful resolution of differences , but it is also a source of much human suffering : the displacement of populations , the destruction of socio-economic infrastructures acquired at the cost of great efforts , massive flows of refugees into bordering countries and the sudden spread of disease.This list is not an exhaustive one by any means . 
This criminal , unprecedented act of aggression , in clear support of separatism and terrorism , has already caused massive human losses and enormous destruction of civilian infrastructure all over Yugoslavia , thus provoking enormous humanitarian suffering .  
The persisting armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering , forced displacement , including on the grounds of ethnicity , and which hinder the return of the internally displaced to their homes ;  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and the least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems .  
I have the honour to inform you that a few days ago the Republic of Honduras ratified a maritime delimitation treaty concluded between Honduras and Colombia on 2 August 1986 , when Nicaragua was suffering the ravages of a bloody civil war caused by ideological differences resulting from the cold war .  
At the other end of the scale , small arms and light weapons obtained through illicit trade account for much of the political , ethnic and criminal killings and human suffering that occur in the less affluent countries of the world .  
In those days of deep crisis , Pakistan extended moral , political , financial , technical and material support to the people of that country in defence of international law and morality as a sign of our solidarity with them in the hour of suffering .  
My delegation is equally concerned about the illegal and humiliating economic blockade that is being imposed on the Palestinian people , resulting in tremendous suffering and in financial losses amounting to several hundred-million dollars .  
Having been the victims of antipersonnel mines planted by the forces of colonial Powers , Eritreans are aware of the grief and suffering caused by the irresponsible and indiscriminate use of these evil weapons .  
They build on the fundamental norm of the law of armed conflict that military necessity in armed conflict has to be constantly set against the humanitarian objective of preventing unnecessary suffering .  
The Republic of Korea shares the humanitarian concerns of the international community about the human suffering and tragic casualties caused by the irresponsible and indiscriminate use of antipersonnel landmines .  
The group recalled that least developed countries were considered to be lowincome developing countries suffering from a low level of human resource development and economic vulnerability , two structural handicaps to economic growth .  
After a further massive loss of human lives , increased suffering of the civilian population and immense physical destruction , the two sides found themselves roughly in the same positions they held in late 1998 .  
After a further massive loss of human lives , increased suffering of the civilian population and immense physical destruction , the two sides found themselves roughly in the same positions they held in late 1998 .  
The annual assistance flow of around 200-million dollars has alleviated human suffering in the short run and prevented major humanitarian disasters but has not provided the foundation for sustainable development .  
The new spiral of fierce armed resistance begun by the Taliban has led to a worsening of the suffering of the Afghan population and to new flagrant violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law .  
It underlines the persisting need for more efficient policies to reverse the effects of discrimination in this field against the poorest , the elderly , persons with physical or mental disability and those suffering from epidemic diseases .  
It has failed , for example , to address longstanding conflicts with massive human suffering and systematic violations of international humanitarian law in a timely and effective manner .  
It is a vexing and tragic mosaic of suffering , and its seemingly endless civil war exacerbates an already dire humanitarian situation , as we heard in the briefing this morning .  
The Republic of Korea fully shares the humanitarian concerns of the international community about human suffering and tragic casualties caused by the irresponsible and indiscriminate use of antipersonnel landmines .  
The response to emerging conflicts was the GreatState nationalistic projects , which caused enormous suffering for all the people of the country , and had prolonged negative implications for the entire region , Europe and the international community as a whole .  
Under international law capital punishment shall not be applied to juvenile offenders , expectant or recent mothers , and those suffering from mental handicap or extremely limited mental capacity .  
The living conditions in this camp are harsh , especially for widows , elderly women and the many children , who often live in an intolerably precarious state , suffering from illnesses , malnutrition and the cold .  
The representative of Norway said that developing countries , which were already suffering from falling commodity prices , debt problems and insufficient ODA flows , were particularly vulnerable to a slowdown in economic growth in the developed countries .  
Mr . Salman ( Iraq ) affirmed that the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq constituted an example of cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment and of violence against men , women and children who had sustained considerable material and physical suffering .  
Once again , we have witnessed with dreary familiarity a major military offensive late this past summer , with all the consequent displacement and suffering of the civilian population .  
The tragedy at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , almost 15 years ago , affected almost the entire territory of Europe but most of all Ukraine and the neighbouring areas of Belarus and the Russian Federation and caused long-lasting , complex problems .  The human suffering caused by the accident can not be measured , and its environmental impact was partly irreversible .  
Finally , the increasing incidence and magnitude of natural disasters confirms the need for and importance of efficient coordination at all levels in disaster preparedness and emergency response ; information-sharing and early warning systems to mitigate the impact of natural disasters ; and , above all , a ready pool of resources , including financial resources that can be deployed and utilized immediately , thus minimizing human suffering .  
The ongoing human suffering inflicted by conflicts , from Afghanistan to Angola and from the Middle East to the Great Lakes , is a daily reminder of the need for a new and concerted response at the highest political levels from Governments , which bear the primary responsibility for protecting civilians , from the Security Council , and from all others who can help cover the considerable distance still to be travelled if the international community is to find truly effective solutions in this area of acute human need .  
Worthy of particular note in his report was the message conveyed to the Mission by the heads of State of the region , who thought that greater subregional integration in the political , security , economic and social spheres should remain a key objective for the United Nations family if durable solutions to conflict and to the tragic humanitarian suffering that accompanies conflict are to be secured .  
It is clear that the Government of Iraq is indifferent to the humanitarian dimension of this issue , because it refuses to resume its participation in the meetings of the tripartite committee and its technical subcommittee , whose meetings it boycotted in January 1998 on the basis of unjustifiable political pretexts despite the humanitarian suffering of those innocent prisoners , their families and loved ones .  
We also called for an overhaul of this regime to put an end to the suffering of the Iraqi people by enabling Iraq to import all its basic humanitarian needs , medical supplies , foodstuffs and educational material , without requiring the prior consent of the Council .  
The United Nations will be hard pressed to defend itself against this charge in the face of substantive cumulative evidence much of it gathered by its own agencies that comprehensive sanctions against Iraq have resulted in the severe suffering of innocent civilians and caused profound socio-economic dislocations .  
In his speech at the beginning of this month at the annual conference of his party , Mr . Tony Blair , Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , referring to a moral duty to provide international military and humanitarian assistance to any country in need , stressed that if the world continued to ignore the suffering of the African nations , like the Democratic Republic of the Congo , ravaged by war , that would incite anger and frustration that could threaten global stability . 
The international community should therefore renew its support for the Office by at least maintaining the level of its contributions thereby enabling it , until such time as definitive solutions were found , to relieve human suffering , particularly in the developing countries , which received the largest number of refugees .  
The representative of Norway said that developing countries , which were already suffering from falling commodity prices , debt problems and insufficient ODA flows , were particularly vulnerable to a slowdown in economic growth in the developed countries .  
Encourages the continuing efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reduce the prison population by releasing minors , elderly prisoners , prisoners suffering from terminal illness and suspects with incomplete files who were detained for their alleged involvement in genocide and other abuses of human rights , urges the Government of Rwanda to accelerate these efforts and reaffirms the urgent need to complete a dossier for every detainee with a view to identifying those who should be released immediately , early or conditionally , while expressing concern at the high number of detainees still awaiting trial ;  
Affirms that the term violence against women means any act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life , and including domestic violence , crimes committed in the name of honour , crimes committed in the name of passion , traditional practices harmful to women , including female genital mutilation , and forced marriages ;  
Encourages the continuing efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reduce the prison population by releasing minors , elderly prisoners , prisoners suffering from terminal illness and suspects with incomplete files who were detained for their alleged involvement in genocide and other abuses of human rights , urges the Government of Rwanda to accelerate these efforts and reaffirms the urgent need to complete a dossier for every detainee with a view to identifying those who should be released immediately , early or conditionally , while expressing concern at the high number of detainees still awaiting trial ,  
The suffering of large numbers of children especially infants and nursing mothers from lack of primary health care , basic health services and malnutrition or unbalanced diets , lack of clean drinking water and proper sanitation , especially in rural and desert areas , poor districts and refugee camps , increased hazards of environmental pollution , dangers of the spread of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) and lack of care provided to children with special needs ;  
The suffering of Palestinian children caused by Israeli acts of aggression aimed at killing and maiming children , coupled with the lack of facilities to shelter them , Israels abandonment of all values and human rights and its flouting of all international instruments , and its refusal to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories and to establish a just peace in accordance with the legitimate decisions of the international community , causing heightened suffering among the Arab population under occupation and denying their children all the rights enshrined in the precepts of God and humanitarian law .  
We recognize and admit that slavery and the slave trade , other forms of servitude , conquest and colonialism were the primary sources and manifestation / a source of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and condemn the injustices that were committed , especially against Africans , people of African descent and indigenous peoples and stress the need for all States which were engaged in such practices to acknowledge the grave human suffering they caused and the heinous racist acts committed ;  
Action is required at all levels national , regional and worldwide and in many areas : disarmament , peacekeeping and peace-building , combating organized crime , ensuring the responsibility of producer and consumer States , without forgetting the need , in parallel , to pursue the whole range of actions to prevent and combat the underlying causes of conflicts .  For the moment , a single aim must nevertheless inspire us , that of responding to the problem of human suffering and insecurity .  
The definition tries to capture the dimension of human suffering that is missing from many formal descriptions of food insecurity : the unbearable , nagging dread that tortures starving persons from the moment they wake up .  How , during the day that lies ahead , will they be able to feed their family , provide nourishment for their children and feed themselves ?  
The terrible dimension of human suffering , so often missing from formal descriptions of food insecurity , is the unbearable , nagging dread that tortures undernourished persons from the moment they wake up .  
Concrete and verified information about massive displacements of people , security conditions , and violations of international humanitarian and human rights law can be vital for distressed populations and international aid workers alike .  Where communications are disrupted , using the media to inform distressed populations about the activities of relief agencies , and about the location of shelter , food , water and medical services , can be critical for alleviating human suffering .  
It also noted with deep concern the continuing pattern of human rights violations in Afghanistan and the continuation of armed hostilities and the complex nature of the conflict , including its ethnic , religious and political aspects , which had resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement .  
My Governments continued call for a comprehensive ceasefire in the war-affected areas in the south will obviously , if implemented , alleviate the suffering of the civilian population in those areas and provide a conducive atmosphere for a peaceful settlement of the conflict .  
It is easy to see that we are dealing with an act devoid of any military objective whose sole aim was simply to spread death , suffering and destruction of our people in the most atrocious way .  
It is no exaggeration to say that the world situation is complex and difficult in view of the fact that our world today is rife with international conflicts that we have not been able to settle and chronic crises awaiting solutions that would break the spiral of violence and suffering threatening our human existence .  
In that Opinion , the Court stated that , given the unique characteristics of those weapons , in particular their destructive capacity , their capacity to cause untold human suffering , and their ability to cause damage to generations to come , the threat or use of nuclear weapons would be a potential catastrophe .  
Cuba was very familiar with international terrorism , since for over 40 years it had been a victim of countless terrorist activities instigated from abroad , which had caused substantial material losses and loss of life and inflicted incalculable suffering on Cuban citizens .  
These are of fundamental importance in assuring that the customary rules of international humanitarian law governing the choice of weapons are faithfully applied to specific weapons likely to have indiscriminate effects and cause suffering beyond military necessity or which simply are abhorrent .  
We are aware that it would have been impossible to take on the problems that have concerned us without facing up to the complexity of the history of mankind in terms both of its own interpretation of the repeated suffering of millions of beings and of the constantly renewed hopes of the prospect of equality and justice and of the ongoing attempt by women and men to build a better material and spiritual life .  
Expressing its grave concern about the decades of conflict in Afghanistan , which has caused massive loss of life , extensive human suffering , destruction of property , serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure , refugee flows and other forcible displacements of large numbers of people ,  
Welcoming the timely preparation of operational plans by the United Nations in response to the latest humanitarian crisis , and affirming the urgent need to reinforce international emergency assistance to Afghanistan in order to alleviate the human suffering and restore basic services ,  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies in the past few years , in particular in armed conflicts and in post-conflict situations , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , in particular of civilians , the suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of the countries affected , in particular those of developing countries ,  
Torture means the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering , whether physical or mental , upon a person in the custody or under the control of the accused ; except that torture shall not include pain or suffering arising only from , inherent in or incidental to , lawful sanctions ;
