People-owned enterprises which got rich ahead of others " thought of the sources for their wealth , " actively made contributions back to society , participated in the activities of supporting the poor , supported the Hope Project , gave donations to assist elderly people who lived alone without help , and performed positive functions in the struggle against floods and other natural disasters and providing relief for people in the disaster-stricken areas .  
Some localities have established " morality appraisal discussion meetings " , organized " workers ' public explanation groups " , held " city and town forums " and " instruction classes by experienced elderly Party members " , carried out " neighborhood Party member contact cards " and " systems for volunteer service time deposits " for bringing into play the role of the " five elderly " elderly cadres , elderly teachers , elderly workers , and elderly model workers .  
From bustling cities to remote countryside , from gray-haired elderly people to children , and from people of all nationalities at home to overseas Chinese and people of Chinese origin living abroad - - everyone 's heart was with Wang Wei , everyone 's attention was drawn to the South China Sea , and everyone kept a close eye on every development and news about the rescue work .  
( 11 ) The interested parties are social public welfare institutions and social welfare enterprises in the charge of civil administrative departments such as welfare institutes , orphanages , homes for the elderly , hospitals for disabled servicemen and family members of martyrs and servicemen , mental hospitals , and SOS [ as published , acronym given in English ] children villages .  
Jia Qinglin stressed that the general requirement for the work of elderly cadres in the Beijing Municipality in a period of time to come should be closely revolving round the overall situation of the capital 's work and focusing on grasping well the political treatment and living treatment for elder cadres to fulfill all policies for elderly cadres , strengthen their ideological and political work , and strive to create excellent conditions for the care , medical treatment , teaching , learning , activities , and entertainment of elder cadres .  
certain headway has been attained in the undertakings of welfare , health care , culture , education , and sports for the elderly ; and both the living standards and the life quality of the old have been improved on a constant basis .  All these progresses and achievements attained in the work towards the aged are now playing an important part in pushing forward the economic construction and social development of our country .  
Under the conditions of a socialist market economy , carrying forward and developing the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation , giving rise to a sound common practice of respecting , providing for , assisting the elderly in society , and building up a harmonious relationship between different generations is a major content for our current socialist spiritual civilization building .  
It is important to vigorously carry forward and develop the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation ; launch a society-wide moral education on the need to respect , provide for , and assist the old ; and to give form to a sound common practice of respecting , caring for , and helping the elderly in the entire society in combination with the activity of creating civilized communities , civilized villages and towns , and civilized families .  
It is important to bring into play the roles of the elderly ; and according to the principle of integrating voluntary participation with one 's actual ability and integrating the demands of the society with one 's personal interests , the elderly should be encouraged to participate in activities of educating the younger generation , passing on scientific and cultural knowledge , providing consulting services , and taking part in social welfare undertakings and in the spiritual civilization building of their communities .  
Active efforts should be made to study and explore new forms and new methods for strengthening and improving the ideological and political work among the elderly under the present new situation , and to carry out the ideological and political work among the elderly in a practical , flexible , thoroughgoing , and meticulous manner , so that the great majority of old people can enjoy a colorful , healthy , and civilized way of living in their remaining years .  
" It is inappropriate and often misleading to describe the actual change in households ' well-being without taking into account the various welfare provisions by the Government including free-subsidised education service , low cost public housing , free medical care , retraining and other government subvented welfare services all of which contribute to improving the living standard of the disabled , the elderly , the single parents and the low income households , " the spokesman added . 
The Chief Executive exchanged views with the officers on the challenges ahead .  These include a rapidly ageing population and improved services for the elderly , social integration , encouraging and mobilising family support in caring for family members , the promotion of volunteerism and the need to build a caring community .  
Announcing this today ( Sunday ) , a DH spokesman said : " Applicants for nursing home care must be elderly persons aged 65 or above who are suffering from one or more medical conditions that are stabilised but which have caused functional disability and loss of personal care ability , and who require regular and basic medical and nursing care . "  
The spokesman stressed that the scheme is not another type of care and attention home for the elderly but a specific housing initiative with integrated domestic and supportive components to enable the elderly to ' age in place ' and enjoy ' healthy ageing . ' "  
By the 1990 ' s , all services were becoming well - established .  The Social Welfare Department puts in much effort to develop a holistic approach by providing preventive , developmental , supportive and remedial services for those in need .  Its service programmes also include family and child welfare , youth and community development , elderly , rehabilitation , medical social service and social security , etc .  
In consideration of the huge demand of the elderly for services of care and attention homes , the Government pledged , in the Policy Address last year , to allocate substantial resources to increase the supply of residential care places .  An additional 3 300 places in subvented residential care homes and 1 400 places in subvented nursing homes will be provided between 1998 and 2002 .  Besides , the number of bought places in private residential care homes will be increased by 2 400 from 1998 to 2001 .  
" In addition , applicants aged over 60 and have special social , medical or health needs are eligible for admission into welfare institutions / elderly homes or public housing through compassionate rehousing . "  
" In addition , applicants aged over 60 and have special social , medical or health needs are eligible for admission into welfare institutions / elderly homes or public housing through compassionate rehousing . "  
There was a direct correlation between the level of air pollution and admissions to hospital for respiratory illness which led to a loss of productivity ; a loss of intellectual capital as sick children miss part of their schooling ; the social cost of the elderly requiring greater care and attention and the effect of dirty air in putting off tourists or potential business migrants .  
The whole Complex occupies a total floor area of 40,000 square metres It consists of five service blocks and houses 25 adult rehabilitation services units .  Different types of rehabilitation services are provided , including a sheltered workshop , two hostels for the moderately mentally handicapped ; three care and attention homes for the severely disabled ; six day activity centres and six hostels for the severely mentally handicapped ; seven homes for the visually impaired elderly .  
Question : It is reported that on April 5 , a bus driver allegedly closed the boarding gate and started the bus without noticing that an elderly man was still boarding the bus .  As a result , the old man got his leg trapped by the boarding gate and was dragged along and injured , and it was found that no sensory device was installed on the boarding gate of the bus involved in the incident .  
The Administration has implemented the Senior Citizen Card Scheme ( SCC Scheme ) to foster respect for the elderly by encouraging the private and public sectors to provide price concessions or priority services for senior citizens .  We are delighted to note that franchised bus operators and the two provisional municipal councils have also joined in to promote respect for the elderly .  
Main achievements in the past year include the commissioning of over 3,500 subsidized residential care places for the elderly ; shortening the waiting time for care-and-attention places to an average of 18 months ; launching of pilot schemes to provide dementia units at some care-and-attention homes and day care centres for the elderly ; increasing the number of licensed private residential care homes from 41 to 242 ; and providing enhanced home care services to the elderly living at home .  
To enable elderly people to lead an active and meaningful life in their golden years , Dr Yeoh said the Social Welfare Department , Education Department and voluntary organizations had been providing them a range of continuing education courses , as well as social and recreational activities .  
The spokesman appealed to the SSA staff to follow the civil service team to uphold their duties and responsibilities under limited resources in the benefit of the general public , especially the social security recipients were mostly the elderly , the disabled and those in need of urgent financial assistance .  
Other than the above measures and services , we will enhance the functioning of the family through family life education and counselling , strengthen our existing services including emergency placement in residential care homes for elderly people in urgent need , social networking services for vulnerable elderly people , and referrals for medical , psychological and psychiatric treatment where necessary . 
Moreover , Radio 5 , in cooperation with social services agencies and tertiary institutions , will be launching a radio programme for the elderly .  The programme , which will focus on cultural , education and medical information , aims to provide a systematic and practical continuing education course for the elderly .  
" Since this is also the first plan for the new millennium , five focus areas have been identified as the Authority 's highlights to be addressed in the coming years , " said a spokesman for the Authority . These five areas are enhancing building quality , meeting elderly housing demand , facilitating greater private sector participation , providing a wider choice for customers and contributing to urban renewal .  
( iv ) Sexual abuse - any act which involves unwanted or forcible touching / activity of a sexual nature or a situation in which an elderly person with physical and mental disabilities submits to sexual activity without consent .  
Research reveals that , in some countries such as Australia and England , there is no specific legislation on elder abuse .  They rely on other legislations to provide the necessary legislative protection but place emphasis on other measures , such as public education and enhanced training for professional and front-line staff giving care to the frail elderly , etc .  
Director of Home Affairs , Mrs Shelley Lau , who joined Mr Tung in walking around the display of artistic and craft skills performed by the elderly , noted : " Many of the elderly are leading meaningful lives in retirement by working as volunteers in helping the handicapped or underprivileged and playing an active part in various community events . 
The people of Hong Kong have always strived for self-improvement .  We attach great importance to education , respect the elderly , care for the children , and are always ready to help in a worthy cause .  These qualities are often displayed in various aspects of our community .  Our international outlook and prompt response to new technological and scientific advances are the major factors of Hong Kong 's continued success .  
We will put in place an enhanced gatekeeping mechanism by the summer of 2000 to target subsidized residential care service to the frail elderly with genuine need so that their waiting time can be shortened . 
( c ) The Social Welfare Department considers each application for transfer on compassionate grounds on its own merits , taking into account special social and medical reasons as well as problems of the elderly applicant that can not be resolved by means other than transfer to another public rental housing flat . 
Dr Yeoh noted that apart from a safety net for the needy , the vulnerable and the disadvantaged , there was a range of preventive , developmental and support services , as well as remedial services for those who required assistance .  These include services for the elderly , the family , the youth , and the disabled .  
The Government is fully committed to providing quality welfare services for those in need .  There is now in place a safety net for the needy , the vulnerable and the disadvantaged .  In addition , there is a range of preventive , developmental and support services , as well as remedial services for those who are vulnerable and require such assistance .  These include services for the elderly , the family , the youth , and the disabled .  
Firstly , the waiting time for public rental flats for the single elderly has been reduced from four years in 1997 to three years at present on average as a result of the implementation of the elderly priority scheme and provision of additional rental flats for the elderly by the Housing Authority .  
On housing strategy , Dr Cheng said the Authority will implement the initiatives to reduce the average waiting time for public rental housing ( PRH ) flats to three years by 2003 , reduce partially the production of subsidized home ownership flats and replace them by an equivalent number of loans , increase the supply of PRH for the elderly in need , review the design of flats for the elderly and consider the use of rental subsidies to satisfy the housing needs of prospective elderly tenants .  
The society has transformed and the economy restructured with the passage of time .  While the idea of raising children as a protection for the old age is becoming out dated , the population is ageing rapidly as ever .  It is imperative that a suitable protection system should be put in place in order to provide the elderly with a reliable source of income after retirement .  
( c ) of the number of elderly persons who received the disability allowance and , among them , the respective numbers of those who were not allowed to apply for the normal or higher old age allowance because they had been granted the disability allowance , in each of the past two years ; as well as the annual amount of old age allowance required to be paid out if these persons were granted the allowance ?  
Because the severely disabled and the elderly infirm were considered to have extra needs , the original objectives of the scheme were to give some financial help to the families concerned and to reduce demand for institutional care for these two groups .  
During a chat with elderly citizens , Mr Tsang reassured them that there would always be a social safety net for Hong Kong 's senior citizens , the needy , the underprivileged and the vulnerable .  
I am pleased to know that the Government 's initiatives to improve the elderly services are already bearing fruit .  Over the past three years and a half , we have made a good deal of efforts .  The provisions for elderly welfare services will be increased twofold from $ 1.6 billion in the financial year 1997-98 to $ 3.2 billion in the next financial year .  
The cleansing teams will help needy residents , such as the elderly and the disabled , to remove discarded articles and rubbish accumulated in common areas of their buildings , including roofs , staircases , canopies and rear lanes .  
Also at today 's meeting , the Authority approved a pilot Rent Allowance for Elderly Scheme ( RAES ) , which had been endorsed by its Rental Housing Committee ( RHC ) earlier this month .  The pilot scheme , to be launched in August , will provide rental subsidies to 500 eligible elderly applicants as an additional choice of accommodation in the private sector .  
He pointed out that in caring for the elderly , the government was aiming at holistic care which addressed the financial , physical and social needs of Hong Kong 's senior citizens .  
Moreover , over 200 000 elderly persons aged 60 or above participated in free activities organized by the LCSD last year .  The most popular activities include swimming , Tai Chi , Tai Chi sword , social dance , physical exercises , go chess , gateball , lawn bowls , day camp , excursion , outreach programmes , etc .  
The scheme gives elderly applicants a choice of rent allowance to lease private accommodation in lieu of PRH when their turn for flat allocation is due .  They can also switch back to PRH after the expiry of the two-year RAES term .  Mr Ho said response to the current scheme has been satisfactory .  So far the Department has received 257 applications as against the 500-quota , with 202 Approvals-in-Principle issued and 46 payments effected .  
The advertisements portrayed the elderly as senile and pathetic , making a strong association between the elderly and death .  Such portrayals were insensitive and denigrating to the elderly , and would be considered objectionable to a substantial section of the community .  
More than half of our elderly population live in subsidised public housing .  Through a number of priority housing schemes for them , the number of elderly households on the Waiting List for public rental flats has been reduced from 16 000 in 1997 to the current 7 900 , and the average waiting time from 3 years to about 1.5 years .  
In the coming years , our elderly services will aim at providing better support to elders in need and co-ordinating community and institutional care services .  For example , public rental estates with a high concentration of older people will be provided with integrated care services .  We will also organise more intergenerational activities in communities to help our elders enjoy healthy and active ageing .  
It was reported that on 8th and 11th of this month respectively , an elderly man jumped onto the track at a MTR station and was crushed to death by a train and a young man plunged to his death from a building .  Their badly mutilated bodies covered in blood were not removed from the scenes until after more than three hours , causing emotional disturbance to many passers-by who saw the dead bodies .  
In addition to dental care education programmes for elders , the second round will include programmes devoted to cultivating elders ' interest in leisure activities such as organic farming and stargazing .  These programmes will be organized by professional bodies and interest groups which have hitherto little involvement with elderly affairs .  
A total of eight Two-way Permit holders , comprising seven women and one man aged from 31 to 43 , were arrested in six elderly homes .  Among them , three were found to be in possession of forged Hong Kong identity card .  They were all suspected to have worked as casual workers with a monthly salary ranging from $ 2,500 to $ 5,500 .  
" As Norwalk-like virus is commonly found in sewage-contaminated water .  Shellfish , particularly raw oyster , harvested from polluted water are prone to contamination .  Vulnerable groups like the young , the elderly , pregnant women and immuno-compromised people are strongly advised not to consume raw oysters as they are likely to suffer from the more severe forms of the disease arising from the viral infection , " she warned .  
The motion , to be moved by Hon CHAN yuen-han , says : " That , as the current economic and employment situations remain acute , and low-income earners and the poor elderly who are not receiving the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance are very hard up , this Council urges the Government to provide them with different forms of assistance or allowances in transport , medical , housing and education services , etc . , so as to improve the livelihood of these people and their families and relieve the pressure on them . "  
We consider that it is necessary to maintain public broadcasting service to complement commercial broadcasting services and to cater to the needs of a broad spectrum of audiences .  Examples of such complementary functions are the promotion of Putonghua and English , as well as culture and arts ; and the provision of programmes on parental education , elderly and childhood education , civic education for the youth , fight-crime and anti-smoking campaigns , and medical and health awareness .  
" The Immigration Department , the Social Welfare Department and the Labour Department continued to conduct a joint operation to combat against illegal employment in elderly homes at Dills Corner situated in Kwu Tung , Sheung Shui . One foreign visitor suspected to have breached her condition of stay and in possession of a forged Hong Kong identity card was arrested , " a spokesman for the Immigration Department said today ( February 19 ) .  
Following from the social philosophy and the four pillars I have just mentioned , the Government in the past five and a half years has put in a lot of resources and efforts to provide care and assistance for the physical and psychosocial well-being of the elderly , and to assist the disadvantaged , the poor and the unemployed with an emphasis on enhancing , not impeding , their will to self-reliance . 
It is essential for us to look far ahead to find feasible and practical ways to develop a sustainable financial support system for the needy elderly .  
The motion , to be moved by Hon Frederick FUNG , says " That , as the Government will introduce very shortly a new charging scheme for public health care services and , in parallel , enhance the existing medical fee waiver mechanism , this Council urges the Government to relax the eligibility criteria under the mechanism so as to benefit more people from the socially disadvantaged groups , such as elderly persons , low-income earners and chronic patients . "  
At present , the Social Welfare Department ( SWD ) provides residential services for people with disabilities and the elderly primarily through financial subventions to non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) .  Amongst these residential services , Long Stay Care Homes are for mentally ill patients with long-term residual disabilities whilst Hostels for Mentally Handicapped Persons are for people with varying degrees of mental handicap .  Residential services for elders suffering from poor health or physical / mental weaknesses are provided in Care and Attention Homes ( including those for the Aged Blind ) and Nursing Homes .  
( c ) To facilitate elderly and disabled persons to use estate facilities , the Housing Department will incorporate enhancement works in the maintenance and improvement programmes for existing public housing estates where practicable .  Such enhancements include provision of handrails , access signage for less mobile persons , ramps for entering housing blocks , and dropped kerbs next to pedestrian paths .  They are in line with the guidelines set out in the " Design Manual : Barrier Free Access 1997 " issued by the Buildings Department .  
During the eight-day intensive meetings in Hong Kong , members of the SARS Expert Committee examined the management of the SARS epidemic to establish the relevant facts .  This was done through site visits and meetings with a wide range of stakeholders including board chairman and members and senior executives of the Hospital Authority , health officials , legislators , frontline health workers , Amoy Gardens residents ' representatives , operators of elderly homes and local medical and public health experts .  
Home visits have also been paid to elderly families to send out the message and render possible assistance .  Mr . Lau called on public housing tenants to maintain good personal hygiene habits by keeping their home and the estates clean .  He reiterated the idea of nourishing a new culture on cleanliness in public housing estates , adding that the marking scheme was only meant for the very minority of tenants who jeopardize the tidiness of the environment in irresponsible and inconsiderate acts .  
( a ) As institutions are more prone to outbreak of infectious diseases , and frail elders are more susceptible to complications if they become infected with influenza , the Department of Health ( DH ) has since 1998 implemented an annual influenza vaccination programme for residents in residential care homes for the elderly ( RCHEs ) . 
Her ideal of returning to nature by growing flowers first took root then . One day as she was driving through the countryside , she came across a piece of fallow land owned by an elderly couple who agreed to rent it to her for US $ 150 a month .  
Section Sixteen : Dependents of overseas Chinese leaving the country to live with relatives shall include : a ) spouses b ) parents and children c ) foster parents and adopted children d ) persons whose presence is required by elderly people and minors e ) underage siblings and children who can not be supported by their parents and must rely on relatives living overseas f ) others who must leave the country to support themselves must exhibit written proof of need .  
In the social sciences , economics and public finance are the most promising departments , while the continued rise of the population 's median age will mean an increased demand for social workers to provide services for the elderly . However , limitations on the number of candidates who can pass the bar examinations make law a rather " cold " field .  
In Kuo 's extended family , the more than forty children belonging to her generation , starting at age three , were instructed by an elderly teacher in the family 's private schoolroom , where they studied the Three Character Classic , the Thousand Character Classic , the Four Books , and the Five Classics , practiced calligraphy , and learned how to compose in literary Chinese , before going on to junior high school at age fourteen .  
This has received attention because : ( a ) The proportion of the elderly in the population has increased ; they hope to continue to study and fill out their lives . ( b ) People demand satisfaction in their spiritual lives as the standard of living rises . ( c ) Constant technological change requires opportunities for continuing education .  
However , in the face of this rapidly growing cohort , all countries have exhibited chaos . Some elderly are rejected from the nuclear family or are thought of as an unproductive burden on the national economy . Even more disconcerting is that health care for the elderly can lead not only to family frictions , but can overwhelm national health care systems . Aging is an unavoidable process for us .  
Out at the rustic chicken restaurant you take a hot spring bath first to work up a good appetite , then a meal of coq-au-vin in the fresh mountain air leaves you feeling wonderfully relaxed , " says free-range chicken aficionado Mr . Ch'en . Mt . Shamao has long been famous in northern Taiwan for its hot springs , frequently visited by elderly keep-fit fans .  
Except for the spring and fall ancestral sacrifices and grave sweeping on the Ch'ing-ming festival , few people go there . Just one elderly Japanese quietly accompanies these homesick spirits in the cold winter months longing for a wind from their native land to the south . The Chinese have a saying that " a fallen leaf wants to return to its roots . "  
Ms Lin recalls seeing an elderly person tottering round the shop using an umbrella for support , so she hastened over to recommend a safe and reliable walking stick specially developed for the elderly .  
In other words , the elderly lack a sense of security about the future and do n't want to wait idly for death , so they need another stage on which to play out the remainder of their lives . " Hsieh Tseng Fang-lan believes services of this kind have a promising future , and the response from outside has been most gratifying . The manpower bank has yet to be officially registered but enquiries are pouring in , with a need for services ranging from technical advisers for refrigeration and air-conditioning to electricity meter readers .  
Today , agricultural villages are in a period of transition . The elderly are not accustomed to living with their children in the crowded cities , and they 're unwilling to live in old folk 's homes . If old trees and the environments around them can be preserved , the villages can remain semi-agricultural , the elderly will have places to go , and their spiritual needs will be taken care of , too .  
Seeking for strong potential : According to data from the Directorate-General of Budget , Accounting and Statistics , Executive Yuan , the proportion of over-65s in the Taiwan region will reach 7.1 percent next year , meaning that the ROC meets the United Nations definition for an elderly society . The future will inevitably bring an increase in rates of chronic disease , and transdermal patches can provide a more effective , simpler means of medical treatment . "  
Today , succeeding to traditional tea houses , with modern beverage and packaging technology , it has finally broken through the traditional image of " old man tea " - of elderly gents sipping delicate little cups of hot tea - to display a startling potential for rebirth .  
From national health insurance to basic and earnings-related state pensions for the elderly , the social welfare pie is growing ever larger . Scholars have differing views on the subject , and the average man in the street is increasingly confused .  
Chen Kuan-cheng explains that the typical European and American social security system is an intergenerational transfer of benefits , which is to say that the living expenses of the current elderly are paid by the current young and middle aged . When the current young become the seniors , the next generation will pay the bills .  
Many elderly people who were unable to collect their subsidies ended up accusing the staff of being obstructionist . Moreover , beginning next year the central government will no longer compensate local governments for hiring social workers . It is likely that after many social workers leave their positions , the work of visiting and protecting the handicapped , women , children , and other disadvantaged groups will grind to an even slower pace .  
When he hears talk about the elements now making up the temple milieu he perks up and begins pointing all around , explaining this and that in an amiable and composed way . He points out that the courtyard outside the threshold is a " political zone . " The walkways - - which in a Chinese temple are covered and skirt the outside of the main courtyard - - are occupied by little groups of fortune-tellers , devout Buddhists , and elderly men , each conversing on their own themes .  
Even if there are numerous homes and senior citizen centers that have been set up by government agencies and private organizations which can solve the problems of part of the elderly population , many of these places do not accept people who are indigent , too sick or aged , entirely unable to care for themselves , or who have been abandoned by their families . Most of the elderly at home alone are n't served by the homes and senior citizen centers .  
Sitting on the local as it shook and jiggled , I noticed that most of the other riders were elderly . Some of these grandfathers went so far as to stretch out on the seats for a nap . A grandmother had a shoulder pole with bamboo baskets full of vegetables that she was bringing to market . A few aboriginal women wearing broad-rimmed rain hats and carrying bamboo baskets got off in Tahsi on the way to odd jobs in nearby harbors .  
Lee and other economy class travelers heard passengers from other airlines being taken to hotels , and saw arrangements being made for food and accomodations for the first-class passengers on the Malaysian Airlines flight . However , the sky was already lightening in the east when the elderly and infirm passengers from economy class were taken to a hotel , and the young , strong male passengers in the main cabin were left in the airport right up until the plane returned to Taipei .  
" At that time , the resource most lacking in Tainan 's social services was nursing homes for the elderly . The situation was especially bad for those who were poor or ill or whose families were unable to take care of them , " says Rev . John B . Kung , now Chancellorof the Diocese , but at that time the assistant to Bishop Cheng .  
Farmland can not be sold to anyone who is not a working farmer , and few children want to take over their parents ' farmland . So much farmland is still owned by elderly farmers who are not physically capable of cultivating it . The principle of " farmer-owned and utilized " is binding farmers for life to land that is useless to them . Not yet ready to buy the farm  
As of the end of 1997 , the Catholic church in Taiwan was operating 46 middle and primary schools , two universities , one technical college , 17 homes for the elderly , and seven halfway houses for troubled youth . In addition , various parishes include centers to assist aboriginal people , foreign laborers working in Taiwan ( including many Filipino Catholics ) , and those on the fringes of society .  
The swelling ranks of the elderly will have tremendous implications for the distribution of social resources . To set proper policy requires an adequate grounding of research into seniors ' physical and mental health as well as their economic and family situations .  
Taiwan is by no means unique in encountering a growing number of elderly following rapid economic gains and improvements in the quality of medical care . The experiences of the advanced industrial nations in confronting these problems can serve as a reference for us , but we still need to do some basic homework : carrying out surveys about the different elderly age groups here and achieving general recognition of these problems and a consensus about how to deal with them .  
In an industrial society , as extended families living under one roof have given way to smaller and smaller nuclear families , the family can no longer serve the same functions it once did in supporting the needs of all segments of the population . Yet traditional Eastern attitudes , morality and values rooted in thousands of years of history are not easy to change , and they have a big effect on how policy toward the elderly is set .  
" Those of us engaged in social work appreciate that there is a difference between the ideal and the reality of the situation , " says Li Hsiung , executive director of the Taipei Elders ' Foundation . He feels that the growing prevalence of problems involving the elderly ca n't simply be attributed to a lack of filial piety on the part of their children . He says that the major factors are rather changes in lifestyle and in the family structure .  
" The majority of Taiwanese senior citizens in the US come here to live with their grown children , who mostly have master 's or PhD degrees , and are ' suburban Chinese . ' Because the homes of their children are spread out in middle - and high-class residential areas , unlike members of self-contained urban Chinatowns , elderly Taiwanese suffer great inconvenience if they are unable to communicate in English , " says Peter C . Lee , associate vice-president of the Office of Faculty Affairs at San Jose State University in California .  
In the southern Bay Area , where land is dear , the facilities at the Overseas Chinese Education Center are cramped , and most of the elderly groups try their luck elsewhere . On normal days the groups meet at municipal senior centers , apartment complexes for the elderly that house many seniors from Taiwan , or other places where they share space and resources with people of other ethnic groups .  
Of course , " The road to the Land of the Dead is traveled by old and young alike , " so the elderly and seriously ill are n't the only ones who need to make a will . People in their primes , living hectic , busy lives and under great pressure at work , should also be prepared for death at any moment .  
If we feel old , as if we are not respected and are incapable of doing anything , we quickly find ourselves on the road to depression . If we feel aged , it is easy to become the stereotype of an elderly person-self-absorbed , dissatisfied and inflexible . This is likely to make us still more depressed .  
How the department came into being is a story in itself . Several years ago , a reporter was sent to interview a recently arrested suspect . The suspect wept bitter tears which the reporter assumed stemmed from his impending incarceration . But the suspect surprised the reporter , stating that he was not crying for himself , but was worried about how his elderly parents , his wife and his children would survive with him in jail .  
Mr . Tseng , who makes his living from manufacturing metal parts for pet products , lives with his wife in Hsinchu , where they are both deeply involved in local charity work . They founded the Tong Hsin Volunteer Service Association , whose efforts are focused on services for the elderly and on recycling . They are also both counselors in the Hsinchu Family Education Service Center . Their colleagues consider them a perfect couple .  
An elderly gent named Chang , who left Taiwan 20 years ago and returned a couple of years ago , is amazed when he sees cartoons lampooning national leaders or when radio commentators say national figures ' " brains are on the fritz . " Is this is the same country that he left all those years ago because of its suffocating and oppressive atmosphere ?  
At the end of every year it issues its " indices of human rights in Taiwan . " The association 's Chai Song-lin says that this year Taiwan earned failing marks in all eight categories of human rights : political , children 's , elderly , economic , judicial , educational-cultural , social and women 's rights .  
If we compare him to other Nativist writers who address the tragedy of the rural elderly unable to adapt to the modern industrial world , we note that Huang is reluctant to expose his elderly characters to unmitigated suffering .  
Letting Them Go gathers together ten moving short stories which take as their theme the plight of the elderly in rural communities . The stories respond to the changing circumstances in Taiwan 's countryside , such as the departure of young people for the cities and growing industrial pollution . Speaking in this interview , Huang explicitly stated his purpose in this collection : " I want to bear witness to the plight of the senior citizens left behind in rural communities . "  
Today 's senior citizens laid the foundation upon which Taiwan 's current success was built , but they 've been abandoned in these rural communities . We , their juniors , are an ungrateful generation . Q : Do you feel that transplanting the elderly to the city is a better solution ?  
Last year the Buddha 's Light International Association organized New Year 's Eve dinners in the north , center and south of Taiwan , which were attended by more than 5,000 old folk who live alone . This year they are repeating the exercise , and are including a special event in Nantou County to bring some warmth and love to elderly survivors of the 9 / 21 earthquake there .  
Huang Cheng-hsiung , executive director of World Vision Taiwan , says that people fell over themselves to take in the orphans created by the earthquake , but the elderly got scant help . The main reason is that children who lost both parents received NT $ 2 million in death benefit , whereas most old people whose children died received no benefit since their children were already married .  
On May 10 , an elderly person living alone in an apartment in the Huachang Public Housing Project in Taipei 's Wanhua District was discovered to have passed away at home several days previously , and two women living in neighboring apartments ( one of whom died shortly thereafter ) were apparently infected . The entire community was quickly sealed off , with more than 700 persons subjected to compulsory quarantine , making this the first community in Taiwan to be sealed as a result of a SARS outbreak .  
But the downside of having conquered these illnesses is that the number of patients is constantly falling , so most young doctors prefer to specialize in growth fields like illnesses of advanced industrial societies or problems of the elderly . Virology , bacteriology , and epidemiology are considered " sunset subjects . " The result is that there has been no one to take the baton from the previous generation , and gatherings of specialists in these fields can be mistaken for meetings of a senior citizens group .  
For example , some community workers in Hsiufeng Village in Luku Rural Township started a business with only NT $ 500,000 in capital to repackage Luku tea leaves in an elegant and appealing way , and by playing on the heartwarming story behind the sale of the tea : paying for the continued operation of a cafeteria for local elderly people who live alone .  
When you first hear the term " art therapy , " it seems very mysterious . But in fact , art therapy is one kind of psychological therapy and like any other psychological therapy , its object can be differentiated based on health status ( the mentally ill and those with non-clinical mental health problems ) , on age ( children , adolescents , the middle-aged , the elderly ) , on type of illness , or stage of illness ( early , terminal ) , on patterns of behavior ( smokers , non-smokers ) and so forth .  
There have long been radio stations-especially those that have a clearly defined regional identity and announcers with that down-home accent-which , after broadcasting a few popular songs , start in on sales pitches in fluent , authentic Taiwanese .

He gives half the income from the restaurant to charity , and once a month he hosts a free dinner for a guest list that includes volunteer teachers and lonely elderly people with no families . He also works to promote environmental , conservation , and animal-rights values in the PRC , so that the vegetarian outlook on life can set down deeper roots , and not just be limited to eating habits or health .  
Looking at the question from the " support " side , elderly people have more financial and physical ability to look after themselves , so aged parents no longer need to rely on their children . Also , young people are now putting off marriage until much later , so they have much more time under their personal control . Finally , young people have their own marketable skills and incomes , so they do n't need to be under the thumb of their parents . For all these reasons , a carefree life seems a good choice .  
To put into practice this ideal of caring for the elderly , Shikatsu-once voted Japan 's best town-has allocated close to 1.5% of its annual budget to the museum and library , and an astonishing amount of human and physical resources have been put into them .  
Unexpected was the fact that children very much hoped to live with their elderly parents and conform to the traditional model of filial piety in this regard , while the image they had for themselves in old age was rather untraditional . Future plans for almost half of them tended toward living with their spouses only or living alone ( 43.9% ) , and they also stressed economic independence ( 44.4% ) .  
Another and most troubling phenomenon for researchers is that as a self-supporting economic unit caring for the elderly and looking after children , the number of economically disadvantaged families has increased in recent years , and the gap between rich and poor households has widened .  
She begins by developing their understanding of their bodies through drawing their genitals , giving self-evaluations , charting menstrual cycles , learning to put on a condom , and studying other contraceptive methods before moving on to the psychological side with work on self-affirmation and interpersonal relations . Ultimately , she asks the students to confront the issues of birth , aging , illness and death by having them interview elderly persons , share their feelings about caring for grandparents who have been the victims of strokes , and write a living will .  
FRTRI director Liu Pao-pao , who has designed rock-climbing shoes and medical footwear for the elderly , says , " If we had presented medical footwear for specific professions or elderly people to the public ten years ago , we would not have been able to sell them . But Taiwan has entered the modern age . These days , people are much more health conscious and are willing to spend money to take care of themselves .  
China formulated the " China Development Plan of Work on Ageing , " in which the Chinese Government " set specific goals for the work , that the elderly people being supported , enjoying medical care , contributive to the society , engaging in life long learning and enjoying a happy life , " he said

Other issues examined included : the economic , social and cultural factors that encourage the expectation that women will take care of the elderly ; whether care-giver is a universal female identity ; and widowhood and how it is affected by the economic and demographic changes occurring in different parts of the world .  
Efforts must be made to harmonize economic and social development , achieve a more equitable distribution of income , promote gender equity and implement proactive social policies , with special emphasis on the needs of the most vulnerable groups , such as children , women , the disabled , the elderly , indigenous persons and the unemployed .

This consists of consolidating the activities of associations working with the elderly , strengthening work in the specialized medical and paramedical areas , validating the role of older people by benefiting from their experience and knowledge and providing permanent assistance to 3 , 100 vulnerable older people in the context of the national programme for the protection of older people .

Under the conditions of a socialist market economy , carrying forward and developing the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation , giving rise to a sound common practice of respecting , providing for , assisting the elderly in society , and building up a harmonious relationship between different generations is a major content for our current socialist spiritual civilization building .

"  
The spokesman stressed that the scheme is not another type of care and attention home for the elderly but a specific housing initiative with integrated domestic and supportive components to enable the elderly to ' age in place ' and enjoy ' healthy ageing . ' "  
By the 1990 ' s , all services were becoming well - established .  The Social Welfare Department puts in much effort to develop a holistic approach by providing preventive , developmental , supportive and remedial services for those in need .  Its service programmes also include family and child welfare , youth and community development , elderly , rehabilitation , medical social service and social security , etc .  
In consideration of the huge demand of the elderly for services of care and attention homes , the Government pledged , in the Policy Address last year , to allocate substantial resources to increase the supply of residential care places .  An additional 3 300 places in subvented residential care homes and 1 400 places in subvented nursing homes will be provided between 1998 and 2002 .  Besides , the number of bought places in private residential care homes will be increased by 2 400 from 1998 to 2001 .  
" In addition , applicants aged over 60 and have special social , medical or health needs are eligible for admission into welfare institutions / elderly homes or public housing through compassionate rehousing . "

The Administration has implemented the Senior Citizen Card Scheme ( SCC Scheme ) to foster respect for the elderly by encouraging the private and public sectors to provide price concessions or priority services for senior citizens .  We are delighted to note that franchised bus operators and the two provisional municipal councils have also joined in to promote respect for the elderly .  
Main achievements in the past year include the commissioning of over 3,500 subsidized residential care places for the elderly ; shortening the waiting time for care-and-attention places to an average of 18 months ; launching of pilot schemes to provide dementia units at some care-and-attention homes and day care centres for the elderly ; increasing the number of licensed private residential care homes from 41 to 242 ; and providing enhanced home care services to the elderly living at home .  
To enable elderly people to lead an active and meaningful life in their golden years , Dr Yeoh said the Social Welfare Department , Education Department and voluntary organizations had been providing them a range of continuing education courses , as well as social and recreational activities .  
The spokesman appealed to the SSA staff to follow the civil service team to uphold their duties and responsibilities under limited resources in the benefit of the general public , especially the social security recipients were mostly the elderly , the disabled and those in need of urgent financial assistance .  
Other than the above measures and services , we will enhance the functioning of the family through family life education and counselling , strengthen our existing services including emergency placement in residential care homes for elderly people in urgent need , social networking services for vulnerable elderly people , and referrals for medical , psychological and psychiatric treatment where necessary . 
Moreover , Radio 5 , in cooperation with social services agencies and tertiary institutions , will be launching a radio programme for the elderly .  The programme , which will focus on cultural , education and medical information , aims to provide a systematic and practical continuing education course for the elderly .  
" Since this is also the first plan for the new millennium , five focus areas have been identified as the Authority 's highlights to be addressed in the coming years , " said a spokesman for the Authority . These five areas are enhancing building quality , meeting elderly housing demand , facilitating greater private sector participation , providing a wider choice for customers and contributing to urban renewal .  
( iv ) Sexual abuse - any act which involves unwanted or forcible touching / activity of a sexual nature or a situation in which an elderly person with physical and mental disabilities submits to sexual activity without consent .  
Research reveals that , in some countries such as Australia and England , there is no specific legislation on elder abuse .  They rely on other legislations to provide the necessary legislative protection but place emphasis on other measures , such as public education and enhanced training for professional and front-line staff giving care to the frail elderly , etc .  
Director of Home Affairs , Mrs Shelley Lau , who joined Mr Tung in walking around the display of artistic and craft skills performed by the elderly , noted : " Many of the elderly are leading meaningful lives in retirement by working as volunteers in helping the handicapped or underprivileged and playing an active part in various community events . 
The people of Hong Kong have always strived for self-improvement .  We attach great importance to education , respect the elderly , care for the children , and are always ready to help in a worthy cause .  These qualities are often displayed in various aspects of our community .  Our international outlook and prompt response to new technological and scientific advances are the major factors of Hong Kong 's continued success .  
We will put in place an enhanced gatekeeping mechanism by the summer of 2000 to target subsidized residential care service to the frail elderly with genuine need so that their waiting time can be shortened . 
( c ) The Social Welfare Department considers each application for transfer on compassionate grounds on its own merits , taking into account special social and medical reasons as well as problems of the elderly applicant that can not be resolved by means other than transfer to another public rental housing flat . 
Dr Yeoh noted that apart from a safety net for the needy , the vulnerable and the disadvantaged , there was a range of preventive , developmental and support services , as well as remedial services for those who required assistance .  These include services for the elderly , the family , the youth , and the disabled .  
The Government is fully committed to providing quality welfare services for those in need .  There is now in place a safety net for the needy , the vulnerable and the disadvantaged .  In addition , there is a range of preventive , developmental and support services , as well as remedial services for those who are vulnerable and require such assistance .  These include services for the elderly , the family , the youth , and the disabled .  
Firstly , the waiting time for public rental flats for the single elderly has been reduced from four years in 1997 to three years at present on average as a result of the implementation of the elderly priority scheme and provision of additional rental flats for the elderly by the Housing Authority .  
On housing strategy , Dr Cheng said the Authority will implement the initiatives to reduce the average waiting time for public rental housing ( PRH ) flats to three years by 2003 , reduce partially the production of subsidized home ownership flats and replace them by an equivalent number of loans , increase the supply of PRH for the elderly in need , review the design of flats for the elderly and consider the use of rental subsidies to satisfy the housing needs of prospective elderly tenants .  
The society has transformed and the economy restructured with the passage of time .  While the idea of raising children as a protection for the old age is becoming out dated , the population is ageing rapidly as ever .  It is imperative that a suitable protection system should be put in place in order to provide the elderly with a reliable source of income after retirement .  
( c ) of the number of elderly persons who received the disability allowance and , among them , the respective numbers of those who were not allowed to apply for the normal or higher old age allowance because they had been granted the disability allowance , in each of the past two years ; as well as the annual amount of old age allowance required to be paid out if these persons were granted the allowance ?  
Because the severely disabled and the elderly infirm were considered to have extra needs , the original objectives of the scheme were to give some financial help to the families concerned and to reduce demand for institutional care for these two groups .  
During a chat with elderly citizens , Mr Tsang reassured them that there would always be a social safety net for Hong Kong 's senior citizens , the needy , the underprivileged and the vulnerable .  
I am pleased to know that the Government 's initiatives to improve the elderly services are already bearing fruit .  Over the past three years and a half , we have made a good deal of efforts .  The provisions for elderly welfare services will be increased twofold from $ 1.6 billion in the financial year 1997-98 to $ 3.2 billion in the next financial year .  
The cleansing teams will help needy residents , such as the elderly and the disabled , to remove discarded articles and rubbish accumulated in common areas of their buildings , including roofs , staircases , canopies and rear lanes .  
Also at today 's meeting , the Authority approved a pilot Rent Allowance for Elderly Scheme ( RAES ) , which had been endorsed by its Rental Housing Committee ( RHC ) earlier this month .  The pilot scheme , to be launched in August , will provide rental subsidies to 500 eligible elderly applicants as an additional choice of accommodation in the private sector .  
He pointed out that in caring for the elderly , the government was aiming at holistic care which addressed the financial , physical and social needs of Hong Kong 's senior citizens .  
Moreover , over 200 000 elderly persons aged 60 or above participated in free activities organized by the LCSD last year .  The most popular activities include swimming , Tai Chi , Tai Chi sword , social dance , physical exercises , go chess , gateball , lawn bowls , day camp , excursion , outreach programmes , etc .  
The scheme gives elderly applicants a choice of rent allowance to lease private accommodation in lieu of PRH when their turn for flat allocation is due .  They can also switch back to PRH after the expiry of the two-year RAES term .  Mr Ho said response to the current scheme has been satisfactory .  So far the Department has received 257 applications as against the 500-quota , with 202 Approvals-in-Principle issued and 46 payments effected .  
The advertisements portrayed the elderly as senile and pathetic , making a strong association between the elderly and death .  Such portrayals were insensitive and denigrating to the elderly , and would be considered objectionable to a substantial section of the community .  
More than half of our elderly population live in subsidised public housing .  Through a number of priority housing schemes for them , the number of elderly households on the Waiting List for public rental flats has been reduced from 16 000 in 1997 to the current 7 900 , and the average waiting time from 3 years to about 1.5 years .  
In the coming years , our elderly services will aim at providing better support to elders in need and co-ordinating community and institutional care services .  For example , public rental estates with a high concentration of older people will be provided with integrated care services .  We will also organise more intergenerational activities in communities to help our elders enjoy healthy and active ageing .  
It was reported that on 8th and 11th of this month respectively , an elderly man jumped onto the track at a MTR station and was crushed to death by a train and a young man plunged to his death from a building .

The motion , to be moved by Hon CHAN yuen-han , says : " That , as the current economic and employment situations remain acute , and low-income earners and the poor elderly who are not receiving the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance are very hard up , this Council urges the Government to provide them with different forms of assistance or allowances in transport , medical , housing and education services , etc . , so as to improve the livelihood of these people and their families and relieve the pressure on them . "  
We consider that it is necessary to maintain public broadcasting service to complement commercial broadcasting services and to cater to the needs of a broad spectrum of audiences .  Examples of such complementary functions are the promotion of Putonghua and English , as well as culture and arts ; and the provision of programmes on parental education , elderly and childhood education , civic education for the youth , fight-crime and anti-smoking campaigns , and medical and health awareness .

Following from the social philosophy and the four pillars I have just mentioned , the Government in the past five and a half years has put in a lot of resources and efforts to provide care and assistance for the physical and psychosocial well-being of the elderly , and to assist the disadvantaged , the poor and the unemployed with an emphasis on enhancing , not impeding , their will to self-reliance . 
It is essential for us to look far ahead to find feasible and practical ways to develop a sustainable financial support system for the needy elderly .  
The motion , to be moved by Hon Frederick FUNG , says " That , as the Government will introduce very shortly a new charging scheme for public health care services and , in parallel , enhance the existing medical fee waiver mechanism , this Council urges the Government to relax the eligibility criteria under the mechanism so as to benefit more people from the socially disadvantaged groups , such as elderly persons , low-income earners and chronic patients . "

Residential services for elders suffering from poor health or physical / mental weaknesses are provided in Care and Attention Homes ( including those for the Aged Blind ) and Nursing Homes .  
( c ) To facilitate elderly and disabled persons to use estate facilities , the Housing Department will incorporate enhancement works in the maintenance and improvement programmes for existing public housing estates where practicable .

They are in line with the guidelines set out in the " Design Manual : Barrier Free Access 1997 " issued by the Buildings Department .

Home visits have also been paid to elderly families to send out the message and render possible assistance .  Mr . Lau called on public housing tenants to maintain good personal hygiene habits by keeping their home and the estates clean .  He reiterated the idea of nourishing a new culture on cleanliness in public housing estates , adding that the marking scheme was only meant for the very minority of tenants who jeopardize the tidiness of the environment in irresponsible and inconsiderate acts .  
( a ) As institutions are more prone to outbreak of infectious diseases , and frail elders are more susceptible to complications if they become infected with influenza , the Department of Health ( DH ) has since 1998 implemented an annual influenza vaccination programme for residents in residential care homes for the elderly ( RCHEs ) .

In the social sciences , economics and public finance are the most promising departments , while the continued rise of the population 's median age will mean an increased demand for social workers to provide services for the elderly .

In Kuo 's extended family , the more than forty children belonging to her generation , starting at age three , were instructed by an elderly teacher in the family 's private schoolroom , where they studied the Three Character Classic , the Thousand Character Classic , the Four Books , and the Five Classics , practiced calligraphy , and learned how to compose in literary Chinese , before going on to junior high school at age fourteen .  
This has received attention because : ( a ) The proportion of the elderly in the population has increased ; they hope to continue to study and fill out their lives .

However , in the face of this rapidly growing cohort , all countries have exhibited chaos . Some elderly are rejected from the nuclear family or are thought of as an unproductive burden on the national economy . Even more disconcerting is that health care for the elderly can lead not only to family frictions , but can overwhelm national health care systems . Aging is an unavoidable process for us .  
Out at the rustic chicken restaurant you take a hot spring bath first to work up a good appetite , then a meal of coq-au-vin in the fresh mountain air leaves you feeling wonderfully relaxed , " says free-range chicken aficionado Mr . Ch'en . Mt . Shamao has long been famous in northern Taiwan for its hot springs , frequently visited by elderly keep-fit fans .  
Except for the spring and fall ancestral sacrifices and grave sweeping on the Ch'ing-ming festival , few people go there .

Ms Lin recalls seeing an elderly person tottering round the shop using an umbrella for support , so she hastened over to recommend a safe and reliable walking stick specially developed for the elderly .  
In other words , the elderly lack a sense of security about the future and do n't want to wait idly for death , so they need another stage on which to play out the remainder of their lives . " Hsieh Tseng Fang-lan believes services of this kind have a promising future , and the response from outside has been most gratifying . The manpower bank has yet to be officially registered but enquiries are pouring in , with a need for services ranging from technical advisers for refrigeration and air-conditioning to electricity meter readers .  
Today , agricultural villages are in a period of transition . The elderly are not accustomed to living with their children in the crowded cities , and they 're unwilling to live in old folk 's homes .

Chen Kuan-cheng explains that the typical European and American social security system is an intergenerational transfer of benefits , which is to say that the living expenses of the current elderly are paid by the current young and middle aged . When the current young become the seniors , the next generation will pay the bills .  
Many elderly people who were unable to collect their subsidies ended up accusing the staff of being obstructionist . Moreover , beginning next year the central government will no longer compensate local governments for hiring social workers . It is likely that after many social workers leave their positions , the work of visiting and protecting the handicapped , women , children , and other disadvantaged groups will grind to an even slower pace .  
When he hears talk about the elements now making up the temple milieu he perks up and begins pointing all around , explaining this and that in an amiable and composed way . He points out that the courtyard outside the threshold is a " political zone . " The walkways - - which in a Chinese temple are covered and skirt the outside of the main courtyard - - are occupied by little groups of fortune-tellers , devout Buddhists , and elderly men , each conversing on their own themes .  
Even if there are numerous homes and senior citizen centers that have been set up by government agencies and private organizations which can solve the problems of part of the elderly population , many of these places do not accept people who are indigent , too sick or aged , entirely unable to care for themselves , or who have been abandoned by their families . Most of the elderly at home alone are n't served by the homes and senior citizen centers .  
Sitting on the local as it shook and jiggled , I noticed that most of the other riders were elderly . Some of these grandfathers went so far as to stretch out on the seats for a nap . A grandmother had a shoulder pole with bamboo baskets full of vegetables that she was bringing to market . A few aboriginal women wearing broad-rimmed rain hats and carrying bamboo baskets got off in Tahsi on the way to odd jobs in nearby harbors .  
Lee and other economy class travelers heard passengers from other airlines being taken to hotels , and saw arrangements being made for food and accomodations for the first-class passengers on the Malaysian Airlines flight . However , the sky was already lightening in the east when the elderly and infirm passengers from economy class were taken to a hotel , and the young , strong male passengers in the main cabin were left in the airport right up until the plane returned to Taipei .  
" At that time , the resource most lacking in Tainan 's social services was nursing homes for the elderly . The situation was especially bad for those who were poor or ill or whose families were unable to take care of them , " says Rev . John B . Kung , now Chancellorof the Diocese , but at that time the assistant to Bishop Cheng .  
Farmland can not be sold to anyone who is not a working farmer , and few children want to take over their parents ' farmland . So much farmland is still owned by elderly farmers who are not physically capable of cultivating it . The principle of " farmer-owned and utilized " is binding farmers for life to land that is useless to them . Not yet ready to buy the farm  
As of the end of 1997 , the Catholic church in Taiwan was operating 46 middle and primary schools , two universities , one technical college , 17 homes for the elderly , and seven halfway houses for troubled youth . In addition , various parishes include centers to assist aboriginal people , foreign laborers working in Taiwan ( including many Filipino Catholics ) , and those on the fringes of society .  
The swelling ranks of the elderly will have tremendous implications for the distribution of social resources . To set proper policy requires an adequate grounding of research into seniors ' physical and mental health as well as their economic and family situations .  
Taiwan is by no means unique in encountering a growing number of elderly following rapid economic gains and improvements in the quality of medical care . The experiences of the advanced industrial nations in confronting these problems can serve as a reference for us , but we still need to do some basic homework : carrying out surveys about the different elderly age groups here and achieving general recognition of these problems and a consensus about how to deal with them .  
In an industrial society , as extended families living under one roof have given way to smaller and smaller nuclear families , the family can no longer serve the same functions it once did in supporting the needs of all segments of the population . Yet traditional Eastern attitudes , morality and values rooted in thousands of years of history are not easy to change , and they have a big effect on how policy toward the elderly is set .  
" Those of us engaged in social work appreciate that there is a difference between the ideal and the reality of the situation , " says Li Hsiung , executive director of the Taipei Elders ' Foundation . He feels that the growing prevalence of problems involving the elderly ca n't simply be attributed to a lack of filial piety on the part of their children . He says that the major factors are rather changes in lifestyle and in the family structure .  
" The majority of Taiwanese senior citizens in the US come here to live with their grown children , who mostly have master 's or PhD degrees , and are ' suburban Chinese . ' Because the homes of their children are spread out in middle - and high-class residential areas , unlike members of self-contained urban Chinatowns , elderly Taiwanese suffer great inconvenience if they are unable to communicate in English , " says Peter C . Lee , associate vice-president of the Office of Faculty Affairs at San Jose State University in California .  
In the southern Bay Area , where land is dear , the facilities at the Overseas Chinese Education Center are cramped , and most of the elderly groups try their luck elsewhere . On normal days the groups meet at municipal senior centers , apartment complexes for the elderly that house many seniors from Taiwan , or other places where they share space and resources with people of other ethnic groups .  
Of course , " The road to the Land of the Dead is traveled by old and young alike , " so the elderly and seriously ill are n't the only ones who need to make a will . People in their primes , living hectic , busy lives and under great pressure at work , should also be prepared for death at any moment .  
If we feel old , as if we are not respected and are incapable of doing anything , we quickly find ourselves on the road to depression . If we feel aged , it is easy to become the stereotype of an elderly person-self-absorbed , dissatisfied and inflexible . This is likely to make us still more depressed .  
How the department came into being is a story in itself . Several years ago , a reporter was sent to interview a recently arrested suspect . The suspect wept bitter tears which the reporter assumed stemmed from his impending incarceration . But the suspect surprised the reporter , stating that he was not crying for himself , but was worried about how his elderly parents , his wife and his children would survive with him in jail .  
Mr . Tseng , who makes his living from manufacturing metal parts for pet products , lives with his wife in Hsinchu , where they are both deeply involved in local charity work . They founded the Tong Hsin Volunteer Service Association , whose efforts are focused on services for the elderly and on recycling . They are also both counselors in the Hsinchu Family Education Service Center . Their colleagues consider them a perfect couple .  
An elderly gent named Chang , who left Taiwan 20 years ago and returned a couple of years ago , is amazed when he sees cartoons lampooning national leaders or when radio commentators say national figures ' " brains are on the fritz . " Is this is the same country that he left all those years ago because of its suffocating and oppressive atmosphere ?  
At the end of every year it issues its " indices of human rights in Taiwan . " The association 's Chai Song-lin says that this year Taiwan earned failing marks in all eight categories of human rights : political , children 's , elderly , economic , judicial , educational-cultural , social and women 's rights .  
If we compare him to other Nativist writers who address the tragedy of the rural elderly unable to adapt to the modern industrial world , we note that Huang is reluctant to expose his elderly characters to unmitigated suffering .  
Letting Them Go gathers together ten moving short stories which take as their theme the plight of the elderly in rural communities . The stories respond to the changing circumstances in Taiwan 's countryside , such as the departure of young people for the cities and growing industrial pollution . Speaking in this interview , Huang explicitly stated his purpose in this collection : " I want to bear witness to the plight of the senior citizens left behind in rural communities . "  
Today 's senior citizens laid the foundation upon which Taiwan 's current success was built , but they 've been abandoned in these rural communities . We , their juniors , are an ungrateful generation . Q : Do you feel that transplanting the elderly to the city is a better solution ?  
Last year the Buddha 's Light International Association organized New Year 's Eve dinners in the north , center and south of Taiwan , which were attended by more than 5,000 old folk who live alone . This year they are repeating the exercise , and are including a special event in Nantou County to bring some warmth and love to elderly survivors of the 9 / 21 earthquake there .  
Huang Cheng-hsiung , executive director of World Vision Taiwan , says that people fell over themselves to take in the orphans created by the earthquake , but the elderly got scant help . The main reason is that children who lost both parents received NT $ 2 million in death benefit , whereas most old people whose children died received no benefit since their children were already married .  
On May 10 , an elderly person living alone in an apartment in the Huachang Public Housing Project in Taipei 's Wanhua District was discovered to have passed away at home several days previously , and two women living in neighboring apartments ( one of whom died shortly thereafter ) were apparently infected . The entire community was quickly sealed off , with more than 700 persons subjected to compulsory quarantine , making this the first community in Taiwan to be sealed as a result of a SARS outbreak .  
But the downside of having conquered these illnesses is that the number of patients is constantly falling , so most young doctors prefer to specialize in growth fields like illnesses of advanced industrial societies or problems of the elderly . Virology , bacteriology , and epidemiology are considered " sunset subjects . " The result is that there has been no one to take the baton from the previous generation , and gatherings of specialists in these fields can be mistaken for meetings of a senior citizens group .  
For example , some community workers in Hsiufeng Village in Luku Rural Township started a business with only NT $ 500,000 in capital to repackage Luku tea leaves in an elegant and appealing way , and by playing on the heartwarming story behind the sale of the tea : paying for the continued operation of a cafeteria for local elderly people who live alone .  
When you first hear the term " art therapy , " it seems very mysterious . But in fact , art therapy is one kind of psychological therapy and like any other psychological therapy , its object can be differentiated based on health status ( the mentally ill and those with non-clinical mental health problems ) , on age ( children , adolescents , the middle-aged , the elderly ) , on type of illness , or stage of illness ( early , terminal ) , on patterns of behavior ( smokers , non-smokers ) and so forth .  
There have long been radio stations-especially those that have a clearly defined regional identity and announcers with that down-home accent-which , after broadcasting a few popular songs , start in on sales pitches in fluent , authentic Taiwanese . These shows are especially attractive to elderly listeners in rural areas .  
He gives half the income from the restaurant to charity , and once a month he hosts a free dinner for a guest list that includes volunteer teachers and lonely elderly people with no families . He also works to promote environmental , conservation , and animal-rights values in the PRC , so that the vegetarian outlook on life can set down deeper roots , and not just be limited to eating habits or health .  
Looking at the question from the " support " side , elderly people have more financial and physical ability to look after themselves , so aged parents no longer need to rely on their children . Also , young people are now putting off marriage until much later , so they have much more time under their personal control . Finally , young people have their own marketable skills and incomes , so they do n't need to be under the thumb of their parents . For all these reasons , a carefree life seems a good choice .  
To put into practice this ideal of caring for the elderly , Shikatsu-once voted Japan 's best town-has allocated close to 1.5% of its annual budget to the museum and library , and an astonishing amount of human and physical resources have been put into them .  
Unexpected was the fact that children very much hoped to live with their elderly parents and conform to the traditional model of filial piety in this regard , while the image they had for themselves in old age was rather untraditional . Future plans for almost half of them tended toward living with their spouses only or living alone ( 43.9% ) , and they also stressed economic independence ( 44.4% ) .  
Another and most troubling phenomenon for researchers is that as a self-supporting economic unit caring for the elderly and looking after children , the number of economically disadvantaged families has increased in recent years , and the gap between rich and poor households has widened .  
She begins by developing their understanding of their bodies through drawing their genitals , giving self-evaluations , charting menstrual cycles , learning to put on a condom , and studying other contraceptive methods before moving on to the psychological side with work on self-affirmation and interpersonal relations . Ultimately , she asks the students to confront the issues of birth , aging , illness and death by having them interview elderly persons , share their feelings about caring for grandparents who have been the victims of strokes , and write a living will .  
FRTRI director Liu Pao-pao , who has designed rock-climbing shoes and medical footwear for the elderly , says , " If we had presented medical footwear for specific professions or elderly people to the public ten years ago , we would not have been able to sell them . But Taiwan has entered the modern age . These days , people are much more health conscious and are willing to spend money to take care of themselves .  
China formulated the " China Development Plan of Work on Ageing , " in which the Chinese Government " set specific goals for the work , that the elderly people being supported , enjoying medical care , contributive to the society , engaging in life long learning and enjoying a happy life , " he said
