" Just one example : A man living in Taipei City 's Anping Borough who supported his family by cleaning building exteriors lost his footing in January and fell to his death , leaving behind a disabled wife and three young children . There was n't even enough money for the funeral , and the fatherless family suddenly found itself in the direst of straits .

Even though reliable statistics on the exact numbers of disabled persons in the region have yet to be compiled , indications are that in recent years cases of disability have increased dramatically in a number of African countries as a result of natural disasters , protracted internal armed conflict , famine and malnutrition , and the resurgence of once-controlled diseases such as tuberculosis .

The gradual economic reform which the transition to a market economy required was having adverse repercussions on the population 's standard of living and particularly on the most vulnerable sectors such as the disabled , elderly persons and young people .  
In order to promote social integration , Bangladesh had set up special programmes for women , children , youth , disabled and elderly persons and minorities focusing on reducing illiteracy ( through compulsory primary education , non-formal education and adult literacy programmes and innovative schemes such as the food-for-education programme aimed at reducing the drop-out rate ) , with special emphasis placed on the education of the girl child .  
They made a commitment , among other things , to protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ; to strengthen laws , policies and programmes to secure the full and equal participation of women in all spheres of political , civil , economic , social and cultural life ; to promote and protect the rights of the child ; to ensure protection of the rights of people who are particularly vulnerable , including young people , the disabled , the elderly and migrant workers ; and to promote and protect the rights of indigenous populations .  
The desire to ensure effective democratization in national life and to foster development is at the core of the activities the Panamanian Government is carrying out to benefit children , young people , women , indigenous and rural populations , the disabled and certain particularly disadvantaged urban groups .  
Furthermore , my Government places particular emphasis on the needs of vulnerable groups , such as the disabled , in the process of social development , in the firm conviction that a genuinely sound and prosperous society can be realized only when all people , irrespective of their physical or mental disadvantages , are able to pursue a life of happiness and dignity based on stability and equality .  
An institute for social work has been established within the University of Malta to provide for the training of social workers in the preventive , rehabilitative and reintegrative social work connected with the family , youth , the elderly , the disabled , abusers of drugs and alcohol and victims of domestic violence .  
Although only the Government can put most of these commitments into effect , URNG , in addition to recognizing the need to put an end to the suffering of the civilian population and to respect the human rights of wounded , captured and disabled combatants , also undertook , inter alia , " to respect the inherent attributes of the human person and to contribute to the effective enjoyment of human rights " ( Comprehensive Agreement , fourth preambular paragraph ) .  
This responsibility is reflected in the adoption of an integrated approach at the local and national levels in order to ensure access to affordable and reliable services for the children and dependants ( particularly those who are elderly and disabled ) of women and men who are working , undergoing training , studying or seeking employment .  
In the social development subprogramme , the area of integrating social groups , namely , the elderly , the disabled and the ageing , some departures from programmed commitments , mainly postponement of publications , were attributable to logistical reasons , while several activities in the area of the integration of the disabled in development were terminated owing to lack of anticipated resources .  
Furthermore , ESCWA published the biennial demographic and related socio-economic indicators on human development and socio-cultural specificity - the case of the Arab world ; the social dimensions of human development ; the situation of disabled women , their marginalization , and measures for social integration in the ESCWA region ; changing values in the Arab family ; and regional perspectives of human settlements in ESCWA countries .  
First , with respect to educational and vocational training measures , the Act provides that " education and re-education shall , as far as is possible , take place in ordinary educational establishments , or , failing that , in specialized establishments " ( art . 10 ) ; and lays down the general rule that " vocational training of the disabled must give them the capacity to exercise an economic activity enabling them to use their vocational skills and aptitudes " ( art .  11 ) .  
In addition , while the State attends to the legal framework , the training of specialized personnel , the enhancement of public awareness , and the mobilization of most of the financial resources ( through the Special Fund for the Disabled created in 1988 ) , the associative sector plays a leading role in specialized education , occupational training and rehabilitation for disabled persons who can not attend a normal institution .  
Disaggregated data and appropriate indicators seem to be lacking to assess the situation of children , especially those who are victims of abuse , ill-treatment or child labour or are involved with the administration of juvenile justice , as well as the girl child , children of single-parent families and those born out of wedlock , children in rural areas , abandoned , institutionalized and disabled children , and children who , in order to survive , are living and / or working in the streets .  
The Committee is particularly concerned at the insufficient measures and programmes for the protection of the rights of the most vulnerable children , especially girls , children living in rural areas , children who are victims of abuse , children of single parents , children born out of wedlock , abandoned children , disabled children , and children who are , in order to survive , forced to live and / or work in the streets .  
The Committee recommends that special protective measures be implemented in relation to children living in rural areas , children who are victims of abuse , children of single-parent families , children born out of wedlock , abandoned , institutionalized and disabled children , children involved with the juvenile justice system , particularly when deprived of their liberty , children involved in child labour and children who , in order to survive , are forced to live and / or work in the streets .  
The Committee , while recognizing the efforts undertaken by the authorities in the collection of data , is concerned at the insufficient measures adopted to collect disaggregated data on the situation of all children , particularly those belonging to the most disadvantaged groups , including black children , disabled children , street children , children placed in institutions , including institutions of a penal nature , ill-treated and abused children or children from economically disadvantaged groups , which constitutes a major obstacle to the effective and full implementation of the provisions of the Convention .  
The Committee is particularly concerned at the insufficient measures and programmes for the protection of the rights of the most vulnerable children , especially children who are victims of abuse , children of single parents , children born out of wedlock , abandoned children , disabled children , children living in poverty and children who , in order to survive , are living and / or working in the streets .  
They can be used as a basis for designing programmes to improve the situation of children , particularly those belonging to the most disadvantaged groups , including disabled children , children born out of wedlock , children ill-treated and abused within the family , children who are victims of sexual exploitation , and children who are forced to live and / or work in the streets in order to survive .  
While it would now be possible to obtain commercial insurance coverage for contingent personnel assigned to United Nations peacekeeping operations if the Secretary-General were so authorized by the General Assembly , in view of the opinion provided by the Office of Legal Affairs , any compensation made for the death or disability of such military personnel could not be paid directly to disabled troops or dependent survivors , but rather to the national authorities , as was the current practice .  
It was difficult to believe that euthanasia was now perceived by some as an acceptable alternative to caring for the sick and elderly and disabled persons .  
Please indicate the specific measures adopted to reduce economic , social and geographical disparities , including between rural and urban areas , to prevent discrimination against the most disadvantaged groups of children , including children belonging to minorities or indigenous communities , disabled children , children born out of wedlock , children who are non-nationals , migrants , displaced , refugees or asylum _ seekers , and children who are living and / or working on the streets .  
At the local level , the non-governmental organizations working with UNRWA range from support groups for individual hospitals or centres for the disabled to societies for the physically or mentally handicapped , covering a particular town or area , locally based law centres , women 's associations , universities , medical associations and camp or village committees .  
The right of disabled children to a full and decent life and to special care and the rights to abolition of traditional practices which are prejudicial to the health of children , such as early marriage , female genital mutilation , denial of equal sustenance and inheritance for girls are also highly relevant in the context of HIV / AIDS .  
The Office 's special programmes and projects shall consist of specialized activities concerning , inter alia , displaced persons , the rights of women , the rights of children and adolescents , the penal and prison systems , indigenous communities , disabled persons and other sectors in need of special protection .  22 .  The representative of the National Observatory for Human Rights of Algeria advised that the Observatory was based on the principle of institutional and cultural pluralism .  
They can be used as a basis for designing programmes to improve the situation of children , particularly those belonging to the most disadvantaged groups , including disabled children , children born out of wedlock , children ill-treated and abused within the family , in institutions , or deprived of liberty , children who are victims of sexual exploitation , children belonging to minority groups , especially Roma , and children who , in order to survive , are forced to live and / or work in the streets .  
The Committee remains concerned at prevailing traditional attitudes and harmful practices , such as female genital mutilation , early marriages and teenage pregnancies , and at the persistence of discriminatory social attitudes against vulnerable groups of children , such as the girl child , disabled children , children born out of wedlock and children affected by or infected with HIV / AIDS , including orphans .  
Such measures would promote change in persisting negative attitudes towards children , particularly girls , disabled children , children born out of wedlock , children affected by or infected with HIV / AIDS , including orphans , and contribute to abolishing traditional practices prejudicial to the health and well-being of children , such as female genital mutilation , early marriages and teenage pregnancies .  
With regard to the full implementation of the principles laid down by articles 2 , 3 , 6 and 12 in the Convention , the Committee suggests that the State party fully integrate them in all its policies , laws , actions and programmes affecting children at all levels , including on the administrative and judicial levels , especially with regard to children belonging to ethnic and religious minority groups , the girl child , disabled children and children living in rural and remote areas .  
Public-sector ICT applications include distance learning and continuing professional development ; road traffic management ; disabled support services ; air-traffic control ; health-care networks ; electronic tendering for contracts ; and public administration applications .  ICT applications are increasing the efficiency of public services in areas such as automated or computer-assisted translation ; one stop shopping for government information ; applications designed to limit environmental degradation ; citizens and emergency support services ; and services to support inter-community meetings .  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages that takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome infection and disabled persons ,

Targeting policies at the most vulnerable groups of society children , women , the elderly , the disadvantaged , the poor , the disabled is , moreover , a prerequisite for the successful realization of social justice , equity and respect for human dignity .  
The programme of the workshop covered four main topics : conceptual issues of poverty in old age ; women as one of the groups at risk , and the process known as the feminization of poverty ; specific issues of poverty among other groups at risk ; disabled and single persons ; and ways to create an enabling environment for the improved well-being of older people .

Disaggregated data and appropriate indicators seem to be lacking to assess the situation of children , especially those who are victims of abuse , ill _ treatment or child labour or are involved with the administration of juvenile justice , as well as refugee and internally displaced children , children of single _ parent families , children in rural and remote areas , abandoned , institutionalized and disabled children , and children who are living and / or working on the street .  
Its current social security scheme was undergoing a period of complex reforms and unemployment insurance was being developed , with emphasis on the promotion of economic activity of the unemployed in small towns and in rural areas , as well as the disabled .  
The needs of the floating populations such as the homeless , squatters , the rural indigent , urban slum dwellers and physically disabled people must be addressed through fundamental social welfare and rehabilitation programmes .  
The Government 's social security policy is to meet the basic and special needs of the disadvantaged , including the financially vulnerable , the elderly and the severely disabled .  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a holistic concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages , which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , young persons , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and disabled persons ,  
Promotion of temporary independent work for the disabled , support for their entrepreneurial activity and home _ based work and provision of flexible working hours ( with special emphasis on disabled mothers caring for minors ) ;  
The periodic humanitarian assistance in the form of food , clothing , footwear and medicines given by international and local charitable organizations , small enterprises and farms also plays an important role in aiding the needy , the elderly , the disabled , residential institutions and orphans .  
All population groups are covered by a coherent State health _ care system , with special attention being paid to women , pregnant women and parturients , children under 14 and other particularly vulnerable population groups , such as the elderly and the disabled . 
The countries of the region , aware that poverty prevented many children in developing countries from exercising their right to education and development , had set themselves priorities in the areas of education , health , food and nutrition and specific targets for children and adolescents in need of special care , such as children who worked or engaged in marginal activities , street children and children who were disabled , abused , orphans or victims of armed conflicts .  
Social care benefits and pensions are directed to the disabled , lonely elderly , invalids , the poor , families with four or more children , the unemployed , and those with an income providing less than the established minimum standard of living .  
General objective : To promote effective nationwide measures , strategies and mechanisms aimed at the prevention of disabilities and the complete rehabilitation , full participation and equality of opportunities of disabled persons , for the purpose of their integration in the family and society and the economic and social development of the country , based on effective respect for their human rights .  
Human services , such as basic education and health care , technical and continuing education , information and extension services , care for the young , old and disabled and programmes to reduce marginalization of migrant , indigenous and other disadvantaged groups , are principally provided through public outlays in most countries .  
Rejects the application of such measures as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , particularly against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all human rights of vast sectors of their populations , inter alia children , women , the elderly , disabled and ill people ;  
Similarly , new safety and environmental standards require the renovation of existing buildings to meet modern standards in such areas as fire safety , access for the disabled , interior air quality , asbestos abatement and safe handling of dangerous or toxic materials .  
Rejects the application of such measures as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , particularly against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all human rights of vast sectors of their populations , inter alia children , women , the elderly , disabled and ill people ;  
Convinced also that human rights education and information contribute to a concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome infection and disabled persons ,

Physical accessibility implies that adequate food must be accessible to everyone , including physically vulnerable individuals , such as infants and young children , elderly people , the physically disabled , the terminally ill and persons with persistent medical problems , including the mentally ill .  
In the area of poverty alleviation , special emphasis was given to assisting Governments in enhancing the quality of life of the poor and other disadvantaged and vulnerable social groups , including children , youth , older persons and disabled persons , through the provision of policy-oriented research and guidelines and the convening of intergovernmental meetings aimed at forging agreements on priority issues , policy approaches and regional benchmarks and their monitoring .  
Governments should improve the management and delivery of services for the growing urban agglomerations and put in place enabling legislative and administrative instruments and adequate financial resources to meet the needs of all citizens , especially the urban poor , internal migrants , older persons and the disabled .  
Governments should improve the management and delivery of services for the growing urban agglomerations and put in place enabling legislative and administrative instruments and adequate financial resources to meet the needs of all citizens , especially the urban poor , internal migrants , older persons and the disabled .
