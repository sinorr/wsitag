For historical reasons , the agricultural structure of major production areas is rather simplistic .  In the current situation in which grain and cotton are in excess supply , the task of structural readjustment has become ever more arduous .  
We face arduous tasks in strengthening and improving our ideological and political work in the new period .  There are many problems that need studying .  The key issue is to strengthen the ideals and beliefs of the broad masses of Party members , cadres , and the people through strong and effective ideological and political work .  
Reviewing 1999 , many deputies and committee members were not only proud that China 's economy has continued to record steady growth and is regarded by the world as one of the liveliest countries , but were also extremely glad that the quality of economic operations has improved during a painful and arduous switch of track .  
Faced with an international and domestic situation that is undergoing profound changes and a glorious and arduous mission , the deputies will be thoroughly studying major issues of overall and strategic significance in reform , opening up and socialist modernization and will be reviewing important policies and arrangements for work in the coming year .

It has also significantly increased people 's awareness of the need to keep the country green .  
We must be clearly aware that we are still faced with arduous tasks and severe challenges in our current efforts to realize the grand target of China 's modernization building and narrow China 's development gap with the world 's advanced development level .  Therefore , we have no reason whatsoever to be conceited and complacent , or cease to go any further ;  
Speaking in this sense , the " three represents " is the foundation for our establishing the party , the source of our strength , and the basics of our life as well as the concrete embodiment of those excellent traditions of our Party like integrating theories with practice , maintaining close links with the masses , waging arduous struggles , and so on in the practice of our party leading the people to develop social productive forces , flourish advanced culture , and realize fundamental interests of the people and the intrinsic excellent characters of the party .  
The ideal and belief education should be taken as a key point of in-depth education in Deng Xiaoping Theory .

Meanwhile , we should also see that the satisfactory economic efficiency attained by state enterprises last year was closely linked with the policy support of the state , besides the hard efforts made by the enterprises .  This year , however , the space for increasing profits through the policy factor is limited , and the task of realizing the three-year target for reform and the difficulty relief of state enterprises has therefore proved extremely arduous .  
Our experience for more than 20 years has proved that these measures and actions in afforestation and improving the environment conform to the reality that our country faces arduous tasks in environmental construction and lacks funds .  Through these measures and actions , the socialist system 's advantages are given full play , and at the same time , people from around the whole country have a heightened awareness of the need for afforestation .  These measures and actions are a lively implementation of patriotism and are worthy of our careful summing up and further perfecting and developing .

The officers and men of the PLA and the Armed Police Force comply with the word " absolute " not only in normal times but also and particularly when dealing with major issues of right and wrong and when performing urgent , arduous and risky tasks .

Everywhere , from South China Sea outposts to northern borders , from east coasts to snowy plateau , headquarters offices , grass-roots companies and other units have done a great deal of arduous and meticulous ideological education work , focusing on " forever unchanged military spirit " .

Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory shine in the annals of the public , which have recorded the glorious course traversed by the people of all ethnic groups in their arduous struggle led by the CPC , engraved the great achievements made in the process of creating and building socialism with Chinese characteristics , and crystallized the wisdom and strategies of the party 's three generations of leading collectives with Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping , and Jiang Zemin as their cores .  
The Chinese people made arduous exploration for half a century to go through this process .  They achieved major successes , and they had also experienced many twists and turns or even paid high prices before they could basically accomplish at last an organic integration of the universality and particularity of socialism under new historical conditions , and begin to figure out the right path of socialist development that suits China 's national conditions .

To promote the spirit of arduous struggling and pursuing effectiveness , we should vigorously advocate a social trend of speaking the truth , doing solid work and pursuing effectiveness .  We should resolutely oppose working in a perfunctory and formalistic manner .  At present , the majority of Party members and cadres are pursuing effectiveness satisfactorily .  
The new situation and arduous tasks require that we must regard vigorously disseminating and promoting the spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career as an important task of the current ideological and political construction , and devote efforts to carrying out this task in a persistent and effective manner .  
Comrades throughout the party have also come to realize profoundly that in the face of the changing international situation and the formidable and arduous tasks at home , our party will remain firm as a rock and indestructible , our socialist country will stay as steady as Mount Tai and stand erect and unshakable , and our cause will be full of vitality and will produce brilliant results only if we always uphold " three represents " and conscientiously implement " three represents " .
