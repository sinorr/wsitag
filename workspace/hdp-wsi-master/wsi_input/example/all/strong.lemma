We face arduous tasks in strengthening and improving our ideological and political work in the new period .  There are many problems that need studying .  The key issue is to strengthen the ideals and beliefs of the broad masses of Party members , cadres , and the people through strong and effective ideological and political work .  
Cao Gangchuan noted : Under the correct leadership of the party Central Committee , the State Council , and the Central Military Commission , China 's scientific and technological undertaking for national defense has realized a historic leap of growing out of nothing and expanding from weak to strong and from small to large ;  
Ever since the convocation of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , in particular , all the comrades working on the scientific and technological front for national defense and weaponry development have firmly implemented the strategy established by the party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission on strengthening the army through science and technology , successfully adapted themselves to the world 's development trend of high technologies and changes in the world 's military field , gone all out to make the country strong , and have attained new achievements of world interest .  
Today , our army has developed a basic system for its weaponry and equipment of a new generation , which enjoys a relatively intact structure and a relatively strong capacity of developing complete sets of weaponry and equipment , thus providing strong weaponry and technological support for our army to enhance its defense and combat capabilities under modern technological , especially high-tech , conditions .  
We should take resolute steps to reduce and eliminate a number of technically backward production capacities which have a high energy consumption and a low economic efficiency and which have caused serious environmental pollution ; and give priority to supporting the development of large enterprises and enterprise groups which have advanced equipment , well-marketable products , and a strong ability to develop new products .  
regard the ideological and political work as the essential among essentials ; grasp the work firmly , create a sound atmosphere , and carry out the work in a down-to-earth manner ; and provide a strong spiritual motive power and a powerful ideological guarantee for our efforts to promote the development of reform and maintain the stability of the society .  
During the discussion , officers and men reviewed the army 's glorious history in fighting the people 's war , defeating the strong by the weak , and defeating the superior by the inferior .  They spoke glowingly of the army 's tremendous achievements in revolutionization , modernization , and regularization and reaffirmed their confidence of winning the regional war under the high-tech condition .  
the people of the whole country have expressed an ardent wish to build a prosperous nation through science and education and a strong country through knowledge ; the whole country 's industrial and agricultural structures have been undergoing major readjustment ; the enterprises have been engaged in technical innovation ;  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's remarks have , from a high plane of historical materialism , revealed the fundamental nature of our party ; pointed out the party 's basic tasks ; and are of an important theoretical and practical significance to our efforts to further maintain the advancement of the party , retain the vigor and vitality of the party , lead the whole party and the people of the entire country to carry out struggles in unity , and build our country into a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized modern socialist power .  
Those responsible for primary party organizations must persistently follow the style of being truthful and realistic , waging a hard struggle , and working hard , establish themselves among the masses , be concerned about their weal and woe , put the interests of the party and the people above everything else , and , with enthusiasm and a strong sense of responsibility , lead the masses in striding toward an ever more prosperous future .  
He said : Sichuan Province will seize the historical opportunity brought by the state 's decision on adopting the strategy for great development in China 's west , and will strive to speed up the province 's development at a rate higher than the national average , thus realizing a new leap forward .

So , the " accession to the WTO " will not only be conducive to rejuvenating and benefiting the labor-intensive industries with strong international competitiveness but it will also be conducive to quickening the readjustment of the capital - and technology-intensive industries and enabling them to grow up at an early date .

Guided by Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , ideological and political work has always accompanied the party 's founding , development , maturing , and strengthening ; it has become the fine tradition and political strong point of the CPC members in uniting for struggle , conquering difficulties , and winning victory , and has become the party 's " magic weapon " in gathering together the spiritual force of the Chinese nation .

Both domestic and foreign hostile forces do not want to see the development of a strong , prosperous , and stable socialist China . They hope for chaos in China . They are constantly trying to " westernize " and " divide " China so as to achieve change amid chaos and to fish in troubled waters .  
Handed down through thousands of years , this strong national cohesion has neither weakened with the passage of time nor been shaken by the changes of dynasty and instead has become a lofty standard of value and passionate political belief that has taken root in the depth of the heart of every Chinese .  
By the middle of the next century , when the Chinese nation reaches the level of an intermediately developed nation with its own hard work , a wealthy , strong , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist China will stand tall in the East !  
The important speech given by President Jiang at the Plenary Session of the PLA Representative Troops fully affirms the achievements made by the military and armed police troops and raises clear requirements for comprehensively promoting the construction of military modernization .  The speech emphasizes that the military must further clearly understand the historical mission it shoulders and provide firm and strong assurance of security for protecting the country 's sovereignty , unity and security , for protecting the people 's labor under peaceful conditions and for reform , opening up and the construction of socialist modernization .  
Only our Party has these important responsibilities .  Our military is the people 's military under the resolute leadership of the Party . Whether or not the military 's Party organizations are firm and strong , whether or not they can become firm fighting forces and whether or not they can play the role of the " Three Representations " are significant to whether or not we can solve the 2 historical tasks , " winning wars " and " not changing the military 's nature . "  
This absurd move , which violated China 's sovereignty , wantonly interfered in its internal affairs , and breached the basic norms of international relations , has aroused strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition from the Chinese people .  
The main reason why the United States produces an annual country report on human rights practices , heedless of the strong opposition of other countries , assumes the air of a " judge of human rights , " and insists on interfering in affairs under the jurisdiction of other countries is mainly to use this as a pretext for putting political pressure on other countries , especially developing and socialist countries , in a bid to change their political and social systems .  
Zeng Peiyan said : In the 21st century , China 's targets are to double the 2000 GNP by 2010 to make the people 's comparatively well-off lives even more prosperous and form a relatively complete socialist market economic system and to bring the per capita GDP to the level of an average developing country and basically achieve modernization by the middle of the century to successfully build a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized socialist country . 
Comrades in Guangdong have soberly realized that they do have their advantage in the strategy of " stepping out " : First , Guangdong 's economy has begun to take shape and its output value is about the same as that of Israel . Its volume of foreign trade and exports is close to that of Russia and the inflow of direct foreign investment exceeds that of Brazil , which ranks sixth in the world .  It is thus in a fairly strong position to take part in international economic competition .  
Particularly in the new historical period , our military is implementing a new period of military strategies and principles in a positive way , moving along the road of quality construction and of making the military strong with science and technology , and striving to complete two historical tasks of " winning wars " and " not changing the military 's quality . "  Deep changes are taking place in various aspects of military construction and new people , new events and new trends worthy of being recorded with letters of gold have emerged in large numbers .  
It has been proven by historical experiences that without the heartfelt endorsement and vigorous support of the broad masses of people , our Party could not possibly have developed from a weak and small beginning into a strong and large force and displayed decisive historical roles in putting an end to the situation of China being carved up by foreign powers and laboring people being oppressed and exploited by reactionary ruling classes and in the struggles of changing the look of poverty and backwardness in China .  
In international relations , China is opposed to the big bullying the small , the strong bullying the weak , and advocates building a new international political and economic order which is peaceful and steady as well as just and reasonable .  
Therefore , to stabilize the birthrate , we must persistently focus our attention on people ; under the general situation of the country 's social and economic growth , devote great efforts to eliminate those economic , social , and natural conditions which may affect people 's concept on child birth ; and provide a sufficient material guarantee and a strong spiritual driving power for the change in people 's concept on child birth .  
The ideal and belief education should be effectively combined with the in-depth education in the party 's basic line so that people may understand how the party 's basic line can turn the ideal into reality and play a role as a bridge between the initial stage of socialism and the more beautiful future , and understand the strong effectiveness of the party 's basic line since the beginning of reform and opening-up and the strong vitality of the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , thus enhancing their initiative in implementing the party 's basic line .  
and we must base our efforts on those major projects that will play a strong locomotive role , make extensive impacts , and expedite future economic and social development of the whole region , and adopt feasible policies and measures , thus pushing ahead a large-scale exploration of resources and large-scale development of the economy in this region .  
The strategic adjustment of the economic structure will give rise to huge investment and consumption demand .  This will not only provide a strong driving force for our nation 's economic growth , but will also provide broad market space for the development of domestic and foreign trade and economic exchanges .  
To a certain extent , Putin 's victory is also related to his personal quality .  In Russians , he has left the impressions of a person who " is steady , " " does solid work , " " has an iron hand , " " is healthy , " and " is bold but cautious . "  His election as president of the new century by the common people showed that the common people have great expectations for him , and hope he will lead Russia to a prosperous , stable , and strong tomorrow .  
Rich in natural resources , China 's northwestern region enjoys a considerably high manufacturing and technological level , as well as a fairly strong ability in scientific research and development ; and some of the region 's products have proved fairly competitive in the international market .  All these advantages should be brought into better play through reform and readjustment .  
and accelerate the process of transforming scientific research results into realistic productive forces .  Wu Bangguo stressed : Under the present new situation , we should further strengthen the party building in state enterprises , reinforce and improve the ideological and political work , step up the building of a spiritual civilization , tighten ties between cadres and masses , show concern for the livelihood of workers and staff , and give full rein to the role of party organizations in enterprises as a strong fighting force .  
The " three representations " is the scientific summary of the Party 's character and aim , is the centralized requirements of maintaining the Party 's advancement , is the creative utilization and development of Theory of Marxism Party building , and is the fundamental guiding ideology of strengthening Party building under new circumstances , which has strong ideological content , theoretical content and distinctive character of the day .  
It has put forward the three anti-corruption work patterns of cadres ' honest self-governing , investigation and handling of cases of discipline violation and broken law , and redressing unhealthy tendencies in government and industry .  It has upheld the establishment of the two lines of defense of moral thinking and Party discipline and law , based on education and focused on keeping a lookout over the majority of Party members and cadres , and using strong legal standards for the small number of corrupt elements .  
Hosts of facts proved that through fabricating a set of heresies , Li Hongzhi absorbed and controlled spiritually a great number of kindhearted people who want to keep themselves strong and healthy .  At the same time , he trained his key members to establish a compact organizational setup and he himself sat in a leading position and gave remote controls and commands .  
First , it is necessary to study and decide on building state-level strategic bases for knowledge innovations and carry out " extensive integrated reforms " across different institutions , different branches of learning , and different geographical areas in cities or areas with strong scientific and technological forces according to the needs in the state 's plan for developing the knowledge economy and high-tech industries .  Such bases should be used to foster and train high-level scientists and technologists and promote the development of high-tech industries .  
Through steadily carrying out this work stage by stage , we should strive to achieve initial results in five years , achieve noticeable results in 10 years , comprehensively develop the economic and social undertakings in the border areas , realize a long period of order and stability , prosperity and progress in the border areas , and attain the objective of " enriching the people , rejuvenating the border areas , building a strong country and remaining on friendly terms with the neighbors . "  
Only by correctly understanding and handling the relationship between the economy and politics can we make comprehensive development in the economic , political , ideological and cultural fields , and build ours into a wealthy , strong socialist modern country with democracy and a high degree of civilization .  
Deng Xiaoping also called for fostering new people with " a lofty ideal , moral integrity , good educational background , and a strong sense of discipline " and took this as the fundamental objective of developing socialist spiritual civilization .  He also stressed that ideals and the sense of discipline are the most important among all the four criteria .  
Both positive and negative experiences show : Under the same material and technological conditions , whether there is a mental force and whether the mental force is strong or weak will have a major bearing on success or failure of a person or a unit 's work .  The impact of this factor must never be underestimated .  
Zhu Rongji stressed : The leaders of state enterprises should all act in line with the requirements of the central authorities ; and strive to turn themselves into operators and managers who have a sound ideological and political quality , enjoy a strong ability in business operation and management , strictly observe the law and discipline , and remain honest and self-disciplined in performing their official duties .  To this end , they should be eager to study , diligent in their studies , and good at their studies .  
North-south conflicts were intense in US history , so that European powers represented by the United Kingdom could bully and humiliate the United States by taking advantage of its internal conflicts .  The United States settled its internal conflicts via the Civil War and achieved national reunification , it was only until then that solid foundations were laid for its strong power in the 20th century .  
] China will turn itself into a strong , prosperous , democratic and culturally advanced modern socialist country and bring about rejuvenation of the great Chinese nation .  The Chinese people are ready to join all other peace-loving people in the rest of the world in contributing their wisdom and energy to world peace and development and an even brighter future for mankind .  
After watching the exercise , Chi Haotian said : The Air Force is a hi-tech service which fights decisive battles in the air but relies on ground support .  Without strong logistics support , the Air Force would be deprived of strong combat effectiveness .  Chi stressed and pointed out : Conducting scientific and technological training is a major measure for implementing Chairman Jiang 's strategic thinking on building a strong force through science and technology ;  
To turn China into a rich and strong , democratic , civilized modern socialist country through self-reliance and arduous struggles is the ideal shared by all Chinese nationalities in the primary stage of socialism .  
China is a socialist country ; it must strive to build strong state finance in order to press forward the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , continually enhance the material and cultural living standards of the people of all nationalities throughout the country , and preserve social stability and state economic and national defense security .  
Having conducted heated discussions on the current situation across the strait , and on ways to promote the cross-strait relations and push forward China 's reunification process on the basis of the one-China principle , and having fully expressed the strong aspiration of opposing " Taiwan independence , " safeguarding peace , and promoting reunification among people from all social circles on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and in Hong Kong and Macao , the two-day-long seminar on " Opposing Taiwan Independence and Promoting Reunification " came to a close today in Shenzhen , Guangdong Province .  
Nowadays , professional national defense communications support service units in Xiamen are known to local army units and civilians as " strong and efficient support service teams out of the military establishment " that are " movable , available , and quick at fixing problems . "  
Following Jiang Zemin 's speech , Zhu Rongji said : In his important speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin fully endorsed the important contributions rendered by the national labor models and advanced workers to reform , opening up , and the socialist modernization drive .  He spoke highly of the lofty spirit of the selfless dedication displayed by the national labor model and advanced workers .  He called on all the people to emulate these advanced models and work hard to build China into an affluent , strong , democratic , and civil socialist modern country .  
" On the premises that the public ownership persistently holds a dominant position , the national economic lifelines are under the state 's control , and the controlling and competitive power of the state-owned economy is growing strong , a certain reduction in the proportion of the state-owned economy will not affect the socialist nature of China . "  
Using network resources and conducting research on the question of launching a people 's war on the net are of strong practical significance in making good preparations for military struggle .  In addition , they are also of profound and far-reaching historical significance in developing the strategic ideology of launching people 's war .  
In order to deepen the teaching reform , we should strive to achieve this goal : We should cultivate personnel who are qualified politically and ideologically , who have a top-notch military quality , who have a solid foundation in science and culture , who have a profound understanding of professional skill , who have a rather strong innovative ability , and who have a fine physical and mental quality .  
At present , the most pressing is to cultivate a unified military and technological database to develop talent , and timely extension of investigation of military strong points and survey of large military areas , constructing precise military-use digital mapping .  Thus we will lay a fine foundation for network troop training and operational simulation .  
In the protracted and complex revolutionary struggle , our party , growing from small to big and from weak to strong , has become the force at the core leading the Chinese revolution and construction .  A fundamental experience is that we have always upheld the principle of strictly administering the party .  
In future regional wars , our strong adversaries who possess high-tech weaponry may engage us in aerial battles with their superior technology .  These battles will be abrupt and decisive .  Our adversaries will go all out to seize the initiative by taking full advantage of nighttime and complex weather conditions .  
It is necessary to safeguard the unity of leading groups to enhance the cohesion force of party committees , uphold collective leadership to strengthen the fighting force of party committees , stay honest , upright , and free from corruption to enhance the appealing force of party committees , and realistically build party committees at all levels into strong leading collectives which can consciously uphold and comprehensively practice the " three represents " .  
They should have a firm ideal and conviction , be totally devoted to their work and have a strong sense of responsibility , be honest and upright in their ways and have a down-to-earth work style , and be good at uniting and guiding the masses for a satisfactory fulfillment of tasks in all fields .  
In the light of the characteristics that the new ground-to-air missiles are mobile and have quick flying speed and strong low-altitude defense capacity , they have established the method of organizing the air defense brigade into " two groups and one team " to cope with future operations , and studied the combat tactics of combining the efforts to resist and fight back with the efforts to hold back and intercept the incoming aircraft .  
To strengthen ideological and political education is of extremely great significance to upholding the party 's absolute leadership over the army , stepping up our army 's revolutionization , modernization and regularization , providing a strong spiritual motive force for " winning in war " , and providing a political guarantee for " being immune to degeneration " .  
The issues of belief and conviction involve many major issues including our guiding thought , social system , cadres ' contingent building , as well as people 's thinking that have a bearing on the rise and fall and success and failure of our party .  Faced with tough challenges in the new millenium , and at a time of comprehensively pushing forward our cause into the new century , we need a strong spiritual force even more .  
This theme defined at the turn of the century has expressed the strong desire of the people nationwide for treasuring the land and protecting the cultivated land at the historical moment when they are marching toward the new century .  It is also the historical choice of the Chinese nation in order to survive and multiply and to grow and flourish .  
Xiamen now ranks as one of the top-ten economically strong cities in the country .  To meet the need of the state 's safety , Xiamen has initially built an industrial system , which can rapidly covert civilian production to defense technology industry .  Electronic , machine tool , and chemical industrial enterprises constitute a major part of this industrial system .  
A constant flow of vast numbers of high-quality personnel with modern science and general knowledge into the army will further optimize the knowledge structure and greatly raise the scientific and cultural level of military cadre ranks , and will provide a strong knowledge , science and technology backing for army building .  
Judging from the craft 's own characteristics , they can be used for powerful surprise attacks in a short period from its good mobility , easy concealment nature , accurate firing power and strong antipersonnel force .  Therefore , Taiwan 's military considers those crafts as an important component part in fighting at coastal waters .  
With an aim of ensuring " victory during the fight " , these achievements were completed in line with the existing equipment and future tasks .  They demonstrated not only strong support capacity during the troops ' routine flight training but also outstandingly supported major military operations such as war tactics drill in the Western region and national grand military parade in the capital .  
The purpose of the " three stresses " education by positive examples conducted at the grass-roots level is to bring into play the role of grass-roots party organizations as fighting bastions and the role of party members as exemplary vanguards , pool together the strength of the vast numbers of officers and men , and provide a strong organizational and ideological safeguards for all-round construction of our grass-roots units and for meeting the requirements of " winning the war " and " preventing degeneration " .

Evolving around the main theme of " strong support " , the meeting put forward concrete measures for carrying out Chairman Jiang 's expositions on logistical work in terms of fundamental targets , key links , and major methods , making suggestions for military logistical building and reform .  
When the soldiers ran down the hill , they were already wet and exhausted .  As soon as the exercise ended , cadres of the company promptly exhorted the soldiers that the new equipment training was aimed at testing the comprehensive military quality of soldiers .  They said that even though they had four-wheeled armored vehicles , they still needed to train their two legs , and that only when the strong skills were maintained and new skills were not weak could they realize a new leap in combat strength .  
In particular , during the magnificent 20th century , the people of Asia were indomitable in going all out to make their countries strong , composing a magnificent historical epic of their political awakening and economic upsurge and giving a powerful impetus to historical progress and social development .  
On a military training base in the northern frontier where the winds were strong and grasses were robust , a combined real-troop and live-ammunition military exercise engaging in various arms of the services turned the vast grassland into a spectacular painting of a battlefield .  
Behind the tough talk about successfully fighting two modern wars is reflected the hollow essence of the Americans in bullying the weak with strength and bullying the weak but fearing the strong .  
The fishermen are skilful at operating their vessels and are familiar with sea conditions , sea routes , and the geographical conditions of harbors , thus laying a strong foundation for them to carry out their future task of participating in battles and supporting the battlefront at sea .  
The US strategy of human rights and values that we are talking about here is not simply a " soft " power , because it actually interacts with the strong superiority of the United States in the scientific and technological as well as economic fields , and also interacts with the active military presence of the United States in regions concerned .  
In recent years , the whole party carried out the activities of studying Deng Xiaoping Theory , conducted " three stress " education among cadres at and above the county level , recently studied and propagated Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thesis on " three represents " , and held a central ideological and political work conference not long ago .  All this has given full play to our party 's strong political advantages and effectively guaranteed the guiding position of Marxism in the ideological field .  
During the " 10th Five-Year Plan " , the province should remarkably increase the proportion of the non-public sector in its entire economy and should build this sector into a strong motive force to speed up economic growth and employ the jobless in society and into an unexhausted source to increase financial revenues as well as incomes of urban and rural residents .  
While persisting in reform and opening up and speeding up exchanges with foreign countries , we must maintain high political vigilance and clear political heads , have a clear understanding of the true features of hostile western forces , lay a firm foundation in ideals and beliefs , build a strong ideological defense line , and win the initiative in the ideological battle .  
The " Decision " by the party committee of the PLA General Staff Headquarters pointed out : With a strong sense of dedication to the revolutionary cause and a highly developed sense of political responsibility , Comrade Liu Yixin has brought up large numbers of outstanding talents for the modernization building of our army , and has achieved fruitful results in teaching and scientific research ; and his devotion to the military academic and educational undertaking has set an example for us .  
We should learn from his innovative spirit of " winning the war " and boldly scaling new heights , with which he has developed a strong awareness for guarding against future mishaps , for promoting the country 's scientific and technological development , and for making innovations ; strived to seize commanding heights in the fields of military theories as well as scientific and technological development ; and has achieved tangible results in comprehensively enhancing the ability of our army to " win the war " .  
Party committees at all levels must uphold a strong sense of being responsible for the party 's cause and the military 's construction , think of the future , make long-term plans , devote prolonged effort , and be responsible to generations to come even if they themselves are only in the position for one term .  Party committees at all levels must devote meticulous , long lasting , and permanent effort to building up the foundation and to daily implementation so as to realize overall improvement through overall consolidation and pursue comprehensive implementation through comprehensive progress .  
Various logistical supports have also been strengthened .  At present , our reserve forces ' rapid mobilization capability and fighting ability have been greatly improved .  Reserve forces have become a strong contingent of the armed forces of our country .  
In particular , we acted in line with urban defense operations , with all priority cities acting in line with their respective strategic status , to build a number of key projects such as mass concealed defense works and key strong points .  
And as to making our civil air defense organs " quasi-militarized " , we need to intensify civil air defense organ building .  Through constant building , we need to turn our civil air defense organs at all levels in the entire northeast China region into " quasi-militarized " administrative organs with political and ideological firmness , strong and effective unity , excellent professional skills , efficient organizational command , honest and clean administration , and a good administrative climate .  
and to check corruption , one should stand up for healthy trends " .  Only when we arm the minds of the vast numbers of party-member cadres with Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , and only when we educate and guide them to establish a correct outlook on the world , life , and values , can they develop a strong spiritual pillar , a correct understanding of right and wrong , and an effective political immunity .  
Party organizations , governments , and departments in charge at all levels are required to inspect their work on a regular basis , including major incidents , emergencies , heavy economic losses , persons and affairs which have aroused strong resentment among the masses , as well as problems with relation to the families of leading cadres .  Based on the results of supervision and inspection , any party-member leading cadres found to be involved should be dealt with according to relevant responsibility affixation stipulations ;  
Whether or not we can uphold democratic centralism , regularly and consciously take up the weapon of criticism and self-criticism , and unfold active and healthy ideological struggle represent an important yardstick for measuring whether a leadership group is strong and effective and whether a leading cadre is truly upright .  
With the ideological and political quality of the party rank and file and party cadres being enhanced , they will have a strong sense of fighting against corruption and keeping themselves clean and honest in performing official duties .

The ruling Japanese Liberal Democratic Party is not lacking in rightwing forces hostile to China ; they do not want to see a reunified and strong China , and still harbor covetous ambitions regarding Taiwan , China 's sacred territory , hence they look with great favor on Lee Teng-hui , who fondly remembers Japan 's colonial rule over Taiwan , and have supported Lee Teng-hui 's visit with coordinated action .

Moreover , there really existed the tendencies that a small number of government workers in charge of supervision and management of production safety neglected their duties and that some corrupt elements even collaborated with lawbreakers so that some owners of individual and private businesses in violation of laws and regulations became emboldened in the knowledge that they had strong backing ;  
You should make efforts to ensure that you have fine ideological and political qualities and also scientific and cultural ability that can withstand severe tests ; you should have both strong physique and sound minds .  
We must , with a strong sense of historic mission , actively plunge into the great practice of socialist modernization , and fully display our initiative and creativity to fulfill the key tasks in our country 's development in the period of the Tenth Five-Year Plan , and promote the sustained , high-speed , and healthy development of the national economy .  
During this crucial period , Ji Pengfei shouldered this important historic mission with a strong sense of duty as the principal leader of the Chinese government for Hong Kong and Macao affairs .  With his devotion and resourcefulness , he blazed new trails in practice , worked indefatigably in exploring new methods never attempted before , overcame all kinds of hardships and dangers , and fulfilled with flying colors the sacred mission entrusted by history and by the people of the motherland .  
It is necessary to continue the activities of creating judicial organs that satisfy the people and being judicial officers who satisfy the people so that the judicial administrative contingent at the grass-roots level will be built into a strong force that is politically up to standard , keeps a strict sense of discipline , maintains a good work style , become more proficient professionally , and enforces laws rigorously .  
At times of war , it is necessary to include counter-rescue operations into the entire process of anti-air raid operations , plan carefully , and organize in particular a keen-witted and capable counter-rescue squad equipped with the capacity of making swift responses and a strong maneuverable power , or a relevant squad which has undergone certain technological and tactical training can be designated to assume the anti-rescue task .  
The rescue operation group of the enemy is well-equipped with fierce firepower and has a strong capability to make a sudden and violent assault and a good maneuverable capability ; and most of its rescue operations are accompanied by an accurate strike in the style of " attacking a vital point , " and restraint by fierce firepower .  
We are glad to see that Hong Kong has successfully overcome many difficulties in the process of advances , has realized its economic recovery and continued to make economic growth , has maintained social stability , and has ensured that the residents can live safely and peacefully and work happily .  Hong Kong continues to display its strong vigor and dynamism as a major international metropolis and economic center .  
At the Guangdong Trade Show , there was one point of view which received general assent : The leap from a large foreign trade country to a foreign trade power rests on transformation of China 's entire economic structure and expansion methods , and within that transformation there must be strong promotion of new high technology export products in addition to the use of new high technology to refurbish traditional industries and raise the overall technological content and value added of export products .  
By building a search and rescue center marked by a sound organization structure , flexible command decision-making , advanced search and rescue equipment , and high-quality search and rescue personnel , we will be able to provide strong support for fighting and winning a future war .  
Currently it is necessary to pay great attention to several conspicuous problems that have a direct bearing on the immediate interests of the broad masses of the people , have provoked a strong reaction from the masses , and have caused serious harm to society .  Measures to be taken primarily in this respect are : cracking down on the production and sale of counterfeit goods and shoddy goods , with an emphasis on foodstuffs , medicines , agricultural materials , cotton , and assembled vehicles ;  
Those who have attained extraordinary work results , have given an outstanding work performance , have made great contributions , and have shown a strong work ability shall be promoted to higher posts either ahead of time or overstepping their proper ranks ; and those who have achieved major scientific research results or have considerably enhanced the military efficiency shall be amply rewarded .  
Only by unifying the efforts of the party , the government , the army , the people , and the students as well as the efforts of various regions , including eastern , western , southern , northern , and central regions , will it be possible to build a strong and unified force for our " strike hard " struggle aimed at rectifying social order .  
Wu Yi pointed out : Cities are situated in a central position in economic and social development , and play a strong influential and leading role in their peripheral areas .  It is necessary to do creative work in accordance with the actual conditions , give full play to their advantages in science , technology , education , and human resources , and more quickly advance the implementation of the strategy of promoting trade with science and technology .  
During the " Ninth Five-year Plan " period , the annual rate of increase in the private economic sector 's registered capital hovered between 36.3 percent and 43.1 percent ; the annual rate of increase in total output value ranged between 21.6 percent to 49.2 percent .  Both displayed a pattern of rapid and steady growth , and behind the rapid increase in capital seemed to be a strong investment momentum .  
Raidi , chairman of the Standing Committee of the Tibetan Autonomous Regional People 's Congress , noted : " Tibet is at its best time in history , for it now enjoys sound social progress , economic growth , and national unity ; its border defense remains strong and consolidated ; and its people are living a prosperous and content life .  All this does not come easily . "  
Today , Tibet is enjoying fast economic growth , great social progress , a stable situation , a sound national unity , and a strong and consolidated border defense ; and its people are leading a happy and contended life .  A scene of prosperity in the socialist new Tibet has spread out before the people of the whole world .  
While intensifying the aversion of most countries in the world to varying degrees , the so-called " unilateralism , " which is criticized by many countries , has also prompted many people of insight in the world to begin pondering numerous profound and lasting historical philosophic , political , and cultural issues , such as that in the new century , how different countries , different systems , and different cultures should make use of each other 's strong points for reference and respect each other ;  
We should work out long-term plans for cooperation in accordance with the principle of ensuring mutual benefit and drawing upon each other 's strong points , explore effective concrete measures to this end , and deepen in an all-round way bilateral cooperation and exchanges in economic , trade , banking , scientific , technological , educational , environmental , and other fields in order to constantly widen the road of Asian-European cooperation and make fresh headway in this direction . 
International security strategy experts analyzed : The space force that Russia is forming at an accelerated pace will be a strong arm and sharp weapon for Russia to deal with the " space warfare " of the 21st century and ensure national strategic security ; what is more , is a " powerful " move to counter the United States ' NMD .  
During the initial days of reform , due to the heavy shackles of the " Left " thinking , reform met with strong obstruction .  In view of such a situation , the party 's leading collective of the second generation with Deng Xiaoping at the core successfully clarified confusions and brought things back to order in the political and ideological field , stood up to pressure , and removed all obstacles ; as a result , the ship of reform set sail smoothly .  
The US strategic adjustment is a new round of expansion under the conditions of the development of the political , economic , and military situation in the world and the necessary result of further consolidating the US position of being the sole superpower in the new century .  The defense group of the Bush administration has a strong color of " Cold War fighter " .  The essence of his " new pragmatism " is to use the strong power of the United States as basis to maximize its national interests .  
Huang Qingyi said : Xu Rongkai has worked in both local and central departments and committees , including organs of the State Council . He is familiar with the work of macroeconomic management and social development and has rather rich practical experience in these fields .  He has a good knowledge of theories and policies , strong writing skills , and remarkable organizing and coordinating ability .  
Reviewing the spirit of struggle of our party in the Jinggangshan period along with the valuable historical experiences and excellent revolutionary traditions formed in the struggle has strong significance for the current strengthening of party building and the party 's close link with the masses .  
The third battle : Naval and air troops crossed beaches for landing .  Paratroops occupied strategic forts while naval and air troops and the Second Artillery Corps used strong firepower to support the attack and prevent foreign troops from eliminating mines , blocking seas , and entering the Taiwan region to join the remaining pro-Taiwan independence forces for military counterattacks .  
Li Peng said : China pursues an independent and peace-oriented foreign policy and holds that all countries in the world , big or small , strong or weak , rich or poor , are equal in international affairs .  All countries have the right to select their own social systems and development courses on the basis of their own national conditions .  
Under new historical conditions and due to the complicated and multi-faceted duties of our various military units in future anti-aggression war , we must abandon the traditional concept of " resisting and attacking enemies face-to-face " in our research and thoroughly study strong opponents who are capable of fighting a high-tech war .  
Since the sum of the gross national product of the APEC members account for half of the world 's total , he said , a strong voice issued by such an economic forum will serve as a political impetus for the launching of a new round of talks .  It will also have a direct and profound influence on the ongoing preparation work in Geneva .  
Thus it is very natural for the Chinese people bullied and humiliated by superpowers from Western countries and domestic reactionary forces over the past 100-plus years ? to look forward to the socialist ideal - expect their country to be prosperous , rich and strong , but without the phenomena of a huge gap between the rich and the poor and the weak being bullied by the strong .  
Under the condition of developing a socialist market economy , a qualified leading cadre must not only have a relatively high political quality and a relatively strong professional ability but must also have relatively high legal quality .  
Li Lanqing stressed : In rectifying and regulating the market economic order , we must proceed our tasks in a quick , responsible , and extensive manner , and adopt strong policies .  Party committees and governments at all levels must firmly uphold the principle of tackling current and long-term tasks , realistically strengthen leadership in this work , divide the work , cooperate closely , and work with concerted efforts to achieve a decisive victory .  
The ministers firmly committed themselves to pursue open regionalism , reaffirming APEC 's strong support for an open , equitable , sound , and rule-based multilateral trading system , from which all economies , developed and developing ones alike , stand to benefit .  
As a huge army of 100,000 strong amassed nearby and as the three armed services , like an arrow on the bowstring , were getting ready to conduct a three-dimensional drill of forced beach landing and attacking , who would have thought that our small car with a nonresident license plate could enter this island in Fujian Province without being subject to any inspection .  
they display the quintessence of the party 's glorious deeds and record the brilliant journey that , over the last 80 years , our party has traveled - - how our party has developed from a small party to a big one , from a weak party to a strong one , and how it has applied itself to struggling for national independence and liberation of the Chinese nation ;  
The CPC has carried out extremely hard and bitter struggles , and countless of outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation have laid down their precious lives to achieve national independence , liberation of the Chinese people , national unification , and for making the motherland wealthy and strong .  
For example , a belligerent will have to concentrate forces for a " move " aimed at forcing the enemy to submit to its own will and intention , through releasing a large amount of powerful information .  A belligerent will also have to release information intended to highlight its own strong points and the enemy 's weaknesses , sow discord between the enemy troops , and unleash a psychological attack on the enemy , thus putting psychological pressure on the enemy , weakening the enemy 's will , and " winning a war without fighting " .  
To properly organize various commemorative activities , we should follow the guidance of Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " , closely surround the main theme determined by the party central leadership , and sing aloud the eulogy for praising the Communist Party , socialism , and reform and opening up with full enthusiasm and strong assurance , thus encouraging the entire party membership and the people to continue to hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , and march forward to create a bright future for the cause of socialist modernization .  
Seen from the history of the international communist movement , our party experienced various high tides and low ebbs , favorable and unfavorable circumstances , successes and errors , and various twists and turns , and successfully withstood the stern tests of strong winds and waves , always standing firmly aloof as a mainstay in the torrents of history and successfully creating the new situation of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
As an old saying goes , " the strength of a tree can be tested by strong winds , and real gold can be distinguished with fire " .  Over the past 50 years , with the profound care of the leaders of the two countries and the joint efforts of the people of the two countries , the across-the-board friendship between the two countries withstood various tests , and was firmly maintained and continuously developed , becoming a model of friendly coexistence of countries with different social systems .  
He encouraged the leaders at all levels of the university and its teaching and administrative staff and workers as well to continue to implement the party 's policies toward nationalities in a comprehensive way and with a strong sense of responsibility , carry forward the fine traditions , strive for greater achievements in the work of training minority nationality cadres and qualified people for the state , and work hard to build the Central University of nationalities into a world class university for nationalities .  
After the Bush administration came to power , it treated Russia as " the number one potential opponent " of the United States . It showed an extreme distrust of the Putin government and expressed strong disapproval of Russia 's developing military cooperation with Iran in addition to restoring and strengthening its relationships with some former Soviet Union allies .  
Putin 's strategic target of rejuvenating Russia , restoring Russia 's prestige as a big power , and turning Russia into a major polar in today 's multipolar world tallies with the mentality and the aspirations of the Russian people ; with the addition of the remarkable results that he has already attained in boosting the country 's economic , financial , and agricultural development and in increasing the public 's income , Putin is now enjoying a strong backing at home . 
Practice proved that the third general of central leadership collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has the unusual political wisdom and superior skills of controlling the complicated situation , and is a strong leadership collective that leads the whole party and the people throughout the country to comprehensively push the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to the 21st century .  
With the coming of the new century , we ardently wish that Guangzhou and Tibet will walk to hand in hand even more closely , further strengthen and deepen their exchanges and cooperation in the economic , technical , scientific , educational , cultural , travel , and other areas , that they will continually create new forms of cooperation , expand the areas of cooperation , mutually use their strong points to compensate for weaknesses , and move forward shoulder to shoulder .  
Third , the implementation of the strategy for relying on science and education in national development and the adoption of relevant favorable policies will encourage overseas Chinese and foreign nationals of Chinese origin to make investment in running high-tech and new technology enterprises or transforming the traditional industries with high and new technologies .  This will also provide great opportunities for scientists and technology experts among overseas Chinese and the high-tech enterprises run by them to bring their strong points into better play .  
Under the conditions of socialism , reform is carried out in a peaceful and orderly form , it does not only resolve some minor problems , but is directed at the old economic structure as a whole .  Therefore it is arduous and complicated , and inevitably produces a strong impact that shocks society in may aspects .  
The vast working masses should be guided to more clearly understand their own historical responsibility .  Such a sense of mission should be turned into a strong driving force to play a role as the main force to continuously enhance their own quality and make contributions to the building of a rich and powerful socialist modern country with a high degree of democracy and civilization as Comrade Jiang Zemin hoped .  
Wei Jianxing pointed out : Since the launch of reform and opening up drive and the convening of the party 's 14th National Congress in particular , under the strong leadership of the party Central Committee , the struggle against corruption and reform have deepened constantly ; the economy has developed in a sustained way ; and social stability has been maintained , with the three factors coordinating and promoting with one another and maintaining a sound momentum of steady , healthy , and extensive and intensive development .  
Fourth , carry forward the spirit of science and democracy , enliven academic thinking .  Continue to carry out the " double-hundred policy , " encourage creative thinking , create a benign academic environment , discover and foster a large batch of outstanding young scientists , build a strong contingent of scientists and technologists with sufficient quantity and high quality , encourage them to scale up the peaks of science and technology and to occupy a position for our country in the high-tech realm of the world .  
We are firmly convinced that , with the strong leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , with the guidance of the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and the important thinking of the " three represents " and with the examples of those heroic models and advanced typical people , our party can certainly create an even better future in the 21st century .  
third , persist in comprehensively carrying out the party 's national and religious policies , making constant efforts to consolidate and develop socialist national relations marked by equality , unity , and mutual aid among the masses of every nationality in Tibet , and persist in developing a strong and patriotic united front ;  
The Tibet party committees at all levels and the regional government must clearly recognize the situation , boost morale , seize upon opportunities , and forge ahead by taking advantage of the favorable situation .  They must continue to propagate self-reliance , arduous striving and the " old Tibetan spirit , " turn the support of the central government and every locality into a strong driving force , be open and progressive , and work creatively to make new contributions for the people of every nationality in Tibet .  
Party organizations at all levels are urged to push forward the building of grassroots party organizations with an innovative mind , integrate in real terms the work of party building at the grassroots level with the reality of the country 's reform , opening up , and modernization building , take earnest steps to enhance the effectiveness of their work , and give better play to the role of grassroots party organizations as a strong fighting force ;  
Why has our Party been able to have become eminent among various political forces in modern Chinese society , turned from small to big and from weak to strong , developed from only more than 50 people at the very beginning to the biggest ruling party in the world with more than 64-million Party members , and achieved these brilliant achievements ? 
After the founding of the CPC , the Chinese nation underwent the great changes from a poor and backward nation to a prosperous and vigorously developing nation , from a disintegrated nation to a strong and unified nation , from a nation being bullied and humiliated by foreign powers to a nation being able to hold its head high and stand aloof among all nations in the world .  
Over the past 80 years , the people of all ethnic groups , the democratic parties , and progressive figures in all circles in our country always share weal and woe and fight side by side together with our party for our nation 's independence , prosperity , and bright future .  In the historical process of revolution , construction , and reform , they demonstrate a strong patriotic spirit and an indomitable fighting spirit .  
We have actively advocated and safeguarded the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , and resolutely opposed hegemonism and power politics with the strong domineering over the weak .  We have upheld principle and justice , striving to let justice prevail and safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of the vast developing countries , and pushed the establishment of a just and reasonable new international political and economic order .  
Under no circumstances should comrades of the whole party stand still and refuse to move forward , nor should they fear hardship and difficulties .  We must closely unite with people of all ethnic groups in China and strive to build the great motherland into a strong , prosperous , democratic and culturally advanced modern socialist country so as to make new and even greater contributions to humanity .  
We must meet the general requirements of building armed forces that are " qualified politically and competent militarily and has a fine style of work , strict discipline and adequate logistic support , " and follow the military strategy for the new era as our overriding guideline .  We must stress the quality of army-building and strengthen our armed forces by relying on science and technology and run the army according to law in an effort to build the People 's Liberation Army into a strong , modern and revolutionary regular army .  
Under no circumstances should comrades of the party stand still and refuse to move forward , nor should they fear hardship and difficulties .  All comrades must closely unite with the people of all ethnic groups in China and strive to build our great motherland into a strong , prosperous , democratic and culturally advanced modern socialist country and make new and even greater contributions to mankind .  
Over the 80 years under the correct leadership of the three generations of leading collectives headed by Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin , the CPC has grown from small to large and from weak to strong .  It led the Chinese people to advance wave upon wave , wage tenacious struggles , found the new China , establish the socialist system , explore ways to building socialism with Chinese characteristics , and write a magnificent chapter in the historical development of the Chinese nation .  
Everyone held that upholding the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces is a great creation of our party and a political strong point unique to our armed forces , and is also the fundamental guarantee for our armed forces always being in an invincible position .  
The participating comrades unanimously held that , showing great foresight and having far-reaching significance , General Secretary Jiang Zemin speech is a brilliant Marxist document and a political manifesto of the Chinese communists facing the 21st century .  It has strong political , theoretical , ideological , and strategic nature and is highly relevant .  
It was precisely because of this that Dr . Sun Yat-sen emphasized the importance of developing our own culture while speaking about nationalism despite controversial views and the strong atmosphere of opposing what was traditional in the academic circles .  
In his speech , General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's remarks on the Taiwan issue fully expressed the firm determination of the whole party and the entire Chinese people at home and abroad to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity and their strong desire to accomplish the motherland 's complete reunification .  
They are all determined to , under the leadership of the party central body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , deeply implement the principles and policies of the central leadership for the Taiwan issue , keep a strong sense of political responsibility , work hard to break new ground and make solid progress , unite compatriots on both sides of the straits and overseas compatriots to fight against all separatist attempts , and make contributions to the accomplishment of the motherland 's reunification at an earlier date .  
Participants held that the important thinking of " three represents " has let the basic demands of maintaining the advanced nature of the party and enabling it to always serve as a strong leadership core in building socialism with Chinese characteristics run through the theories and practice of building the ruling party , and clearly put forward a series of important new requirements for the party to strengthen itself in the new century .  
Analyzing the issue in the context of international strategy , how could the United States guarantee that the reconnaissance plane with sophisticated equipment would not take pictures of important military facilities along the coast and carry out " legal espionage mission " once it was permitted to cross China 's territorial airspace ?  Moreover , without regard to China 's strong objection , the United States had resumed its spying mission in the air space of South China and said that it would continue to do so .  
He Yong : In recent years , under the unified leadership of party committees and governments , discipline inspection and supervision departments at all levels cooperated closely with other relevant departments , adopted effectively measures , seriously implement the established policies , steadily advanced the work of removing roots causes of corruption in some key fields , properly settled some issues that aroused strong discontent among the masses over many years , and also provided useful experience for our work in the next step .  
The meeting unanimously agreed : General Secretary Jiang 's important speech is very insightful , all-embracing , rich in content , and of great significance , it has very strong political character , theoretical traits , strategic nature , and relevance .  
Utilizing their advantages of having a strong capacity of sudden attack , people 's armed forces departments in Gulou , Taijiang , and three other urban districts have organized an ad hoc team composed of 1,000 militiamen to participate in the local " strike-hard " campaign and maintain social security in coordination with public security departments so as to safeguard the fundamental interests of the people .  
We should comprehensively implement the principle on promoting younger , better educated , more professionally competent , and revolutionary cadres and the criterion on both ability and political integrity , exercise strict education and management on party member-cadres , pay keen attention to recruiting new party members from among outstanding young and middle-aged students and teachers , further strengthen the cohesive power and creativity of party organizations of schools of higher learning , and provide strong and effective political guarantee for reform , development , and stability of the cause of higher education .

Making full use of the powerful position of junior military academies and strengthening ideological and political education among the children and youth so that they will foster from childhood the fine quality of loving the party , the motherland , the people , and the army and give them training in acquiring a patriotic spirit of a high degree , a strong sense of national defense , a strong will , and strong physique is a major issue that has a bearing on the future of China 's socialist modernization .

The foreign policy must serve the needs of domestic development : making the country strong and prosperous , developing the economy , and improving the living standard of the people .  
As the statistics for various economic sectors are announced , the outline of China 's national economic development in the first half of this year is gradually becoming clear : China 's economic growth has continued to maintain a strong momentum amid the overall environment of weakening global economy .  
After the launch of the " strike hard " campaign , public security organs in Hebei , Jiangxi , Guizhou , Hunan , and Sichuan , under the strong leadership of the various levels of party committees and governments , have overcome many difficulties , adopted firm measures , destroyed a number of organized crime groups , and arrested a large number of criminals who seriously undermined public order and who committed many evil deeds .  
According to the latest statistics released by the People 's Bank of China , the country 's moderate fiscal policy has yielded desired results , and the country 's stable and healthy financial conditions during the first half of this year have proved to be strong support for both its economic restructuring and its sustained national economic growth .

Having gone through 50 extraordinary years , Tibet today enjoys economic growth , social progress , national solidarity , stability , and strong border defense ; and the people live in peace and work in contentment .  Tibet today is a thriving place replete with life .  
The PLA , armed police , and law enforcement units stationed in Tibet are strong pillars and loyal guards who safeguard the motherland 's frontier areas and Tibet 's stability .  They are important forces for building the socialist material and spiritual civilizations in Tibet . They must continue to carry forward their fine traditions and work styles , ensure their own construction , strengthen their unity with the local governments , civilian authorities , and the people , and make new contributions to Tibet 's stability and development .  
The nation is astir and the people are mad with joy over Beijing 's successful Olympic bid .

11 .  The two sides reiterate that all countries - - be they large or small , strong or weak , poor or rich - - have the right to decide their own fates , have the right to choose their political , economic , and social development courses in accordance with their national conditions , and have an equal right in participating in the discussion and settlement of world affairs .

In order to ensure that the " Lee Teng-hui line " which he operated for many years can be effectively extended and continually " developed and enhanced " among the new authorities , Lee Teng-hui , who moved about freely in the Taiwan political arena for 12 years , has ignored the strong demands of the people for rejuvenating the economy and improving cross-strait relations and has not hesitated to stir up conflict between ethnic groups and strike at those forces advocating the motherland 's reunification .  
Through the propaganda , we have been greatly touched and enhanced our thinking .  Chi Haotian said that through the propaganda campaign , the reporters have shown a high degree of revolutionary dedication and a strong sense of political responsibility .  With valuable professional dedication and despite difficulties and obstacles , these reporters went deep to frontier companies and forward posts , boldly faced hardships , worked indomitably , covered a lot of outstanding , brilliant , and touching news reports , and did a good job in performing their sacred missions and lofty duties .  
Although the " technical aspect " of their election cooperation , which external circles are most concerned about , might not seem effective , the " strategic aspect " of their alliance is rather strong .  Their overall integrated strength can be said to be " developing steadily . "  
Ji Yunshi , deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and governor , said : We must take the " 1 July " speech as a driving force ; based ourselves on the actual conditions in Jiangsu Province ; take it as the basic line of thinking to make the people prosperous and the country strong , a line of thinking which is of overall importance ;  
As compared with the period of the Clinton Administration that attached importance to multilateral cooperation , the Bush Administration regards multilateral agreements more as restricting the freedom of movement of the United States . It carries a strong color of unilateralism , judges everything by the yardstick of the " supreme national interests of the United States , " and ignores its international obligations .  
Up to now , the navies of some middle class countries are equipped with light class carriers , with costs varying from $ 300-500-million , and while this class of carrier can fulfill some regional combat missions , they can not handle the naval formations of strong nations , so this class of carrier would have no practical significance for the Chinese navy .

In the 80 years since its founding , the CPC has grown from a small and weak force to a big and strong one .  It has defeated formidable enemies in extremely difficult conditions and kept forging ahead in a tortuous course of exploration , accumulating very rich experiences .  
Under the CPC 's leadership , the Chinese people , driven by a deep hatred of the common enemy , fought a bloody war in an indomitable spirit and performed a miracle in which a weak country under semi-colonial rule defeated a strong imperialist country .  As a result , a century-old disgrace was wiped out .  
Any historical assessment of Japan 's war of aggression has been subjected to rigorous historical examination by every successive postwar Japanese government , but their annual statements marking the " Day the War Ended " ( they dare not call it the " Day of Surrender " ) have all been disappointing .  Disregarding strong domestic and foreign opposition , Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi insisted on paying his respects at Yasukuni Shrine , where a large group of war criminals is enshrined .  
The Japanese prime minister 's brazenly paying his respects shows that Yakusuni Shrine is a symbol of aggressive war ; it has overtones of a public and official provocation , and indicates contempt for the people of those countries which suffered from that aggression .  It recalls for those people the pain they suffered , so is it not something natural , a matter of course , for the Chinese people to express their strong indignation and firm opposition ?  
As for which direction Japan is likely to move under Junichiro Koizumi 's leadership , we may view things from the following two aspects : First , insofar as domestic reform is concerned , Japan is expected to meet strong resistance and a host of difficulties , first and foremost , from Junichiro Koizumi 's Liberal Democratic Party , and thus , whether Japan 's reform can succeed and meet the Japanese people 's expectations is bound to have a direct bearing on the Junichiro Koizumi Administration ;

We must make great efforts to rectify this situation .

The " five noes policy " is not some new olive branch extended by the new Taiwanese leaders , it is not their political bargaining chip , because as a minority leader , and with the DPP not the majority organization in the island 's public opinion , the points rejected in the " five noes " have strong support among those opposing " independence " in the opposition parties , which exercises a natural restraining action on the DPP .

It is necessary to strive to cultivate an ideological and political contingent that is politically strong , that is professionally competent , that has strict discipline , and that is correct in work style to support their work , to show care in their daily life , to raise their quality , and to even better give play to their roles .  
However , when the smart , wise , tenacious , and hard-working Hong Kong people mount the arena of the history as the master of themselves with the strong support from their great motherland , no tumultuous waves can make Hong Kong stray from the right course of " one country , two systems , " nor can any furious storm obscure the magnificent luster of this shining pearl .

During the cold winter season it lost all its leaves , and only barren branches are left to wait for the spring . As I watch them , the withered branches seem especially strong and unyielding in the dark . Some of the branches bud early and are soon covered with tender green leaves , transparent , smooth and clean . The veins on each heart-shaped leaf are clear to the scrutiny of night .  
It can not be denied , however , that the development of various aspects of society has brought about a number of problems that have not as yet been completely solved . For example , the adjustment of the adaptability of various government systems has not yet been completed , traditional rules of politics have been subject to strong attack , and the behavior standards of a democratic society have not yet been firmly established , leading to incidents of anomie and disorder .  
Eventually people strung together some of the popular songs existing in the countryside , blending them in with plots from vernacular fiction and song-texts and inserting a few charming stage steps and movements derived from ch'e-ku and ts'ai-ch'a drama .

S . , relatively unscathed , its strong economy , which ranked among the world 's top , and its abundant capital at the time laid a good foundation for the development of its universities and academic research .  
In traditional China there was a strong emphasis on the here and now , and among the upper classes ancestor worship tended to be functional rather than religious in nature . The same naturally held true among the lower classes , where for ordinary people with little familiarity with classical writings ancestor worship was seen in terms of personal gain .  
" One male patient received a heart from a female donor , and was worried he would turn into a woman , " recalls Dr . Chu with a smile . In fact the patient 's weak heart had arrested his physical development , and after receiving the strong and healthy transplant heart he grew bigger and his whiskers sprouted with new vigor . " The transplant actually made him more masculine ! "  
This Chinese Hamlet is a story of emotional entanglements and moral dilemmas , because Chinese drama is strong on narrative , weak on emotional outpourings , and depends more on beautiful literary language than on philosophical content .  
Thinking about all this from the angle of historical geography , I think northerners are used to being ruled by nomadic tribes , and the physical environment makes northerners more open-minded ; southerners , on the other hand , are the stubborn guardians of Chinese cultural traditions , so to speak , they opened up the south when they fled there to escape foreign domination , so they have a strong " spirit of resistance . " Q : Of what benefit were your two years of fieldwork ?  
The schools of theology , law and medicine are extremely famous . A special feature is that all of them have theoretical research as their strong suit .

Film critic and dramatist Huang Chien-yeh lauds Stan Lai as an intelligent , expert creator with a strong sense of the social pulse who is a master at handling transitions , at propelling the action forward and at providing an abundance of content in a tightly knit structure .

As an example , Den Chi-fu , a professor at National Chiao Tung University , cites India , which has strong basic science , produces many Ph . D.s and far exceeds us in the number of papers published in international academic journals , but which has been unable to raise the quality of life of its citizens , where the electronics industry has been developed for decades without ever getting off the ground and where many airports are still not computerized . . . . "  
We 're constantly seeing cases of leaders being rejudged in the light of history , finding they may have been strong in ability but were weak in morals , or vice versa . Inter-level communicationQ : In your book you analyzed the main cause for the decline of China through the ages and concluded that it lay in the rift between the upper and middle levels and between the middle and lower ones . Is cross-level interaction and communication really that difficult ?  
In the free democratic societies that have mostly replaced authoritarian societies , the upper level is formed from the middle level and the middle level from the lower level . No one 's position is permanently occupied , and there are no strong authoritarian forces blocking interaction and communication . Mutual understanding is n't difficult .  
Although many environmental scholars believe that there is also a problem of organic pollution , the scholarly community still lacks indepth under-standing in this area . In any case , organic waste is highly mobile ; Taiwan also has strong winds and heavy rains , " and has the good fortune to be surrounded by sea on all sides , so just two or three storms and most of it gets washed away , " is how one scholar describes it .  
" This is because Taiwan was pioneered from south to north . At first the south was opened up , and with illness rampant in that pioneering period , expelling the evil and clearing away misfortune required strong methods . Thus the more martial and ferocious Master Taitzu and Wang Yeh flourished more , " argues Cheng Chih-ming .  
Besides the consideration of low land costs , the concept of " bringing Taiwan 's experience in agriculture together with Vietnam 's natural resources " is just right for what the Vietnamese government - - stuck with backward local production methods and an urgent need to close the gap between city and country - - wants and needs . It has thus won their strong support .  
Besides a strong legislature , with the development of democratic politics , various interest groups are both " numerous and vocal " with their opinions . For example , there were endless disputes over land acquisition and the proposed routes of transportation projects , which all affected the pace of the projects . This caused the foreign firms who were anxious to get their orders settled to have to wait off to the side chomping at the bit .  
Researchers have endeavored to find the reasons why grey mullet production has been unstable in recent years . One important discovery is that although the cold water mass from the mainland heads south to Taiwan , if it is n't sustained , which is to say if it does n't come far enough south , then it wo n't be strong enough to get into that push-pull dynamic with the Kuroshio Current , so that the fish will not form into schools . "

Critics hold that Red Sorghum , which carries the mysterious colors of silence on the vast northern plain on which it is set and describes a strong northern man taking a wife , and Judou , which describes the melancholy of a beautiful women suppressing her sexuality , are both " packaged in exoticness . "  
Q : Because the Three Gorges project is extremely complex , there are many different opinions pro and con . Those opposed accuse the political leaders of simply liking grandiose white elephants while ignoring the ecology and the overall interests of the nation . Those who approve say that the dam could resolve the eternal problem of flooding on the Yangtze , and feel that this enormous project would enable the country to become wealthy and strong , creating a chance to do something unparalleled in the world .  
Seeking for strong potential : According to data from the Directorate-General of Budget , Accounting and Statistics , Executive Yuan , the proportion of over-65s in the Taiwan region will reach 7.1 percent next year , meaning that the ROC meets the United Nations definition for an elderly society .

One of the features of tea is that it can be made stronger or weaker . It has its own striking flavor when strong ; when it is weak , it is more like water , suitable for mixing with various flavorings like jasmine , lemon , pomegranate , or whatever .

One example can be found in the Taiwan television serial " Empress of an Age , " where aside from portraying the Empress Wu as a strong female in the traditional mold , the writers also see fit to credit her success to the support of two capable men .

Although the Chinese communist authorities have already announced that they have arrested three suspects for robbing the passengers and burning the boat , the rigid attitude displayed by mainland China after the incident , their imperious obstruction of bereaved family members and reporters from Taiwan , and their sustained insistence that the incident was simply an accident , generated a strong reaction in Taiwan , where people moved to completely boycott cross-Strait exchanges .  
A heavy load of paper work , mostly administrative in nature , stirred in him strong feelings of nostalgia for the simple life he led as a straight weather forecaster . Hence , when a television station invited him to serve primarily as a weather forecaster , this tallied with his special interests , and after only a moment 's reflection he agreed .  
He practiced medicine in his " Pochilum Clinic . " In an age of turmoil when China was weak and prey to Western invaders , with one hand he struck at the foreign sowers of intrigue and disorder , and with the other he fought against the corrupt and treacherous elements within China which sprang up to bedevil the country in its hour of difficulty . In the Chinese cinema of the l990s , the heroic figure of Huang Fei-hong bears strong parallels with Bruce Lee , who was the sensation of the film world 20 years ago .  
" The ' huachung ' [ or central Chinese climate ] zone of mainland China and the ' huanan ' [ or southern Chinese climate ] zone divide just about at the Ta-an River . To the north , where the rains are heavy , the settlers built wooden structures offering strong protection against the rain . It 's drier to the south , so there they built cool and shady bamboo structures . " And the abundance of rocks strewn on the bed of the Ta-an River led to their use in the embankments between rice paddies .

Previously salmon had taken advantage of different types of topography to adapt to natural disasters . Today there are no pools for them to escape to , and when heavy rains come the fish are washed downstream . No fish , no matter how strong , can overcome the meters-high dams to get back upstream , so they are left to die from the higher water temperatures downstream .  
To make redbraised beef noodle soup , generally the meat is fried with chilli and broad bean paste , then simmered with such spicy and aromatic ingredients as chopped garlic , coriander and ginger . The strong flavor naturally tends to mask any rankness in the beef , but it also covers the meat 's own flavor . But a clear broth brings out the natural flavor of the beef , so the meat 's selection and preparation require particular care .  
After the universal health insurance was implemented , the medical referral system , buttressed by ample financial power , went into an experimental phase . But wave after wave of strong suspicion and opposition have been thrown up against the program . This has forced the NHIB to initiate the " transitional step " of simplifying the referral system from having four levels to only two , and doing away with extra fees for those who have no referral slips , until the population can become accustomed to the referral system .  
Old local gazetteers report the existence of " black gulches " to both the west and east of Penghu . The former-nicknamed " the Larger Sea " - - separated Penghu from Fujian Province , while the latter ( " the Lesser Sea " ) marked the boundary between Penghu and Taiwan . It was vital for ships trying to cut across these " gulches " to catch a strong wind in the right direction , otherwise they would be carried away by the current and placed in severe danger if they should hit a typhoon .  
Naturally he does not exclude the possibility that some of these ships were brought to grief by Penghu 's strong winds and treacherous waters . For example , when exploring the tiny 1,000-meter-square island of Hsienchiao ( which means " dangerous coral reef " ) , he found an astounding amount of Yuan and Ming period potsherds . " It seems obvious that ships were wrecked here , " he concludes .  
Then people would start yelling or crying or having other strong emotional reactions . When the physical problems appeared , Mesmer and his assistants would massage the afflicted part of the body to " prompt the magnetic fluid to pass through . " The results appeared to be quite good .  
The bronze and jade articles from the earliest antiquity bear the marks of different tribal groups ; the extraordinarily finely carved Hindustan jades from Northern India and the Anatolian Peninsula bear a strong flavor of Islam . Porcelain from the Liao , Jin and Yuan dynasties ( non-Han dynasties in the period 907-1368 ) is markedly distinct from the porcelain of the Song and Ming dynasties , but there are also signs of mutual influence .  
This is the time of year when the weather is affected by cold high-pressure areas from the continent . These create sharp differences in temperature , generating strong upward currents . Also , humidity is low , and there is less concern about rain caused by hot air currents running into cold air at high altitudes .  
Chen Chuo-ming , head of the Changhua Normal University , says that in the Chinese tradition teachers were supposed to have been able to teach both the material and the man . Teachers trained for ten years , and after this hard labor and sacrifice , not only did they acquire knowledge , they acquired a strong character as well , and this was reflected in their essays and lessons . But modern training for professors creates researchers only specialized in one particular area .  
An incoming middle school teacher earned about NT $ 4000 per month ( or less than US $ 100 at then-current exchange rates ) . It was a time of political and diplomatic crises . President Chiang Kai-shek had died less than a year before ( in April , 1975 ) , and citizens accustomed to following a strong leader were at a loss .

After the brief upturn in the first quarter of last year , the monitoring signal score slid from its peak level - - the " yellow-red light , " which indicates a booming economy - - through the " green light " which indicates moderately strong economic activity , past the rather sluggish " yellow-blue light , " and all the way to the worrisome " blue light " !  
" The artistic aura of Hou Hsiao-hsien 's The Puppet Master was similar in lighting and hue to that of the 17th Century Dutch painter Rembrandt . It needs to be illuminated with excellent facilities , " says Chiao . When screened in inadequately equipped theaters , the film is transformed into a murky block . The situation is even worse on a television set , whose ability to differentiate between strong and soft light is considerably inferior .  
President Lee talked about a " Chinese renaissance " - - an ideal Chinese culture based in Confucian thought , but not distorted and rigidified by authoritarian rulers , which has also absorbed the best of modern Western culture . Can this culture grow strong in Taiwan and then influence the 1.2 billion people in mainland China , so that one day they too can be the bosses of their own government ?  
" Although Air Macau has its strong points , we are also increasing our efforts , " comments TransAsia Airway 's public relations office . After passengers reach Macao , in addition to the conventional method of disembarking and boarding a second flight to mainland China , TransAsia also offers a free bus service which takes their customers straight to Guangdong 's Zhuhai City in little more than an hour . From Zhuhai 's newly completed Sanzao International Airport , one can then fly to all the major cities in mainland China .  
One of his own specialties is a " galan-tine , " in which many strips of meat are bound together into a long loaf . To stew the meat , instead of the traditional sachet of strong spices , Kao only uses a few pods of star anise and a dash of Sichuan peppercorns and black pepper . To make up for the missing spices he adds rather more spring onions , ginger and garlic , to give the meat more of the light aroma of fresh vegetables .  
Chinese have long understood how to listen to the natural music of the soughing pines . This is especially so for those ancient literati who learned that it was their duty to serve their nation , but who could find no ruler who would listen to their criticisms of official corruption and inefficiency . Disappointed by the mundane world , these literati found in pines a salve , admiring how , even in the most remote places , they grew strong .  
Based upon various different research conclusions , Goleman expresses the strong belief that social problems , particularly the worsening problems among children and adolescents , are linked to the emotions .

Second , Lu Hsiu-lien offered strong personal credentials : a strong academic record , a clean and fresh image , a background as a leader in the women 's movement , and her imprisonment as an early democratic activist back in the early 1980s . She also showed a far-reaching boldness for running the county for " four years and nine months " ( i.e . the nine-month replacement term plus an expected victory in the regular year-end contest ) .  
Wang Chen-tai notes that early on there were factional conflicts , reducing the religion 's impact . Fortunately , he says , learned elders like Hsieh Sung-tao and Ting Chung-ming wrote inexhaustibly . Also , because of the importance of diplomatic ties with Islamic countries , the ROC government has strongly supported Muslims . The Taipei mosque , which has been the main spiritual and practical resource for Muslims in Taiwan for many years now , was built with government money in response to strong and far-sighted efforts by Ambassador Yeh Kung-chao .  
Last year , the meeting of APEC leaders was held in Manila , in the Philippines . Upon entering the country , every leader , conforming to local custom , changed into a Filipino shirt , marked by dazzling patterns and bright , fresh colors . The collective photo which all the leaders lined up for is permeated by the style and passion of Southeast Asia . It makes a strong impression on anyone who sees it , wherever they may be from .  
As they stand in front of you , the color of their skin and nationality seems no longer to make any difference , and what becomes apparent is that Evergreen 's strong corporate culture-that " green " spirit with which the firm is so associated in Taiwan-is reverberating here in an exotic land on the other side of the world .  
" The strong prey on the weak , the old consume the young , " sighs one telecom company manager . Early on , the DGT earned huge profits with its exorbitant mobile phone charges ; it was this fat market that private firms yearned for .  
What one sees is what is left after the violence , circles of shards amid the silence . With Tsong Pu 's exquisite and mature installation technique , the small and large pottery shards arranged in their disordered way create a rhythm between strong and weak and rising and falling that is similar to what is found in poetry .  
They quickly discovered that while she looked elegant and refined , she was broad-minded , direct and easy to get along with . Though she could n't speak Hakka , she could chat away half the day with them using signs and gestures . Though an artist , she spent her days working in the fields . Running up and down the mountain , she was soon as tan and as strong as the local farming wives .  
Looking from another angle , after the Communist Party of China had won power , if they had governed well , developed China , fulfilled the calls to " overtake the US and Britain , " and improved the living conditions of the people , then even if Zhang had acted traitorously , even though his actions were morally flawed , the result of these actions would have been that China became rich and strong and he would still be a national hero to be revered through the ages . However , this has not been the reality .  
The fundamental principles behind the operation of a synchrotron are based in electromagnetic theory : when electrons moving at near the speed of light are subjected to a magnetic field , they can then be deflected to create strong radiation in a tangential direction-namely , synchrotron radiation .  
About 400 years ago people began coming over to Taiwan from Fujian and Guangdong in search of land to farm . Faced with the perilous sea voyage and the hazardous life of pioneers , they naturally had a strong need for some authoritative guidance in determining the best ( and worst ) times to act .  
From their early twenties into their thirties and forties , these bodyguards weathered innumerable storms with CCK . Well trained , possessed of strong bodies and agile minds , these men were ready for anything . But the aging body of the man they protected was weakening by the day . Finally , this candle flickering in the wind was extinguished .  
Lu Dongbin was a Tang-dynasty historical figure who trained himself in the Daoist arts in hopes of becoming an immortal . He has long since passed into popular lore as an immortal with a strong preference for the company of women . He is well-known for his flirtations with a famous courtesan , and for his frequent drunken revelry at the Yueyang Pavilion .  
Most observers approved of Siew 's decisive handling of the case as maintaining the team spirit of the cabinet . Though Liao later made a strong statement attacking Siew and Control Yuan President Wang Tso-yung was also critical , the incident was settled in a short time due to Premier Siew 's actions .  
But in natural forests , every creature has its natural enemies , and the insect fungus Beauveria bassiana and parasitic flies are ready and waiting for M . basalis pryeri . Furthermore , in the wild the inchworms prefer trees over two meters tall , and by the time trees have reached this size they are strong enough for a few caterpillars not to pose them any threat .  
Two-spotted lymantriid moth caterpillars ' bodies are covered with fine , spiny hairs , and although the insecticide quickly killed the grubs , their death throes released the hairs from their bodies . The number of poisonous spines drifting in the air increased dramatically , and with the help of Hsinchu 's strong winds they got into the children 's respiratory tracts ; the children also came out in an unbearably itchy red rash . Over half the school 's staff and pupils had to seek medical attention .  
Moreover , it takes system safety very seriously and will build in passwords to prevent theft of the data . The National Card project is ready to fly , but despite repeated assurances from the RDEC and the fact that it will only combine two functions in its initial stage , the public 's opposition remains strong . Government agencies must still give careful consideration to the functions that the card will later include and the potential problems that may result .  
Shih Ying does not deny that there were already a number of community organizations active in Wenshan District , and that it already had quite a strong cultural and educational ethos . Thus siting the first community college there " in fact was a soft option-but that does n't mean we are n't aware of the difficulties to be faced later . " He says that in the future it is hoped that community colleges will spread to communities throughout Taiwan , but this will depend on each community 's degree of readiness and preparedness .  
When the northeast monsoon was at its peak in early December , stormy skies , strong winds and ferocious waves made coming to this small island off Taiwan 's southeast coast feel like boarding a forlorn little boat that was liable to capsize at any moment .

Saying it wants to block any rampant spread of gambling , the Executive Yuan has decided to propose additional amendments in the next legislative session . However , it will certainly meet strong opposition from the conglomerates and legislators who fought so hard to have the gambling rider passed .  
Not knowing this story , the Japanese naturally do n't carry out dragon boat races , as we Chinese do . It was at some point during the Edo period ( 1607-1867 ) that tango no sekku came to be seen as a festival for boys . Families with male children began to use the festival as a chance to pray that their sons would grow up strong and brave . As an expression of their wishes , they took to displaying statues dressed in the armor worn by medieval Japanese warriors .  
Firstly , there is strong support among Taiwan 's population of 22 million people , regardless of ethnic group or provincial ancestry , for the concept of " new Taiwanese .

The straightforward , confident , and unrestrained A-Mei has made quite a splash in the Chinese-speaking world . Perhaps it is not surprising that someone with such a distinctive personality would elicit strong feelings both positive and negative . Wang Dong is not alone in his views , for many in the mainland have asked how long A-Mei will continue her spectacular run of success . Hopefully she will always " speak " straight from the heart , and can keep that natural verve that set her apart from the crowd in the first place .  
Because the royal Li family of the Tang dynasty were descended from western and northern minorities , the Tang dynasty was deeply influenced by their culture , and the hunks of the Tang dynasty were all tall and broad-shouldered with strong physiques .

In that way a small minority of gifted students could enter schools where the curriculum is specifically tailored to meet their needs . But it is n't necessary to make entrance exams exceedingly abstruse just so it is possible to distinguish these students . " There are theoretical bases behind both district high school systems and selective high school systems , and both have their strong points , " says Yang Jen-hsiao , principal of NTNU Affiliated High .  
The biggest weak point of the joint entrance exam is that only people that excel on pen-and-paper examinations come out on top . People with a strong spatial sense , musical talent or athletic prowess are neglected . The movement to replace the joint entrance exam is based on this kind of reasoning .  
Taiwan at that time was in the midst of an " economic miracle " fueled by the export success of its small and medium enterprises .

Ju 's determination made a deep impression on Yang , a strong believer that the mark of a true artist is not to be found in technical skill , but in a person 's attitude . In Yang 's view , an artist must be sincere and kindhearted , otherwise he is unlikely to attain artistic success . Ju ended up studying under Yang for eight years . Yang took a special interest in the country boy with no formal art education .  
The latter was the northernmost of these three counties , and extended all the way to Taipei and Keelung , but settlers long declined to venture north of Touliu ( today the county seat of Yunlin ) . Further south in Tainan , the Dutch arrived in the 1620s and established a fortress called Zeelandia . Later in that century , the Ming loyalist Koxinga 's able minister Chen Yonghua adopted a policy of keeping Taiwan equally strong in both the cultural and military spheres . A period of cultural flowering ensued in the south .  
The sponsoring organizations make strong efforts to attract excellent instructors . Most of the students are youths with a strong political bent , many of whom hope to become political reporters or legislative assistants , or to find positions at political brain trusts . Some plan to get involved in social movements or to seek public office themselves . As far as they are concerned , these leadership camps are basic training in political participation .  
The architecture of the temples is of the eastern Fujian style , with granite walls and featuring colorful , intricate decorations , in sharp contrast to the plain buildings around them . Squatting in the entrance of a temple on a hillside , looking out across the sea-which shines golden in the light of the setting sun and is dotted with little fishing craft-one feels a strong sense of the endless ebb and flow of history .  
Later , because strong winds and heavy seas made landing impossible , the camera team 's plans were delayed . The next time they were able to land on the islet where the birds were filmed , the Chinese crested terns had already moved on , so the team missed the opportunity to observe them more closely .  
The jian also contributed to a dashing appearance . In the view of Professor Chen Pingyuan of Peking University 's Chinese literature department , " Bearing a jian makes one handsome and dignified ; it confers a heroic air . " Chen notes that it would have been hard to travel far carrying a heavy dao or a pair of axes . Moreover , being adrift with book and sword carries strong connotations of refinement .  
Chiang warns , " If you take a bank job , you 'd better be ready to bone up on the financial industry , sharpen your sales skills , and become a multi-talented money management advisor . " Financial products are complex and come in infinite variety . Banks badly need powerful systems for integrating financial information , so computer specialists with a strong quantitative grasp of the business will be highly valued by their employers .  
Liu Chia-lang , head of the office of civil affairs , also has strong feelings on the future of development and industry in Tungkang : " Only Japan and Tungkang produce banded coral shrimp , which is one of the main seafood products of the town . And Tapeng Bay abounds in natural resources . Tungkang has what it takes to develop . But Taiwan 's entry into the WTO is going to be a heavy blow to Tungkang 's fishing industry . "  
From the 1970s to the beginning of 1990s , entrance to these schools was fixed at a ratio of 30:70 . No matter how strong the desire of students to continue toward university , seven out of every ten were forced out of the university track and into the vocational track right after leaving junior high ( i.e . just before their tenth year in school ) . These have been the real victims left on the school advancement battlefield .  
Kwan is talented at conveying the role of the tormented but strong-willed female in traditional society . Considered as particularly skilled at smashing the stereotyped female image as portrayed in cinema , he possesses a strong sense of feminism .  
During the Ming dynasty an Inspection Office was set up here , and Kinmen became an important maritime defense settlement . After the commanding general , Zhou Dexing , said of the place , " It is as impregnable as a metal [ kin ] wall and a moat of boiling water , and it commands control of the ocean gate [ men ] , " it came to be called Kinmen . Thus Kinmen 's role as a key military strong point began several hundred years ago .  
Not far off the east coast of Taiwan the continental shelf falls away into an ocean trench thousands of meters deep , so bluefin arriving from across the Pacific have to come close inshore to find shallow waters to spawn . Their newly hatched fry are unable to hunt or swim for themselves , so they need waters that are rich in plankton and have strong currents . The North Equatorial Current and the Kuroshio Current pass by eastern Taiwan , creating an area of high primary productivity .  
And Taiwan has a special history , she explains . It has experienced colonization and imperialism and is a cosmopolitan place with strong ties to the rest of the world , but it also has the rich cultures of the Southern-Fujianese-speaking " Taiwanese , " the Mandarin-speaking mainlanders who arrived after the war , and its aboriginal tribes . " How can it not have abundant stories , emotions , conflicts , dreams and all the sweet , sour , bitter and hot that make up people 's lives ? "  
Although this has been a bitter test , after six years of experience , Chuang Ming-yi and the entire community now feel a strong sense of mission . This major fire has only made them even more aware of how fast things can change , so they are even more determined to move forward .  
But as things have developed , and with strong support from the Council for Cultural Affairs , it has become ever richer in content , and moved toward being an " all-new , all-round operatic production " that combines the beauty of Peking Opera and Western opera .

Regarding the international emphasis on " global " culture , Soyinka pointed out that the TIBE was featuring ancient Chinese culture , Czech culture , his own traditional Yoruba culture , as well as authors of Caribbean and American backgrounds , all exhibiting at the same time . This reveals that Taiwan is not a country that is culturally weak . In contrast to the strong centralizing trend of globalization , the TIBE assumed the appearance of an " anti-globalization " book exhibition , which felt marvelous .  
That afternoon , the sky suddenly turns black and a strong wind comes up , and raindrops the size of coins-seemingly racing to the ground-come crashing down on the corrugated steel roofs of buildings , raising a racket that shakes the very air . It is like an invading army , and I watch as the water fills the embassy compound , then begins to seep into my office , and soon is washing over my feet . ( I must have made a comical sight . )  
Chen made full use of tin 's flexibility to contrast the cock 's soft feathers , its obstinate and unruly beak , and its two erect legs . Thousand Mile Eyes and Ears that Hear with the Wind , which is part of the collection at Tachia 's Chenlan Temple , depicts the two deities that are sidekicks of Mazu , the goddess of the sea . It blends various techniques in a work of great spirit and vitality . The deities ' magnificent poses and strong muscular lines reinforce each other to achieve tremendous drama and realism .  
" A truly professional art therapist will not show off her ability to interpret paintings .

He gradually developed his own style and found new techniques to express it . His painting style evolved from Taiwanese localism to sentimentalism .  
Just as famous as their green onions are their sand leeks , although they can only be grown over the two or three months of winter . With the abundant rainfall of the plain , the leeks , too , grow large and well proportioned .

As the association 's executive director Huang Jui-chiang points out , the full 12-kilometer length of Highway 7C had been divided into 13 sections , each with their own name , which had long confused visitors from outside the area . Taking this into consideration , the county government proposed earlier this year to rename the entire highway " Parisa Road , " but this proposal met with strong opposition . Caught between a rock and a hard place , the county government decided to open the proposal to public submissions .  
Cheng points out that although such ideas have a contagious element about them , people who are mentally healthy or who have a strong " psychological immunity " will not easily be " infected " by suicide reports . But people who are themselves suffering from severe depression or who have suffered a serious setback in life , are more likely to be contaminated by an unhealthy suicidal frame of mind and to be unable to free themselves from it .  
With its beautiful natural scenery , Ilan County has a strong environmental consciousness . As early as 1977 , the county began experimenting with and promoting the recycling of kitchen waste . Natural Environmental Protection Foundation chairperson Liu Shu-hui and National Ilan Institute of Technology jointly developed a simple composting method suitable for use by families and neighborhoods .  
Mutouyu , located at the northernmost part of the Penghu islands , is comprised entirely of rocks , with reefs on all sides . It is strategically important terrain , but not one inch of grass grows on the entire island , and every time strong winds and waves rise up , it seems like a salty rain is falling . Every day the island is covered in a salt fog , with salt getting into your clothes and hair , making it very uncomfortable .  
Jan Hung-tze , an expert on trends , writes that Taiwan ought to be better suited than Korea at matching and combining these industries suitable for cultural creativity with the information technology industry ( where Taiwan is already strong ) , creating electronic publishing , the broadcasting and marketing of digital music , and video games .  
This long-standing practice of raising tilapia with other livestock kept tilapia prices low , though its bacterial counts were somewhat elevated . Tilapia makes a delicious dish commonly consumed at family meals , but its strong earthy taste and humble image can not be shaken off .  
Because of strong support from parents and schools , not only has there been a quantitative increase in the number of players , but a clear qualitative increase as well . Since the first breakthrough in 1999 when Chen Chin-feng signed a contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers of the US , over the past several years international talent hunters have scouted more than 15 of Taiwan 's top players , and Taiwan has become a main center for the development of talent for global baseball .  
When the company took control of the Bears this year , it immediately adopted Kaohsiung 's Cheng-Ching Lake Baseball Stadium and took a more professional tack in managing the team , improving the diet , clothing , living arrangements and transportation it provided to the players .

A few extra charcoal blocks are thrown on the fire to boil water and provide heat . Although the temperature in Taiwan 's plains can go as high as 30oC in late May , when night comes , it falls to 4-5oC on the north peak and there is often a strong cold wind . Sweaters , hats and thick socks are basic requirements all year round . " Not until November 1997 did a helicopter bring the first load of charcoal to the Yushan Weather Station , " says Hsieh .  
A loose hat flies up into the air , and someone curious to see how a helicopter delivers construction material is forced by the strong wind and sand kicked up by the helicopter to squint as , eyes barely open , he watches the helicopter as it lowers heavy solar panels to the ground and then flies off in the direction of Taoshan .

In an era of strong environmental consciousness , when reports of disasters are frequent , naturally a land-use policy that gives the environment central importance is going to get a generally positive response . But because the government actually promoted mountain agriculture for half a century , now hundreds of thousands of farmers and workers in related industries depend on it for their livelihood , and there is also the question of the cultural and historic needs of Aborigines who call the mountain forests home .

To exercise the strong political leadership required to attain a national , regional and international consensus regarding effective solutions for these complex issues ;  
Capacitybuilding , training , regional and international cooperation and information exchange along with a strong coordinating body at the national level seem to have been common primary requirements by developing countries .  
The Conference acknowledged the need to organize regional workshops regularly and provide expert advisory services with a strong involvement in the United Nations system , in collaboration with international scientific and professional organizations . 
The Commission also regards the achievement of a safe and healthy environment , through strong and effective international and domestic environmental protection efforts , as an essential component of sustainable development .  
Sound macroeconomic policies , a strong fiscal system , the development of human resources in environmental management and administrative efficiency are essential for successful internalization .  
This involves promoting the conditions for a strong and an efficient civil service capable of meeting the challenges posed by national economic development and the specific conditions of the world economy .  
A strong and effective multilateral system with the United Nations at its centre is an essential prerequisite for successful multilateral cooperation on development and international economic policy and operations .  
The developments during the past year relating to the Framework Convention on Climate Change have to some extent been encouraging , but the process still suffers greatly from the strong political and economic forces that obscure the Convention 's clearly stated objective : the stabilization of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at safe levels .  
The opposition to a strong and dynamic United Nations is political and profoundly ideological , and is largely concentrated in a few States whose establishments prefer not to strengthen a forum in which their domestic and global policies can be challenged or trimmed .  But the United Nations exists for all humankind , not just a handful of Member States representing a small minority of the world 's population . . . .  
Thus , for those who believe that the African is less than human or is incapable of governing himself , the existence for almost a century and a half of a politically stable and peaceful Liberia with strong economic potential is undesirable .  
We must now assuage our hurt by rising above our differences and coalesce into a strong , unified nation , determined to move forward to a better and prosperous future .  
The pious promises of the developed world to allocate a minuscule percentage of national income to the provision of aid for the developing world have shrunk to non-fulfilment ; the thought of the strong economies helping the weak has shrivelled like a raisin in the sun .  
We are increasingly becoming aware that the world is one family , and that if we are to assure a brighter and better future for coming generations , we have no other choice than to continue our efforts towards preserving and promoting a strong United Nations that will be able to pursue a common purpose for a world of equity , justice and shared economic progress .  
We hope that the final outcome of this high-level meeting will give a strong impetus to developing such partnerships among the principal actors in this field so that the World Programme of Action will have sound institutional and political support at all levels international , regional and national .  
It must not only resolve a society 's fundamental problems but also promote the full development of the whole individual , with a strong emphasis on economic and social development , social justice and the necessary participation of all citizens in building a civil , pluralistic and participatory society .

Handed down through thousands of years , this strong national cohesion has neither weakened with the passage of time nor been shaken by the changes of dynasty and instead has become a lofty standard of value and passionate political belief that has taken root in the depth of the heart of every Chinese .  
By the middle of the next century , when the Chinese nation reaches the level of an intermediately developed nation with its own hard work , a wealthy , strong , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist China will stand tall in the East !

This absurd move , which violated China 's sovereignty , wantonly interfered in its internal affairs , and breached the basic norms of international relations , has aroused strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition from the Chinese people .  
The main reason why the United States produces an annual country report on human rights practices , heedless of the strong opposition of other countries , assumes the air of a " judge of human rights , " and insists on interfering in affairs under the jurisdiction of other countries is mainly to use this as a pretext for putting political pressure on other countries , especially developing and socialist countries , in a bid to change their political and social systems .

In international relations , China is opposed to the big bullying the small , the strong bullying the weak , and advocates building a new international political and economic order which is peaceful and steady as well as just and reasonable .  
Therefore , to stabilize the birthrate , we must persistently focus our attention on people ; under the general situation of the country 's social and economic growth , devote great efforts to eliminate those economic , social , and natural conditions which may affect people 's concept on child birth ; and provide a sufficient material guarantee and a strong spiritual driving power for the change in people 's concept on child birth .

"  His election as president of the new century by the common people showed that the common people have great expectations for him , and hope he will lead Russia to a prosperous , stable , and strong tomorrow .

The fact that under the staunch leadership of the party , the anti-separatist struggle in our region has turned from the state of passively meeting an emergency to one of taking the initiative to tackle problems in a comprehensive way and that our social and political situation remains stable shows that the 2.6-million people of all ethnic groups , the main body in the struggle against the separatist clique headed by the Dalai , are carrying out this struggle with strong determination , redoubled confidence , and high morale until they win a complete victory .  
The vast majority of these comrades are young in age , good in political quality , highly educated , possessing of strong professional ability , broadminded , ideologically emancipated , highly conscious of reform , and down-to-earth in style of work .

In a country which originally does not have a strong religious awareness , while reaffirming man 's right to freedom of faith , we must also let our kindhearted people know how high a cost the Western world has paid in blood and how protracted and arduous a struggle it has gone through in its pursuit of a peaceful coexistence between religion and rationality and in its effort to gradually bury the various extremist religions and political propositions .  
It is necessary to act according to the requirements of the " three represents " to earnestly study and resolve the new situations and new issues encountered in the building of party organizations under the new historical condition of reform and opening up and developing the socialist market economy and conduct education for maintaining the advanced nature of the party with targets in mind , so as to let party branches at grass-roots level possess very strong capability in directing the overall building of companies and resolving their own problems and party member truly display an exemplary role .  
Now that the case has been cracked within a short period of time , this has once again borne out that our public security contingent is one capable of fighting a tough battle and one worthy of the trust of the party and the people and deserving such a title as a strong shield of the republic .  
An important experience we have accumulated in administrating military units at grass-roots level lies in sticking to " one group and two contingents . "  Practice has shown that every military unit with a solid contingent of party members is strong .  This unit can stand forward at crucial moments and confront difficulties and dangers .  
The party organization of this unit is strong in uniting and inspiring people .  Now that party members account for a considerable percentage of the military and armed police forces , if this contingent is satisfactorily administered , we will provide a solid foundation for the party 's absolute leadership over the military and provide a reliable guarantee for assuring the completion of every task .

As a result of this struggle , the people of all nationalities throughout the country have further formed the common aspiration that China must develop , the nation must be rejuvenated , and society must be stable ; and they have further formed staunch fighting spirit for rousing ourselves to vigorous efforts to make the country prosperous , making China strong , and boosting our national strength .

The Japanese Government has ignored the repeated strong opposition of the Chinese Government and imprudently agreed to permit Lee Teng-hui to " go to Japan for medical treatment .

The ruling Japanese Liberal Democratic Party is not lacking in rightwing forces hostile to China ; they do not want to see a reunified and strong China , and still harbor covetous ambitions regarding Taiwan , China 's sacred territory , hence they look with great favor on Lee Teng-hui , who fondly remembers Japan 's colonial rule over Taiwan , and have supported Lee Teng-hui 's visit with coordinated action .

All countries have the right to select their own social systems and development courses on the basis of their own national conditions .  
Under new historical conditions and due to the complicated and multi-faceted duties of our various military units in future anti-aggression war , we must abandon the traditional concept of " resisting and attacking enemies face-to-face " in our research and thoroughly study strong opponents who are capable of fighting a high-tech war .  
Since the sum of the gross national product of the APEC members account for half of the world 's total , he said , a strong voice issued by such an economic forum will serve as a political impetus for the launching of a new round of talks .  It will also have a direct and profound influence on the ongoing preparation work in Geneva .  
Thus it is very natural for the Chinese people bullied and humiliated by superpowers from Western countries and domestic reactionary forces over the past 100-plus years ? to look forward to the socialist ideal - expect their country to be prosperous , rich and strong , but without the phenomena of a huge gap between the rich and the poor and the weak being bullied by the strong .  
Under the condition of developing a socialist market economy , a qualified leading cadre must not only have a relatively high political quality and a relatively strong professional ability but must also have relatively high legal quality .  
Li Lanqing stressed : In rectifying and regulating the market economic order , we must proceed our tasks in a quick , responsible , and extensive manner , and adopt strong policies .  Party committees and governments at all levels must firmly uphold the principle of tackling current and long-term tasks , realistically strengthen leadership in this work , divide the work , cooperate closely , and work with concerted efforts to achieve a decisive victory .  
The ministers firmly committed themselves to pursue open regionalism , reaffirming APEC 's strong support for an open , equitable , sound , and rule-based multilateral trading system , from which all economies , developed and developing ones alike , stand to benefit .  
As a huge army of 100,000 strong amassed nearby and as the three armed services , like an arrow on the bowstring , were getting ready to conduct a three-dimensional drill of forced beach landing and attacking , who would have thought that our small car with a nonresident license plate could enter this island in Fujian Province without being subject to any inspection .  
they display the quintessence of the party 's glorious deeds and record the brilliant journey that , over the last 80 years , our party has traveled - - how our party has developed from a small party to a big one , from a weak party to a strong one , and how it has applied itself to struggling for national independence and liberation of the Chinese nation ;  
The CPC has carried out extremely hard and bitter struggles , and countless of outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation have laid down their precious lives to achieve national independence , liberation of the Chinese people , national unification , and for making the motherland wealthy and strong .  
For example , a belligerent will have to concentrate forces for a " move " aimed at forcing the enemy to submit to its own will and intention , through releasing a large amount of powerful information .  A belligerent will also have to release information intended to highlight its own strong points and the enemy 's weaknesses , sow discord between the enemy troops , and unleash a psychological attack on the enemy , thus putting psychological pressure on the enemy , weakening the enemy 's will , and " winning a war without fighting " .  
To properly organize various commemorative activities , we should follow the guidance of Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " , closely surround the main theme determined by the party central leadership , and sing aloud the eulogy for praising the Communist Party , socialism , and reform and opening up with full enthusiasm and strong assurance , thus encouraging the entire party membership and the people to continue to hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , and march forward to create a bright future for the cause of socialist modernization .  
Seen from the history of the international communist movement , our party experienced various high tides and low ebbs , favorable and unfavorable circumstances , successes and errors , and various twists and turns , and successfully withstood the stern tests of strong winds and waves , always standing firmly aloof as a mainstay in the torrents of history and successfully creating the new situation of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
As an old saying goes , " the strength of a tree can be tested by strong winds , and real gold can be distinguished with fire " .  Over the past 50 years , with the profound care of the leaders of the two countries and the joint efforts of the people of the two countries , the across-the-board friendship between the two countries withstood various tests , and was firmly maintained and continuously developed , becoming a model of friendly coexistence of countries with different social systems .  
He encouraged the leaders at all levels of the university and its teaching and administrative staff and workers as well to continue to implement the party 's policies toward nationalities in a comprehensive way and with a strong sense of responsibility , carry forward the fine traditions , strive for greater achievements in the work of training minority nationality cadres and qualified people for the state , and work hard to build the Central University of nationalities into a world class university for nationalities .  
After the Bush administration came to power , it treated Russia as " the number one potential opponent " of the United States . It showed an extreme distrust of the Putin government and expressed strong disapproval of Russia 's developing military cooperation with Iran in addition to restoring and strengthening its relationships with some former Soviet Union allies .  
Putin 's strategic target of rejuvenating Russia , restoring Russia 's prestige as a big power , and turning Russia into a major polar in today 's multipolar world tallies with the mentality and the aspirations of the Russian people ; with the addition of the remarkable results that he has already attained in boosting the country 's economic , financial , and agricultural development and in increasing the public 's income , Putin is now enjoying a strong backing at home . 
Practice proved that the third general of central leadership collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has the unusual political wisdom and superior skills of controlling the complicated situation , and is a strong leadership collective that leads the whole party and the people throughout the country to comprehensively push the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to the 21st century .  
With the coming of the new century , we ardently wish that Guangzhou and Tibet will walk to hand in hand even more closely , further strengthen and deepen their exchanges and cooperation in the economic , technical , scientific , educational , cultural , travel , and other areas , that they will continually create new forms of cooperation , expand the areas of cooperation , mutually use their strong points to compensate for weaknesses , and move forward shoulder to shoulder .  
Third , the implementation of the strategy for relying on science and education in national development and the adoption of relevant favorable policies will encourage overseas Chinese and foreign nationals of Chinese origin to make investment in running high-tech and new technology enterprises or transforming the traditional industries with high and new technologies .  This will also provide great opportunities for scientists and technology experts among overseas Chinese and the high-tech enterprises run by them to bring their strong points into better play .  
Under the conditions of socialism , reform is carried out in a peaceful and orderly form , it does not only resolve some minor problems , but is directed at the old economic structure as a whole .  Therefore it is arduous and complicated , and inevitably produces a strong impact that shocks society in may aspects .  
The vast working masses should be guided to more clearly understand their own historical responsibility .  Such a sense of mission should be turned into a strong driving force to play a role as the main force to continuously enhance their own quality and make contributions to the building of a rich and powerful socialist modern country with a high degree of democracy and civilization as Comrade Jiang Zemin hoped .  
Wei Jianxing pointed out : Since the launch of reform and opening up drive and the convening of the party 's 14th National Congress in particular , under the strong leadership of the party Central Committee , the struggle against corruption and reform have deepened constantly ; the economy has developed in a sustained way ; and social stability has been maintained , with the three factors coordinating and promoting with one another and maintaining a sound momentum of steady , healthy , and extensive and intensive development .  
Fourth , carry forward the spirit of science and democracy , enliven academic thinking .  Continue to carry out the " double-hundred policy , " encourage creative thinking , create a benign academic environment , discover and foster a large batch of outstanding young scientists , build a strong contingent of scientists and technologists with sufficient quantity and high quality , encourage them to scale up the peaks of science and technology and to occupy a position for our country in the high-tech realm of the world .  
We are firmly convinced that , with the strong leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , with the guidance of the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and the important thinking of the " three represents " and with the examples of those heroic models and advanced typical people , our party can certainly create an even better future in the 21st century .  
third , persist in comprehensively carrying out the party 's national and religious policies , making constant efforts to consolidate and develop socialist national relations marked by equality , unity , and mutual aid among the masses of every nationality in Tibet , and persist in developing a strong and patriotic united front ;  
The Tibet party committees at all levels and the regional government must clearly recognize the situation , boost morale , seize upon opportunities , and forge ahead by taking advantage of the favorable situation .  They must continue to propagate self-reliance , arduous striving and the " old Tibetan spirit , " turn the support of the central government and every locality into a strong driving force , be open and progressive , and work creatively to make new contributions for the people of every nationality in Tibet .  
Party organizations at all levels are urged to push forward the building of grassroots party organizations with an innovative mind , integrate in real terms the work of party building at the grassroots level with the reality of the country 's reform , opening up , and modernization building , take earnest steps to enhance the effectiveness of their work , and give better play to the role of grassroots party organizations as a strong fighting force ;  
Why has our Party been able to have become eminent among various political forces in modern Chinese society , turned from small to big and from weak to strong , developed from only more than 50 people at the very beginning to the biggest ruling party in the world with more than 64-million Party members , and achieved these brilliant achievements ? 
After the founding of the CPC , the Chinese nation underwent the great changes from a poor and backward nation to a prosperous and vigorously developing nation , from a disintegrated nation to a strong and unified nation , from a nation being bullied and humiliated by foreign powers to a nation being able to hold its head high and stand aloof among all nations in the world .  
Over the past 80 years , the people of all ethnic groups , the democratic parties , and progressive figures in all circles in our country always share weal and woe and fight side by side together with our party for our nation 's independence , prosperity , and bright future .  In the historical process of revolution , construction , and reform , they demonstrate a strong patriotic spirit and an indomitable fighting spirit .  
We have actively advocated and safeguarded the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , and resolutely opposed hegemonism and power politics with the strong domineering over the weak .  We have upheld principle and justice , striving to let justice prevail and safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of the vast developing countries , and pushed the establishment of a just and reasonable new international political and economic order .  
Under no circumstances should comrades of the whole party stand still and refuse to move forward , nor should they fear hardship and difficulties .  We must closely unite with people of all ethnic groups in China and strive to build the great motherland into a strong , prosperous , democratic and culturally advanced modern socialist country so as to make new and even greater contributions to humanity .  
We must meet the general requirements of building armed forces that are " qualified politically and competent militarily and has a fine style of work , strict discipline and adequate logistic support , " and follow the military strategy for the new era as our overriding guideline .  We must stress the quality of army-building and strengthen our armed forces by relying on science and technology and run the army according to law in an effort to build the People 's Liberation Army into a strong , modern and revolutionary regular army .  
Under no circumstances should comrades of the party stand still and refuse to move forward , nor should they fear hardship and difficulties .  All comrades must closely unite with the people of all ethnic groups in China and strive to build our great motherland into a strong , prosperous , democratic and culturally advanced modern socialist country and make new and even greater contributions to mankind .  
Over the 80 years under the correct leadership of the three generations of leading collectives headed by Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin , the CPC has grown from small to large and from weak to strong .  It led the Chinese people to advance wave upon wave , wage tenacious struggles , found the new China , establish the socialist system , explore ways to building socialism with Chinese characteristics , and write a magnificent chapter in the historical development of the Chinese nation .  
Everyone held that upholding the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces is a great creation of our party and a political strong point unique to our armed forces , and is also the fundamental guarantee for our armed forces always being in an invincible position .  
The participating comrades unanimously held that , showing great foresight and having far-reaching significance , General Secretary Jiang Zemin speech is a brilliant Marxist document and a political manifesto of the Chinese communists facing the 21st century .  It has strong political , theoretical , ideological , and strategic nature and is highly relevant .  
It was precisely because of this that Dr . Sun Yat-sen emphasized the importance of developing our own culture while speaking about nationalism despite controversial views and the strong atmosphere of opposing what was traditional in the academic circles .  
In his speech , General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's remarks on the Taiwan issue fully expressed the firm determination of the whole party and the entire Chinese people at home and abroad to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity and their strong desire to accomplish the motherland 's complete reunification .  
They are all determined to , under the leadership of the party central body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , deeply implement the principles and policies of the central leadership for the Taiwan issue , keep a strong sense of political responsibility , work hard to break new ground and make solid progress , unite compatriots on both sides of the straits and overseas compatriots to fight against all separatist attempts , and make contributions to the accomplishment of the motherland 's reunification at an earlier date .  
Participants held that the important thinking of " three represents " has let the basic demands of maintaining the advanced nature of the party and enabling it to always serve as a strong leadership core in building socialism with Chinese characteristics run through the theories and practice of building the ruling party , and clearly put forward a series of important new requirements for the party to strengthen itself in the new century .  
Analyzing the issue in the context of international strategy , how could the United States guarantee that the reconnaissance plane with sophisticated equipment would not take pictures of important military facilities along the coast and carry out " legal espionage mission " once it was permitted to cross China 's territorial airspace ?  Moreover , without regard to China 's strong objection , the United States had resumed its spying mission in the air space of South China and said that it would continue to do so .  
He Yong : In recent years , under the unified leadership of party committees and governments , discipline inspection and supervision departments at all levels cooperated closely with other relevant departments , adopted effectively measures , seriously implement the established policies , steadily advanced the work of removing roots causes of corruption in some key fields , properly settled some issues that aroused strong discontent among the masses over many years , and also provided useful experience for our work in the next step .

Utilizing their advantages of having a strong capacity of sudden attack , people 's armed forces departments in Gulou , Taijiang , and three other urban districts have organized an ad hoc team composed of 1,000 militiamen to participate in the local " strike-hard " campaign and maintain social security in coordination with public security departments so as to safeguard the fundamental interests of the people .  
We should comprehensively implement the principle on promoting younger , better educated , more professionally competent , and revolutionary cadres and the criterion on both ability and political integrity , exercise strict education and management on party member-cadres , pay keen attention to recruiting new party members from among outstanding young and middle-aged students and teachers , further strengthen the cohesive power and creativity of party organizations of schools of higher learning , and provide strong and effective political guarantee for reform , development , and stability of the cause of higher education .

The foreign policy must serve the needs of domestic development : making the country strong and prosperous , developing the economy , and improving the living standard of the people .  
As the statistics for various economic sectors are announced , the outline of China 's national economic development in the first half of this year is gradually becoming clear : China 's economic growth has continued to maintain a strong momentum amid the overall environment of weakening global economy .  
After the launch of the " strike hard " campaign , public security organs in Hebei , Jiangxi , Guizhou , Hunan , and Sichuan , under the strong leadership of the various levels of party committees and governments , have overcome many difficulties , adopted firm measures , destroyed a number of organized crime groups , and arrested a large number of criminals who seriously undermined public order and who committed many evil deeds .  
According to the latest statistics released by the People 's Bank of China , the country 's moderate fiscal policy has yielded desired results , and the country 's stable and healthy financial conditions during the first half of this year have proved to be strong support for both its economic restructuring and its sustained national economic growth .  
The historical mission for the current period put forth by our Party is , through reform and opening-up , to further liberate and develop the productive forces , promote national economic , political and cultural development in an all-around way , continuously improve people 's material and cultural standards of living , strive to build China into a prosperous , strong , democratic , civilized , modernized socialist country , and strive for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese people .  
Currently , a key urgent task of the whole army 's is to find ways to improve the logistical support capability for winning technical local wars .  As there are still some unsolved problems , we should learn from the fleet 's strong sense of responsibility and urgency ;

Having gone through 50 extraordinary years , Tibet today enjoys economic growth , social progress , national solidarity , stability , and strong border defense ; and the people live in peace and work in contentment .  Tibet today is a thriving place replete with life .  
The PLA , armed police , and law enforcement units stationed in Tibet are strong pillars and loyal guards who safeguard the motherland 's frontier areas and Tibet 's stability .  They are important forces for building the socialist material and spiritual civilizations in Tibet . They must continue to carry forward their fine traditions and work styles , ensure their own construction , strengthen their unity with the local governments , civilian authorities , and the people , and make new contributions to Tibet 's stability and development .  
The nation is astir and the people are mad with joy over Beijing 's successful Olympic bid .

In order to ensure that the " Lee Teng-hui line " which he operated for many years can be effectively extended and continually " developed and enhanced " among the new authorities , Lee Teng-hui , who moved about freely in the Taiwan political arena for 12 years , has ignored the strong demands of the people for rejuvenating the economy and improving cross-strait relations and has not hesitated to stir up conflict between ethnic groups and strike at those forces advocating the motherland 's reunification .  
Through the propaganda , we have been greatly touched and enhanced our thinking .  Chi Haotian said that through the propaganda campaign , the reporters have shown a high degree of revolutionary dedication and a strong sense of political responsibility .  With valuable professional dedication and despite difficulties and obstacles , these reporters went deep to frontier companies and forward posts , boldly faced hardships , worked indomitably , covered a lot of outstanding , brilliant , and touching news reports , and did a good job in performing their sacred missions and lofty duties .  
Although the " technical aspect " of their election cooperation , which external circles are most concerned about , might not seem effective , the " strategic aspect " of their alliance is rather strong .  Their overall integrated strength can be said to be " developing steadily . "

As compared with the period of the Clinton Administration that attached importance to multilateral cooperation , the Bush Administration regards multilateral agreements more as restricting the freedom of movement of the United States . It carries a strong color of unilateralism , judges everything by the yardstick of the " supreme national interests of the United States , " and ignores its international obligations .  
Up to now , the navies of some middle class countries are equipped with light class carriers , with costs varying from $ 300-500-million , and while this class of carrier can fulfill some regional combat missions , they can not handle the naval formations of strong nations , so this class of carrier would have no practical significance for the Chinese navy .

In the 80 years since its founding , the CPC has grown from a small and weak force to a big and strong one .  It has defeated formidable enemies in extremely difficult conditions and kept forging ahead in a tortuous course of exploration , accumulating very rich experiences .  
Under the CPC 's leadership , the Chinese people , driven by a deep hatred of the common enemy , fought a bloody war in an indomitable spirit and performed a miracle in which a weak country under semi-colonial rule defeated a strong imperialist country .  As a result , a century-old disgrace was wiped out .  
Any historical assessment of Japan 's war of aggression has been subjected to rigorous historical examination by every successive postwar Japanese government , but their annual statements marking the " Day the War Ended " ( they dare not call it the " Day of Surrender " ) have all been disappointing .  Disregarding strong domestic and foreign opposition , Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi insisted on paying his respects at Yasukuni Shrine , where a large group of war criminals is enshrined .  
The Japanese prime minister 's brazenly paying his respects shows that Yakusuni Shrine is a symbol of aggressive war ; it has overtones of a public and official provocation , and indicates contempt for the people of those countries which suffered from that aggression .  It recalls for those people the pain they suffered , so is it not something natural , a matter of course , for the Chinese people to express their strong indignation and firm opposition ?  
As for which direction Japan is likely to move under Junichiro Koizumi 's leadership , we may view things from the following two aspects : First , insofar as domestic reform is concerned , Japan is expected to meet strong resistance and a host of difficulties , first and foremost , from Junichiro Koizumi 's Liberal Democratic Party , and thus , whether Japan 's reform can succeed and meet the Japanese people 's expectations is bound to have a direct bearing on the Junichiro Koizumi Administration ;  
However , due to historical and practical reasons , some backward cultures , and even decadent cultures that corrode people 's mind and endanger the cause of socialism , have emerged in society .  These cultures corrupt social values , weaken the will of people , poison young people 's mind , have caused great harm to society , and have aroused the strong resentment of the masses of people .  We must make great efforts to rectify this situation .  
A batch of large corporations and enterprise groups with great strength should be fostered and developed in major industries .  They should possess their own intellectual property rights , and have strong international competition power .  At the same time , it is necessary to actively support small and medium-sized companies , especially technology companies , and promote their development in the orientation of being " specialized , sophisticated , special , and new . "  
We must do a good job in resolving problems of the current livelihood and long-term production development for peasants where farmland is bring returned to forest , and support the peasants in developing industries for which there are strong local resources and which meet market needs ; through developing small hydroelectric stations , methane , and so on , we should resolve the problems of the peasants ' fuel and rural energy , prevent indiscriminate tree-felling , and protect the results of returning farmland to forest .  
To align the personal quality of these professional soldiers with the requirements of the rank of nomcom as soon as possible , people who have obtained the rank of noncom must understand their position and role in military construction , be aware of their duties and have a strong sense of urgency regarding learning information about organization , training , and education and about administrating soldiers , so as to improve their overall quality in the military and in political fields .

It was also the only team that was awarded the " Prize for the Best Performance in Military Skills . "  
General Secretary Jiang 's July 1 speech , he said , is important because it provides our party with a powerful ideological weapon for understanding , strengthening , and improving itself under new historical conditions and provides a strong spiritual force for our great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  Studying the speech is not only an important political task for the entire military now , but also a long-term strategic task .  
After Jiang Zemin spoke , Zhang Wannian said that Chairman Jiang 's important speech was imbued throughout with Marxist world-view and methodology and filled with the truth-seeking and innovative spirit of emancipating the mind and moving with the times ; its political , theoretical , ideological , and targeted properties were extremely strong , it has further pointed out the orientation for the whole party and the whole army to study in depth and implement the 1 July speech and fully implement the demands of the " three represents , " and is of major guiding significance .  
China is now in the stage of deepening reform and strong administrative power is the important factor of guaranteeing a smooth carrying forward of every reform measure .

It will be exposing the deceitful propaganda of the Taiwan military authorities from the political and military perspectives .  Its aim is to fully demonstrate the strong determination and great might of the PLA [ People 's Liberation Army ] in fighting " Taiwan independence " and splittism and defending state sovereignty and territorial integrity in order to promote the development of cross-strait relations in a benign direction .  
That the United States has always ignored facts , played the same old tune , and slandered the situation of human rights in China and other developing countries is caused by its hegemonic mental state of Cold War mentality .  It has implemented its values and ideology with a strong sense of superiority , practiced dual standards on the human rights issue , and politicized the human rights issue .  
A responsible official from the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chinese National People 's Congress [ NPC ] today commented here on the anti-China resolutions on Taiwan and Tibet adopted by the European Parliament [ EP ] .  He expressed extreme indignation and strong condemnation against such EP acts which violated the basic norms governing international ties , grossly interfered in China 's internal affairs , and supported the splittist forces for " Taiwan independence " and " Tibet independence .

The much dwindled current account surplus was unable to offset the net outflow of funds in the financial and capital account , which was mainly led by a sharp reversal from net inflow to net outflow in the banking sector as net other investment outflow , outrunning the strong surge in net direct investment inflow and the significantly moderated net portfolio investment outflow .  
Some people are still doing business much like their forefathers did generations before . Most of the narrow streets paved with granite slabs are now gone . Among Lukang 's fantastic construction features are the covered streets . They resemble ancient castles , so designed to make them less vulnerable to damage from strong winds and to offer protection from pillaging by bandits .  
His strong use of color and lack of technical skill give Hung 's works a primitive and traditional flavor . The old man 's eccentric behavior and distaste for worldly wealth are a secondary attraction for visitors .  
Before submarine cables can be laid , tests must be conducted to decide on the most suitable route . A flat and solid sea bed , stable sea temperatures , and a lack of strong tides or currents are considered ideal conditions for cable laying . Deep trenches and geological fault lines are avoided to prevent damage .  
But a very rare orchid , rich in color with bright green , rigid stalks and strong but delicate-looking flowers , full of lustre and without any imperfection whatsoever can command thousands of dollars .  
Looking at the cloisonne duck , we see a smooth and curved but , none theless , strong and powerful neck , supporting a rather small and frail head . The surface of the duck is smooth , the roughness and sharp angles of the original lump of bronze eliminated .

Take water sleeves for example ; the extent of expression that can be conveyed by an actor 's hand movement is limited . After adding the sleeves , not only is the meaning of the opera deepened , but also it can make the graceful and tender figure more noticeable and give the viewer a strong and sharp sensation . If a sense of despair is to be expressed , then both sleeves are lifted high into the air at the same time .

" The transplant actually made him more masculine ! "  
This Chinese Hamlet is a story of emotional entanglements and moral dilemmas , because Chinese drama is strong on narrative , weak on emotional outpourings , and depends more on beautiful literary language than on philosophical content .  
Thinking about all this from the angle of historical geography , I think northerners are used to being ruled by nomadic tribes , and the physical environment makes northerners more open-minded ; southerners , on the other hand , are the stubborn guardians of Chinese cultural traditions , so to speak , they opened up the south when they fled there to escape foreign domination , so they have a strong " spirit of resistance . " Q : Of what benefit were your two years of fieldwork ?  
The schools of theology , law and medicine are extremely famous . A special feature is that all of them have theoretical research as their strong suit .

As an example , Den Chi-fu , a professor at National Chiao Tung University , cites India , which has strong basic science , produces many Ph . D.s and far exceeds us in the number of papers published in international academic journals , but which has been unable to raise the quality of life of its citizens , where the electronics industry has been developed for decades without ever getting off the ground and where many airports are still not computerized . . . . "  
We 're constantly seeing cases of leaders being rejudged in the light of history , finding they may have been strong in ability but were weak in morals , or vice versa . Inter-level communicationQ : In your book you analyzed the main cause for the decline of China through the ages and concluded that it lay in the rift between the upper and middle levels and between the middle and lower ones . Is cross-level interaction and communication really that difficult ?  
In the free democratic societies that have mostly replaced authoritarian societies , the upper level is formed from the middle level and the middle level from the lower level . No one 's position is permanently occupied , and there are no strong authoritarian forces blocking interaction and communication . Mutual understanding is n't difficult .  
Although many environmental scholars believe that there is also a problem of organic pollution , the scholarly community still lacks indepth under-standing in this area . In any case , organic waste is highly mobile ; Taiwan also has strong winds and heavy rains , " and has the good fortune to be surrounded by sea on all sides , so just two or three storms and most of it gets washed away , " is how one scholar describes it .  
" This is because Taiwan was pioneered from south to north . At first the south was opened up , and with illness rampant in that pioneering period , expelling the evil and clearing away misfortune required strong methods . Thus the more martial and ferocious Master Taitzu and Wang Yeh flourished more , " argues Cheng Chih-ming .  
Besides the consideration of low land costs , the concept of " bringing Taiwan 's experience in agriculture together with Vietnam 's natural resources " is just right for what the Vietnamese government - - stuck with backward local production methods and an urgent need to close the gap between city and country - - wants and needs . It has thus won their strong support .  
Besides a strong legislature , with the development of democratic politics , various interest groups are both " numerous and vocal " with their opinions . For example , there were endless disputes over land acquisition and the proposed routes of transportation projects , which all affected the pace of the projects . This caused the foreign firms who were anxious to get their orders settled to have to wait off to the side chomping at the bit .  
Researchers have endeavored to find the reasons why grey mullet production has been unstable in recent years . One important discovery is that although the cold water mass from the mainland heads south to Taiwan , if it is n't sustained , which is to say if it does n't come far enough south , then it wo n't be strong enough to get into that push-pull dynamic with the Kuroshio Current , so that the fish will not form into schools . "

Q : Because the Three Gorges project is extremely complex , there are many different opinions pro and con . Those opposed accuse the political leaders of simply liking grandiose white elephants while ignoring the ecology and the overall interests of the nation .

One example can be found in the Taiwan television serial " Empress of an Age , " where aside from portraying the Empress Wu as a strong female in the traditional mold , the writers also see fit to credit her success to the support of two capable men .

Although the Chinese communist authorities have already announced that they have arrested three suspects for robbing the passengers and burning the boat , the rigid attitude displayed by mainland China after the incident , their imperious obstruction of bereaved family members and reporters from Taiwan , and their sustained insistence that the incident was simply an accident , generated a strong reaction in Taiwan , where people moved to completely boycott cross-Strait exchanges .  
A heavy load of paper work , mostly administrative in nature , stirred in him strong feelings of nostalgia for the simple life he led as a straight weather forecaster . Hence , when a television station invited him to serve primarily as a weather forecaster , this tallied with his special interests , and after only a moment 's reflection he agreed .  
He practiced medicine in his " Pochilum Clinic . " In an age of turmoil when China was weak and prey to Western invaders , with one hand he struck at the foreign sowers of intrigue and disorder , and with the other he fought against the corrupt and treacherous elements within China which sprang up to bedevil the country in its hour of difficulty . In the Chinese cinema of the l990s , the heroic figure of Huang Fei-hong bears strong parallels with Bruce Lee , who was the sensation of the film world 20 years ago .  
" The ' huachung ' [ or central Chinese climate ] zone of mainland China and the ' huanan ' [ or southern Chinese climate ] zone divide just about at the Ta-an River . To the north , where the rains are heavy , the settlers built wooden structures offering strong protection against the rain . It 's drier to the south , so there they built cool and shady bamboo structures . " And the abundance of rocks strewn on the bed of the Ta-an River led to their use in the embankments between rice paddies .

Previously salmon had taken advantage of different types of topography to adapt to natural disasters . Today there are no pools for them to escape to , and when heavy rains come the fish are washed downstream . No fish , no matter how strong , can overcome the meters-high dams to get back upstream , so they are left to die from the higher water temperatures downstream .  
To make redbraised beef noodle soup , generally the meat is fried with chilli and broad bean paste , then simmered with such spicy and aromatic ingredients as chopped garlic , coriander and ginger . The strong flavor naturally tends to mask any rankness in the beef , but it also covers the meat 's own flavor . But a clear broth brings out the natural flavor of the beef , so the meat 's selection and preparation require particular care .  
After the universal health insurance was implemented , the medical referral system , buttressed by ample financial power , went into an experimental phase . But wave after wave of strong suspicion and opposition have been thrown up against the program . This has forced the NHIB to initiate the " transitional step " of simplifying the referral system from having four levels to only two , and doing away with extra fees for those who have no referral slips , until the population can become accustomed to the referral system .  
Old local gazetteers report the existence of " black gulches " to both the west and east of Penghu . The former-nicknamed " the Larger Sea " - - separated Penghu from Fujian Province , while the latter ( " the Lesser Sea " ) marked the boundary between Penghu and Taiwan . It was vital for ships trying to cut across these " gulches " to catch a strong wind in the right direction , otherwise they would be carried away by the current and placed in severe danger if they should hit a typhoon .  
Naturally he does not exclude the possibility that some of these ships were brought to grief by Penghu 's strong winds and treacherous waters . For example , when exploring the tiny 1,000-meter-square island of Hsienchiao ( which means " dangerous coral reef " ) , he found an astounding amount of Yuan and Ming period potsherds . " It seems obvious that ships were wrecked here , " he concludes .

Chen Chuo-ming , head of the Changhua Normal University , says that in the Chinese tradition teachers were supposed to have been able to teach both the material and the man . Teachers trained for ten years , and after this hard labor and sacrifice , not only did they acquire knowledge , they acquired a strong character as well , and this was reflected in their essays and lessons . But modern training for professors creates researchers only specialized in one particular area .  
An incoming middle school teacher earned about NT $ 4000 per month ( or less than US $ 100 at then-current exchange rates ) . It was a time of political and diplomatic crises . President Chiang Kai-shek had died less than a year before ( in April , 1975 ) , and citizens accustomed to following a strong leader were at a loss . With little international room to maneuver following the ROC 's withdrawal from the United Nations , Taiwan 's only asset was economic growth .

The situation is even worse on a television set , whose ability to differentiate between strong and soft light is considerably inferior .  
President Lee talked about a " Chinese renaissance " - - an ideal Chinese culture based in Confucian thought , but not distorted and rigidified by authoritarian rulers , which has also absorbed the best of modern Western culture . Can this culture grow strong in Taiwan and then influence the 1.2 billion people in mainland China , so that one day they too can be the bosses of their own government ?  
" Although Air Macau has its strong points , we are also increasing our efforts , " comments TransAsia Airway 's public relations office . After passengers reach Macao , in addition to the conventional method of disembarking and boarding a second flight to mainland China , TransAsia also offers a free bus service which takes their customers straight to Guangdong 's Zhuhai City in little more than an hour . From Zhuhai 's newly completed Sanzao International Airport , one can then fly to all the major cities in mainland China .  
One of his own specialties is a " galan-tine , " in which many strips of meat are bound together into a long loaf . To stew the meat , instead of the traditional sachet of strong spices , Kao only uses a few pods of star anise and a dash of Sichuan peppercorns and black pepper . To make up for the missing spices he adds rather more spring onions , ginger and garlic , to give the meat more of the light aroma of fresh vegetables .  
Chinese have long understood how to listen to the natural music of the soughing pines . This is especially so for those ancient literati who learned that it was their duty to serve their nation , but who could find no ruler who would listen to their criticisms of official corruption and inefficiency .

Wang Chen-tai notes that early on there were factional conflicts , reducing the religion 's impact . Fortunately , he says , learned elders like Hsieh Sung-tao and Ting Chung-ming wrote inexhaustibly . Also , because of the importance of diplomatic ties with Islamic countries , the ROC government has strongly supported Muslims . The Taipei mosque , which has been the main spiritual and practical resource for Muslims in Taiwan for many years now , was built with government money in response to strong and far-sighted efforts by Ambassador Yeh Kung-chao .  
Last year , the meeting of APEC leaders was held in Manila , in the Philippines .

They quickly discovered that while she looked elegant and refined , she was broad-minded , direct and easy to get along with . Though she could n't speak Hakka , she could chat away half the day with them using signs and gestures . Though an artist , she spent her days working in the fields . Running up and down the mountain , she was soon as tan and as strong as the local farming wives .  
Looking from another angle , after the Communist Party of China had won power , if they had governed well , developed China , fulfilled the calls to " overtake the US and Britain , " and improved the living conditions of the people , then even if Zhang had acted traitorously , even though his actions were morally flawed , the result of these actions would have been that China became rich and strong and he would still be a national hero to be revered through the ages . However , this has not been the reality .  
The fundamental principles behind the operation of a synchrotron are based in electromagnetic theory : when electrons moving at near the speed of light are subjected to a magnetic field , they can then be deflected to create strong radiation in a tangential direction-namely , synchrotron radiation .  
About 400 years ago people began coming over to Taiwan from Fujian and Guangdong in search of land to farm .

But in natural forests , every creature has its natural enemies , and the insect fungus Beauveria bassiana and parasitic flies are ready and waiting for M . basalis pryeri . Furthermore , in the wild the inchworms prefer trees over two meters tall , and by the time trees have reached this size they are strong enough for a few caterpillars not to pose them any threat .  
Two-spotted lymantriid moth caterpillars ' bodies are covered with fine , spiny hairs , and although the insecticide quickly killed the grubs , their death throes released the hairs from their bodies . The number of poisonous spines drifting in the air increased dramatically , and with the help of Hsinchu 's strong winds they got into the children 's respiratory tracts ; the children also came out in an unbearably itchy red rash . Over half the school 's staff and pupils had to seek medical attention .  
Moreover , it takes system safety very seriously and will build in passwords to prevent theft of the data . The National Card project is ready to fly , but despite repeated assurances from the RDEC and the fact that it will only combine two functions in its initial stage , the public 's opposition remains strong . Government agencies must still give careful consideration to the functions that the card will later include and the potential problems that may result .  
Shih Ying does not deny that there were already a number of community organizations active in Wenshan District , and that it already had quite a strong cultural and educational ethos . Thus siting the first community college there " in fact was a soft option-but that does n't mean we are n't aware of the difficulties to be faced later . " He says that in the future it is hoped that community colleges will spread to communities throughout Taiwan , but this will depend on each community 's degree of readiness and preparedness .

Not knowing this story , the Japanese naturally do n't carry out dragon boat races , as we Chinese do . It was at some point during the Edo period ( 1607-1867 ) that tango no sekku came to be seen as a festival for boys . Families with male children began to use the festival as a chance to pray that their sons would grow up strong and brave . As an expression of their wishes , they took to displaying statues dressed in the armor worn by medieval Japanese warriors .

The straightforward , confident , and unrestrained A-Mei has made quite a splash in the Chinese-speaking world . Perhaps it is not surprising that someone with such a distinctive personality would elicit strong feelings both positive and negative . Wang Dong is not alone in his views , for many in the mainland have asked how long A-Mei will continue her spectacular run of success . Hopefully she will always " speak " straight from the heart , and can keep that natural verve that set her apart from the crowd in the first place .  
Because the royal Li family of the Tang dynasty were descended from western and northern minorities , the Tang dynasty was deeply influenced by their culture , and the hunks of the Tang dynasty were all tall and broad-shouldered with strong physiques .

In that way a small minority of gifted students could enter schools where the curriculum is specifically tailored to meet their needs . But it is n't necessary to make entrance exams exceedingly abstruse just so it is possible to distinguish these students . " There are theoretical bases behind both district high school systems and selective high school systems , and both have their strong points , " says Yang Jen-hsiao , principal of NTNU Affiliated High .  
The biggest weak point of the joint entrance exam is that only people that excel on pen-and-paper examinations come out on top . People with a strong spatial sense , musical talent or athletic prowess are neglected . The movement to replace the joint entrance exam is based on this kind of reasoning .  
Taiwan at that time was in the midst of an " economic miracle " fueled by the export success of its small and medium enterprises .

Ju 's determination made a deep impression on Yang , a strong believer that the mark of a true artist is not to be found in technical skill , but in a person 's attitude . In Yang 's view , an artist must be sincere and kindhearted , otherwise he is unlikely to attain artistic success . Ju ended up studying under Yang for eight years . Yang took a special interest in the country boy with no formal art education .  
The latter was the northernmost of these three counties , and extended all the way to Taipei and Keelung , but settlers long declined to venture north of Touliu ( today the county seat of Yunlin ) . Further south in Tainan , the Dutch arrived in the 1620s and established a fortress called Zeelandia . Later in that century , the Ming loyalist Koxinga 's able minister Chen Yonghua adopted a policy of keeping Taiwan equally strong in both the cultural and military spheres . A period of cultural flowering ensued in the south .  
The sponsoring organizations make strong efforts to attract excellent instructors . Most of the students are youths with a strong political bent , many of whom hope to become political reporters or legislative assistants , or to find positions at political brain trusts .

The architecture of the temples is of the eastern Fujian style , with granite walls and featuring colorful , intricate decorations , in sharp contrast to the plain buildings around them .

Later , because strong winds and heavy seas made landing impossible , the camera team 's plans were delayed . The next time they were able to land on the islet where the birds were filmed , the Chinese crested terns had already moved on , so the team missed the opportunity to observe them more closely .  
The jian also contributed to a dashing appearance . In the view of Professor Chen Pingyuan of Peking University 's Chinese literature department , " Bearing a jian makes one handsome and dignified ; it confers a heroic air . " Chen notes that it would have been hard to travel far carrying a heavy dao or a pair of axes . Moreover , being adrift with book and sword carries strong connotations of refinement .  
Chiang warns , " If you take a bank job , you 'd better be ready to bone up on the financial industry , sharpen your sales skills , and become a multi-talented money management advisor . " Financial products are complex and come in infinite variety . Banks badly need powerful systems for integrating financial information , so computer specialists with a strong quantitative grasp of the business will be highly valued by their employers .  
Liu Chia-lang , head of the office of civil affairs , also has strong feelings on the future of development and industry in Tungkang : " Only Japan and Tungkang produce banded coral shrimp , which is one of the main seafood products of the town . And Tapeng Bay abounds in natural resources . Tungkang has what it takes to develop . But Taiwan 's entry into the WTO is going to be a heavy blow to Tungkang 's fishing industry . "  
From the 1970s to the beginning of 1990s , entrance to these schools was fixed at a ratio of 30:70 .

These have been the real victims left on the school advancement battlefield .

After the commanding general , Zhou Dexing , said of the place , " It is as impregnable as a metal [ kin ] wall and a moat of boiling water , and it commands control of the ocean gate [ men ] , " it came to be called Kinmen . Thus Kinmen 's role as a key military strong point began several hundred years ago .  
Not far off the east coast of Taiwan the continental shelf falls away into an ocean trench thousands of meters deep , so bluefin arriving from across the Pacific have to come close inshore to find shallow waters to spawn . Their newly hatched fry are unable to hunt or swim for themselves , so they need waters that are rich in plankton and have strong currents . The North Equatorial Current and the Kuroshio Current pass by eastern Taiwan , creating an area of high primary productivity .  
And Taiwan has a special history , she explains . It has experienced colonization and imperialism and is a cosmopolitan place with strong ties to the rest of the world , but it also has the rich cultures of the Southern-Fujianese-speaking " Taiwanese , " the Mandarin-speaking mainlanders who arrived after the war , and its aboriginal tribes .

In contrast to the strong centralizing trend of globalization , the TIBE assumed the appearance of an " anti-globalization " book exhibition , which felt marvelous .  
That afternoon , the sky suddenly turns black and a strong wind comes up , and raindrops the size of coins-seemingly racing to the ground-come crashing down on the corrugated steel roofs of buildings , raising a racket that shakes the very air .

Caught between a rock and a hard place , the county government decided to open the proposal to public submissions .  
Cheng points out that although such ideas have a contagious element about them , people who are mentally healthy or who have a strong " psychological immunity " will not easily be " infected " by suicide reports .

Because of strong support from parents and schools , not only has there been a quantitative increase in the number of players , but a clear qualitative increase as well . Since the first breakthrough in 1999 when Chen Chin-feng signed a contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers of the US , over the past several years international talent hunters have scouted more than 15 of Taiwan 's top players , and Taiwan has become a main center for the development of talent for global baseball .
