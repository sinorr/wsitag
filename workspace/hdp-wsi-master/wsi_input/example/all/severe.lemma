As permitted entry into the market expands , and tariffs are reduced and nontariff measures abolished , foreign products , services , and investment may enter our market on a larger scale ; as a result , our domestic enterprises will face more intense competition , and in particular , enterprises with high production costs , low level of technology , and backward management will face still more severe challenges .  
Sometimes , a disease is cured by chance .  It is simply because the illness is not so severe and the patient recovers without any medical treatment due to the fact that he still has a natural resistant power in himself .  In ancient times , people also had a wishful thinking to live a long life .  
We must be clearly aware that we are still faced with arduous tasks and severe challenges in our current efforts to realize the grand target of China 's modernization building and narrow China 's development gap with the world 's advanced development level .  Therefore , we have no reason whatsoever to be conceited and complacent , or cease to go any further ;  
He said the Chinese side once again stresses that the US act of bombing the Chinese Embassy in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia caused heavy casualties and severe damage to the Embassy premises , seriously violated the relevant international conventions and basic norms governing international relations , infringed gravely on China 's sovereignty , greatly hurt the feeling of the Chinese people , and severely damaged Sino-US relations .  
The move in fact represents unilateral nuclear arms build-up in disguised form .  The move will not only bring severe damage to the integrity and vitality of the ABM treaty and the global strategic balance and stability , but will also seriously disrupt the basis for the US-Russia bilateralnuclear reductions , impede the international nuclear disarmament process , thus shatter the prerequisite and basis for international nuclear non-proliferation .  
world peace is facing severe crisis .

Third , complexity and uncertainty is constantly growing in the international security environment .  Along with economic globalization , the current rapid development of modern information technology , and the deepening of the new military revolution , both conventional and unconventional security problems have come to the front at the same time ; and the security environment of many countries , especially developing countries , has become more severe and more vulnerable .

During the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea in the early 1950s , Chinese military personnel had to fight against poison gas .  To meet the need of such an extremely severe situation , China 's anti-chemical scientific research institute , which was still being organized and established then , urgently began to develop the most needed poison-detecting equipment .  The curtain was then raised on the development of anti-chemical equipment for our armed forces .  
What is even more exasperating is , no one knows how does this Saddam possess such a remarkable supernatural power , but he somehow has managed to make civil aircraft from some countries , including US allies , to fly one after another into Baghdad in spite of the ban .  The " no flight zones " masterminded by the United States with painstaking efforts have thus been reduced to fragments .  The Americans have suffered a severe case of losing face .  
Therefore , it is essential that we further expose and criticize the false reasoning and heretical teachings of " Falungong " in order to further uncover the political nature of " Falungong " and the severe harm it causes , and to drive out evil and usher in the good so as to ensure total victory in this battle .  
In recent years , given the complicated circumstances where international struggles changed tremendously and domestic reforms constantly intensified , and in the face of severe economic , political and natural tests , the united front promoted a united and stable political situation and also created a vigorous and vital democratic atmosphere .

This is certainly not saying something frightening just to scare people .  In doing a good job in rural work , we must not only depend on correct theory , line , guidelines , and policies , but also on a rural grassroots cadre contingent of a quality capable of withstanding severe tests , with good ideological and work style , and genuinely bent on pursuing the masses ' interests .

His violations of law and disciple are serious and disgusting and have given the public a very bad impression .  This is a typical case of a leading cadre of a law-enforcement department bending the law to serve personal interests and abusing official power for selfish ends .  A severe punishment is absolutely necessary .  
You should make efforts to ensure that you have fine ideological and political qualities and also scientific and cultural ability that can withstand severe tests ; you should have both strong physique and sound minds .  
On the battlefield of a combined operation , electronic confrontation is becoming increasingly intense , the degree of command control automation is growing higher and higher , and the battlefield situation is undergoing instantaneous changes ; and all these have constituted a severe challenge to the quality of commanding officers .

The masses of the people clapped and cheered at all these achievements .  
All localities should make arrangements around the key fields pointed out by the central leadership in connection with their local conditions , fully mobilize the masses , concentrate the police force , crack accumulated cases , smash criminal gangs , seize criminals at large .  In particular , more severe and rapid actions should be taken to crack criminal cases , especially serious and malicious cases occurring in the period of the " strike hard " period .

It is said that during the amphibious landing joint military exercise on Dongshan Island , the Chinese Communist once more used large commercial vessels to ship supporting firepower cannons and rockets .  The purpose is nothing more than making up for the severe shortage of conventional amphibious landing vessels .  But this action will only be feasible under the condition of possessing superior naval and air forces .  These vessels are big and weak targets , but not a miraculous cure as they appear to be .  
During a recent interview with this paper , Minister in Charge of the State Economic and Trade Commission [ SETC ] Sheng Huaren , who is responsible for the actual economic and trade operations and the reform of state-owned enterprises [ SOE 's ] in China , said : " In 1999 , China successfully stood up to the severe test of an intricate environment both at home and abroad .  There were rapid economic growth and comprehensive social development and a new , gratifying prospect was opened up for economic and trade work . "  
The reason why this issue remained unsolved for a long time is the existence of a separatist force inside Taiwan island , and the Taiwan authorities represented by Lee Teng-hui stubbornly adhered to a position of splitting up the motherland and moved farther and farther , thus causing a more and more severe situation across the straits .

However , Annette Lu , a person who holds a master 's degree in law , has disregarded the historical facts and legal documents at the current moment when cross-strait relations are facing a severe test .  She has confounded right with wrong , and replayed in an unscrupulous manner the " old tune " of " Taiwan independence . "  
Some 80 percent of the existing water conservancy facilities were built before the 1970 ' s , and these have aged and lost effectiveness through operating over many years ; in addition , since a complete set of facilities has not been built up , the irrigation assurance rate is not high , and agriculture suffers heavy losses when a severe drought is encountered .  
Since the financial crisis in Asia , China 's economy has experienced severe and complicated tests , but it has still maintained a relatively rapid growth .

Faced with such a severe challenge , the call from international society demanding a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions has been heightened daily .  Through arduous negotiations , the 1997 Tokyo Protocol stipulated that developed countries must take the lead in shouldering the responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions reduction .  This means that by 2010 , the developed countries must reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to a level slightly lower than that for 1990 .

While Hong Kong has not been immune from the severe impact of the regional financial turmoil , with our sound economic fundamentals and robust financial and fiscal systems , we should be able to recover speedily when the global and regional situation improves . 
" In the coming rainy seasons , the Observatory will give , to the extent possible , some advance indication of the issuance of warnings and signals so that people will have sufficient time to take precautions against severe weather .  " We have maintained the thrust on development works aimed at improving the forecasting of heavy rains in the coming rainy season , " he said .  
However , we are of the view that the CFA 's interpretation of Articles 22 and 24 of the Basic Law differs from the SAR Government 's understanding of the legislative intent of the provisions .  The CFA judgment has increased tremendously the number of people who are qualified for ROA in Hong Kong , which would impose a severe social and economic burden on Hong Kong . ExCo has decided that the Chief Executive should report to the Central Authorities and request for an interpretation of the relevant articles of the Basic Law .  
Given the increasingly volatile and potentially destabilising nature of international capital flows , as was clearly demonstrated during the Asian financial crisis , the very substantial foreign reserves held by the Exchange Fund provided the foundation which enabled us to fend off very severe speculative attacks and retain public confidence on Hong Kong 's monetary and financial systems .  
However , in very exceptional circumstances , the department will exercise discretion given by law and consider not imposing surcharge .  For instance , a taxpayer has successfully applied for holdover of a part or the whole of provisional salaries tax payable on the ground that he is unemployed .  However , due to severe financial problem consequent upon unemployment , the taxpayer still can not afford to settle the balance of tax payable but has showed sincerity in agreeing to an acceptable instalment plan with the department .

Otherwise , the public at large would criticize the Government for failing its responsibility .  It would be detrimental to the overall interests of the civil service and the community if our failure to implement the pay reduction led to the impression that civil servants were unwilling to share the burden with the rest of the community in time of difficulty or our inaction meant that our severe fiscal deficit could not be alleviated .  
It involves selecting a list of the major historical storms which had induced severe landslips or flooding , computing the rainfall amounts brought by these storms to areas of different sizes , and maximizing these rainfall amounts to those that would be obtained if the water vapour content in the storms attained the climatological maximum .  
It was found that if the air-conditioner concerned has not been given periodical maintenance and is installed close to the sea or susceptible to salty sea spray , its capacitor might exhibit unusually severe degree of corrosion , which in rare circumstances , may pose a potential hazard to users .  
" As Norwalk-like virus is commonly found in sewage-contaminated water .  Shellfish , particularly raw oyster , harvested from polluted water are prone to contamination .  Vulnerable groups like the young , the elderly , pregnant women and immuno-compromised people are strongly advised not to consume raw oysters as they are likely to suffer from the more severe forms of the disease arising from the viral infection , " she warned .

This latest revision , along with the lifting of the Hong Kong travel advisory earlier by both the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , send a strong signal that severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) is contained in Hong Kong , travel is safe , and Hong Kong will continue to protect public health .  
The Government today ( August 8 ) has approved an application for financial assistance by the family members of a private doctor who died of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) contracted in the course of his professional practice .  
But many new immigrants from Taiwan , despite being proven veterans on the fiercely competitive economic battlefield at home and arriving with full coffers and detailed plans for investment , tend to pull up short and halt the troops when they see the business efficiency , market order , rise of labor consciousness , severe labor shortage ( even worse than Taiwan 's ) and high operating costs they must face . . . even if they do n't beat a hasty retreat .  
Little did people expect that the economy was brittle , and an unprecedentedly severe recession set in . The unemployment rate , including that for high level positions , rose dramatically , and housing prices collapsed . Many people who had had stable incomes were laid off or took paycuts . Moreover , bank interest rates showed a large increase , and monthly payments thus began to exceed people 's budgets .  
Taiwan developed relatively late , so that it was somewhat behind in terms of spraying pesticides , and the most destructive and toxic chemicals had already been banned for use anywhere in the world , so the problem was not so severe as in the advanced industrial nations . This was good luck . But since all that is true , and Taiwan has had the experience of others to serve as a mirror , why is it that today this has become a pressing problem for us ?  
As for giving oneself up to avoid prosecution , we have discovered that collective corruption is most severe . This kind of corruption is fairly invisible and highly contagious . In some departments , newcomers will be pressured to engage in the same corruption , and once everyone has " greased their palms , " they 'll have a tacit understanding that pockets are padded .  
For those cities and counties with less developed economies , or with severe population outflow , the redistribution of funds is of course the best possible plan . But the money is not there just for the asking . Often expenses that are considered vital at the local level are not seen as such by the center . Sometimes the funds are given with so many restrictions as to how they might be spent that it is hard for the local government to put them to use .  
But with the severe levels of short sight now prevalent among ROC schoolchildren , it would seem that many fail to meet the basic physical requirements , whatever their degree of aptitude . After four years of professional baseball , there are still many shortcomings to be urgently addressed . But this is no reason , as pro ball enters its fifth year , not to invite readers to a spectator 's -eye view of the action down at the ballpark .  
An expectations gapIn fact , there are some industries where economic conditions are not too bad , and people can find work in their original line . But sometimes , the needs of labor and capital collide . Therefore , despite the fact that there is a severe shortage of manufacturing labor , everywhere you can see laid-off industrial workers drifting to other areas of employment ; it 's very perplexing .  
Mainland textbooks on the other hand stress the Communist Party of China 's development of an all-out resistance campaign behind enemy lines , stressing that " the Nationalist government , for fear of unleashing the great power of the people to resist the Japanese , only mobilized the government and the army in partial resistance , leading to severe military failures . The CPC implemented a total war of resistance , effectively complementing the Kuomintang 's overall military strategy and threatening the enemy 's rear . "  
Looking at the evolution of " sexual affairs " in dynasties down the ages , a regular pattern emerges : the more prosperous and powerful a dynasty was , the less restrictions it placed on people in sexual matters ; while the more weak and corrupt a dynasty was , the more tightly it controlled people 's lives , and the more severe the constraints it placed on sex .  
Old local gazetteers report the existence of " black gulches " to both the west and east of Penghu . The former-nicknamed " the Larger Sea " - - separated Penghu from Fujian Province , while the latter ( " the Lesser Sea " ) marked the boundary between Penghu and Taiwan . It was vital for ships trying to cut across these " gulches " to catch a strong wind in the right direction , otherwise they would be carried away by the current and placed in severe danger if they should hit a typhoon .

Those whose offenses are judged to be the lightest , such as runaways , truants , or those picked up wandering the streets , are usually let off with a stern warning .  
Because the economic and political situations in the countries of western and central Africa are worse than in eastern and southern Africa , many countries are worried that after the ban is lifted there the impact on the elephant will be much more severe , so these concerned countries also cast negative votes at the CITES meeting .  
If the scope of liberalization is too broad , problems will result . If there is total liberalization , then future owners need not actually farm the land . Given that illegal use of farmland for non-agricultural purposes is already widespread , it would be almost impossible to regulate future use at all if land need not be owned by farmers themselves . Rampant speculation , a food crisis , or other severe problems might ensue .  
The main areas affected by land subsidence run down the western coastal plain from Changhua through Chia-yi , Yunlin and Tainan to Pingtung . Fish farming is prevalent in these counties , and ponds dot the entire area . The excessive pumping of ground water by these fish farmers is so severe that the elevation of towns and village in the area is dropping . This creates problems with drainage leading to frequent flooding .

Sun is searching for a supplementary treatment which " will release interfering compounds , prevent the early stages of cancer from turning into full-blown cancer , promote healing and have less severe side effects . " Looking at the research into Chinese herbal pharmaceuticals , of those which are relatively cheap and have a high degree of safety , rodi astragale , fructus lycii , and fructus ziziphi jujubae are the most effective . All of these shorten the duration of treatment and reduce the rate of recurrence .  
Following technological advances in the fishing industry , the worldwide consumption of seafood rose and then peaked at 100 million tons in 1990 . The UN 's Food and Agriculture Organization has stated that one-fourth of the sea creatures that constitute the world 's top 20 sources of seafood are already suffering from severe overfishing , requiring cuts in total yearly hauls of 30% .  
" The Marshall Islands have a severe shortage of water for industrial use , so it is not appropriate to set up fish processing operations there such as canning factories . But their geographical location makes them suitable to be developed as a Pacific base for Taiwan 's fishing industry , if they are amenable to this kind of cooperation , " says Koo Kuan-min .  
Even for Mr . and Mrs . Chang Erh-lien , who had run a nursery for nearly 30 years and considered themselves very knowledgeable about preschool children , the reality of foster parenting was far different from what they had been anticipating . Says Mr . Chang , " These children are really very different from most kids . " The first child they accepted , aged two years and nine months , displayed severe developmental regression , and was completely unable to control his bowel or bladder movements .  
On October 16 , Justice Minister Yeh Chin-fong convened a conference of senior police officers , public prosecutors and government anti-corruption units from the six county and city administrations of central Taiwan .

They agreed to impose severe penalties for criminal activities relating to reconstruction projects .  
Lee Juh-feng , a New Party Legislative Yuan member who twice lost in Kinmen County administrator elections , says that although clans perform many positive functions in Kinmen society , the dominance of clans over the exercise of political power has meant that people from minor clans frequently can only play the role of junior ally or balancer and find it hard to rise to prominence themselves . The impact this has had on Kinmen is as severe as the influence of ethnic identity on Taiwan .  
According to statistics of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , if greenhouse gases ( mainly carbon dioxide ) continue to increase at the current rate , in 50 years the global temperature will be five degrees higher than it is now , causing the ice caps to melt faster , raising sea level , and putting one percent of the Earth 's current land surface under water . Other effects will be a sharp increase in the frequency of severe storms and heatwaves .  
The growth of alternative medicine reflected " a gnawing dissatisfaction with conventional , or ' allopathic ' medicine . " For all Western medicine 's brilliant achievements , such as vaccines , penicillin and organ transplants , it also had some severe failings , and the one most complained about was the endless waiting for doctors who viewed one as a sore back , an inoperable tumor or a cardiac case , but never as a person .  
A warm and sunny May day would normally be a profitable and pleasant one for all manner of businesses . But the storm raging over the increasingly widespread epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) has enveloped the entire island of Taiwan in a mist of anxiety and tragedy .  
According to the data , aside from persons suffering from chronic liver , lung and kidney diseases and the old and infirm , those who exhibit the most severe symptoms are adults aged 20 to 50 . Conversely , children whose immune system has not yet fully developed are able to escape this scourge . This provides evidence for the inference that it is the reaction of the immune system and not the SARS virus itself that kills a person .  
The steel is then pounded and ground into a shape roughly approximating that of the eventual blade . This process is repeated 36 times to be absolutely sure the blade will stand up to severe punishment . After the steel has been through smelting , heat treatment , hammering , and cooling , the metal is deliberately exposed to the elements to test its quality . The rusted blade is then subjected to a beating , and will be thrown away if it ca n't withstand the punishment .  
The outbreak of an epidemic of the pre-viously unknown disease SARS ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) revealed a Taiwan public health system shot through with flaws . But twenty years ago , Taiwan had suppressed malaria , Japanese encephalitis , infantile paralysis , and other infectious diseases and had successfully set up a powerful frontline , grassroots defense network against epidemics .  
According to Cheng , research in Taiwan and abroad has consistently demonstrated that severe depression , alcohol and drug addiction , psychological instability and personality disorders , and suicidal behavior by close blood relatives are all clear contributing factors to suicide . Moreover , Dr . George Brown , a fellow of the British Academy , stresses that the experience of loss events also plays a decisive role as a catalyst for suicide .  
Cheng points out that although such ideas have a contagious element about them , people who are mentally healthy or who have a strong " psychological immunity " will not easily be " infected " by suicide reports . But people who are themselves suffering from severe depression or who have suffered a serious setback in life , are more likely to be contaminated by an unhealthy suicidal frame of mind and to be unable to free themselves from it .  
The biggest drawback of this type of treatment is that it takes two to three years , which is more than most people can put up with . What 's more , desensitization is also a risky procedure , because allergy shots can in some cases have the opposite effect to that intended , and provoke asthma , allergic rhinitis , and even anaphylactic shock . Therefore , unless they suffer from a severe case of allergy , most people opt to wage a protracted war of resistance or even to live in peaceful coexistence with their allergy .  
During previous typhoons , after a flood release from the reservoir , it was always possible to wait a few days for the river water to clear up and start providing potable water again . But this time people were not so lucky . Six or seven days after Aere the turbidity of the water remained high , leading to Taoyuan being declared a disaster area due to a severe water shortage , and a war of words broke out between local and central authorities over responsibility .

They attributed the crisis , one of the most severe agricultural disasters in southern Africa over the past 10 years , to " the area 's weakened farm production and supply after two years of production decline caused by bad weather coupled with economic crisis and the suspension of agricultural activities in some areas . "

While we are aware that the matter of economic and individual personal development is first and foremost a national responsibility , we are deeply conscious that our limited domestic resources constitute a severe constraint upon us in our quest to fulfil this obligation .  
The full economic and social utilization of those resources for the benefit of the peoples , to uplift them and create and maintain a better way of life , has been retarded by the severe impact of external debt and , concomitantly , debt-servicing costs , declining levels of official development assistance , reduced financial flows for investment and for industrial , business and commercial development , increasing barriers to trade and impaired access to the markets of the developed countries of the world .

In most cases , the Committee determined that merely to report the adoption of urgent security measures ( implying severe restrictions on the functioning of institutions and the exercise of human rights ) , on the ground of the alleged existence of a state of emergency , was not sufficient , in conformity with the terms of article 4 of the Covenant , to invoke the right of derogation provided for in strictly defined cases .  
To achieve this end , most dictatorial governments have resorted to pseudo _ consultations of the people , in the form of plebiscites or referendums , generally against a background of severe restrictions on the exercise of civil and political rights and public freedoms , as was the case in the Philippines under the Government of President Marcos in 1973 and again in 1979 , in Chile under Pinochet and in Uruguay , where it was attempted unsuccessfully on the occasion of the 1980 constitutional referendum . 
In situations where the constraints on domestic resources are most severe owing to weak economic performance , inadequate infrastructure and the shortage of trained personnel , it is expected that most of the needed resources will be supplied through external population assistance .

Given the severe and irreversible health effects of lead poisoning , particularly on children , it is important to accelerate the process of eliminating unsafe uses of lead , including the use of lead in gasoline worldwide , in light of country-specific conditions and with enhanced international support and assistance to developing countries , particularly through the timely provision of technical and financial assistance and the promotion of endogenous capacity-building .  
There was a general atmosphere of insecurity , in which the population suffered from the arbitrariness and brazen arrogance of the Zairian armed forces ; an inefficient judiciary ; severe repression of freedom of expression and opinion , although within the margin of freedom tolerated since the National Sovereign Conference ; systematic torture and deplorable prison conditions ; and the absence of measures to ensure economic , social and cultural rights .

On the contrary , experience demonstrates that excessive government interference with trade union rights and restrictions on collective bargaining leads to a progressive build-up of industrial relations tension and eventually can result in severe public protests and widespread strikes , with detrimental effects for economic and political stability .  
Torture is defined in the latter Declaration as any act by which severe pain or suffering , whether physical or mental , is intentionally inflicted by or at the instigation of a public official on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or confession , punishing him for an act he has committed or is suspected of having committed , or intimidating him or other persons .

Deeply concerned that intermittent drought , and heavy rains which caused river flooding and consequent severe devastation , coupled with the dire economic situation and persistent civil conflict , have seriously impaired the traditional coping mechanisms of the people in some parts and have aggravated the increasingly fragile food security situation in Somalia , worsening the overall humanitarian situation ,  
Although the measures introduced in 1995 to restore internal and external balance to the Hungarian economy have made considerable progress in this direction , their impact on domestic demand and especially on household consumption has been more severe and more long-lasting than expected .  Economic growth in Slovenia also continued to slow down in 1996 , despite earlier forecasts of an acceleration .  
However , in Central and Eastern Europe ( including the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ) the difficulties inherent in introducing viable market and State mechanisms ab initio to replace the defunct system of control and command took a severe toll , with sharp declines in industrial output , shortfalls in agricultural production , disruption of trade flows , external financial strains and fiscal imbalances .  
However , illegal weapons do not have that protection , and their war-time use easily meets the rest of the definition of torture : their use causes severe pain and suffering , both physical and mental ; their use is intentional ; they are used to unduly coerce the enemy or the civilian population into surrender , submission or other state favourable to the user of the weapons ; and their use is under the direct order of public officials .  
Given the severe and irreversible health effects of lead poisoning , particularly on children , it is important to accelerate the process of eliminating unsafe uses of lead , including the use of lead in gasoline worldwide , in light of country-specific conditions and with enhanced international support and assistance to developing countries , particularly through the timely provision of technical and financial assistance and the promotion of endogenous capacity-building .  
This performance reflected the combined effects of a variety of factors : the results of most countries efforts to control severe macroeconomic imbalances in 1995 , adverse climate conditions which affected primary production , and the drop in the international prices of the main export goods .  
Disturbed that millions of women worldwide suffer from extremely poor housing and living conditions , including severe pollution , overcrowding , polluted water and inadequate sanitation , all of which give rise to serious mental and physical health problems and cause thousands of women to die , or to live in a permanent state of ill _ health ,

If , in addition , one considered the frequent violations of the human rights of the Palestinian and Arab population , the severe conditions under which members of that population were held in custody and the frequent closures of Palestinian territory , it was easy to understand how difficult it was for the Palestinian population to hold on to the optimism and hope engendered by the various peace agreements that had been concluded since 1991 .  
When the General Assembly had adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989 , the Governments of the region had felt confident that they would take concrete measures to reduce high infant and maternal mortality rates and severe malnutrition and to provide universal access to basic education , health and safe drinking water .  That had not happened , however , and most Governments , particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa , had fallen far short of the goals set for the year 2000 .

The increase in the level of resources requested in 20002001 should be viewed in the context of the historically low levels of funding provided for programmes of preventive maintenance and repair and the significant reductions effected in this section during previous bienniums during periods of severe financial constraint in lieu of higher-priority substantive programme activities .  
Protocol I additional to the 1949 Geneva Conventions , relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts , article 35 , paragraph 3 : It is prohibited to employ methods or means of warfare which are intended , or may be expected , to cause widespread , long-term and severe damage to the natural environment .  * E / 1999 / 100 .

Cuba reiterates its vigorous condemnation of the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade , which caused deaths , wounded and the destruction of the building , and reaffirms the need for an impartial , urgent and exhaustive investigation , the immediate publication of its results , the severe punishment of those responsible and the Security Council 's continuing attention to the matter , an obligation that falls within its competence in compliance with the United Nations Charter .  
Mr . Al-Kidwa ( Observer for Palestine ) said that , in the decades since its establishment , UNRWA had played a crucial and historical role in halting the further deterioration of the situation of Palestine refugees and had greatly assisted them by providing the necessary relief , health care , education and social services .  The severe financial difficulties faced by the Agency were of grave concern .  
Reiterating in that regard that natural disasters damage the social and economic infrastructure of all countries , although the long _ term consequences of natural disasters are especially severe for developing countries , including the least developed countries , and landlocked and small island developing States , as well as for countries with economies in transition , thus hampering their sustainable development processes ,

Three in particular stand out : the return to stability and growth has not been the result of a unique formula ; the severe economic and social consequences of the crisis have highlighted the need to strengthen institutional structures at the international and national levels ; and corrective domestic policies have to be complemented by resolute international support measures .  
Recognizing also that globalization poses severe challenges and risks , particularly for developing countries , at a time when they are intensifying their efforts towards achieving sustained economic growth and directing their national policies towards realizing the objective of eradicating poverty ,  
While globalization and market liberalization had had a positive impact on some countries , the aspirations of many of the worlds peoples , especially those of the least developed nations , remained unattainable because of their worsening economic and financial problems and their burden of foreign debt .

The Committee recognized that vulnerability was an important issue for many developing countries , especially the least developed countries ; but to capture all the complex components of vulnerability in just one index posed severe analytical and technical difficulties . 
The most severe forms of incitement to national , racial and religious hatred , enmity or intolerance are those involving abuse of authority , and are punishable by imprisonment from one to eight years ; should such acts cause riots , violence or other grave consequences for the joint life of nations and national minorities living in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , they are punishable by imprisonment from 1 to 10 years.The said criminal offences may be :

Sometimes the funds are given with so many restrictions as to how they might be spent that it is hard for the local government to put them to use .  
But with the severe levels of short sight now prevalent among ROC schoolchildren , it would seem that many fail to meet the basic physical requirements , whatever their degree of aptitude . After four years of professional baseball , there are still many shortcomings to be urgently addressed . But this is no reason , as pro ball enters its fifth year , not to invite readers to a spectator 's -eye view of the action down at the ballpark .  
An expectations gapIn fact , there are some industries where economic conditions are not too bad , and people can find work in their original line .

According to Cheng , research in Taiwan and abroad has consistently demonstrated that severe depression , alcohol and drug addiction , psychological instability and personality disorders , and suicidal behavior by close blood relatives are all clear contributing factors to suicide . Moreover , Dr . George Brown , a fellow of the British Academy , stresses that the experience of loss events also plays a decisive role as a catalyst for suicide .  
Cheng points out that although such ideas have a contagious element about them , people who are mentally healthy or who have a strong " psychological immunity " will not easily be " infected " by suicide reports . But people who are themselves suffering from severe depression or who have suffered a serious setback in life , are more likely to be contaminated by an unhealthy suicidal frame of mind and to be unable to free themselves from it .  
The biggest drawback of this type of treatment is that it takes two to three years , which is more than most people can put up with . What 's more , desensitization is also a risky procedure , because allergy shots can in some cases have the opposite effect to that intended , and provoke asthma , allergic rhinitis , and even anaphylactic shock . Therefore , unless they suffer from a severe case of allergy , most people opt to wage a protracted war of resistance or even to live in peaceful coexistence with their allergy .
