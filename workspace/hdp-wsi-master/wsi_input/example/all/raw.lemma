In addition , the bank also issued more than 4-billion US dollars in the form of foreign exchange rate and spot exchange rate loans to foreign-invested enterprises .  These loans were mainly to support the basic raw materials , chemical , and mechanical industries , etc .  
For a future period of time , China will encourage foreign businessmen to invest in new agricultural technology , comprehensive development of land resources , and such basic industries and pillar industries as water conservation , energy , transportation , important raw materials , machinery and electronics , mining , etc . and will encourage foreign businessmen to employ new high level technology to participate in the technical transformation of China 's enterprises  
The analysis of the State Statistical Bureau shows , last year , there were still certain problems during the industrial economy operation , for instance , capital defaults increased , deficits were still serious , fundamental products such as energy resources , raw materials , etc . grew at low rates , the transfer of industrial structure was considerably slow , and all these are restraining factors assailing the further healthy development of an industrial economy .  
With raw and processed materials , auxiliary materials , components , parts and packaging materials provided by foreign businessmen , the Chinese enterprises manufacture finished products or semi-finished products for them .  They charge foreign businessmen with processing fees .  The money provided by foreign businessmen for buying facilities , testing equipment and special instruments will be offset by processing fees charged by the relevant contracted Chinese enterprises .  
Wang has conducted surveys of some joint venture enterprises in the coastal region of southern China , an area which is seen by many domestic and foreign companies as an excellent processing base , and as long as the design and standards for electronic products are provided , there are various ready-made associated facilities there , from raw materials and parts / components to assembly , etc .  
Wang Zhile surveyed some joint venture enterprises in southern China 's coastal area , which is regarded by many domestic and foreign corporations as the best processing base .  One only has to provide the designs and standards for electronic products , because all kinds of necessary factories , from raw materials , spare parts , to assembly , are already there .  
As our reform is entering a crucial stage of storming fortified positions , new developments and problems have emerged in large numbers , such as the work of preparing for military struggle with the aim of winning the war and not become morally degenerate , and the cadre system reform with the implementation of the raw on Officers on Active Service and the temporary Measures for Resettling Demobilized Soldiers as the content . 
The Chinese government encourages foreign investors , especially multinational corporations , to invest and run fund - and technology-intensive projects ; to initiate a larger number of advanced technology-related projects ; and to invest in auxiliary and coordinative projects as well as projects aimed to earn foreign currency through exports , including electromechanical products , the components and parts industry , and raw materials .  
On 24 May , the Public Security Department of Guangdong cracked down an exceptionally big drug manufacturing and trafficking syndicate in a single operation and destroyed an underground drug processing plant in the Hunan city of Gongyi together with several hideouts in Guangzhou after six months of careful planning based on information supplied , seizing 260,000 head-shaker pills , 320,000 methaqualone pills and large quantities of raw materials and equipment for making drugs .  Also tracked down and seized were 20-million yuan in cash , seven vehicles and other ill-gotten property .  
While efforts are made in history researches , attention should also be paid to propaganda , to the collection and sorting-out of raw historical materials , and to theoretical generation and analysis so that the party history work will be raised to a new level .  Second , adhere to the principle of seeking truth from facts , adhere to the analytical method of dialectical materialism and historical materialism .  Everything should be based on historical facts , and truth should be sought on the basis of facts .  
To follow the path of industrialized operation means to devote major efforts to advancing industrialized operation in cotton and encouraging cotton spinning enterprises to set up raw material production bases in cotton-producing areas and establish various forms of common interest communities with cotton farmers .  
A few local businesses and blood banks acted without authorization in Henan to set up clinics that collected plasma only , and operated in violation of regulations , collecting large amounts of plasma and purchasing raw plasma .  This resulted in the human immunodeficiency virus [ HIV ] being spread widely among the throng who sold blood at these clinics , with Wenlou Village , in Shangcai County 's Lugang Township , being one of the villages with the most serious epidemic conditions .  
We must take effective measures to appropriately lower the prices of industrial raw materials for which there are big price differences between China and abroad , resolutely intensify the work of closing down " five small " industries and knocking out backward production capacity , ensure the prevention of new duplicate construction , strictly control excessive imports of ordinary industrial products , and expand the market space for the development of state enterprises .  
The main factors constraining Russia 's industrial structural adjustment include , firstly , the government 's " passive adaptation " policy .  To fight crises , Russia has been tilted in favor of advantage-enjoying energy and raw material industries in terms of the direction of investment and exports .  This has unavoidably further worsened the already-deformed heavy-light structure .

When touching on utilizing domestic and international resources and on striving to tap domestic and international markets , Wu Yi emphasized the need for localities to encourage , promote , and assist potential and outstanding enterprises to invest in and operate plants abroad , and to engage in product assembling and in raw material processing .  
Increased investment in infrastructure construction and other key construction projects brought about production increase of cement , rolled steel , non-ferrous metal , other raw and processed materials and energy and made their prices rise again in the first half of this year ; and the increased investment also laid a good foundation for increasing the consumer goods prices and promoting long-term economic development .  
From the perspective of practice during the first half of the year , expanding the investment in development of the infrastructure and key projects has not only stimulated growth and a recovery in prices in the energy and raw materials area , including cement , steel , and nonferrous metals , etc . , in the first half of the year , it has also laid an excellent foundation for stimulating an increase in the price of industrial consumables and long-term economic development .  
Temperature difference has been a key factor affecting the quality of concrete pouring in the Three Gorges Project . In order to overcome the difficulty in pouring concrete at high temperatures , the Three Gorges Project set up a special temperature control group formed by specialized technical personnel from design , construction , and supervision units .  The group implements comprehensive measures for controlling temperature and preventing cracks in concrete , covering such aspects as raw materials , extra additives , composition ratios , temperature reduction and maintenance , and pouring design optimization .  
At the same time , the acceleration in the process of China 's reform , opening up , and modernization will provide good business development opportunities to foreign investors mainly in the following aspects .  First , China 's continued efforts to implement the principle and policy of expanding its domestic demand , and to accelerate strategic economic restructuring , will provide extensive space for foreign investments in agriculture , water conservancy , energy , transportation , communications , raw and semi-finished materials , environmental protection , high technology , major equipment , and other fields .  
In the second half of the year , its comparative base number is higher , the effect of tax reimbursement for export will be weakened , and the increased prices of raw and semifinished will result in higher cost .  So , the possibility of continued growth of exports is slim too .  
A Ming Pao reporter has learned that the NPC Standing Committee has recently set up a special group to study the legislation of a law to put raw materials listed in the International Anti-Narcotics Convention under control .  However , since such legislation involves many production and export administrative departments , as well as relevant judicial organs , it will take a relatively long time to officially promulgate such a law .  
In order to suit the development of the market economy , they carried on diversified and multitrade operations in the past .  With their businesses expanded , they have exposed the weaknesses in the shortage of managerial personnel and decentralization of funds .  Therefore , they were unable to achieve the scale merit , the costs of raw materials were comparatively high , the operating costs were comparatively expensive , the prices of goods and services were less competitive , and the return rate on capital failed to reach the best level .  
Hubei will concentrate on the development of six major industries , including high-tech industries in " Wuhan - - China 's Optical Valley , " with electronic information industry at the core , modern manufacturing industries with automotive industry at the core , raw materials industries with iron and steel industry at the core , energy industries with hydropower generation at the core , modern agricultural industries with the production of green food at the core , and tertiary industries with tourism at the core .

At the same time , another raiding team broke into an adjacent temporary structure which was suspected to be used as a meat roasting factory .  A total of 340 kilogrammes of raw meat as well as 160 kilogrammes of roasted ducks and pigs were seized .  One person was arrested .  
Mr Lee explained that the pollution problems previously portrayed by the media only involved specific areas along Dongjiang which were localised and confined in nature and might not affect the overall quality of raw water transferred to Hong Kong . The water volume of the Dongjiang was huge , being measured in millions of cubic metres ( 1 cubic metre is 1,000 litres ) , which had a natural purification effect on the quality of Dongjiang water .  
Two unlicensed meat roasting factories in Yuen Long which carried on their illegal business after repeated raids by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department ( FEHD ) were smashed again during a new round of blitz operations early this ( August 29 ) morning .  A total of 1,695 raw and roast meat were seized .

Finally , the Great Wall was extended in an unbroken line for thousands of miles across territories with varied topographic and geological characteristics .  Over the two millennia , the Great Wall was mainly built by raw materials procured from local sources and adapted to local conditions to take the best of topographic advantage .  
" As Norwalk-like virus is commonly found in sewage-contaminated water .  Shellfish , particularly raw oyster , harvested from polluted water are prone to contamination .  Vulnerable groups like the young , the elderly , pregnant women and immuno-compromised people are strongly advised not to consume raw oysters as they are likely to suffer from the more severe forms of the disease arising from the viral infection , " she warned .  
In negotiating with the Guangdong Authority for an agreement on future water supply , the Hong Kong Government will carefully review the annual supply quantities according to the latest estimate of our freshwater demand .  We will also seek to incorporate more flexible provisions into the agreement so that the quantities of raw water imported may be reduced in wet seasons and suitably increased in dry seasons .  
" Bacterial food poisoning is expected to rise , " he said .  " The major contributing factors in food poisoning are cross-contamination between raw food and cooked food , as well as inadequate cooking .  Dr Tsang said the incidence of acute conjunctivitis was low in the first half of this year .  
A large quantity of unmanifested cargoes included an optical disc production machinery , about 400 000 VCDs , raw plastic , medical equipment , fax machines , assorted electrical and computer components , and assorted vehicle parts were found concealed and beneath the scrap metal . 
The Wide Field of Plastics With active assistance of the government and continued efforts of businessmen , the plastics industry in Taiwan , though starting late , has developed very rapidly . Beginning with processing imported raw materials into daily necessities , then expanding to the current export of self-produced raw materials , its development has been beyond expectation . Plastics have become an important key to the economic development of the Republic of China .  
Today this new plant at Tung Hsiao produces 100,000 metric tons of high quality refined salt annually . About 130,000 metric tons of crude salt originally required as raw material for the manufacturing of refined salt will be saved annually to meet the pressing needs of rapidly growing industries .  
After several years of intensive work , Mr . Chuang eventually produced a machine which is faster , processing up to 110 pieces a minute , only one thirteenth the size of the imported models , and only requires a three-quarters of a horsepower engine to operate . The waste rate is also low , with 82 kilograms of peeled asparagus obtained from 100 kilograms of the raw material .  
Furthermore , hydraulic power has been exploited to the maximum in Taiwan already . Though there is great potential in the development of nuclear power , the sources of raw material are mainly overseas , and the radioactive residue is difficult to dispose of .  
Lin pointed out that as a precious Chinese cultural legacy , the art of flower arrangement was popular in the Sui and Tang dynasties ( 589-907 A . D . ) , when it was first introduced to Japan . Wild flowers and natural raw materials are endowed with new vitality when they are arranged artistically , giving an elegant and refined look to the most mundane surroundings .  
The earliest snuff bottles were made of five-colored glass . Later , all kinds of raw materials , including gold , jade and other precious stones , porcelain , bamboo and wood were used to create elaborate designs . Carving , painting and inlaying techniques were used to complete the process .  
Anyone who sees the raw material after it is imported into Taiwan will inevitably ask : " How can these ugly-looking , twisted vines be transformed into such outstanding furniture ? " At the Ye Fun plant , each piece is measured and placed in a different warehouse according to size .  
Fortunately , a few enlightened people noticed this weakness , and began to take their raw materials from everyday life as a means of enlightening audiences as well as entertaining them . In " He 's My Brother , " Koo Pao-min plays the part of a mentally and physically handicapped boy who is looked after by his elder brother .  
But the mainland has been isolated from the rest of the world for more than 30 years , and therefore is backward in industrial production . Its major exports are raw materials and labor-intensive products of low quality , while Taiwan exports semi-finished and finished products .  
Since the oil shock , the price of textile raw materials has skyrocketed , and meanwhile the people 's living standards were rising , resulting in higher labor costs . The developed countries protected their domestic textile industries with import quotas . Moreover , the ROC had been concentrating on the low-priced market . As such less-developed areas as the Philippines , India and Mainland China took advantage of very low labor costs and local resources , the competition grew .  
According to early records , the ling chiao was cultivated as a worship offering as early as Chou dynasty times ( 1122 B . C . ) . An aquatic plant , the ling chiao became a vital source of livelihood for those people dwelling in lake regions . The starchy , nutritious fruit became a food staple : cooked as congee , ground into a flour for cakes and eaten raw as a fruit .  
As for the international situation , the United States had already issued forth an official government report , and was prepared to cast aside Taiwan . As for the domestic situation , Taiwan had met up against a dire shortage of raw materials and inflation . Also , the Chinese Communists had their eyes set on Kinmen and Matsu , and were making strategic preparations to attack .  
It would be nice if Chinese living overseas could share more of what they have learned with each other , especially French cuisine , which is world famous - - I expect that French cooking is more attractive than jus cheese and salads . As for oysters , judging from my many years of experience work ing in a hospital , it 's best to eat them cooked instead of raw .  
Ilan author Li Tung writes feelingly : " Their acting may still be a bit raw and unpolished , and there are flaws in the continuity , but compared with the lackadaisical performance of some professional troupes that are stuck in a rut and never try anything new , their sincerity and concentration are all the more fresh and moving . "  
This company located in Kaohsiung originally made badminton racquet heads , whose main raw material is cork . Not only does cork have to be imported from abroad , it is even more troublesome to deal with the waste after the wood is processed .  
According to the original recipe , the beef is first sliced and placed on top of the cooked noodles , then a superior stock made from chicken bones , medicinal herbs , shrimp sauce , fish sauce and so on is poured in ; lastly various raw vegetables such as chiutsengta and purple perilla are added , along with local herbs and leaves .  
Most proprietary teas on the British market are made from a variety of raw or processed graded teas which tea merchants buy from different Indian and African plantations or at tea auctions , and which are then carefully mixed and combined in varying proportions by professional blenders to create branded teas of stable quality , in flavors such as Earl Grey Tea , Breakfast Tea , Prince Charles Tea and so on .  
" Starting from late 1994 , as the global economy recovered , demand increased greatly , and this brought sharp rises in the international prices of some agricultural and industrial raw materials , including petrochemical feedstocks , textile fibers , paper pulp , grains , basic metals and so on . Price rises in Taiwan are part of a global chain reaction , " says Liu Fang-jung , a specialist researching prices at the Council for Economic Planning and Development .  
Since 1993 , as part of a major government crackdown , the government has thus far closed down over 30 underground amphetamine laboratories . Nearly 14 tons of raw materials , finished products , and semi-finished products were uncovered . The industry 's history then repeated itself , only this time it was Taiwan drug manufacturers putting up the capital and providing the equipment and technology , as factories moved westward to coastal China ( especially Fujian ) . Goods produced there are either sold to Taiwanese businessmen or shipped out to Taiwan , Japan , and Korea .  
" In fact , Hong Kong 's intrinsic importance for Taiwan 's economy is not absolute . " C . J . Lee , director of the First Institute of the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research , points out that Hong Kong 's own manufacturing industry has almost all moved north , and naturally Taiwanese companies will not choose to set up factories in Hong Kong . Hong Kong is not a production base , and there are no key raw materials or components which can only be obtained from the colony .  
The desire of " civilized " humanity for material goods is insatiable . Man is also the only animal to have developed commerce . Ivory has been a common raw material since the earliest days of markets , and its consumption has grown continuously .  
No taste like home Old Confucius was not the only one who was partial to raw fish . Poet Zhang Han of the Western Jin ( 265-317 ) was appointed an official in the capital Luoyang . But when the autumn winds began to blow he was so overcome with nostalgia for the thick watershield soup and sliced raw sea bass of his native Suzhou that he said : " What matters most in life is to be content .  
These included " fish souls , " made from the lips cut from live sturgeon ; " Xi Shi 's bosom , " made with white fat from pufferfish bellies and named after a famous beauty ; and the " gold soup and jade slices " served by Mrs . Song outside Qiantang Gate , which comprised a thick wild rice stem soup and sliced raw common carp and crucian carp .  
However , to date the exchange center has not been able to balance demand with supply . Lin Chih-sen , a division chief at the IDB , comments that many raw materials derived from waste do not have the same level of purity as original feedstocks , and so do not meet manufacturers ' requirements . Hence the proportion of waste materials offered through the exchange center which are actually sold is very low-less than 10% .  
According to museum employee Lu Yu-hua , many people express surprise that there should be an entire museum devoted solely to paper , but when you really think about it , there 's really nothing strange about it . When paper was first invented , the raw materials from which it was made differed from one region to the next . A single sheet of paper spoke volumes about local climates and vegetation ; its very existence enabled the spread of knowledge , and could record the history of an individual or an entire nation !  
The MOEA promotes economic diplomacy in coordination with overall foreign policy . Concrete measures include the following : Based on the " Guidelines for Strengthening Economic and Trade Ties with Diplomatic Partner States in Latin America , " businesses are assisted in accessing agricultural or industrial raw materials , cheap labor , or land in Latin America , and are assisted in creating an international division of labor with Latin America and in penetrating North and South American markets .  
Many of this year 's award winners , including Piyouma , Wantan , and Wukou , are aboriginal or Hakka websites . Such communities have the innate advantages of rich non-mainstream traditional cultures , and can feature novel or unusual local customs . Therefore , these communities have more raw material to work with in constructing a website .  
President Chen has also instructed Taiwan 's financial and economic community that regardless of whether the US fights a quick or a protracted war , Taiwan must respond with flexibility by stabilizing the equity and currency markets and guaranteeing the supply of crude oil , agricultural raw materials , and staple commodities .  
All types of fish that can be eaten raw have a fairly high fat content , but the bluefin is particularly famed for its fattiness . The Pacific bluefin that migrate through the waters east of Taiwan prefer lower water temperatures than other tuna , and usually stay north of the 18th parallel . To protect it from cold the Pacific bluefin has more fat than the yellowfin and albacore , which are distributed around the equator , or the southern bluefin , which lives in the southern hemisphere .  
The impact of high technology goes deeper than that of the old crafts , or even of traditional industries such as textiles , papermaking , or iron and steel . Like them , high-tech industries create pollution , and treat nature no differently from lifeless raw materials . But the unpredictable stream of innovations thrown up by modern science has also created many new ethical issues .  
When Yang made his first trip to mainland China in 1989 , he never expected that CHM would become the professional preoccupation of the rest of his life . Traveling only to see the scenery , he incidentally discovered that major pharmaceuticals manufacturers from around the world had set up shop in the PRC , hoping to find buried treasure . That 's when he decided to go into the business of gathering , inspecting , and trading raw materials for CHM , and even cultivating basic sources of botanical pharmaceuticals .  
Yang once decided to grind pearl down to nano levels , and discovered that he had destroyed the amino acid , releasing a foul odor and ruining the raw material .  
The applications for refined CHM can be extended considerably . Already a number of manufacturers in Taiwan are adding raw materials from Kingstone to all kinds of products , including yogurt and ice cream . These raw materials can also be put to use in natural colorings and flavorings , edible fibers , cosmetic masks , bandages , and more . These uses are already common overseas , with the production value of such products increasing year in and year out , but in Taiwan there is still vast room for R &amp; D and promotion .  
There are records of the medicinal uses of alcohol in China even on ancient tortoise shells dating back to the Shang and Zhou dynasties . " Alcohol is a good natural solvent , enabling one to get a higher proportion of the therapeutic content out of the raw materials of Chinese medicine , " Chen Chun-che says .  
For one thing , he says , the raw material for lacquer ware is made from the sap of any of various species of lacquer tree and is poisonous in its natural form . Contact with the skin or ingestion will , in mild cases , cause swelling and extreme itchiness of the arms . Persons with a low tolerance level will experience general swelling and suffer from symptoms akin to poison ivy . If scratching leads to infection , the victim will puff up all over like a big balloon .  
While the raw lacquer is toxic , once it dries it is insoluble to all chemicals ; and its toxins are trapped inside . Thus there are no health worries , and lacquer ware is impervious to humidity , heat , acids , and alkalis . It is a natural insulator , and remains perfectly preserved even when buried underground for ages . Few other art objects can compare .  
They said that except the construction sector , most industries are recovering , and , in particular , the indices for the basic raw material industry and the chemical industry " are more positive " Even the sector of consumer 's goods , which has been under the pressure of low demands , showed signs of growing  
The economic crises in the developing world have been greatly aggravated : unemployment and economic stagnation have been compounded by persisting problems in international trade , by foreign debt and by falling prices for raw materials .  
Yet there are numerous exceptions : some enterprises are licensed and regulated ; some use imported raw materials ; some are owned by educated persons ; and some obtain a loan from a formal source of credit . 
The application of the widely advocated concept of good governance with less emphasis on traditional donor assistance is not impartial : it is very flexible and indulgent when it comes to countries with strategic raw materials , but strict and restrictive when it comes to others .  
By this I mean , for example , earmarking for the armed forces imposts on exports of raw materials such as oil or preferential treatment for businesses controlled or owned by the armed forces , which may also be stockholders in major public and private companies .  
It is estimated that a provision of $ 865,700 , reflecting growth of $ 41,000 , would be required for the acquisition of professional radio and television reference books and materials , and public information supplies such as film , raw stock , audio and video tapes and cassettes , photographic film , paper and chemicals and other miscellaneous materials required for radio and visual productions and supplies for the operation of the typesetting system .  
Further took note of the gradual shift of focus from pollution control and waste management to pollution prevention approaches in policies and programmes at the country level and bilateral and multilateral cooperation , and observed that this shift has resulted in the introduction of production patterns that emphasize the more efficient use of raw materials and energy , taking into account the capture and recycling of wastes and the better use of end-products of the productive system ;  
The raw images collected by optical sensors on board the satellites were corrected for radiometric and geometric distortions , in order to facilitate subsequent visual image interpretation or computer classification and to assure that they could be superposed on pre-existing maps as required , for example , in a GIS .  
The negative impacts of imports barriers by developed countries on the pace of forest-based industrialization in developing countries are not expected to lead to increased export of raw wood because of the many restrictions on raw wood exports imposed by most tropical timber exporting countries .  
The problem is that normally people living in areas with high potential biodiversity values are poorer and have less or no paying capacity compared with people in industrialized countries , where the value of biodiversity is often recognized , for example , as raw material for the pharmaceutical industry , or in terms of recreation for visitors . 
The collective goal of the former colonial Powers was to continue controlling the former colonies in order to guarantee a continuous flow of inexpensive raw materials and cheap labour while at the same time ensuring a stable market for goods from the industrially developed countries .  
In considering applications on a case-by-case basis , the Committee viewed as inappropriate requests to supply industrial equipment and raw materials , as well as horticultural produce , except fruits and vegetables , to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , unless such applications contained , in every case , specific explanations of how the commodities and products in question were intended to meet essential humanitarian needs ( see press release SC / 6118 ) .  
Developing countries ' growing leverage in the global trade system was based on raw economic power : they currently accounted for a quarter of world trade and , if current trends continued , this figure could reach 40 per cent by the year 2010 and over half by 2020 .  
At the same time , the reform process must assign special importance to measures and mechanisms designed to accelerate economic and social development , especially in Africa , by supporting domestic efforts at economic restructuring , diversification of raw materials and increased food security being carried out by the countries of the region . 
Increasing the value added to the processing of local raw materials ; the transformation of hides and skins into exportable leather products in eight eastern and southern African countries ; the manufacture of wood products in order to provide opportunities for the environmentally sustainable development of forest resources in seven western and central African countries ; the processing of spices and aromatic products in Zanzibar ; and the introduction of new techniques for the production of salt in the Plateau State of Nigeria ;  
This integration is of great benefit to national and foreign investors thanks to the country 's economic and other potential such as its geographical location , in relation to major regional markets , its transit role , its role as a supplier of hydroelectric power to neighbouring countries and export producer , using the country 's raw materials , and its innumerable natural tourist attractions .  
Information provided both by the Secretariat and by specialized agencies gives an objective quantitative picture of where the phenomena of poverty , unemployment and social disintegration are most acute : the same places experiencing an increased deterioration in the terms of trade ; protectionism ; a fall in the prices of exported raw materials ; and the drying up of financial flows .  
The people and Government of Jamaica have long recognized that small businesses , which incorporate small-scale enterprises , micro-enterprises and cooperatives , have the potential to create jobs , utilize local raw materials and involve large numbers of people in national decision-making and social and economic development .  
Those objectives are set out relative to the following five programme areas : ( a ) increasing the availability of food , feed and renewable raw materials ; ( b ) improving human health ; ( c ) enhancing protection of the environment ; ( d ) enhancing safety and developing international mechanisms for cooperation ; and ( e ) establishing enabling mechanisms for the development and environmentally sound application of biotechnology .  
The Penal Code lays down offences of an ecological nature , dealing , for example , with the unlawful destruction of raw materials , trees , agricultural or industrial products or means of production , such destruction being detrimental to national wealth or consumption , as well as with the protection of mammals or marine vertebrates and aquatic species .  
It was also recommended that the indicative list of criminal activities contained in article 1 of the draft framework convention should be supplemented with the following crimes : trafficking in illegal migrants ; extortion ; kidnapping ; cattle-rustling ; export of toxic wastes ; illicit export of precious raw materials ; trafficking in protected species ; international fraud ; sexual exploitation of children ; trafficking in human organs ; and violation of intellectual property rights .  
Changes in the sectoral composition of world output towards less commodity-intensive service sectors , combined with technological advances making for less raw material use per unit of output , appear to foreshadow a continuing long-run decline in the prices of primary commodities relative to those of manufactured goods .  
The recession had given rise to falling prices of raw materials and basic commodities , increased protectionism by the industrialized countries , the absence of a genuinely free transfer of technology , and a staggering rise in the external debt .  
Rapidly rising tariffs , from low rates for raw materials to higher rates for intermediate products and sometimes peak rates for finished industrial products , continue to hamper vertical diversification and industrialization in developing countries .  
Low conversion efficiency remains a problem in many developing countries ; however , gains in processing efficiency in many industrialized countries , coupled with increasing use of recovered or non-wood fibre in pulp and paper manufacture , have helped to moderate global demand for wood raw material from forests .  
Although demand for industrial wood raw material is expected to increase in the future , changes in the product mix and changes in production technology and sources of raw material are likely to provide opportunities for production increases consistent with constant ( or modestly increasing ) prices .  
However , the overemphasis on export-led growth , particularly on export agriculture and mineral extraction , merely reinforced the inherited colonial division of labour which condemned many developing nations to supplying raw materials to industrialized nations and trapped them into importing finished goods at much higher prices .  
Small businesses had the potential to create jobs , utilize local raw materials and scientific and technological expertise and involve large numbers of people in national decision-making and economic and social development .  
Ms . Cardoze ( Panama ) , speaking on behalf of the Rio Group , said that the consequences for the Rio Group region of the global financial crisis which had begun during the previous year had included a decrease of two percentage points in the growth rate of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) , a decline in imports and exports , particularly of raw materials and semi-manufactured products , an increase in the current account deficit and , in some cases , a decrease in international reserves .  
During the period of the United Nations Security Council sanctions , it was very difficult , or even impossible , for FRY to import medicaments , raw materials for medicaments , medical supplies , instruments and their spare parts , materials for personal protection of workers , measuring instruments and their spare parts , various chemicals which are required for various analyses in health care and micro-climate tests of working conditions , scientific and technical books , etc .  
Contributing factors to the marine environmental deterioration include oil exploration and exploitation , rapid economic growth , overfishing , physical alteration of the coastlines by dredging and filling , discharge of raw sewage , disposal of untreated industrial effluents , and dumping wasted oil and debris .  
One means of accomplishing this will be to disseminate , at the pace dictated by media deadlines , more live footage and quickly edited raw materials for television and radio in particular , including , where possible , audio-visual coverage of United Nations activities in major international developments in which the Organization is a principal player .  
Strengthening programme management capacity , including logistical systems , to make services safer , more affordable and more convenient and accessible to clients and to ensure the availability and continuous supply of safe and effective contraceptives and other sexual and reproductive health supplies and , as appropriate , the raw material for them ;  
Strengthening programme management capacity , including logistical systems , to make services safer , more affordable and more convenient and accessible to clients and to ensure the availability and continuous supply of safe and effective contraceptives and other sexual and reproductive health supplies and , as appropriate , the raw material for them ;  
An expert from a low-income country reported that the major objective of his country 's agricultural policy was to produce enough food grains and other agricultural commodities for direct consumption or for use as raw materials in agro-processing industries , and the problem for the country was not so much in terms of competition in the world market for exports but how to compete with cheap imports from outside , an excess inflow of which could be economically and socially destabilizing .  
Take note of and adopt sanctions against Rwanda and Uganda for the systematic pillaging of the raw materials of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , which is the real motive behind this invasion , contrary to the false pretext of security considerations which the two aggressor countries are flaunting in their vain , deliberate attempt to deceive the international community as to the real reasons for their criminal enterprise in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ;  
The region can no longer rely on cheap labour or raw materials for its structural transformation but rather must shift to improving the productivity of its labour , effectively transforming its static comparative advantages to dynamic competitive advantages .  
Fourth , the United Nations Development Programme must prepare studies on industrial projects for manufacturing basic commodities agricultural and mineral where Africa again would contribute raw materials and human resources , and the international investment firms would provide financing and technical know-how in a fair manner applied to all .  
If we really want to find effective and lasting solutions we can not overlook the fact that the roots of the current problems are found in the centuries of colonial exploitation during which African economies were looted and distorted in order to turn them into providers of natural resources , raw materials and cheap manpower at the cost of the annihilation and enslavement of tens of millions of people . 
A new potential is growing in certain developing countries as they become major foreign investors and major manufacturers and exporters in industries which now use textile fibres and raw materials previously imported from developed country industries .  
The vast , cheap labour pools of developing countries were being exploited , commodity prices were being manipulated in order to ensure a continued supply of cheap raw materials and the markets of developing countries were being pried open in the name of trade liberalization while the developed countries limited access to their own markets through various stratagems .  
Among the obstacles faced by developing countries were the current lack of infrastructure in the domestic and global economies and the instability of capital markets , the fall in the price of raw materials , debt burdens , lack of investment , uncontrolled exchange rates and social resistance .  
For many commodities exported by developing countries , there has also been substantial substitution by synthetic materials over the past two decades , while a shift away from traditional &amp; lt ; heavy = industries , such as iron and steel , has also limited the rate of expansion in demand for natural raw materials .  
The theme From farm to factory for a better future embodies my firm belief that Africa , with its endowment of diverse agricultural resources , most of which are industrial raw materials that could be transformed to provide adequate food for the peoples of Africa , could simultaneously improve agricultural productivity , as well as increase utilization of its manufacturing capacity for food security .  
The term primary data means those raw data that are acquired by remote sensors borne by a space object and that are transmitted or delivered to the ground from space by telemetry in the form of electromagnetic signals , by photographic film , magnetic tape or any other means ;  
Strengthening programme management capacity , including logistical systems , to make services safer , more affordable and more convenient and accessible to clients and to ensure the availability and continuous supply of safe and effective contraceptives and other sexual and reproductive health supplies and , as appropriate , the raw material for them ;  
While Africa has a rich natural resource endowment , which should give it the comparative advantage in becoming a major producer of industrial raw materials and manufactures , its potential remains largely untapped .  
Even with improved pumping capacity and disinfectant supply , the operational capacity of many ( and probably most ) treatment plants is simply inadequate to counter the level of bacterial contamination in the raw water intake .  
The first United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Vancouver , Canada , 1976 ) was supported by producing a statistical annex , h a set of derived measures combined with raw data , used for supporting the major findings and recommendations of the Conference .  
Urges all Governments to continue contributing to the maintenance of a balance between the licit supply of and demand for opiate raw materials for medical and scientific needs , the achievement of which would be facilitated by maintaining , in so far as their constitutional and legal systems permit , support to the traditional and legal supplier countries , and to cooperate in preventing the proliferation of sources of production of opiate raw materials ;  
The goal of sustainable development for all required that a solution be found to the debt problem of the developing countries , the liberalization of the trade polices of the industrialized countries be encouraged , especially in sectors of interest to the countries of the South such as agriculture and textiles , the prices for raw materials stabilized , development assistance increased and the transfer of technology promoted , so as to reduce the growing gap between North and South which was the greatest threat to the developing countries .  
In urging the Governments concerned to adjust global production of opiate raw materials to a level corresponding to actual licit needs and to avoid unforeseen imbalances between licit supply of and demand for opiates caused by the exportation of products manufactured from seized and confiscated drugs ;  
Last year alone , the Bank of China provided an accumulated total of more than 69 billion yuan of RMB loans to foreign-invested enterprises .  In addition , the bank also issued more than 4-billion US dollars in the form of foreign exchange rate and spot exchange rate loans to foreign-invested enterprises .  These loans were mainly to support the basic raw materials , chemical , and mechanical industries , etc .  
For a future period of time , China will encourage foreign businessmen to invest in new agricultural technology , comprehensive development of land resources , and such basic industries and pillar industries as water conservation , energy , transportation , important raw materials , machinery and electronics , mining , etc . and will encourage foreign businessmen to employ new high level technology to participate in the technical transformation of China 's enterprises  
The analysis of the State Statistical Bureau shows , last year , there were still certain problems during the industrial economy operation , for instance , capital defaults increased , deficits were still serious , fundamental products such as energy resources , raw materials , etc . grew at low rates , the transfer of industrial structure was considerably slow , and all these are restraining factors assailing the further healthy development of an industrial economy .  
With raw and processed materials , auxiliary materials , components , parts and packaging materials provided by foreign businessmen , the Chinese enterprises manufacture finished products or semi-finished products for them .  They charge foreign businessmen with processing fees .  The money provided by foreign businessmen for buying facilities , testing equipment and special instruments will be offset by processing fees charged by the relevant contracted Chinese enterprises .  
Wang has conducted surveys of some joint venture enterprises in the coastal region of southern China , an area which is seen by many domestic and foreign companies as an excellent processing base , and as long as the design and standards for electronic products are provided , there are various ready-made associated facilities there , from raw materials and parts / components to assembly , etc .  
Wang Zhile surveyed some joint venture enterprises in southern China 's coastal area , which is regarded by many domestic and foreign corporations as the best processing base .  One only has to provide the designs and standards for electronic products , because all kinds of necessary factories , from raw materials , spare parts , to assembly , are already there .  
As our reform is entering a crucial stage of storming fortified positions , new developments and problems have emerged in large numbers , such as the work of preparing for military struggle with the aim of winning the war and not become morally degenerate , and the cadre system reform with the implementation of the raw on Officers on Active Service and the temporary Measures for Resettling Demobilized Soldiers as the content . 
The Chinese government encourages foreign investors , especially multinational corporations , to invest and run fund - and technology-intensive projects ; to initiate a larger number of advanced technology-related projects ; and to invest in auxiliary and coordinative projects as well as projects aimed to earn foreign currency through exports , including electromechanical products , the components and parts industry , and raw materials .  
On 24 May , the Public Security Department of Guangdong cracked down an exceptionally big drug manufacturing and trafficking syndicate in a single operation and destroyed an underground drug processing plant in the Hunan city of Gongyi together with several hideouts in Guangzhou after six months of careful planning based on information supplied , seizing 260,000 head-shaker pills , 320,000 methaqualone pills and large quantities of raw materials and equipment for making drugs .  Also tracked down and seized were 20-million yuan in cash , seven vehicles and other ill-gotten property .  
While efforts are made in history researches , attention should also be paid to propaganda , to the collection and sorting-out of raw historical materials , and to theoretical generation and analysis so that the party history work will be raised to a new level .  Second , adhere to the principle of seeking truth from facts , adhere to the analytical method of dialectical materialism and historical materialism .  Everything should be based on historical facts , and truth should be sought on the basis of facts .  
To follow the path of industrialized operation means to devote major efforts to advancing industrialized operation in cotton and encouraging cotton spinning enterprises to set up raw material production bases in cotton-producing areas and establish various forms of common interest communities with cotton farmers .  
A few local businesses and blood banks acted without authorization in Henan to set up clinics that collected plasma only , and operated in violation of regulations , collecting large amounts of plasma and purchasing raw plasma .  This resulted in the human immunodeficiency virus [ HIV ] being spread widely among the throng who sold blood at these clinics , with Wenlou Village , in Shangcai County 's Lugang Township , being one of the villages with the most serious epidemic conditions .  
We must take effective measures to appropriately lower the prices of industrial raw materials for which there are big price differences between China and abroad , resolutely intensify the work of closing down " five small " industries and knocking out backward production capacity , ensure the prevention of new duplicate construction , strictly control excessive imports of ordinary industrial products , and expand the market space for the development of state enterprises .  
The main factors constraining Russia 's industrial structural adjustment include , firstly , the government 's " passive adaptation " policy .  To fight crises , Russia has been tilted in favor of advantage-enjoying energy and raw material industries in terms of the direction of investment and exports .  This has unavoidably further worsened the already-deformed heavy-light structure .

When touching on utilizing domestic and international resources and on striving to tap domestic and international markets , Wu Yi emphasized the need for localities to encourage , promote , and assist potential and outstanding enterprises to invest in and operate plants abroad , and to engage in product assembling and in raw material processing .  
Increased investment in infrastructure construction and other key construction projects brought about production increase of cement , rolled steel , non-ferrous metal , other raw and processed materials and energy and made their prices rise again in the first half of this year ; and the increased investment also laid a good foundation for increasing the consumer goods prices and promoting long-term economic development .  
From the perspective of practice during the first half of the year , expanding the investment in development of the infrastructure and key projects has not only stimulated growth and a recovery in prices in the energy and raw materials area , including cement , steel , and nonferrous metals , etc . , in the first half of the year , it has also laid an excellent foundation for stimulating an increase in the price of industrial consumables and long-term economic development .  
Temperature difference has been a key factor affecting the quality of concrete pouring in the Three Gorges Project . In order to overcome the difficulty in pouring concrete at high temperatures , the Three Gorges Project set up a special temperature control group formed by specialized technical personnel from design , construction , and supervision units .  The group implements comprehensive measures for controlling temperature and preventing cracks in concrete , covering such aspects as raw materials , extra additives , composition ratios , temperature reduction and maintenance , and pouring design optimization .  
At the same time , the acceleration in the process of China 's reform , opening up , and modernization will provide good business development opportunities to foreign investors mainly in the following aspects .  First , China 's continued efforts to implement the principle and policy of expanding its domestic demand , and to accelerate strategic economic restructuring , will provide extensive space for foreign investments in agriculture , water conservancy , energy , transportation , communications , raw and semi-finished materials , environmental protection , high technology , major equipment , and other fields .  
In the second half of the year , its comparative base number is higher , the effect of tax reimbursement for export will be weakened , and the increased prices of raw and semifinished will result in higher cost .  So , the possibility of continued growth of exports is slim too .  
A Ming Pao reporter has learned that the NPC Standing Committee has recently set up a special group to study the legislation of a law to put raw materials listed in the International Anti-Narcotics Convention under control .  However , since such legislation involves many production and export administrative departments , as well as relevant judicial organs , it will take a relatively long time to officially promulgate such a law .  
In order to suit the development of the market economy , they carried on diversified and multitrade operations in the past .  With their businesses expanded , they have exposed the weaknesses in the shortage of managerial personnel and decentralization of funds .  Therefore , they were unable to achieve the scale merit , the costs of raw materials were comparatively high , the operating costs were comparatively expensive , the prices of goods and services were less competitive , and the return rate on capital failed to reach the best level .  
Hubei will concentrate on the development of six major industries , including high-tech industries in " Wuhan - - China 's Optical Valley , " with electronic information industry at the core , modern manufacturing industries with automotive industry at the core , raw materials industries with iron and steel industry at the core , energy industries with hydropower generation at the core , modern agricultural industries with the production of green food at the core , and tertiary industries with tourism at the core .

At the same time , another raiding team broke into an adjacent temporary structure which was suspected to be used as a meat roasting factory .  A total of 340 kilogrammes of raw meat as well as 160 kilogrammes of roasted ducks and pigs were seized .  One person was arrested .  
Mr Lee explained that the pollution problems previously portrayed by the media only involved specific areas along Dongjiang which were localised and confined in nature and might not affect the overall quality of raw water transferred to Hong Kong . The water volume of the Dongjiang was huge , being measured in millions of cubic metres ( 1 cubic metre is 1,000 litres ) , which had a natural purification effect on the quality of Dongjiang water .  
Two unlicensed meat roasting factories in Yuen Long which carried on their illegal business after repeated raids by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department ( FEHD ) were smashed again during a new round of blitz operations early this ( August 29 ) morning .  A total of 1,695 raw and roast meat were seized .

Finally , the Great Wall was extended in an unbroken line for thousands of miles across territories with varied topographic and geological characteristics .  Over the two millennia , the Great Wall was mainly built by raw materials procured from local sources and adapted to local conditions to take the best of topographic advantage .  
" As Norwalk-like virus is commonly found in sewage-contaminated water .  Shellfish , particularly raw oyster , harvested from polluted water are prone to contamination .  Vulnerable groups like the young , the elderly , pregnant women and immuno-compromised people are strongly advised not to consume raw oysters as they are likely to suffer from the more severe forms of the disease arising from the viral infection , " she warned .  
In negotiating with the Guangdong Authority for an agreement on future water supply , the Hong Kong Government will carefully review the annual supply quantities according to the latest estimate of our freshwater demand .  We will also seek to incorporate more flexible provisions into the agreement so that the quantities of raw water imported may be reduced in wet seasons and suitably increased in dry seasons .  
" Bacterial food poisoning is expected to rise , " he said .  " The major contributing factors in food poisoning are cross-contamination between raw food and cooked food , as well as inadequate cooking .  Dr Tsang said the incidence of acute conjunctivitis was low in the first half of this year .  
A large quantity of unmanifested cargoes included an optical disc production machinery , about 400 000 VCDs , raw plastic , medical equipment , fax machines , assorted electrical and computer components , and assorted vehicle parts were found concealed and beneath the scrap metal . 
The Wide Field of Plastics With active assistance of the government and continued efforts of businessmen , the plastics industry in Taiwan , though starting late , has developed very rapidly . Beginning with processing imported raw materials into daily necessities , then expanding to the current export of self-produced raw materials , its development has been beyond expectation . Plastics have become an important key to the economic development of the Republic of China .  
Today this new plant at Tung Hsiao produces 100,000 metric tons of high quality refined salt annually . About 130,000 metric tons of crude salt originally required as raw material for the manufacturing of refined salt will be saved annually to meet the pressing needs of rapidly growing industries .  
After several years of intensive work , Mr . Chuang eventually produced a machine which is faster , processing up to 110 pieces a minute , only one thirteenth the size of the imported models , and only requires a three-quarters of a horsepower engine to operate . The waste rate is also low , with 82 kilograms of peeled asparagus obtained from 100 kilograms of the raw material .  
Furthermore , hydraulic power has been exploited to the maximum in Taiwan already . Though there is great potential in the development of nuclear power , the sources of raw material are mainly overseas , and the radioactive residue is difficult to dispose of .  
Lin pointed out that as a precious Chinese cultural legacy , the art of flower arrangement was popular in the Sui and Tang dynasties ( 589-907 A . D . ) , when it was first introduced to Japan . Wild flowers and natural raw materials are endowed with new vitality when they are arranged artistically , giving an elegant and refined look to the most mundane surroundings .  
The earliest snuff bottles were made of five-colored glass . Later , all kinds of raw materials , including gold , jade and other precious stones , porcelain , bamboo and wood were used to create elaborate designs . Carving , painting and inlaying techniques were used to complete the process .  
Anyone who sees the raw material after it is imported into Taiwan will inevitably ask : " How can these ugly-looking , twisted vines be transformed into such outstanding furniture ? " At the Ye Fun plant , each piece is measured and placed in a different warehouse according to size .  
Fortunately , a few enlightened people noticed this weakness , and began to take their raw materials from everyday life as a means of enlightening audiences as well as entertaining them . In " He 's My Brother , " Koo Pao-min plays the part of a mentally and physically handicapped boy who is looked after by his elder brother .  
But the mainland has been isolated from the rest of the world for more than 30 years , and therefore is backward in industrial production . Its major exports are raw materials and labor-intensive products of low quality , while Taiwan exports semi-finished and finished products .  
Since the oil shock , the price of textile raw materials has skyrocketed , and meanwhile the people 's living standards were rising , resulting in higher labor costs . The developed countries protected their domestic textile industries with import quotas . Moreover , the ROC had been concentrating on the low-priced market . As such less-developed areas as the Philippines , India and Mainland China took advantage of very low labor costs and local resources , the competition grew .  
According to early records , the ling chiao was cultivated as a worship offering as early as Chou dynasty times ( 1122 B . C . ) . An aquatic plant , the ling chiao became a vital source of livelihood for those people dwelling in lake regions . The starchy , nutritious fruit became a food staple : cooked as congee , ground into a flour for cakes and eaten raw as a fruit .  
As for the international situation , the United States had already issued forth an official government report , and was prepared to cast aside Taiwan . As for the domestic situation , Taiwan had met up against a dire shortage of raw materials and inflation . Also , the Chinese Communists had their eyes set on Kinmen and Matsu , and were making strategic preparations to attack .  
It would be nice if Chinese living overseas could share more of what they have learned with each other , especially French cuisine , which is world famous - - I expect that French cooking is more attractive than jus cheese and salads . As for oysters , judging from my many years of experience work ing in a hospital , it 's best to eat them cooked instead of raw .  
Ilan author Li Tung writes feelingly : " Their acting may still be a bit raw and unpolished , and there are flaws in the continuity , but compared with the lackadaisical performance of some professional troupes that are stuck in a rut and never try anything new , their sincerity and concentration are all the more fresh and moving . "  
This company located in Kaohsiung originally made badminton racquet heads , whose main raw material is cork . Not only does cork have to be imported from abroad , it is even more troublesome to deal with the waste after the wood is processed .

" Starting from late 1994 , as the global economy recovered , demand increased greatly , and this brought sharp rises in the international prices of some agricultural and industrial raw materials , including petrochemical feedstocks , textile fibers , paper pulp , grains , basic metals and so on . Price rises in Taiwan are part of a global chain reaction , " says Liu Fang-jung , a specialist researching prices at the Council for Economic Planning and Development .  
Since 1993 , as part of a major government crackdown , the government has thus far closed down over 30 underground amphetamine laboratories . Nearly 14 tons of raw materials , finished products , and semi-finished products were uncovered . The industry 's history then repeated itself , only this time it was Taiwan drug manufacturers putting up the capital and providing the equipment and technology , as factories moved westward to coastal China ( especially Fujian ) . Goods produced there are either sold to Taiwanese businessmen or shipped out to Taiwan , Japan , and Korea .  
" In fact , Hong Kong 's intrinsic importance for Taiwan 's economy is not absolute . " C . J . Lee , director of the First Institute of the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research , points out that Hong Kong 's own manufacturing industry has almost all moved north , and naturally Taiwanese companies will not choose to set up factories in Hong Kong . Hong Kong is not a production base , and there are no key raw materials or components which can only be obtained from the colony .  
The desire of " civilized " humanity for material goods is insatiable . Man is also the only animal to have developed commerce . Ivory has been a common raw material since the earliest days of markets , and its consumption has grown continuously .  
No taste like home Old Confucius was not the only one who was partial to raw fish . Poet Zhang Han of the Western Jin ( 265-317 ) was appointed an official in the capital Luoyang . But when the autumn winds began to blow he was so overcome with nostalgia for the thick watershield soup and sliced raw sea bass of his native Suzhou that he said : " What matters most in life is to be content .  
These included " fish souls , " made from the lips cut from live sturgeon ; " Xi Shi 's bosom , " made with white fat from pufferfish bellies and named after a famous beauty ; and the " gold soup and jade slices " served by Mrs . Song outside Qiantang Gate , which comprised a thick wild rice stem soup and sliced raw common carp and crucian carp .  
However , to date the exchange center has not been able to balance demand with supply . Lin Chih-sen , a division chief at the IDB , comments that many raw materials derived from waste do not have the same level of purity as original feedstocks , and so do not meet manufacturers ' requirements . Hence the proportion of waste materials offered through the exchange center which are actually sold is very low-less than 10% .  
According to museum employee Lu Yu-hua , many people express surprise that there should be an entire museum devoted solely to paper , but when you really think about it , there 's really nothing strange about it . When paper was first invented , the raw materials from which it was made differed from one region to the next . A single sheet of paper spoke volumes about local climates and vegetation ; its very existence enabled the spread of knowledge , and could record the history of an individual or an entire nation !  
The MOEA promotes economic diplomacy in coordination with overall foreign policy . Concrete measures include the following : Based on the " Guidelines for Strengthening Economic and Trade Ties with Diplomatic Partner States in Latin America , " businesses are assisted in accessing agricultural or industrial raw materials , cheap labor , or land in Latin America , and are assisted in creating an international division of labor with Latin America and in penetrating North and South American markets .  
Many of this year 's award winners , including Piyouma , Wantan , and Wukou , are aboriginal or Hakka websites . Such communities have the innate advantages of rich non-mainstream traditional cultures , and can feature novel or unusual local customs . Therefore , these communities have more raw material to work with in constructing a website .  
President Chen has also instructed Taiwan 's financial and economic community that regardless of whether the US fights a quick or a protracted war , Taiwan must respond with flexibility by stabilizing the equity and currency markets and guaranteeing the supply of crude oil , agricultural raw materials , and staple commodities .  
All types of fish that can be eaten raw have a fairly high fat content , but the bluefin is particularly famed for its fattiness . The Pacific bluefin that migrate through the waters east of Taiwan prefer lower water temperatures than other tuna , and usually stay north of the 18th parallel . To protect it from cold the Pacific bluefin has more fat than the yellowfin and albacore , which are distributed around the equator , or the southern bluefin , which lives in the southern hemisphere .  
The impact of high technology goes deeper than that of the old crafts , or even of traditional industries such as textiles , papermaking , or iron and steel . Like them , high-tech industries create pollution , and treat nature no differently from lifeless raw materials . But the unpredictable stream of innovations thrown up by modern science has also created many new ethical issues .  
When Yang made his first trip to mainland China in 1989 , he never expected that CHM would become the professional preoccupation of the rest of his life . Traveling only to see the scenery , he incidentally discovered that major pharmaceuticals manufacturers from around the world had set up shop in the PRC , hoping to find buried treasure . That 's when he decided to go into the business of gathering , inspecting , and trading raw materials for CHM , and even cultivating basic sources of botanical pharmaceuticals .  
Yang once decided to grind pearl down to nano levels , and discovered that he had destroyed the amino acid , releasing a foul odor and ruining the raw material .  
The applications for refined CHM can be extended considerably . Already a number of manufacturers in Taiwan are adding raw materials from Kingstone to all kinds of products , including yogurt and ice cream . These raw materials can also be put to use in natural colorings and flavorings , edible fibers , cosmetic masks , bandages , and more . These uses are already common overseas , with the production value of such products increasing year in and year out , but in Taiwan there is still vast room for R &amp; D and promotion .  
There are records of the medicinal uses of alcohol in China even on ancient tortoise shells dating back to the Shang and Zhou dynasties . " Alcohol is a good natural solvent , enabling one to get a higher proportion of the therapeutic content out of the raw materials of Chinese medicine , " Chen Chun-che says .  
For one thing , he says , the raw material for lacquer ware is made from the sap of any of various species of lacquer tree and is poisonous in its natural form . Contact with the skin or ingestion will , in mild cases , cause swelling and extreme itchiness of the arms . Persons with a low tolerance level will experience general swelling and suffer from symptoms akin to poison ivy . If scratching leads to infection , the victim will puff up all over like a big balloon .  
While the raw lacquer is toxic , once it dries it is insoluble to all chemicals ; and its toxins are trapped inside . Thus there are no health worries , and lacquer ware is impervious to humidity , heat , acids , and alkalis . It is a natural insulator , and remains perfectly preserved even when buried underground for ages . Few other art objects can compare .  
They said that except the construction sector , most industries are recovering , and , in particular , the indices for the basic raw material industry and the chemical industry " are more positive " Even the sector of consumer 's goods , which has been under the pressure of low demands , showed signs of growing  
The economic crises in the developing world have been greatly aggravated : unemployment and economic stagnation have been compounded by persisting problems in international trade , by foreign debt and by falling prices for raw materials .  
Yet there are numerous exceptions : some enterprises are licensed and regulated ; some use imported raw materials ; some are owned by educated persons ; and some obtain a loan from a formal source of credit . 
The application of the widely advocated concept of good governance with less emphasis on traditional donor assistance is not impartial : it is very flexible and indulgent when it comes to countries with strategic raw materials , but strict and restrictive when it comes to others .  
By this I mean , for example , earmarking for the armed forces imposts on exports of raw materials such as oil or preferential treatment for businesses controlled or owned by the armed forces , which may also be stockholders in major public and private companies .  
It is estimated that a provision of $ 865,700 , reflecting growth of $ 41,000 , would be required for the acquisition of professional radio and television reference books and materials , and public information supplies such as film , raw stock , audio and video tapes and cassettes , photographic film , paper and chemicals and other miscellaneous materials required for radio and visual productions and supplies for the operation of the typesetting system .  
Further took note of the gradual shift of focus from pollution control and waste management to pollution prevention approaches in policies and programmes at the country level and bilateral and multilateral cooperation , and observed that this shift has resulted in the introduction of production patterns that emphasize the more efficient use of raw materials and energy , taking into account the capture and recycling of wastes and the better use of end-products of the productive system ;  
The raw images collected by optical sensors on board the satellites were corrected for radiometric and geometric distortions , in order to facilitate subsequent visual image interpretation or computer classification and to assure that they could be superposed on pre-existing maps as required , for example , in a GIS .  
The negative impacts of imports barriers by developed countries on the pace of forest-based industrialization in developing countries are not expected to lead to increased export of raw wood because of the many restrictions on raw wood exports imposed by most tropical timber exporting countries .  
The problem is that normally people living in areas with high potential biodiversity values are poorer and have less or no paying capacity compared with people in industrialized countries , where the value of biodiversity is often recognized , for example , as raw material for the pharmaceutical industry , or in terms of recreation for visitors . 
The collective goal of the former colonial Powers was to continue controlling the former colonies in order to guarantee a continuous flow of inexpensive raw materials and cheap labour while at the same time ensuring a stable market for goods from the industrially developed countries .  
In considering applications on a case-by-case basis , the Committee viewed as inappropriate requests to supply industrial equipment and raw materials , as well as horticultural produce , except fruits and vegetables , to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , unless such applications contained , in every case , specific explanations of how the commodities and products in question were intended to meet essential humanitarian needs ( see press release SC / 6118 ) .  
Developing countries ' growing leverage in the global trade system was based on raw economic power : they currently accounted for a quarter of world trade and , if current trends continued , this figure could reach 40 per cent by the year 2010 and over half by 2020 .  
At the same time , the reform process must assign special importance to measures and mechanisms designed to accelerate economic and social development , especially in Africa , by supporting domestic efforts at economic restructuring , diversification of raw materials and increased food security being carried out by the countries of the region . 
Increasing the value added to the processing of local raw materials ; the transformation of hides and skins into exportable leather products in eight eastern and southern African countries ; the manufacture of wood products in order to provide opportunities for the environmentally sustainable development of forest resources in seven western and central African countries ; the processing of spices and aromatic products in Zanzibar ; and the introduction of new techniques for the production of salt in the Plateau State of Nigeria ;  
This integration is of great benefit to national and foreign investors thanks to the country 's economic and other potential such as its geographical location , in relation to major regional markets , its transit role , its role as a supplier of hydroelectric power to neighbouring countries and export producer , using the country 's raw materials , and its innumerable natural tourist attractions .  
Information provided both by the Secretariat and by specialized agencies gives an objective quantitative picture of where the phenomena of poverty , unemployment and social disintegration are most acute : the same places experiencing an increased deterioration in the terms of trade ; protectionism ; a fall in the prices of exported raw materials ; and the drying up of financial flows .  
The people and Government of Jamaica have long recognized that small businesses , which incorporate small-scale enterprises , micro-enterprises and cooperatives , have the potential to create jobs , utilize local raw materials and involve large numbers of people in national decision-making and social and economic development .  
Those objectives are set out relative to the following five programme areas : ( a ) increasing the availability of food , feed and renewable raw materials ; ( b ) improving human health ; ( c ) enhancing protection of the environment ; ( d ) enhancing safety and developing international mechanisms for cooperation ; and ( e ) establishing enabling mechanisms for the development and environmentally sound application of biotechnology .  
The Penal Code lays down offences of an ecological nature , dealing , for example , with the unlawful destruction of raw materials , trees , agricultural or industrial products or means of production , such destruction being detrimental to national wealth or consumption , as well as with the protection of mammals or marine vertebrates and aquatic species .  
It was also recommended that the indicative list of criminal activities contained in article 1 of the draft framework convention should be supplemented with the following crimes : trafficking in illegal migrants ; extortion ; kidnapping ; cattle-rustling ; export of toxic wastes ; illicit export of precious raw materials ; trafficking in protected species ; international fraud ; sexual exploitation of children ; trafficking in human organs ; and violation of intellectual property rights .  
Changes in the sectoral composition of world output towards less commodity-intensive service sectors , combined with technological advances making for less raw material use per unit of output , appear to foreshadow a continuing long-run decline in the prices of primary commodities relative to those of manufactured goods .  
The recession had given rise to falling prices of raw materials and basic commodities , increased protectionism by the industrialized countries , the absence of a genuinely free transfer of technology , and a staggering rise in the external debt .  
Rapidly rising tariffs , from low rates for raw materials to higher rates for intermediate products and sometimes peak rates for finished industrial products , continue to hamper vertical diversification and industrialization in developing countries .  
Low conversion efficiency remains a problem in many developing countries ; however , gains in processing efficiency in many industrialized countries , coupled with increasing use of recovered or non-wood fibre in pulp and paper manufacture , have helped to moderate global demand for wood raw material from forests .  
Although demand for industrial wood raw material is expected to increase in the future , changes in the product mix and changes in production technology and sources of raw material are likely to provide opportunities for production increases consistent with constant ( or modestly increasing ) prices .  
However , the overemphasis on export-led growth , particularly on export agriculture and mineral extraction , merely reinforced the inherited colonial division of labour which condemned many developing nations to supplying raw materials to industrialized nations and trapped them into importing finished goods at much higher prices .  
Small businesses had the potential to create jobs , utilize local raw materials and scientific and technological expertise and involve large numbers of people in national decision-making and economic and social development .  
Ms . Cardoze ( Panama ) , speaking on behalf of the Rio Group , said that the consequences for the Rio Group region of the global financial crisis which had begun during the previous year had included a decrease of two percentage points in the growth rate of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) , a decline in imports and exports , particularly of raw materials and semi-manufactured products , an increase in the current account deficit and , in some cases , a decrease in international reserves .  
During the period of the United Nations Security Council sanctions , it was very difficult , or even impossible , for FRY to import medicaments , raw materials for medicaments , medical supplies , instruments and their spare parts , materials for personal protection of workers , measuring instruments and their spare parts , various chemicals which are required for various analyses in health care and micro-climate tests of working conditions , scientific and technical books , etc .  
Contributing factors to the marine environmental deterioration include oil exploration and exploitation , rapid economic growth , overfishing , physical alteration of the coastlines by dredging and filling , discharge of raw sewage , disposal of untreated industrial effluents , and dumping wasted oil and debris .  
One means of accomplishing this will be to disseminate , at the pace dictated by media deadlines , more live footage and quickly edited raw materials for television and radio in particular , including , where possible , audio-visual coverage of United Nations activities in major international developments in which the Organization is a principal player .  
Strengthening programme management capacity , including logistical systems , to make services safer , more affordable and more convenient and accessible to clients and to ensure the availability and continuous supply of safe and effective contraceptives and other sexual and reproductive health supplies and , as appropriate , the raw material for them ;  
Strengthening programme management capacity , including logistical systems , to make services safer , more affordable and more convenient and accessible to clients and to ensure the availability and continuous supply of safe and effective contraceptives and other sexual and reproductive health supplies and , as appropriate , the raw material for them ;  
An expert from a low-income country reported that the major objective of his country 's agricultural policy was to produce enough food grains and other agricultural commodities for direct consumption or for use as raw materials in agro-processing industries , and the problem for the country was not so much in terms of competition in the world market for exports but how to compete with cheap imports from outside , an excess inflow of which could be economically and socially destabilizing .  
Take note of and adopt sanctions against Rwanda and Uganda for the systematic pillaging of the raw materials of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , which is the real motive behind this invasion , contrary to the false pretext of security considerations which the two aggressor countries are flaunting in their vain , deliberate attempt to deceive the international community as to the real reasons for their criminal enterprise in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ;  
The region can no longer rely on cheap labour or raw materials for its structural transformation but rather must shift to improving the productivity of its labour , effectively transforming its static comparative advantages to dynamic competitive advantages .  
Fourth , the United Nations Development Programme must prepare studies on industrial projects for manufacturing basic commodities agricultural and mineral where Africa again would contribute raw materials and human resources , and the international investment firms would provide financing and technical know-how in a fair manner applied to all .  
If we really want to find effective and lasting solutions we can not overlook the fact that the roots of the current problems are found in the centuries of colonial exploitation during which African economies were looted and distorted in order to turn them into providers of natural resources , raw materials and cheap manpower at the cost of the annihilation and enslavement of tens of millions of people . 
A new potential is growing in certain developing countries as they become major foreign investors and major manufacturers and exporters in industries which now use textile fibres and raw materials previously imported from developed country industries .  
The vast , cheap labour pools of developing countries were being exploited , commodity prices were being manipulated in order to ensure a continued supply of cheap raw materials and the markets of developing countries were being pried open in the name of trade liberalization while the developed countries limited access to their own markets through various stratagems .  
Among the obstacles faced by developing countries were the current lack of infrastructure in the domestic and global economies and the instability of capital markets , the fall in the price of raw materials , debt burdens , lack of investment , uncontrolled exchange rates and social resistance .  
For many commodities exported by developing countries , there has also been substantial substitution by synthetic materials over the past two decades , while a shift away from traditional &amp; lt ; heavy = industries , such as iron and steel , has also limited the rate of expansion in demand for natural raw materials .  
The theme From farm to factory for a better future embodies my firm belief that Africa , with its endowment of diverse agricultural resources , most of which are industrial raw materials that could be transformed to provide adequate food for the peoples of Africa , could simultaneously improve agricultural productivity , as well as increase utilization of its manufacturing capacity for food security .  
The term primary data means those raw data that are acquired by remote sensors borne by a space object and that are transmitted or delivered to the ground from space by telemetry in the form of electromagnetic signals , by photographic film , magnetic tape or any other means ;  
Strengthening programme management capacity , including logistical systems , to make services safer , more affordable and more convenient and accessible to clients and to ensure the availability and continuous supply of safe and effective contraceptives and other sexual and reproductive health supplies and , as appropriate , the raw material for them ;  
While Africa has a rich natural resource endowment , which should give it the comparative advantage in becoming a major producer of industrial raw materials and manufactures , its potential remains largely untapped .  
Even with improved pumping capacity and disinfectant supply , the operational capacity of many ( and probably most ) treatment plants is simply inadequate to counter the level of bacterial contamination in the raw water intake .  
The first United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Vancouver , Canada , 1976 ) was supported by producing a statistical annex , h a set of derived measures combined with raw data , used for supporting the major findings and recommendations of the Conference .  
Urges all Governments to continue contributing to the maintenance of a balance between the licit supply of and demand for opiate raw materials for medical and scientific needs , the achievement of which would be facilitated by maintaining , in so far as their constitutional and legal systems permit , support to the traditional and legal supplier countries , and to cooperate in preventing the proliferation of sources of production of opiate raw materials ;  
The goal of sustainable development for all required that a solution be found to the debt problem of the developing countries , the liberalization of the trade polices of the industrialized countries be encouraged , especially in sectors of interest to the countries of the South such as agriculture and textiles , the prices for raw materials stabilized , development assistance increased and the transfer of technology promoted , so as to reduce the growing gap between North and South which was the greatest threat to the developing countries .  
In urging the Governments concerned to adjust global production of opiate raw materials to a level corresponding to actual licit needs and to avoid unforeseen imbalances between licit supply of and demand for opiates caused by the exportation of products manufactured from seized and confiscated drugs ;
