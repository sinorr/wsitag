Competition of this kind is a means to stimulate consumption as well as a necessary market mechanism to save efficient enterprises and eliminate the poor ones .  The reason why China 's home electrical appliance enterprises , such as color televisions , refrigerators , and washing machine enterprises , have been able to grab an overwhelmingly large domestic market share and in turn enter international markets is just the fierce price competitions a few years ago .  
Price cartel has drawbacks of monopoly - - it will mislead enterprises to escape competition and not to improve their efficiency , which has an adverse effect on improving enterprises ' management , upgrading their technology , saving efficient enterprises and eliminating poor ones , improving the overall quality of the entire industry , and on the overall development of the industry .

We also are determined to uphold the rule of law , the free market principles , clean and efficient government , sound and transparent regulations and prudent fiscal management , the hallmarks of our past success .  
We therefore believe the correct response lies on increased awareness of the public through education to protect themselves against deceptive and fraudulent activities than subjecting an otherwise long-established , effective and efficient market under unnecessary regulation . 
A stable and efficient debt market provides an effective avenue for Governments and enterprises to raise capital .  It is critical to the steady development of the financial industries as well as to the overall stability of the regional economies .

" We believe the overall approach of an auction based on royalty percentages and minimum guarantee payments already meets the objective of a fair and efficient licence allocation exercise .  It also achieves the aim of encouraging entry into the 3G market , taking into account the current situation in the telecommunications market .  " Although we believe that a balanced package has been proposed by Government , we do not have any in principle objection to the adoption of the ' fifth leaver ' rule as the primary objectives of the exercise have been achieved .  
We are of the view that our original proposal , i.e . the adoption of the " fourth leaver " rule in an auction based on bidding on royalty percentages and minimum guarantee payments , is a balanced arrangement .  Not only does it meet the policy to allocate the licences in a fair and efficient manner , but also achieve the aim of encouraging entry into the 3G market under the current conditions of the telecommunications market .

Hong Kong serves as the country 's premier port for foreign trade , handling 70% of the container cargo in southern China last year .  
While the system may not be perfect , it is fair to say that by and large , it has played an important role in the development of a clean , efficient , trustworthy and quality civil service in Hong Kong .  
As the top echelon of the Government , the new principal officials are expected to lead and contribute towards the building up of an efficient , professional , fair , clean and honest civil service .  
" Moreover , Hong Kong offers the conducive business environment and facilities to facilitate the development of the shipping industry .  These include a low tax regime , efficient banking services , excellent communications , modern infrastructures , a sound legal system , business-friendly policies , a clean and accountable civil service as well as a highly educated and skilled workforce , " she said .  
On better use of advanced technologies , Mr Tang said , " We have developed a comprehensive Intelligent Transport System ( ITS ) strategy which comprises two main elements - the Transport Information System ( TIS ) which provides a central database for easy and efficient access by Government departments , transport operators and the public ; and a Traffic Management Framework ( TMF ) which puts all existing traffic control functions under a coordinated central command . "  
Miss Willis said Hong Kong has remained true to its foundations of success : the rule of law underpinned by an independent judiciary ; a level playing field for business ; free flow of information ; a society which respects human rights and a clean , efficient and effective civil service despite the challenges faced in the past five years .  
A spokesman for the Commission on Youth ( COY ) today ( July 9 ) said : " Young people need continual trainings in all aspects , including leadership training , to become better equipped , more confident and capable in the face of challenges ; and we hope that by funding relevant bodies to organise leadership training activities , local youths can develop their potential as young leaders through systematic , efficient and active trainings . 
But we should never underestimate our strengths .  Our confidence stems from our distinct geographic advantage as well as the institutional assets we have developed over the years , including the rule of law , a free and open economy , a level playing field , an uncorrupt and efficient government and our enterprising people .  
The Government will strive to provide an institutional environment that is conducive to market development , in particular , to reinforce Hong Kong 's institutional strengths , such as the rule of law , a level playing field , clean government , free flow of information , a simple and low tax regime , and an efficient and effective market-regulatory system .  
" Much of our future success , like our past success , will depend on Hong Kong 's unchanging fundamentals : free flow of capital and information , an independent judiciary based on the rule of law , clean and efficient government , and a simple and low tax regime .  Add to this , no exchange controls , transparent regulation and state-of-the-art telecommunications , " Mr Ma said .  
Mr Leung said that Hong Kong must maintain its institutional strengths , the unique advantage it has over its neighbouring cities .  These strengths are the rule of law , a level playing field , the free flow of information , a low and simple tax regime , and a clean and efficient government .

He said : " The figure shows that disciplined grade staff who have joined the civil service on or after June 1 , 2000 have progressively been transferred to permanent terms upon the completion of a three-year probationary period provided they could achieve continued satisfactory conduct and efficient performance of work and maintain continued physical fitness .  
In addition , Hong Kong has many competitive advantages , including our rule of law ; free flow of capital , people and information ; a level playing field ; a cosmopolitan lifestyle ; a transparent and efficient government ; international standards and practices of doing business ; and the list goes on and on .  
Hong Kong has always been the world 's freest economy .  It has built up sound market mechanisms and its goodwill is recognised internationally .  We have robust legal institutions , legislation to protect intellectual property , an efficient and transparent government , and a business community with a well-earned reputation for fulfilling its contractual obligations .  
Additionally , Hong Kong has many comparative advantages , including our rule of law ; free flow of capital , goods and information ; a level playing field ; a cosmopolitan lifestyle ; a transparent and efficient government ; international standards and practices of doing business ; and the list goes on and on .  
The Chief Executive , Mr Tung Chee Hwa , accompanied by the Secretary for the Civil Service , Mr Joseph W P Wong , met representatives from major civil service unions and departmental consultative committees today ( September 24 ) .  During the meeting , Mr Tung said that he had always regarded civil servants as the most important asset of the Special Administrative Region ( SAR ) Government , and took pride in being surrounded by a world-class team of professional and efficient civil servants .  
" Hong Kong 's success is also buttressed by a sound institutional framework - the rule of law upheld by an independent judiciary , a level playing field for business , the free flow of information , and a clean , efficient Administration " , said the Financial Secretary .  
As a matter of fact , Hong Kong 's excellent business environment , simple and low tax regime , cosmopolitan lifestyle , superb geographical location , free economy , rule of law , skilled workforce with international vision , world class infrastructure as well as efficient and clean government are factors attracting many overseas multi-national corporations to set up their regional headquarters or offices in Hong Kong .  
Covering an area of 163 kilometers on the western coastal plain , Taichung 's location has aided economic development of the city . Taichung 's harbor and verdant outlying fields provide fresh fish and produce for busy city markets , and both the city and surrounding area are served by an efficient network of roads and railways , linking Taichung to centers in the north and south of Taiwan .  
Development of National EducationOur educational system has endowed the general public with the ancient Greek ideal of a healthy mind in a healthy body . This has produced a source of efficient manpower , and it points out the future direction which national education should take .  
Huang says that Stan Lai is super efficient at moving the work along . He constantly revises the plot that developed out of rehearsal from the day before and constantly inspires the actors with fresh interest . He 's adept at encouraging them and giving them hope when they 're stuck .  
The great air pollution killer - - the motor vehicle : " Development of an electric car is an inevitable global trend , " contends Yang . Whether it be from the point of view of efficient use of resources or from that of environmental protection , the electric vehicle is one of the most effective ways to resolve current pollution problems .  
He explains that the animal world , because of the proliferation of varieties , must be rigidly economical with resources and efficient in distribution . During cloudy weather , therefore , ever-teeming honey bees can only consume foodstuff stored in the hive ; lacking provisions of pollen , their mood naturally turns less benevolent . " They lose their temper " and attack people . " I can understand their emotional disposition , " he says .  
Briton Dennis Casey , managing director of drugstore chain Watson 's The Chemist Taiwan , and a long-time resident in the Asia-Pacific region , observes that a few years ago prices in Taiwan were almost as high as in Japan . But with the fast opening of Taiwan 's markets and free competition , " the most efficient and modern international retailers are all setting up in Taiwan , bringing with them their international experience and vision , and seeking out low - price , high-quality products from all over the world to supply to local consumers . "  
These figures suggest citizens ' ability to separate the individual from the issue at stake and to be both hard-headed and sympathetic . This again reminds us that freedom and democracy are our most precious assets , and that open debate creates an informed electorate . We look forward to the people nudging the government and society to be ever-more efficient and competitive .  
Her main hope now is revise the laws to meet the demands of the times , so that executive agencies can be more efficient . Film is another industry " guided " by the GIO . Though not as complex as the broadcast industry , it has its headaches as well , especially the poor economic returns on domestic films .  
It 's just that state firms often are less efficient than private ones because they have three burdens to bear : implementing state policies based on non-economic concerns , accepting legal restraints and interference from government agencies , and the human failing of usually performing public tasks more poorly than those involving private profit . Thus people often are dismayed with state firms .  
Most SREs are involved in activities intimately related to daily life , and are the foundation for national economic development . They may well be making huge surpluses-last year Chunghwa Telecom took in NT $ 49 billion in profits , CPC and Taipower more than NT $ 10 billion each-but that does n't mean they have been efficient . They have many shortcomings compared to similar service-providers abroad .  
Setting up in a foreign country was no easy task , particularly given that before BMI was established , the Bank of Hawaii and the Bank of Guam had already divided up the local financial market between them . Because the local savings rate was low but the borrowing rate was high , Chen decided that the only way to gain the upper hand as a latecomer was to offer more efficient lending operations .  
Many non-flowering aquatic plants propagate through asexual reproduction , which is arguably more efficient than the process employed by terrestrial plants . It is common to think of flowering plants as more advanced , but in Yen 's view , " Maybe plants that can reproduce without going through that process are actually the most advanced from an evolutionary standpoint . "  
As Lo says , " The ROC must move in the direction of flexible diplomacy and utilize foreign policy resources more flexibly . " In the future , overseas offices of the ROC will undertake functional integration at the continental level , with different locations having different specialties , such as overseas Chinese affairs , political affairs , and media relations . All the offices in a particular region will be linked into a single , more efficient , and more richly endowed cooperative group .  
Chen Chung believes that the small cultivated plots of traditional farming make it difficult to use efficient , labor-saving technologies and thus hinder competitiveness in international markets . The usual remedy for this has been even further exploitation of the land , and as Chen Chung points out with a pained expression , " the result was heavy use of pesticides and fertilizers , increased soil depletion , and environmental pollution . "  
" While the adjustments may be difficult for a time , these crises will pass , " he said , stressing that " stronger individual economies and a more robust and efficient international economic and financial system will surely emerge in their wake "  
To be efficient , public expenditure planning needs a coherent macroeconomic framework in which the institutional capability is shared between the ministries of finance and planning , the central bank and the statistical office .  
On the contrary , a security system must be established that ensures the fiscal integrity of all persons , individual initiative and the inviolability of private property , through a stable monetary system and efficient public services .  
Mining and investment institutions are attracted to jurisdictions where the rules are simple and complete , the bureaucracy is efficient , mineral tenure is secure , and the general positioning of the mineral resource is competitive on a worldwide scale .  
The interconnection between the effective functioning of the political system , in a lawful and efficient manner , and the maintenance of human rights is a crucial matter on which the democratic future of El Salvador largely depends .  
Indeed , after a long period of conservative and incremental technical change , alternative process routes for mineral production are being developed and these are emerging as economically more efficient as well as environmentally less hazardous .  
Developing an effective and efficient environmental health information system to collect and disseminate national , regional and international information on newly emerging environmental health problems by 1997 .  
Programmes for disadvantaged or vulnerable groups , in addition to reflecting a true understanding of the underlying problems of each group , must pass the test of being both equitable and efficient .  
Developing an effective and efficient environmental health information system to collect and disseminate national , regional and international information on newly emerging environmental health problems by 1997 .  
To enable national and local governments to achieve responsive , participatory administration , efficient service delivery , effective transport provisions , adequate access to open space and recreational facilities , and healthy environments ;  
In his statement , the SecretaryGeneral laid down his views on an effective human resource management system that could meet the challenges of the changing world situation with an efficient , dynamic and representative international civil service . 
This involves promoting the conditions for a strong and an efficient civil service capable of meeting the challenges posed by national economic development and the specific conditions of the world economy .  
The rational and efficient administration of macroeconomic and sectoral policies , as well as the application of clear , relevant and consistent rules , are indispensable prerequisites for achieving and maintaining economic and social stability .  
The first involved more efficient prevention , especially to address the problems of victims of internal conflicts , actual or potential victims of the situation in States that have recently emerged from authoritarian rule , and citizens of developing countries in flight from inhuman poverty or socio-economic instability .  
Emphasis has also been placed on the reform of the public sector and the provision of basic infrastructure in order to ensure the efficient delivery of reliable , high-quality services , the progressive restructuring of our educational system so as to put in place a sustainable human-resource development programme which would respond to the new challenges and needs of our development , and the employment of social policies aimed at protecting the most vulnerable in our society .  
While we seek to put in place all the necessary measures to ensure the efficient and effective management of our domestic affairs , we strongly urge multilateral institutions to include in these models for development a component that provides skills training and , in particular , training in the use of technologies to enable young people to find productive employment in the private sector and to facilitate the process towards equitable social and economic development .  
The affirmation of human dignity and the universal rights of the individual upheld by the Charter of the United Nations can be achieved only through respect for different ethnic , religious , cultural and political identities , through an efficient system of collective security , and through respect for a law-governed State and international law .  
Our Government is fully convinced that if we are to enjoy sustained medium - and long-term growth it must be based on an efficient and competitive productive sector , both domestically and internationally , and to that end we have adopted the requisite economic policy measures .  
This universality of the Organization can naturally put tremendous resources at its disposal to facilitate the achievement of the principles and objectives of the United Nations Charter , particularly the maintenance of international peace and security , the promotion of economic and social development , justice and mutual cooperation , and place it in a better position to deal with emerging challenges in a more efficient and distinguished fashion .  
The changes of the last decade in economic and political conditions and new consensuses reached during the recent series of conferences offer a unique opportunity to develop an intensified , strengthened and more realistic approach to such cooperation , but the opportunity may go to waste if we fail to shape a more efficient , creative and forward-looking United Nations . 
The adoption and future implementation of the prototype for the new format of the medium-term plan for the period 1998 to 2001 , the introduction of a transparent and efficient system of accountability and responsibility , and the decentralization of regional economic commissions and of social and economic activities : all these are reform measures that foster administrative and financial efficiency in the Organization in the economic and social spheres .  
The potential contribution of improved efficiency in meeting growing needs for energy services in a sustainable way in the rural areas of developing countries can be substantial , especially at the point of end use , by introducing new , efficient , low-polluting technologies and systems and by upgrading existing , inefficient systems .  
Develop and disseminate to farming households integrated farm management technologies , such as crop rotation , organic manuring and other techniques involving reduced use of agricultural chemicals , multiple techniques for sources of nutrients and the efficient utilization of external inputs , while enhancing techniques for waste and by-product utilization and prevention of pre - and post-harvest losses , taking particular note of the role of women ;  
Develop and make widely available new and improved vaccines against major communicable diseases that are efficient and safe and offer protection with a minimum number of doses , including intensifying efforts directed at the vaccines needed to combat common diseases of children ;  
Implementing macroeconomic and microeconomic policies in accordance with national priorities and policies , aimed at encouraging greater domestic savings and investment required for public spending , through progressive , fair and economically efficient taxes which are cognizant of sustainable development concerns , and through cutting back on subsidies that do not benefit the poor ;  
Urges the multilateral financial institutions , recipient countries and donor countries , within the conceptual framework and design and implementation of structural adjustment policies in Africa , to pay special attention to eradicating poverty and addressing the social impact of these policies , while focusing on public investment , fiscal reform , reform of public enterprises , export expansion and efficient public administration ;  
At the Paris ceremony , AfDB committed itself to play an active part in implementing the Convention , in line with the important role assigned to it under the provisions of the Convention , particularly in terms of integrated activities in key areas such as improving national economic environments , the sustainable use of natural resources , efficient energy use , capacity-building and sensitization .  
It holds promise for increasing the yield , quality , efficient processing and utilization of products ; for decreasing reliance on agro-chemicals and other external inputs ; and for improving the conservation and use of genetic and other natural resources .  
She endorsed the view expressed in the commentary that the principle of optimal utilization did not necessarily mean the " maximum " use of a watercourse , but the most economically feasible and , if possible , the most efficient one , since an international watercourse was not an inexhaustible natural resource .  
The report recommended four main areas of future focus at the macro level : advising on social objectives and the efficient handling of the economy ; creating productive employment ; revamping the agriculture sector ; and strengthening the national database to measure social progress .  
Reiterates the importance of ensuring access , for all persons seeking international protection , to fair and efficient procedures for the determination of refugee status or , as appropriate , to other mechanisms to ensure that persons in need of international protection are identified and granted such protection , while not diminishing the protection afforded to refugees under the terms of the 1951 Convention , the 1967 Protocol and relevant regional instruments ;  
Stressing the importance of trade as a major instrument of economic growth and sustainable development for all countries , in particular developing countries and the need to find solutions to microeconomic issues of international trade which can significantly contribute to more open , dynamic and efficient trade relations ,  
While it always favoured efficient use of scarce resources , her delegation believed that the modest additional net resources proposed were justified by an increase in workload which could not be handled within existing resources .  
The benefits expected of joint implementation are to be seen , inter alia , in an intensified transfer of capital , investments , technology and know-how with positive impetus to the development process in the countries involved , under the condition that joint implementation activities are in line with national development priorities and strategies , and in a more efficient use of scarce resources to reduce anthropogenic GHG emissions worldwide .  
The underlying philosophy surrounding the use of economic instruments in contrast to that of the traditional regulatory approach , is that economic instruments based on implementing the Polluter Pays Principle use market signals for influencing the behaviour of economic agents , and are efficient in achieving environmental targets , in particular when they are used to complement systems of environmental standards and regulations . 
Together with the constitutional and legislative reforms established by the peace agreements , the creation of a new and efficient system for the administration of justice calls for the programming and implementation of measures to modernize and raise the professional standards of the judiciary , which , in keeping with the new democratic legality that supports it , would make it possible for new judicial practices to become firmly entrenched . 
Taking into account the main development objectives established by the Territory 's Executive Council , namely , the improved management of the economy through a more efficient public sector , the strategic development of human resources through the reform of the educational and training systems , and the development of integrated policies of physical infrastructural improvements , as well as the preservation of the natural environment ,  
The ultimate goal is to enhance the image of the United Nations as an efficient and effective organization capable of making a substantial contribution to international understanding on a wide variety of issues and meeting the challenges posed by a rapidly changing international environment .  
This entails the need for modernized institutional mechanisms and processes to enable Governments to respond effectively to the complex and changing needs of societies , including demands for viable economic growth , efficient integration of social and economic policies and greater responsiveness and participatory processes .  
Further took note of the gradual shift of focus from pollution control and waste management to pollution prevention approaches in policies and programmes at the country level and bilateral and multilateral cooperation , and observed that this shift has resulted in the introduction of production patterns that emphasize the more efficient use of raw materials and energy , taking into account the capture and recycling of wastes and the better use of end-products of the productive system ;  
The adoption of General Assembly resolution 49 / 139 B , in the light of the growing demands for manpower and funds to mitigate the suffering and destruction caused by numerous emergencies , represents an innovative opportunity for the effective , efficient and economical provision of assistance to the intended beneficiaries of the United Nations system 's operations , tapping existing but as yet unstructured and therefore unrealized sources of volunteer expertise .  
However , when improvement of policy development is the main goal of administrative and political reforms , to be effective and efficient in utilizing scarce improvement resources , improvement endeavour should focus on key variables exerting a major impact on the quality of policy development dealing with critical future-influencing issues and domains .  
Viewing the public service as a critical agent of change , the Programme aims to rebuild a public service that is the servant of the people : accessible , accountable , efficient , free of corruption , and providing excellent quality .  
The public service is defined as an institution that should be professional ; career-oriented ; non-partisan ; efficient , effective and responsive in terms of service delivery ; loyal in its service to the public and the elected Government of the day ; accountable to the public and Parliament .  
In modern management , it has been clearly demonstrated that private and public organizations that achieve excellence do not do so through a detailed , formal restructuring but , rather , inter alia , by developing the capacity to identify an agenda of key decisions , networking , involving staff , making innovations , enhancing flexibility , implementing efficient image-creation policies , improving relations with the media and developing leadership aptitudes to cope with complexity .  
In this context of social , economic , and political change , the United Nations is re-examining the relationship between public administration and development in order to fashion more effective and efficient means of delivering technical assistance to developing countries in the service of world peace .  
In this regard , the ultimate goal is articulated to be the provision of a sustainable , efficient , profitable , readily differentiated and significantly higher quality service to the travelling and cargo-shipping communities at reasonable rates .  
In this context , special emphasis should be placed on ensuring that international financial institutions make the most effective use of existing financing facilities and establish additional ones , attracting capital investments in conditions of respect for the domestic legislation of each country and using efficient energy technologies mainly to support the execution of the projects that are necessary for our region in this sector .  
While energies have to be focused and action planned in the best and most efficient manner , the ultimate goals of effectively preventing and controlling organized transnational crime in all its forms and dimensions , and arresting its expansion at both the national and international levels , should be guiding the relevant efforts and should constitute the yardstick against which success is to be assessed .  
Furthermore , with the assistance of the United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) , a national transport policy framework has been drafted , which aims at developing a coordinated transport system , in a market-oriented approach , and a sound base for the various carriers to provide reliable , efficient and economic services to the people .

NULLWhatever the level of domestic savings and however large or small the net transfer of foreign savings , there is legitimate concern to ensure that those savings are allocated to investment in developing countries in a manner that is efficient and desirable in the social , political and developmental senses .  
An effective government planning mechanism is essential if necessary social investment - especially for human-resource development - is to be well designed , and is even more essential for efficient government guidance of the investment process in those countries that choose to have activist industrial , agricultural or other sectoral policies .  
It was noted that the effect of sound and efficient policies at the micro-economic level as well as the impact on individual and small group initiatives can be blunted by inconsistent or unbalanced macroeconomic policies .  
Iraq 's cooperation , including the provision of accurate information and supporting documentation , access to personnel involved in the relevant activities and support of the Commission 's inspection and monitoring efforts will be required , on a continuous basis , in order to enable the Commission to achieve this objective in a speedy and efficient manner .  
The Secretary-General supports this approach , which should be aimed at enhancing the flexibility and adaptability of the United Nations in the performance of its functions and its ability to address the most urgent tasks and new demands , as well as to ensure an efficient and effective United Nations system capable of dealing with the growing number of global challenges in the economic , social and related fields . 
In line with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , measures are being taken to make the human rights machinery : ( a ) more effective and cost efficient ; ( b ) able to act swiftly and to respond appropriately to human rights situations ; ( c ) stronger , through international cooperation in the field of human rights , based on mutual confidence ; and ( d ) more transparent and understandable to the outside world .  
For example , a cooperative program was undertaken examining commercial cotton fields in the San Joaquin Valley of California , aimed at developing integrated tools to produce crops that maximize economic return , support efficient use of natural resources , and minimize detrimental impacts on the environment .  
Those areas included ensuring the continuity of remote sensing data from satellite operators , technical assistance in the implementation and operation of ground stations , price reductions and easier access to data , provision of training and education for efficient and timely data processing and analysis , and increased efforts in the coordination of programmes and projects between national , regional and international aid agencies .  
The reform seeks to introduce a professionalized and efficient first-level appeal system to replace the current volunteer system which , in an era of increasing management accountability for programme delivery coupled with declining resources and an increasing number of cases , makes it difficult to attract sufficient experienced and qualified staff to discharge these vital functions .  
States , as the principal actors in the realization of the right to development , should guarantee the exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms , strengthen democracy and ensure an honest and transparent public administration and an efficient and impartial administration of justice .  
The spread of conflicts and the magnitude of the humanitarian consequences are such as to require the international community to conduct an objective and responsible evaluation and take vigorous and efficient measures to end the spiral of armed conflicts and create conditions for peace and security without which the universal realization of the right to development will be little more than a good intention . 
reorganization is reflected in the budgetary proposals for 1996 and concerns the expansion of the Strategy Team in the Investigation Section , a complete reorganization of the former Special Advisory Section into a new Legal Services Section and the provision of additional resources to the Information and Records Section to enable the efficient and timely processing of the huge amount of information , evidence and other material received by the Office so that it is accessible to the investigative and prosecutorial staff in the Office .

motivated , competent , efficient , responsible and accountable staff team constituted the basis for the proper functioning of the organization and for achieving its objectives .  
A stable legal framework , fair and efficient law enforcement and equal access to public services and justice , in accordance with international standards of human rights , are essential conditions for the creation of transparent and accountable institutions , for the promotion of a public administration that is responsive to the needs of the population and for the prevention of and fight against all forms of corruption .  
It also involves injecting new capital from the private sector , either domestic or foreign , into national public enterprises through an innovative , efficient capitalization and administration plan , in collaboration with strategic private partners .  
In the context of globalization and integration in which our countries are evolving , Governments are bound to assume a much more active role in helping to create efficient and competitive environments in our economies , thus enabling us to improve the standards of living of our peoples and contributing to the resolute head-on fight against corruption and impunity at the national and international levels . 
Among the objectives of the audit are the necessary refocusing of the administration on its essential tasks ; the organization and establishment of well-adapted structures and flexible procedures to carry out these tasks ; and the establishment of adequate resources , both material and human , for the effective and efficient functioning of the administration .  
There may be merit in some of these assertions , but this is only correct when the public sector is not well trained ; when its size can not be justified on the output and quality of services offered ; or when the policies it delivers run counter to the accumulation of national wealth , efficient delivery of social services or administration of justice .  
They are also aimed at creating a lean , efficient , highly motivated and dutiful civil service , based on the job requirements and carefully evaluated professional requirements of each Ministry and public institution .  
Joint action in the field of crime prevention and the elimination of international terrorism envisages closer cooperation between central , regional and border authorities through efficient communications and exchange of information ; a commitment to accede to all relevant international conventions that prevent and punish international crime and terrorism ; joining and participation in specialized regional forums for discussing the problems of illicit drug-trafficking , organized crime and regional anti-terrorist cooperation ; and the elaboration of a regional programme to combat organized crime .  
The total elimination of all existing nuclear weapons , as an indispensable step towards general and complete disarmament under strict and efficient international control , is the demand of the entire Non-Aligned Movement , to which we fully subscribe . 
We believe that the main focus for the 20 / 20 initiative should be the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and disadvantaged and other vulnerable sectors of our society . 
In this respect , my delegation wishes to express its appreciation to the Governments of Norway and the Netherlands for the meeting held at Oslo last April to review the implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative , which was enunciated in the Copenhagen Programme of Action , and which aims to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and vulnerable in the developing world through a partnership between developed and developing countries . 
While there is no substitute for efficient national systems for accounting and control , especially in those countries possessing sensitive nuclear material , in preventing illicit trafficking , we recognize the crucial role the Agency can play in information-sharing and in identifying the sources of stolen material .  
We commend the commitments made at national level to the implementation of relevant recommendations through , inter alia , the effective mobilization and efficient utilization of domestic resources and through increased allocation of resources to the social sector .  
Examples of this trend are the free elections that have been held in recent years elections that were open , competitive and fair ; the respect for existing legislation ; the creation of constitutional courts and the appointment of special prosecutors for human rights ; the existence of independent electoral tribunals and multi-party parliaments ; the promotion of autonomous and efficient judicial systems and the development of programmes to promote a culture of peace and democracy .  
President , I have long admired the imagination and determination you have brought to the difficult challenges of multilateral diplomacy , and I should like to express my appreciation for the leadership you have demonstrated in taking the General Assembly through its demanding schedule to an efficient and productive conclusion .  
The system complements operational early warning systems for food security in eastern and southern Africa by providing fast and efficient data distribution capacity for environmental satellite data produced by the ARTEMIS system of FAO at Rome .  
A much-needed increase in productivity of rural areas of developing countries , in terms of agricultural output and processing , would require supplies of efficient , modern fuels for mechanized agriculture , rural transport and operating of essential tools and machineries . 
Although the potential biomass resource base is immense and dedicated energy crops could add significantly to that resource base , modern , efficient use of biomass remains to be promoted and applied ; a small increase in the efficiency of burning fuelwood would have noticeable effects on carbon and particulate emissions .  
Bildt was invited to meet the NAC on 17 January where he acknowledged the efficient deployment of IFOR and the adequacy of the Peace Agreement structures , outlined the important civilian tasks ahead and emphasized that reconciliation between all the parties was the key to a stable and lasting peace .  
RIESCO ( Director of Conference Services ) , reporting on the technical and financial implications of the proposal by the representative of the Netherlands that the Committee should rationalize its work by scheduling four two-hour meetings daily , beginning at 9 a.m . , 11 a.m . , 2 p.m . and 4 p.m . , said that , while the Secretariat would be ready to provide conference services to accommodate whatever schedule would be most productive for the Committee 's work , the proposal raised a number of issues relating to the efficient use of resources .  
In line with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , measures are being taken to make the human rights machinery : ( a ) more effective and cost efficient ; ( b ) able to act swiftly and to respond appropriately to human rights situations ; ( c ) stronger , through international cooperation in the field of human rights , based on mutual confidence ; and ( d ) more transparent and understandable to the outside world .  
Reiterates the importance of ensuring access , for all persons seeking international protection , to fair and efficient procedures for the determination of refugee status or , as appropriate , to other mechanisms to ensure that persons in need of international protection are identified and granted such protection , while not diminishing the protection afforded to refugees under the terms of the 1951 Convention , the 1967 Protocol and relevant regional instruments ;

Because of our very strong fiscal reserves of HK $ 450 billion - ladies and gentlemen , the government has no debt - and with a budget surplus of 5.8% of our GDP in the current year , we are able to , through the budget recently announced for this year , continue with our massive plan of investment in infrastructure and education which will make Hong Kong much more efficient and competitive in the 21st Century . 
Furthermore , there are the rule of law , a low and predictable tax regime , an efficient and honest civil service , free flow of information and an efficient and sound financial system .  
Because of our very strong fiscal reserves of HK $ 450 billion ( A $ 100 billion ) - the Government has no debt - and with a budget surplus of 5.8 per cent of our GDP in the past year , we are able to , through the budget announced in February this year , continue with our massive plan of investment in infrastructure and education which will make Hong Kong much more efficient and competitive in the 21st Century . 
The challenge ahead is to promote shared growth , to forestall future crises , and to design a new international financial architecture that promotes resilient financial systems , efficient global resource allocation and a level playing field .  
Mr Kwong noted that harmonisation of internal codes for Chinese characters was not enough .  Equally important issues that demanded immediate attention included the provision of more sophisticated and user-friendly conversion tools capable of supporting the use of traditional and simplified Chinese characters ; the development of an efficient and effective mechanism for searching and retrieving information in either traditional and simplified Chinese characters on the Internet ; and above all the provision of content in Chinese .  
We also are determined to uphold the rule of law , the free market principles , clean and efficient government , sound and transparent regulations and prudent fiscal management , the hallmarks of our past success .  
We therefore believe the correct response lies on increased awareness of the public through education to protect themselves against deceptive and fraudulent activities than subjecting an otherwise long-established , effective and efficient market under unnecessary regulation . 
A stable and efficient debt market provides an effective avenue for Governments and enterprises to raise capital .  It is critical to the steady development of the financial industries as well as to the overall stability of the regional economies .  
More importantly , Hong Kong 's edge over the other East Asian economies has been underpinned by a host of other factors , such as a good quality labour force , a low and simple taxation system , a stable government , a corruption free society , an efficient transport and telecommunications infrastructure , sound legal and regulatory systems , free flow of information , and most important of all , a huge and rapidly growing hinterland just to the north of Hong Kong , " Mr Tsang said .  
" Hong Kong , with its huge cargo base , comprehensive and efficient links with the Mainland and the outside world , and excellent supporting services , is ideally located to organise the logistics for the numerous manufacturing plants and factories in the Pearl River Delta and the region .  
Hong Kong 's economic fundamentals remain strong .  These include , inter alia , the Mainland as our economic hinterland , robust financial and banking systems , a huge foreign exchange reserve , a sound legal system , a simple tax system with low tax rates , a clean government and efficient transport and communications facilities .  All these factors contribute towards the maintenance of our competitiveness .  
However , as the new millennium unfolds and in order to meet the many new challenges which Hong Kong now faces , we are also making a determined effort in civil service reform .  Our objective is to make our civil service even more efficient , accountable and responsive to changing needs .  
Citing the MTRC and Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation ( KCRC ) which are wholly government owned but operated as separate commercial entities , Mr Tsang pointed out that the two corporations had easily achieved their primary goal to provide Hong Kong with efficient , modern , affordable and profitable railway transport .

Given the advanced development of forensic analysis , it is now possible to take a buccal swab ( being a non-intimate sample ) to obtain a buccal cell sample by wiping a swab along the inside of the cheek part of the mouth of a person which is sufficient for analysing the DNA profile of that person .  This method is quick , efficient and the degree of interference is low .  
On the promotion of efficient functioning of global markets , Mr Trichet said that full and reliable transparency for all , including both public and private sector entities , would be the most effective measure for countering dangers arising from the " herd instinct " of market participants .  
The Government remains firmly committed to maintaining the rule of law , efficient public administration , prudent fiscal policy , simple tax system with low tax rate , sound financial system , first-class infrastructure and sophisticated support services , so as to preserve and wherever possible lift further Hong Kong 's competitive position in the world .  
The latter is necessary for the efficient and effective future management of the projects , and for a continuous development of their respective area to keep up with the dynamic and competitive global environment , " he added .  
MTRC was established in 1975 as a wholly government-owned statutory corporation .  Over the years , government equity has helped propel the expansion of the MTR network .  Operating on prudent commercial principles , MTRC has developed into a highly efficient and successful organisation , providing a world-class railway service that is the envy of the world .  The original objectives of 100 per cent government ownership are no longer relevant .  
" Through ESD , members of the public will be able to obtain efficient and quality services securely and in a seamless manner through a single common interface at places and time convenient to them , and at no additional cost .  
These initiatives include lowering the Overall Thermal Transfer Value requirement on new commercial and hotel buildings , improving the energy efficiency of existing public buildings through energy audit surveys and retrofitting them with energy efficient equipment , expanding the existing voluntary Energy Efficiency Labelling Schemes to more electrical appliances and introducing new labels for office equipment starting from 2001 , and promoting gradual conversion of existing air-cooled air conditioning systems to water-cooled air conditioning systems in non-domestic buildings starting from 2002-2003 .  
Accordingly , to provide a safe , efficient and reliable transport system that meets the economic , social and recreational needs of Hong Kong in an environmentally acceptable manner , the Administration aims to provide better integration of transport and land use planning , better use of railways as the back-bone of our passenger transport system , and better use of advanced technologies in transport management and emission reduction from vehicles .  
We have one of the best ports , airports and mass transit systems in the world .  We have some of the world 's most efficient and cost-effective communication systems and one of the highest concentration of mobile telephones .

We are committed to maintaining monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong ; improving the regulatory framework ; and enhancing the infrastructure required for an international financial centre and providing an appropriate environment for an open , fair and efficient market ; and spearheading the further development of the financial markets .  
" Hong Kong is experienced in international capital financing and able to provide a wide variety of financial services .  Our efficient market and monitoring mechanism as well as prudent banking sector can provide effective capital financing services to the western region .  
Hong Kong 's market mechanism is well aligned with the world system .  The regulation of financial businesses such as banking , insurance and securities is efficient .  Professional services such as legal services , accounting and consultancy are well established .  The external networking such as trade , communication and transportation is also properly set up .  
Our well-established policy is to provide a favourable environment for business from a macro perspective , including first-rate infrastructure , quality human resources , a sound legal system , a fair competitive environment and efficient government services , etc .

" The pre-qualification exercise will ensure that all applicants will meet a minimum standard of investment , network rollout and financial capability while spectrum auction is an allocation process that is efficient , fair and transparent , " he stressed .  
Hong Kong also provides comprehensive supporting facilities .  These include well developed port facilities and land transport , a sound legal system firmly rooted in the common law tradition , excellent financing and e-commerce support as well as highly efficient customs services .  
" We believe the overall approach of an auction based on royalty percentages and minimum guarantee payments already meets the objective of a fair and efficient licence allocation exercise .  It also achieves the aim of encouraging entry into the 3G market , taking into account the current situation in the telecommunications market .  " Although we believe that a balanced package has been proposed by Government , we do not have any in principle objection to the adoption of the ' fifth leaver ' rule as the primary objectives of the exercise have been achieved .  
We are of the view that our original proposal , i.e . the adoption of the " fourth leaver " rule in an auction based on bidding on royalty percentages and minimum guarantee payments , is a balanced arrangement .  Not only does it meet the policy to allocate the licences in a fair and efficient manner , but also achieve the aim of encouraging entry into the 3G market under the current conditions of the telecommunications market .

Hong Kong serves as the country 's premier port for foreign trade , handling 70% of the container cargo in southern China last year .  
While the system may not be perfect , it is fair to say that by and large , it has played an important role in the development of a clean , efficient , trustworthy and quality civil service in Hong Kong .  
As the top echelon of the Government , the new principal officials are expected to lead and contribute towards the building up of an efficient , professional , fair , clean and honest civil service .

Most SREs are involved in activities intimately related to daily life , and are the foundation for national economic development . They may well be making huge surpluses-last year Chunghwa Telecom took in NT $ 49 billion in profits , CPC and Taipower more than NT $ 10 billion each-but that does n't mean they have been efficient . They have many shortcomings compared to similar service-providers abroad .  
Setting up in a foreign country was no easy task , particularly given that before BMI was established , the Bank of Hawaii and the Bank of Guam had already divided up the local financial market between them . Because the local savings rate was low but the borrowing rate was high , Chen decided that the only way to gain the upper hand as a latecomer was to offer more efficient lending operations .  
Many non-flowering aquatic plants propagate through asexual reproduction , which is arguably more efficient than the process employed by terrestrial plants . It is common to think of flowering plants as more advanced , but in Yen 's view , " Maybe plants that can reproduce without going through that process are actually the most advanced from an evolutionary standpoint . "  
As Lo says , " The ROC must move in the direction of flexible diplomacy and utilize foreign policy resources more flexibly . " In the future , overseas offices of the ROC will undertake functional integration at the continental level , with different locations having different specialties , such as overseas Chinese affairs , political affairs , and media relations . All the offices in a particular region will be linked into a single , more efficient , and more richly endowed cooperative group .  
Chen Chung believes that the small cultivated plots of traditional farming make it difficult to use efficient , labor-saving technologies and thus hinder competitiveness in international markets . The usual remedy for this has been even further exploitation of the land , and as Chen Chung points out with a pained expression , " the result was heavy use of pesticides and fertilizers , increased soil depletion , and environmental pollution . "

This universality of the Organization can naturally put tremendous resources at its disposal to facilitate the achievement of the principles and objectives of the United Nations Charter , particularly the maintenance of international peace and security , the promotion of economic and social development , justice and mutual cooperation , and place it in a better position to deal with emerging challenges in a more efficient and distinguished fashion .  
The changes of the last decade in economic and political conditions and new consensuses reached during the recent series of conferences offer a unique opportunity to develop an intensified , strengthened and more realistic approach to such cooperation , but the opportunity may go to waste if we fail to shape a more efficient , creative and forward-looking United Nations . 
The adoption and future implementation of the prototype for the new format of the medium-term plan for the period 1998 to 2001 , the introduction of a transparent and efficient system of accountability and responsibility , and the decentralization of regional economic commissions and of social and economic activities : all these are reform measures that foster administrative and financial efficiency in the Organization in the economic and social spheres .  
The potential contribution of improved efficiency in meeting growing needs for energy services in a sustainable way in the rural areas of developing countries can be substantial , especially at the point of end use , by introducing new , efficient , low-polluting technologies and systems and by upgrading existing , inefficient systems .  
Develop and disseminate to farming households integrated farm management technologies , such as crop rotation , organic manuring and other techniques involving reduced use of agricultural chemicals , multiple techniques for sources of nutrients and the efficient utilization of external inputs , while enhancing techniques for waste and by-product utilization and prevention of pre - and post-harvest losses , taking particular note of the role of women ;  
Develop and make widely available new and improved vaccines against major communicable diseases that are efficient and safe and offer protection with a minimum number of doses , including intensifying efforts directed at the vaccines needed to combat common diseases of children ;

Stressing the importance of trade as a major instrument of economic growth and sustainable development for all countries , in particular developing countries and the need to find solutions to microeconomic issues of international trade which can significantly contribute to more open , dynamic and efficient trade relations ,  
While it always favoured efficient use of scarce resources , her delegation believed that the modest additional net resources proposed were justified by an increase in workload which could not be handled within existing resources .  
The benefits expected of joint implementation are to be seen , inter alia , in an intensified transfer of capital , investments , technology and know-how with positive impetus to the development process in the countries involved , under the condition that joint implementation activities are in line with national development priorities and strategies , and in a more efficient use of scarce resources to reduce anthropogenic GHG emissions worldwide .  
The underlying philosophy surrounding the use of economic instruments in contrast to that of the traditional regulatory approach , is that economic instruments based on implementing the Polluter Pays Principle use market signals for influencing the behaviour of economic agents , and are efficient in achieving environmental targets , in particular when they are used to complement systems of environmental standards and regulations . 
Together with the constitutional and legislative reforms established by the peace agreements , the creation of a new and efficient system for the administration of justice calls for the programming and implementation of measures to modernize and raise the professional standards of the judiciary , which , in keeping with the new democratic legality that supports it , would make it possible for new judicial practices to become firmly entrenched . 
Taking into account the main development objectives established by the Territory 's Executive Council , namely , the improved management of the economy through a more efficient public sector , the strategic development of human resources through the reform of the educational and training systems , and the development of integrated policies of physical infrastructural improvements , as well as the preservation of the natural environment ,  
The ultimate goal is to enhance the image of the United Nations as an efficient and effective organization capable of making a substantial contribution to international understanding on a wide variety of issues and meeting the challenges posed by a rapidly changing international environment .  
This entails the need for modernized institutional mechanisms and processes to enable Governments to respond effectively to the complex and changing needs of societies , including demands for viable economic growth , efficient integration of social and economic policies and greater responsiveness and participatory processes .  
Further took note of the gradual shift of focus from pollution control and waste management to pollution prevention approaches in policies and programmes at the country level and bilateral and multilateral cooperation , and observed that this shift has resulted in the introduction of production patterns that emphasize the more efficient use of raw materials and energy , taking into account the capture and recycling of wastes and the better use of end-products of the productive system ;  
The adoption of General Assembly resolution 49 / 139 B , in the light of the growing demands for manpower and funds to mitigate the suffering and destruction caused by numerous emergencies , represents an innovative opportunity for the effective , efficient and economical provision of assistance to the intended beneficiaries of the United Nations system 's operations , tapping existing but as yet unstructured and therefore unrealized sources of volunteer expertise .  
However , when improvement of policy development is the main goal of administrative and political reforms , to be effective and efficient in utilizing scarce improvement resources , improvement endeavour should focus on key variables exerting a major impact on the quality of policy development dealing with critical future-influencing issues and domains .  
Viewing the public service as a critical agent of change , the Programme aims to rebuild a public service that is the servant of the people : accessible , accountable , efficient , free of corruption , and providing excellent quality .  
The public service is defined as an institution that should be professional ; career-oriented ; non-partisan ; efficient , effective and responsive in terms of service delivery ; loyal in its service to the public and the elected Government of the day ; accountable to the public and Parliament .  
In modern management , it has been clearly demonstrated that private and public organizations that achieve excellence do not do so through a detailed , formal restructuring but , rather , inter alia , by developing the capacity to identify an agenda of key decisions , networking , involving staff , making innovations , enhancing flexibility , implementing efficient image-creation policies , improving relations with the media and developing leadership aptitudes to cope with complexity .  
In this context of social , economic , and political change , the United Nations is re-examining the relationship between public administration and development in order to fashion more effective and efficient means of delivering technical assistance to developing countries in the service of world peace .  
In this regard , the ultimate goal is articulated to be the provision of a sustainable , efficient , profitable , readily differentiated and significantly higher quality service to the travelling and cargo-shipping communities at reasonable rates .  
In this context , special emphasis should be placed on ensuring that international financial institutions make the most effective use of existing financing facilities and establish additional ones , attracting capital investments in conditions of respect for the domestic legislation of each country and using efficient energy technologies mainly to support the execution of the projects that are necessary for our region in this sector .  
While energies have to be focused and action planned in the best and most efficient manner , the ultimate goals of effectively preventing and controlling organized transnational crime in all its forms and dimensions , and arresting its expansion at both the national and international levels , should be guiding the relevant efforts and should constitute the yardstick against which success is to be assessed .  
Furthermore , with the assistance of the United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) , a national transport policy framework has been drafted , which aims at developing a coordinated transport system , in a market-oriented approach , and a sound base for the various carriers to provide reliable , efficient and economic services to the people .

NULLWhatever the level of domestic savings and however large or small the net transfer of foreign savings , there is legitimate concern to ensure that those savings are allocated to investment in developing countries in a manner that is efficient and desirable in the social , political and developmental senses .  
An effective government planning mechanism is essential if necessary social investment - especially for human-resource development - is to be well designed , and is even more essential for efficient government guidance of the investment process in those countries that choose to have activist industrial , agricultural or other sectoral policies .  
It was noted that the effect of sound and efficient policies at the micro-economic level as well as the impact on individual and small group initiatives can be blunted by inconsistent or unbalanced macroeconomic policies .  
Iraq 's cooperation , including the provision of accurate information and supporting documentation , access to personnel involved in the relevant activities and support of the Commission 's inspection and monitoring efforts will be required , on a continuous basis , in order to enable the Commission to achieve this objective in a speedy and efficient manner .  
The Secretary-General supports this approach , which should be aimed at enhancing the flexibility and adaptability of the United Nations in the performance of its functions and its ability to address the most urgent tasks and new demands , as well as to ensure an efficient and effective United Nations system capable of dealing with the growing number of global challenges in the economic , social and related fields . 
In line with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , measures are being taken to make the human rights machinery : ( a ) more effective and cost efficient ; ( b ) able to act swiftly and to respond appropriately to human rights situations ; ( c ) stronger , through international cooperation in the field of human rights , based on mutual confidence ; and ( d ) more transparent and understandable to the outside world .  
For example , a cooperative program was undertaken examining commercial cotton fields in the San Joaquin Valley of California , aimed at developing integrated tools to produce crops that maximize economic return , support efficient use of natural resources , and minimize detrimental impacts on the environment .  
Those areas included ensuring the continuity of remote sensing data from satellite operators , technical assistance in the implementation and operation of ground stations , price reductions and easier access to data , provision of training and education for efficient and timely data processing and analysis , and increased efforts in the coordination of programmes and projects between national , regional and international aid agencies .  
The reform seeks to introduce a professionalized and efficient first-level appeal system to replace the current volunteer system which , in an era of increasing management accountability for programme delivery coupled with declining resources and an increasing number of cases , makes it difficult to attract sufficient experienced and qualified staff to discharge these vital functions .  
States , as the principal actors in the realization of the right to development , should guarantee the exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms , strengthen democracy and ensure an honest and transparent public administration and an efficient and impartial administration of justice .  
The spread of conflicts and the magnitude of the humanitarian consequences are such as to require the international community to conduct an objective and responsible evaluation and take vigorous and efficient measures to end the spiral of armed conflicts and create conditions for peace and security without which the universal realization of the right to development will be little more than a good intention . 
reorganization is reflected in the budgetary proposals for 1996 and concerns the expansion of the Strategy Team in the Investigation Section , a complete reorganization of the former Special Advisory Section into a new Legal Services Section and the provision of additional resources to the Information and Records Section to enable the efficient and timely processing of the huge amount of information , evidence and other material received by the Office so that it is accessible to the investigative and prosecutorial staff in the Office .

It also involves injecting new capital from the private sector , either domestic or foreign , into national public enterprises through an innovative , efficient capitalization and administration plan , in collaboration with strategic private partners .  
In the context of globalization and integration in which our countries are evolving , Governments are bound to assume a much more active role in helping to create efficient and competitive environments in our economies , thus enabling us to improve the standards of living of our peoples and contributing to the resolute head-on fight against corruption and impunity at the national and international levels . 
Among the objectives of the audit are the necessary refocusing of the administration on its essential tasks ; the organization and establishment of well-adapted structures and flexible procedures to carry out these tasks ; and the establishment of adequate resources , both material and human , for the effective and efficient functioning of the administration .  
There may be merit in some of these assertions , but this is only correct when the public sector is not well trained ; when its size can not be justified on the output and quality of services offered ; or when the policies it delivers run counter to the accumulation of national wealth , efficient delivery of social services or administration of justice .  
They are also aimed at creating a lean , efficient , highly motivated and dutiful civil service , based on the job requirements and carefully evaluated professional requirements of each Ministry and public institution .  
Joint action in the field of crime prevention and the elimination of international terrorism envisages closer cooperation between central , regional and border authorities through efficient communications and exchange of information ; a commitment to accede to all relevant international conventions that prevent and punish international crime and terrorism ; joining and participation in specialized regional forums for discussing the problems of illicit drug-trafficking , organized crime and regional anti-terrorist cooperation ; and the elaboration of a regional programme to combat organized crime .  
The total elimination of all existing nuclear weapons , as an indispensable step towards general and complete disarmament under strict and efficient international control , is the demand of the entire Non-Aligned Movement , to which we fully subscribe . 
We believe that the main focus for the 20 / 20 initiative should be the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and disadvantaged and other vulnerable sectors of our society . 
In this respect , my delegation wishes to express its appreciation to the Governments of Norway and the Netherlands for the meeting held at Oslo last April to review the implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative , which was enunciated in the Copenhagen Programme of Action , and which aims to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and vulnerable in the developing world through a partnership between developed and developing countries . 
While there is no substitute for efficient national systems for accounting and control , especially in those countries possessing sensitive nuclear material , in preventing illicit trafficking , we recognize the crucial role the Agency can play in information-sharing and in identifying the sources of stolen material .  
We commend the commitments made at national level to the implementation of relevant recommendations through , inter alia , the effective mobilization and efficient utilization of domestic resources and through increased allocation of resources to the social sector .  
Examples of this trend are the free elections that have been held in recent years elections that were open , competitive and fair ; the respect for existing legislation ; the creation of constitutional courts and the appointment of special prosecutors for human rights ; the existence of independent electoral tribunals and multi-party parliaments ; the promotion of autonomous and efficient judicial systems and the development of programmes to promote a culture of peace and democracy .  
President , I have long admired the imagination and determination you have brought to the difficult challenges of multilateral diplomacy , and I should like to express my appreciation for the leadership you have demonstrated in taking the General Assembly through its demanding schedule to an efficient and productive conclusion .  
The system complements operational early warning systems for food security in eastern and southern Africa by providing fast and efficient data distribution capacity for environmental satellite data produced by the ARTEMIS system of FAO at Rome .  
A much-needed increase in productivity of rural areas of developing countries , in terms of agricultural output and processing , would require supplies of efficient , modern fuels for mechanized agriculture , rural transport and operating of essential tools and machineries . 
Although the potential biomass resource base is immense and dedicated energy crops could add significantly to that resource base , modern , efficient use of biomass remains to be promoted and applied ; a small increase in the efficiency of burning fuelwood would have noticeable effects on carbon and particulate emissions .

In areas where plantations are designed to achieve multiple purposes , especially for fulfilling subsistence needs of local populations , methodologies have to become more efficient and designed to reinforce the process of expanding forest cover .  NULLSeveral initiatives at the regional level have taken place or are planned for the near future in connection with improving the readiness to implement the Convention to Combat Desertification .  
Keeping open the availability of additional alternative corridors for transit in an uncertain world , even at some cost , as compared with putting more resources into expanding the current most efficient single route , may be the most effective long-term investment and best insurance " policy " for landlocked countries .  
The Technical Meeting sought to move this evaluation process forward , giving emphasis to the necessary immediate and longer-term actions by focusing on four areas : evaluating alternative routes and their comparative costs ; considering bottlenecks in physical infrastructure and ways to remove them ; assessing non-physical barriers to the efficient use of the available transit transport corridors and steps to remove them ; and finally moving towards a framework for future cooperation .

The key factors which contribute to inefficient energy-use in the transport sector are growing road congestion in urban areas , increasing dependence on cars , and use of vehicles which are not fuel efficient coupled with poor vehicle and road maintenance in developing countries .  
The limited organizational capacity of many local transport providers - particularly undersized freight forwarders , who with proper assistance might develop into efficient multimodal transport operators - is leaving many countries too dependent on foreign transport providers . 
These projects include the compilation , review and implementation of measures to facilitate trade flows , to promote national transport activities , to increase awareness on efficient commercial practices in international trade , as well as to provide Customs administrations with proper working tools designed to increase efficiency and transparency in Customs clearance time and revenue collection and to generate timely and reliable trade data .  
Their major expected results are : the establishment of legal and institutional frameworks , of commercially viable reforms and instruments to foster efficient trade and transport operations ( with direct and active participation of concerned public and private agencies and operative Trade Points , and through National Trade and Transport Facilitation Committees representing all functional interests ) ; and the establishment of adequate training programmes .  
In order to address these concerns and to reach the goal of economically efficient , socially balanced and ecologically sound sustainable forest management , the experts call upon the Governments , private sector and investment community , multilateral international organizations , non-governmental organizations and the voluntary sector to recognize their shared responsibility and to take urgent action as follows :  
Secondly , the Board had to undertake important managerial tasks essential to the future efficient functioning of UNCTAD , on which the Union expected detailed discussions in such areas as UNCTAD 's technical cooperation activities and UNCTAD 's publications policy .  
Much remained to be done to advance the cause in terms of the tasks assigned to the Commissions and expert meetings , for the main challenge ahead was to perfect a pragmatic approach that would enable the international community to deal with the development problem in a globalized world economy and to endow UNCTAD with efficient and modern instruments for helping the developing countries to meet this challenge .  
In accordance with the Declaration , equity should be a basic principle of health policy , and such policy should be based on the Almaty principle of Health for All ; health services should be effective , efficient , accessible , affordable , compassionate , and socially acceptable .  
Significant human and financial resources are being devoted by the international community to assistance in mine clearance , which is , by its nature , a long-term task ; to efficient and effective demining programmes where the primary emphasis is on the development of national mine-clearance capacities by afflicted countries ; to mine-awareness programmes ; and to the rehabilitation and reintegration into society of victims of landmines .  
If democratization is the most reliable way to legitimize and improve national governance , it is also the most reliable way to legitimize and improve international organization , making it more open and responsive by increasing participation , more efficient by allowing for burden-sharing and more effective by allowing for comparative advantage and greater creativity .  
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
Emphasizing the importance of the democratic , efficient , transparent and representative governing structures of the United Nations Environment Programme , with a complementary , specific and distinct role and mandate for each of their components ,
