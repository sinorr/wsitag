Multinationals are the main engine of world economic growth , especially international investment .  In the last several years , multinationals have engaged in and controlled 1 / 3 of the world 's gross product , 2 / 3 of the world trade , 70% of the direct investment , and 80% of the technology transfer and the research and development of civilian technology .  
The United States , mouthing human rights , in the end utilized concentrated bombing and depleted uranium bombs - - weapons prohibited by international law , and bombed residential sites , schools , hospital , and other civilian targets , even flagrantly bombing chemical installations , causing the spread of chemicals and reagents , seemingly carrying out chemical warfare .  
[ Li Dingfan ] For many years while making efforts to enter the international market for peaceful utilization of nuclear energy , China 's nuclear industry has fully developed and utilized nuclear energy resources to serve the construction of the national economy and the livelihood of the people ; constructed many nuclear power projects , such as the Qinshan and Daya Bay nuclear power stations ; developed newly rising high-tech industries in which nuclear fuel , civilian-use nuclear technology , and production of nonnuclear civilian goods support and complement one another ;  
[ Li Dingfan ] In the new century , the CNNC 's entire line of thinking on development is to further cut the new development path of " integrating military and civilian production , developing nuclear energy power generation , readjusting the structure , giving prominence to efficiency , strengthening management , and invigorating the nuclear industry with science and technology . "  
do a good job in diverting redundant workers to other jobs and increasing efficiency with reduced staff ; put it in a prominent place to improve efficiency ; and establish a new-type small and efficient nuclear technology industrial system based on the integration of military and civilian production .  
For medium-sized and small enterprises , we have tried to gradually develop them into professional and special enterprises characterized by being " focused , excellent , unique , and modern " by helping them increase profits and make up losses , and realize investment diversity through adopting such policies as separating the production of military and civilian products , and make full use of merger for the bankrupt , and turning debt to equity .  
At present , China 's civilian networks are widely distributed , and the web sites and net points are scattering everywhere .  To enable these scattered strengths to really form an integrated joint force for attack and defense during the war , we must establish a highly authoritative , centralized and united network people 's war organizational organ .  
In line with a civilian market having abundant technology and products that are suited to the requirements of military equipment , many civilian-use technologies such as electronics technology , information technology , production technology , and materials technologies , all of which have developed rapidly , our army has instituted several " joint logistics reforms " and logistics reforms with " socialized support " as the main content , thus decreasing the burden and lengthening the strides forward .  
By 2010 , military specialized technical cadres competent for both military and civilian services should basically be trained mainly by regular schools of higher learning , and a proper number of graduates from regular schools of higher learning should be selected to fill command posts , so that the knowledge structure and scientific and cultural levels of military cadres can be improved fundamentally and a military personnel training system compatible with China 's national conditions and our army 's characteristics can take shape .  
Xiamen now ranks as one of the top-ten economically strong cities in the country .  To meet the need of the state 's safety , Xiamen has initially built an industrial system , which can rapidly covert civilian production to defense technology industry .  Electronic , machine tool , and chemical industrial enterprises constitute a major part of this industrial system .  
The city has developed , in a selected and planned manner , more than 130 projects that can manufacture products both for military and civilian purposes .  To meet the need of military maneuvers , the city has repeatedly made such a conversion in an effort to turn sci-tech achievements into combat capability .  Now a total of 16 high-tech industrial enterprises are able to manufacture military articles to meet various needs at short notice .  
In the meantime , to meet the need of military combat readiness in the new period , they have integrated wartime and peacetime work , coordinated military and civilian affairs , and worked out an overall plan on building regional battlegrounds in cooperation with the troops stationed in the relevant region , by focusing on port , communication , and ship building .  
After a certain number of years ' efforts , the army 's technical cadres with specialties of both military and civilian applicability will be cultivated mainly through regular higher education , some outstanding regular college graduates will fill the commander 's position of the army 's grass-roots units , and around 40 percent of the army 's annual cadre replenishment will be those trained through regular higher education .  
Cultivating military cadres with the assistance of civilian colleges and universities is an inevitable choice made to adapt to the world 's military development trends , to the " Two fundamental changes " in our military construction and to the needs for " winning wars " in the future .  It is a practical step in carrying out and implementing the essence of Chairman Jiang 's directives .  
Like their civilian counterparts , the legal affairs that military lawyers have to handle involve those relevant to criminal , civil , economic , administrative , maritime , and financial laws , and so they must be totally familiar with the laws and regulations of the country so that they can properly handle the legal affairs in the armed forces and legal affairs that involve both military and civilian departments ;  
The training exercise command center on board the vessel , which had been jointly set up by the units of the state organs or military units concerned , had found out or tackled problems through coordination ; had revised in a timely fashion both the measures and steps for the wartime emergency mobilization and requisition of civilian vessels ; and had built a faster and highly efficient operational mechanism during the training exercise .  
Relevant military and civilian personnel generally think that frequent exercises not only have rigorously trained the front-support contingent participating in sea battles , but also have strengthened the military-government and military-people relationships in coastal regions and raised the national defense awareness of the masses in these regions .  
A number of large and medium cities seized the opportunity of the rapid development of capital construction , quickly building new large and medium leading projects to make products for both peacetime and wartime use , and building underground bomb shelters integrated with civilian buildings , for a simultaneous growth of war readiness , social , and economic efficiency .  
The bloody Palestinian-Israeli conflicts that had continued for two weeks escalated intensely on the afternoon of 12 October . The Palestinian Self-Rule Authority [ PSRA ] , the Voice of Palestine radio station , the Gaza port , and other places in Gaza as well as the Ramallah City Palestinian Police Office and some Palestinian civilian facilities in the Gaza Strip were all attacked by missiles fired by Israeli helicopters , leaving two Palestinian civilians and four policemen dead and more than 30 people wounded .  
With the efforts made in the past years , a system for training a new type of anti-chemical-warfare capable personnel has been formed in our armed forces .  At present , major combat equipment , including tanks , airplanes and vessels can better resist nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , and both the armed forces and the civilian basically have complete sets of equipment for protection against such weapons .  
Leaders and institutions at all levels should strengthen their contact with administrative departments in civilian governments at all levels , properly handle cases in which economic construction projects involve military facilities , crack down on conduct which results in damage to military facilities , and make positive contributions to protecting military facilities and maintaining national security .  
I propose that military units stationed in western China should be authorized to take special preferential measures for retaining and attracting useful personnel .  There should be stronger leadership over the programs by which military and civilian authorities will support each other and work together in promoting the construction of a civil society ; and the military should support local economic construction projects with its advantages in terms of personnel , technical , and information .  
The large-scale Chinese military and civilian action of searching for Wang Wei , the missing parachuting pilot , was concluded at 18:00 yesterday .  The people of all walks of life in Hainan Province expressed deep sorrow at the fact that there is no possibility of Wang Wei returning alive , and acclaimed him as a hero in defending the motherland .  
We should target the characteristic that most logistical science and technology have military and civilian applications as we vigorously bring in local advanced and practical scientific and technological results , put civilian work to military use and promptly turn them into a military economic benefit , so that they can provide a service and boost our safeguard capability .  We should pay attention to using society 's R &amp; D capability to accelerate the strong pace of using scientific and technological advancement to achieve security .  
At the ongoing Beijing International Week , the Great Wall Rocket Company is a very eye-catching exhibitor .  Visitors are amazed by the gigantic models of the advanced carrier rockets of the Long March series , electronic traffic maps , sensors , satellite positioning and navigation instruments , TV receivers that can receive high-resolution pictures via satellites , and other high-tech civilian products on display at the company 's booths .  
Jiang Yongquan who was locked up at the Jiaohe Detention Center for suspected murder never had anyone coming to see him and give him money or articles of daily use since his detention .  The civilian police at the detention center brought a change of cloth and a cotton quilt from home and gave these to him .  Deeply moved , Jiang volunteered to confess the truth about how he collaborated with others in robbing taxi drivers at knife point , thus solving a major case which remained unresolved for three long years .  
At the meeting , Jiang Zemin , on behalf of the party Central Committee , the State Council , and the Central Military Commission , extended warm congratulations to national model military officers transferred to civilian work and to advanced units and workers engaged in work in resettling demobilized officers and extended cordial regards to the military officers to be transferred to civilian work and to those comrades engaged in resettling such military personnel .  
the proportion of the gross industrial product made up of dominant products , high-tech products and technical products for both military and civilian use rising to 40 percent from the current approximately 30 percent ;  
According to what is understood , for more than 20 years China 's national defense science and technology industry has gradually realized a transformation from an industry that produces industrial products for military use only , to one that produces products that integrate military and civilian use .  Every industry within the military industrial complex has fundamentally formed a developmental pattern with professional characteristics for products for the civilian industry .  
As China 's accession to the WTO is approaching , the government has changed their views on civilian-run economic sectors , and civilian capital has also increased .  As a result , the authorities responsible for the media formally clarified their stand a month ago on foreign capital 's participation in media operations .  
The provincial military district system , in accordance with relevant regulations at a national level and in the military , integrate political education , organization and rectification , military training , recruitment work , and major holiday and commemoration activities , accomplishing national defense of civilian militia reserves .  
The party , government , military , and civilian must pool their efforts , coordinate closely , and expand in a deep and sustained way the advertisement of the " National Defense Education Law " , creating a fine social atmosphere that all people will focus on , be concerned with , and support .  
They have also dispatched the fleet to the sea to conduct test training in different sea areas and under different weather conditions .  They have successively completed more than 30 difficult training courses , including replenishment in rocky areas at night , round-the-clock comprehensive supplies from all directions , replenishment in strong waves and winds , and joint logistical replenishment tasks by military and civilian vessels .  
The PLA , armed police , and law enforcement units stationed in Tibet are strong pillars and loyal guards who safeguard the motherland 's frontier areas and Tibet 's stability .  They are important forces for building the socialist material and spiritual civilizations in Tibet . They must continue to carry forward their fine traditions and work styles , ensure their own construction , strengthen their unity with the local governments , civilian authorities , and the people , and make new contributions to Tibet 's stability and development .  
Since the introduction of the reform and opening-up program , our army has firmly implemented the Party 's basic line , and supported reform with actual deeds .  It has correctly dealt with difficult problems such as helping officers and men transfer to civilian jobs , become decommissioned , and settle down , and assisting their family members find jobs .  It has successfully fulfilled the task of reshuffling and streamlining the army , actively participated in and supported the local economic construction projects , and resolutely strengthened unity and stability in the country .  
Since the 1991 Gulf War , the US and British aircraft have been flying on patrol missions in two " no-fly zones , " set up over the north and south of Iraq respectively , frequently striking at various civilian and military targets in Iraq , and resulting in losses in human life and property .  
actively organize and encourage both army troops and militia reserves to plunge themselves in the current large-scale development of the country 's western region ; take up urgent , difficult , dangerous , and heavy tasks on our own initiative ; and strive for dual effects of promoting economic development and consolidating the defense building in line with the principle of manufacturing products for both peacetime and wartime use and for both military and civilian use .  
The key to building a system of logistics support that is adaptable to joint operations and to fundamentally eliminating such deficiencies as multiple channeling , separation of the general-purpose support and the special-purpose support , and operation via separate bodies is to take the road of integration .  This will bring about a new setup of logistics support where support for the three armed services are integrated as one , the system is compatible to both the military and the civilian , and the general-purpose logistics supplies and services are all supported in a unified way .  
In 1994 , Russia changed into following the gradualist approach to changing products .  After a few years , the situation of militarization of the national economy was changed ; the value of output of armament industries represented a reduced proportion of the GDP , and civilian products constituted a growing proportion in terms of the product mix of armament industry complexes .  
However , the absolute quantity of civilian products produced by armament industry enterprises declined rapidly , mainly because of insufficient investment , debt payment failures , competition of foreign goods , unsuccessful privatization , and technological and operational difficulties in changing products .

Its basic characteristic is the comprehensive use of various high-tech information technology [ IT ] developed in the 1990 ' s to conduct rapid , hidden , and destructive damage to the enemy 's military and civilian computer networks and communication systems , cutting off the enemy 's military contacts , disabling command , dowsing the fighting spirit , and bringing great chaos to the economy and society of the country concerned .  This will finally allow the attacking side to achieve the goal of striking the first blows without shedding a drop of blood .  
During the visit , Jiang Zemin urged all departments participating in the cooperation of war industries to implement the principle of " the integration of military and civilian use , and the integration of wartime and peacetime needs , " meet the needs of the new situation of the development of the socialist market economy , adhere to the principle of turning civilians into a part of the armed forces , and establish a vigorous structure for the development science and technology for national defense ;  
We must obtain maximum results from our limited resources , form a complete set of effective mechanisms for competition , appraisal , and supervision , optimize the distribution of the science , technology and productive forces of the whole society , promote the ties , integration and cooperation between the military and civilian scientific research structures , and enable the achievements in technological innovation to be turned faster and better into productive forces for national defense and economic development .  
A few days ago , at a certain sea port in northern Jiangsu , more than 30 civilian ships of large tonnage called up by the Jiangsu Provincial Military District carried officers and men of a certain motorized infantry brigade and heavy equipment and sailed towards the wavy Huang Hai sea area to start a two-day , two-night sea-crossing and military tactics and technology training .  
Upon receiving an emergency order , the naval training vessel " Shichang " set sail in a thick fog with visibility of only 15 m .  It braved the wind and the waves of a near Force 10 typhoon for 17 days , sailing 4000 nautical miles .  It satisfactorily completed comprehensive training in maritime national defense mobilization with " wartime civilian vessels emergency mobilization and acquisition " as its main task .  The vessel returned to a certain military port in the Bo Hai a few days ago .  
Wen Jiabao pointed out : The troops and the civilian people in Hainan Province demonstrated a great indomitable spirit in fighting against floods by working with one heart and one mind without being daunted by dangers and difficulties , and won the initial victory in the work of resisting floods and restoring normal production .  
The circular finally stressed : We should make vigorous efforts to train and utilize qualified personnel capable of working in both military and civilian posts and this is at once a need of army building and a need for tackling the problem of lack of qualified personnel in the rural areas and promoting rural development as well . 
AMEEGC General Manger Xia Guohong told this reporter during the air show in Zhuhai that the AMEEGC will , by adhering to the guiding thought of " gearing to the market , with aerospace as the principal line , striving for scientific and technological innovations , prevailing on the strength of quality , " speed up the general adoption of the market principle and the process of converting military enterprises to civilian production in order to maintain a sustained , sound and fast development of China 's space undertakings under the conditions of market economy .  
The CWC is an important international disarmament treaty against proliferation .  It aims at the comprehensive ban and complete destruction of weapons of mass destruction .  Accordingly , the Convention seeks to exercise control and monitoring over the destruction of chemical weapons and civilian industrial enterprises producing relevant chemicals through the mandatory declaration of data and on-site inspections .  
The " Epilogue - - China 's New Century " gave full expression to the firm determination of the entire military troops and civilian people throughout the country to closely rally around the party central leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core and build our country into a rich and powerful modern socialist nation with a high degree of civilization and democracy in the new century .  
According to the " Provisional Procedure , " military cadres at the divisional level and those who are below the battalion level and who have served in the military for less than 20 years will continue to be assigned jobs when transferred to civilian work .  The local party committees and governments concerned should be responsible for arranging jobs for these cadres .  
The amount of the pension should be calculated on the basis of 80 percent of the monthly pay , military-rank pay , plus the standard allowance of the military cadre at the level equivalent to the new civilian job and the total of basic and length-of-service wages in the military .  
We should - - by means of making enterprises go listed inside and outside the territory , utilizing foreign capital , absorbing social entities , and attracting civilian capital - - bring in investment from all sides and form multiple investment entities , so as to bring about aggregate increase in the state-owned economy , yet with a decreased proportion of state-owned capital and greater control .  
The SCDS consulted the department management and staff before making its recommendations .  They considered that the pay advantage which the disciplined services now enjoy over the civilian grades in recognition of their special job factors should be preserved , but some adjustment would be justified to that element of the starting salaries of recruits entering the disciplined services which is based on academic qualification benchmarks in order to maintain broad comparability with the rest of the civil service .  
In addition , the Bureau proposes to accept the Standing Committee 's recommendations on individual JRAs payable to disciplined services staff .  It further proposes that the modified JRA governing principles should apply to civilian grades and the disciplined services alike in order to maintain broad consistency in the administration of JRAs in respect of the civilian grades and the disciplined services .  
When a scene takes place in the emperor 's palace the most formal of all costumes , the Mang , is worn by both civilian and military officials . In ordinary scenes such characters would wear a less formal Pi , and when in their homes they can wear the even more casual Chetzu . These three costumes are made of soft material and have gentle lines .  
Rising up to take advantage of this opportunity and lay a comprehensive and lasting foundation for the future of the Chinese people is the common responsibility of the 1.2 billion Chinese at home and abroad . It is also the duty of the people on our bastion of national revival , civilian and military alike , to lead the way with great wisdom , determination , and solidarity , based on our many years of experience and achievements in implementing political democracy and an economy that benefits the people .  
An ad hoc task force comprising both civilian and military investigators is now hard at work on the case , but has discovered signs that many documents have either been lost or falsified . Many worrisome questions remain unanswered : How many people are involved ? How high up does the case reach ?  
The Taiwan Garrison Command was established in 1958 , assuming complete control over martial law , police functions , entry to and exit from Taiwan , media and cultural censorship , postal spying , and military trials ( which could also be used in civilian cases ) .  
The civilian population of the occupied territories has continued to suffer a heavy toll of casualties caused by the disproportionately harsh and violent methods employed by the Israeli authorities to repress the popular uprising .  
In flagrant defiance of international humanitarian law , crimes such as " ethnic cleansing " , mass rapes , torture and deliberate bombing of civilian targets continue to be committed against the innocent Bosnian people .  
VHF equipment is required to provide static , mobile and portable communications to military observers , civilian police monitors , civilian engineering services , civil affairs and administrative support units in the area of operation .  
The unencumbered balance of appropriations , $ 34,655,950 gross ( $ 35,247,050 net ) as at 31 December 1993 , will be sufficient to meet the cost of maintaining MINURSO at its current military and civilian strength for a period of some 10 months .  
These estimates provide for a total of 354 military observers , 6,226 military contingent personnel ( out of an authorized level of 6,625 ) , 128 civilian police observers , 243 international civilian staff , 200 United Nations Volunteers and 500 local staff .  
Several major cities remained under siege , encircled or under sustained military pressure by one or the other side , resulting in increased hardship for the civilian population and compounding the already disastrous humanitarian situation .  
The initial requirement would be to bring UNAVEM II rapidly to its previous level of 350 military observers , 126 police observers and 14 military medical staff , with an appropriate number of international and local civilian staff .  
Considers that an international tribunal with general jurisdiction should be established urgently to prosecute genocide , crimes against humanity , including murder , extermination , enslavement , deportation , imprisonment , torture , rape , persecutions on political , racial and religious grounds and other inhumane acts directed against any civilian population , and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the Additional Protocols of 1977 thereto ;  
To meet the growing need for civilian personnel during crises , Canada will offer the United Nations secondment or the loan of civilian personnel on a short-term urgent basis to help in the development of a fully trained capacity in the areas of human rights , legal advice , humanitarian assistance , and other aspects of a rapid civilian response to crises . 
In the context of our common endeavour we must encourage international cooperation in all possible uses of science and advanced technology for both military and civilian purposes so-called dual-use through the transfer and exchange of scientific and technical know-how for the peaceful purposes of promoting sustainable development and the preservation of international security .  
This calls for the strengthening of preventive diplomacy , including developing adequate early warning capacities , dispatching field missions , and utilizing the good offices of Governments , international or regional organizations or eminent personalities in order to get to the source of an imminent conflict and safeguard the security , well-being and human rights of the affected civilian population .  
These have been the tasks of protecting humanitarian operations during continuing warfare , protecting civilian populations in designated safe areas and pressing the parties to achieve national reconciliation at a pace faster than they were ready to accept . 
In this context , my Government wishes to emphasize the need for the quick deployment of UNAVEM III , because it alone as we all know will bear responsibility for the quartering , disarming and selection of UNITA troops that are to be integrated into the unified national army of Angola and for the demobilization of the excess military personnel that will be reintegrated into civilian life after receiving vocational training .  
Four of the five nuclear-weapon States and some of their allies had taken a clear position on the Treaty 's indefinite and unconditional extension , but with regard to such matters as the pace of the negotiations on a complete test-ban treaty , peaceful nuclear explosions , the future of nuclear energy for civilian purposes and negative security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States , the overall impression was that it was business as usual .  
By 21 February , a total of 211 international staff members from 36 countries had joined the Mission , comprising 111 substantive staff , of whom 72 are United Nations Volunteers , 60 administrative and logistical support staff , 10 military liaison officers and 30 civilian police observers .  
Any armed attack on the civilian population is obviously prohibited , and that prohibition does not end even if the indirect aim is to achieve military objectives , unless there is a pressing military need and , at the same time , a certain proportionality between the military objective to be achieved and the expected and foreseeable harm which may be caused to the civilian population .  
Such actions affecting private property or public utilities designed to meet the needs of the civilian population involve a high degree of risk for civilians and can not be justified as legitimate military operations .  
They also shared the view that steps could be taken to facilitate the early conclusion of negotiations on complex substantive issues that are yet to be considered , namely " economic and social issues and the agrarian situation " , " strengthening of civilian power and role of the army in a democratic society " and " constitutional reforms and electoral regime " .  
The revised timetable provides for completion of two main substantive issues ( economic and social issues and the agrarian situation ; and strengthening of civilian power and role of the army in a democratic society ) before the electoral campaign is fully under way .  
These confidence-building measures , which could lead to an informal suspension of offensive military operations , would constitute a demonstration of good will aimed at alleviating the suffering of the civilian population in areas affected by the armed confrontation , protecting human rights and facilitating the work of MINUGUA as well as all national entities devoted to the protection and promotion of human rights . 
With regard to military operations , until such time as a cease-fire is agreed to and takes effect , URNG insists on the commitment to respect the provisions of the comprehensive agreement on human rights intended to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population , protect human rights and facilitate the work of MINUGUA and of all national bodies devoted to the protection and promotion of human rights and the rights deriving from international humanitarian law .  
The travel of international civilian personnel to the mission area has been calculated at an average cost of $ 5,800 per person per round-trip ( basic air fare $ 3,500 and 100 kilograms of unaccompanied baggage $ 2,300 ) , based on actual recent expenditures .  
The cost estimate also makes provision for pending claims by civilian and military personnel for lost personal effects as a result of the civil war ( $ 500,000 ) , of which an amount of $ 375,000 has been brought forward from the previous mandate period .  
Urges all the Afghan parties to respect accepted humanitarian rules , as set out in the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto , of 1977 , to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians from acts of reprisal and violence , including ill-treatment , torture and summary executions , and to expedite the simultaneous release of prisoners wherever they may be held ;  
Deeply concerned further by the increasingly severe and grave violations of human rights by the Government of Iraq against the civilian population in southern Iraq , in particular in the southern marshes , where the combination of massive drainage projects and wide-ranging military operations on the part of the Government of Iraq has forced residents of the marshes to flee in large numbers , many of whom have sought refuge on the border between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran ,  
The progress report focused on prerequisites of learning from experience with United Nations peace-keeping operations , and on the status of a ready capacity to act for six substantive components of complex missions : information , electoral , repatriation , human rights , civilian police and military .  
The travel costs of military and civilian personnel to the mission area on assignment , rotation or repatriation have been estimated at an average of $ 2,000 per person one way , or $ 4,000 round trip ( basic air fare of $ 1,000 , plus 100 kilogrammes of unaccompanied baggage and travel allowances at $ 1,000 ) .  The cost of a round-trip travel on a three-day official mission to New York is estimated at $ 1,400 ( $ 700 basic airfare and $ 700 in allowances and daily subsistence allowance ) .  
The possibility of reducing the huge financial , material and human resources devoted to the military sector and reallocating part of them to the civilian sector of national economies has been the object of deliberations within the framework of the United Nations for over three decades .  
Travel costs for the military and civilian personnel have been calculated on the basis of the following travel rates : ( a ) for repatriation of military contingent personnel , by group travel arrangements , at a rate of $ 540 per person ; and ( b ) for international civilian personnel , by commercial arrangements , at a rate of $ 3,500 per person one way or $ 7,000 round trip , inclusive of the entitlement for excess unaccompanied baggage .  
Acts of inhumanity , cruelty or barbarity directed against the life , dignity or physical or mental integrity of persons [ , in particular wilful killing , torture , mutilation , biological experiments , taking of hostages , compelling a protected person to serve in the forces of a hostile Power , unjustifiable delay in the repatriation of prisoners of war after the cessation of active hostilities , deportation or transfer of the civilian population and collective punishment ] ;  
The Committee was informed that subsequent to the preparation of the Secretary-General 's report , the Security Council , on 10 February 1995 , approved the deployment of an additional 30 civilian police , increasing the authorized level to 120 ( see S / 1995 / 130 ) .  
Estimates for activities ranging from water purification and storage to the number of civilian and military personnel required for the Mission and infrastructure repairs were excessive ; in that regard she fully shared the concerns expressed and the recommendations put forward by the Advisory Committee in paragraphs 24 , 34 , 39 and 42 of its report .  
The ninth report of the Human Rights Division , issued in September 1993 , emphasized that the increase in crime was linked to non-implementation or delayed or incomplete implementation of the agreements : " [ Firstly ] , the failure to confiscate military weapons in the hands of the civilian population . . . 
In a whole range of areas , there is no halt to military actions , in clear violation of the agreements of 21 and 31 December last year between the Bosnian parties on a cease-fire and on a complete cessation of hostilities .  The situation is being aggravated by attempted offensives from the Government forces and by disproportionate responses from the Bosnian Serbs , including acts against the civilian population which is absolutely inadmissible .  
Despite an almost total information blockade and the restriction of the movement of representatives of international organizations by the Croatian side under various pretexts , foreign media have managed to inform the world public about some of the atrocities and the systematic drive of the Croatian military and civilian authorities to erase the traces of these atrocities by burning the dead , burying them in unmarked mass graves or by washing the streets and roads to remove the evidence .  
Consequently , in the Agreement , URNG undertook " to respect the inherent attributes of the human person and to contribute to the effective enjoyment of human rights " and , like the Government , it recognized the need to end the suffering of the civilian population and to respect the human rights of wounded , captured and disabled combatants . 
During the period covered by this report , the Mission verified complaints of alleged violations by both parties of the commitment to respect the human rights of wounded , captured and disabled combatants , as well as to end the suffering of the civilian population .  
In the Mission 's view , the laying of mines in places where people work , live or circulate constitutes a violation of this commitment and of the principles of international humanitarian law , since it puts the civilian population at unnecessary risk and there is no proportionality between the intended military objective and the foreseeable harm that may be caused to that population . 
The Mission believes that URNG has committed human rights violations and has failed to observe the commitment to end the suffering of the civilian population , by making threats and taking action against civilian property for the purpose of collecting the " war tax " ; by unnecessarily endangering civilians not involved in the conflict during attacks on military bases and units ; by laying mines or explosive devices in places where civilians work , live or circulate ; and by taking reprisals . 
Following the perverse logic of ethnic cleansing , ethnic Serbs were often evacuated prior to an attack against civilian targets in ethnically mixed regions so that Serb forces could conduct indiscriminate shelling and wholesale random killings , safe in the knowledge that among the victimized population there were no ethnic Serbs .  
In this difficult moment , I wish to express my Government 's full solidarity with the UNPROFOR forces , particularly with the courageous Dutch soldiers operating in the Srebrenica territory , sharing the hardships of the civilian population they are protecting and facing overwhelmingly superior forces .  
During the Conference , deep concern was voiced over the recent brutal attacks carried out by Bosnian Serbs against United Nations-declared safe areas , special emphasis being given to the massacre of civilians and the continued policy of ethnic cleansing and atrocities committed against the civilian population . 
The Federal Government expects and demands that , proceeding from Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations , the international community , and the Security Council in particular , take immediate and resolute measures to put an end to the aggression and the killing of the innocent civilian population and the prevention of ethnic cleansing and to see to it that Croatian armed forces withdraw to the separation lines established by the relevant resolutions of the Security Council .  
Should evidence surface that unlawful acts were committed , we are determined to bring to justice all those responsible for violations of international humanitarian law , as would anyway be the case with any individual who would be responsible for crimes committed , in particular , against civilian population .  
By the horrifying indiscriminate mass artillery and missile bombardment of predominantly civilian targets in all the towns of Serb Krajina , Croatia unambiguously demonstrated that one of its main goals , apart from imposing its sovereignty over Krajina , was to inflict heavy losses on the civilian population and by so doing incite a mass exodus of Serbs in order to create an ethnically pure Croat state .  
The report also noted that URNG had committed human rights violations and had failed to observe the commitment to end the suffering of the civilian population by making threats and taking action against civilian property for the purpose of collecting " war tax " ; by unnecessarily endangering civilians not involved in the conflict during attacks on military bases and units ; by laying mines and explosive devices in places where civilians work , live or circulate ; and by taking reprisals . 
As a result of insufficient communications infrastructure , unreliable municipal power supply , as well as basic operational needs of the civilian staff and civilian police , an unforeseen expenditure amount of $ 87,100 was required for communication circuits to Port-au-Prince , Les Cayes , Gona \ x { 9d33 } es , and Cap Ha \ x { 9ba0 } ien , two-way radios for the CIVPOL vehicles , batteries , inverters , transformers , and telephone and UHF base installations .  
While the number of those killed , beaten , detained and sexually assaulted remains unknown , consistent accounts by displaced persons and United Nations personnel lead to a strong presumption that Bosnian Serb soldiers committed substantial violations of international humanitarian law following the fall of Srebrenica , including mass arbitrary detention of civilian men and boys , and summary executions .  
Growing stocks of surplus fissile material from the military sector and growing amounts of plutonium in civilian fuel cycles make accountancy and control an urgent task of paramount importance .  
On many occasions in the past we have declared that the practice of waging indiscriminate attacks against a defenceless civilian population is a particularly heinous practice that is totally unacceptable under every standard of civil society .  
The question must be raised : what possible moral authority do NATO and the United Nations have to pursue a relentless campaign of mass bombardment of the Republic of Srpska , causing unprecedented material damage and numerous civilian casualties ?  
It aims at training senior managers of Chinese military enterprises for conversion to production of civilian goods for the domestic and world markets , and facilitating joint ventures by bringing together major domestic and international investors from the private sector in the most attractive and committed Chinese enterprises .  
Priorities included : ( a ) regaining access to civilian populations in areas controlled by factions ; ( b ) preparing a new appeal for humanitarian assistance requirements ; ( c ) meeting the emergency needs of newly displaced populations ; and ( d ) developing a cohesive and shared strategy to meet the needs of the greatest possible number of affected civilians .  
It was also agreed that funds reserved for the civilian component of the Mission should be increased to enable it to deploy constitutional legal experts , human rights monitors and mediators , and to facilitate the process of dialogue and national reconciliation in Burundi .  
The teams found evidence of extrajudicial executions , disappearances , ill treatment , harassment and the systematic and widespread destruction of houses and entire villages carried out by members of the Croatian Army and internal security forces in the Krajina against the remaining civilian population , mostly elderly men and women .  
Although some of the problems raised , such as remuneration of personnel employed in peace-keeping operations and more extensive use of United Nations Volunteers is of concern to JIU and are actually reflected in its report on staffing of the United Nations peace-keeping and related missions ( civilian component ) ( JIU / REP / 93 / 6 ) , it is difficult to make any substantive comments without access to the original records .  
For the period starting on 1 May 1995 up to 31 October 1995 , the MINUSAL team was composed of 11 Professionals , headed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General at the assistant secretary-general level , supported by 8 civilian police , 1 internationally recruited General Service staff and 15 local level staff .  
The travel of international civilian personnel to the mission area has been calculated at an average cost of $ 5,800 per person per round trip ( basic air fare $ 3,500 and 100 kilograms of unaccompanied baggage ( $ 2,300 ) ) , based on actual recent expenditures .  
It is anticipated that one of the areas to be developed is joint peace-keeping seminars , co-sponsored by national staff colleges and the United Nations , with a view to increasing general knowledge and understanding of peace-keeping for mid-level and senior military and civilian officers .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
To supplement premises provided by the Government of Angola under the terms of the status-of-forces agreement , and taking into account the total number of military and civilian personnel of the Verification Mission , UNAVEM requires the continued rental of additional premises for residential and office accommodation at Mission headquarters at Luanda and at six regional headquarters .  
Taking into account the vast area of the country , its ravaged infrastructure and the total number of military and civilian personnel to be mobilized throughout the Mission area , the services of these aircraft are considered essential in accomplishing the operational requirements of the Mission .  
Human rights action teams established by UNCRO , conducting on-site investigations , found " evidence of extrajudicial executions , disappearances , ill treatment , harassment and the systematic and widespread destruction of houses and entire villages carried out by members of the Croatian Army and internal security forces in Krajina against the remaining civilian population , mostly elderly men and women " .  
During the transitional period , civilian tasks include ensuring that refugees and displaced persons can return , supervising property matters , monitoring human rights , re-establishing the normal functioning of all public services , coordinating international support and assistance and organizing and monitoring the conduct of elections .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
United States government civilian employees assigned overseas may receive a taxable post differential of up to 25 per cent of basic salary for posting to duty stations where " extraordinarily difficult or notably unhealthful conditions or excessive physical hardships " exist .  
The living quarters allowance is intended to reimburse United States government civilian employees for costs for a temporary residence or housing whenever Government-owned or rented housing is not provided ( including rent , heat , light , fuel , gas , electricity , water and taxes , insurance and agent 's fees required by law or custom to be paid by the lessee ) .  
These heinous criminal acts , however , were preceded by 170 counts of barbaric and random rocket attack on civilian targets in the heavily crowded residential sectors of the city on 11 November 1995 , which caused the death of 39 citizens of the capital , including schoolgirls and a team of film-makers , and vast destruction of the city , in this regard , I submitted a letter dated 13 November 1995 addressed to you ( see S / 1995 / 950 ) . 
about continuing indiscriminate and deliberate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers ,  
with interest that the Government of Nigeria , on 1 October 1995 , affirmed the principle of multi-party democracy , announcing its intent to accept the principle of power-sharing , lift the ban on political activity and the press , devolve power to local levels of government and subordinate the military to civilian authority , but disappointed that only limited action in this regard has followed ,  
with mounting concern the prolongation , and in some regions the intensification , of armed hostilities among the parties in the country , including indiscriminate attacks on civilians and other violations of international humanitarian law , which have caused significant civilian casualties , displaced populations and destruction of the economic and social infrastructure of the country , in spite of repeated calls by the Security Council and the Secretary-General for a cessation of hostilities ,  
with mounting concern the prolongation , and in some regions the intensification , of armed hostilities among the parties in the country , including indiscriminate attacks on civilians and other violations of international humanitarian law , which have caused significant civilian casualties , displaced populations and destruction of the economic and social infrastructure of the country , in spite of repeated calls by the Security Council and the Secretary-General for a cessation of hostilities ,  
the absence of precise information concerning the operational requirements of each mission , the cost estimates have been based on the average cost per person per day of military personnel and civilian police derived from the commitment authorization of $ 115,373,000 gross ( $ 113,866,300 net ) provided by the General Assembly for the month of December 1995 .  
additional relevant Security Council resolutions , in particular resolutions 824 ( 1993 ) of 6 May 1993 and 836 ( 1993 ) of 4 June 1993 , in which the Council declared that Sarajevo , Tuzla , _ epa , Gora _ de , Biha _ , Srebrenica and their surroundings should be treated as safe areas , that international humanitarian agencies should be given free and unimpeded access to those areas and that there should be freedom of movement for the civilian population and humanitarian goods to , from and within the areas ,  
about continuing indiscriminate and deliberate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers ,  
with interest that the Government of Nigeria , on 1 October 1995 , affirmed the principle of multi-party democracy , announcing its intent to accept the principle of power-sharing , lift the ban on political activity and the press , devolve power to local levels of government and subordinate the military to civilian authority , but disappointed that only limited action in this regard has followed ,  
the past year , there had been increasing reports of slavery and forced labour of women and children belonging to racial , ethnic and religious minorities ; of atrocities against indigenous peoples ; of indiscriminate aerial bombardments against civilian targets , and of unaccompanied minors being conscripted into military service .  
Through its current operation Israel has demonstrated once again its utter contempt for Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) , as well the Charter provisions and principles of international law governing relations between States . My delegation regards this military action , which has brought about scores of casualties among the civilian population , particularly among women and children , as unconscionable . 
It is difficult for us to see how the firing of Katyusha rockets by Hezbollah into northern Israel , condemnable as it is , can be equated with the Israeli artillery bombardments , sea and air attacks and other missile attacks directed at the civilian populations in Lebanese villages , towns and cities , resulting in many deaths , enormous suffering and extensive destruction of property .  
The mechanisms must have a unified and clearly defined command and control structure ensuring the orderly and effective discharge of the mandate assigned to them , and precise coordination of the political , military , humanitarian , civilian and administrative components of any activity must be ensured ;  
When wars break out , once the weapons have fallen silent , the painful aftermath remains , including millions of landmines , which have a devastating , extremely deadly effect , scattered in fields and under roads and have a massive impact on civilian populations , primarily on children . 
But how many millions of these cold , cruel and silent enemies still await our unsuspecting and innocent civilian population in remote areas of the country near the western border ? 
Success in reforms , promotion of the private sector and direct foreign investment , increased activity in the democratic process and the strengthening of civilian society are essential elements of an Agenda for Development , and to a large extent depend on the support of the international community , in terms of resources and political will .  
On another level , this blockade , which has continued for more than 35 years , constitutes a violation of international humanitarian law , because it has led to unimaginable human suffering among the Cuban civilian population by imposing restrictions on the sovereign right of Cuba to develop economic relations with other countries .  
But how many millions of these cold , cruel and silent enemies still await our unsuspecting and innocent civilian population in remote areas of the country near the western border ? 
The suffering they inflict upon civilian populations , their detrimental effects on economic and social development , especially in areas infested with landmines , and the hefty financial burdens , as well as the technological limitations involved in their detection and de-activation , are undeniable . 
The occupation itself constituted the primary violation of the human rights of the civilian population and was the source of other violations and harsh practices by the occupying Israeli authorities , including closure and sealing of the occupied territories , land confiscation , the demolition of Palestinian homes , the detention of Palestinians , and the killing of Palestinians by military and undercover security forces .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
Although the Security Council meets far away from the scene of the events we are discussing today , and although we are not subject to the difficulties faced by the people in the field , I believe it is important that the personnel of the United Nations civilian and military should be aware of our solidarity with them and understanding of the difficult tasks and living conditions that they have to face .  
In welcoming the special envoy of the Secretary-General , Mrs . Sadako Ogata , United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , the Prime Minister went even further , and announced the mechanisms planned as a means to establishing permanent consultation on security measures between the military and civilian authorities concerned and the representatives of United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations .  
However , through our civil military cooperation ( CIMIC ) operations IFOR has established an effective mechanism to coordinate activities with the many international non-governmental and other civilian organizations contributing to the reconstruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
Bildt was invited to meet the NAC on 17 January where he acknowledged the efficient deployment of IFOR and the adequacy of the Peace Agreement structures , outlined the important civilian tasks ahead and emphasized that reconciliation between all the parties was the key to a stable and lasting peace .  
We also welcome the remarkable work carried out every day , frequently in dangerous conditions on the ground , by local and foreign humanitarian organizations and the various programmes , United Nations organs and international institutions to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population and to aid in the rebuilding of the country .  
They engaged in such hostile and provocative actions as breaking the sound barrier over civilian sites , dropping heat flares over agricultural land and intercepting and provoking Iraqi civilian vessels .  
Lightly armed peace-keepers and unarmed civilians were sent into areas of active warfare , where their courageous efforts helped to save untold human lives and to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population .  
In addition , we are very concerned about the continued UNITA military activity in some regions of the country , in a pattern of military movement without prior notification to UNAVEM III and of isolated attacks and ambushes against civilian and military targets alike , almost always resulting in a loss of human life . 
Hiding behind a " living shield " of members of the Government forces , they are continuing attacks which are compelling the command of the armed forces of the Republic of Tajikistan to abandon the positions occupied by it in order to avoid unjustified losses of life among military personnel and the civilian population .  
Noting with mounting concern the prolongation , and in some regions the intensification , of armed hostilities among the parties in the country , including indiscriminate attacks on civilians and other violations of international humanitarian law which have caused significant civilian casualties , displaced populations and destruction of the economic and social infrastructure of the country , in spite of repeated calls by the Security Council and the Secretary-General for a cessation of hostilities ,  
To establish or strengthen operational coordination machinery for the competent institutions so as to increase the effectiveness of national and regional efforts to combat crime and all threats to democratic security necessitating the use of military , security or civilian police forces , such as terrorism , illicit arms trafficking , drug trafficking and organized crime ;  
The permanent communications mechanism which the Parties undertake to establish and put into operation in order to facilitate secure , efficient and rapid communications among the respective competent civilian , military and public security authorities and between them and the Security Commission , with a view to preventing incidents , responding to alerts and contributing to the fulfilment of the objectives and obligations set forth in this Treaty . Article 61 .  
The mechanisms must have a unified and clearly defined command and control structure ensuring the orderly and effective discharge of the mandate assigned to them , and precise coordination of the political , military , humanitarian , civilian and administrative components of any activity must be ensured ;  
Although only the Government can put most of these commitments into effect , URNG , in addition to recognizing the need to put an end to the suffering of the civilian population and to respect the human rights of wounded , captured and disabled combatants , also undertook , inter alia , " to respect the inherent attributes of the human person and to contribute to the effective enjoyment of human rights " ( Comprehensive Agreement , fourth preambular paragraph ) .  
Progress in the political transition , for instance , the consolidation of new democratic institutions , the convergence of opinions in favour of the primacy of civilian authority , the normal conduct of elections , the emergence of new forms of representation of civil society and the national consensus surrounding the broadening of the political sectors incorporated in the Congress of the Republic .  
It ensures the proper application of the Organization 's policies and procedures relating to the assignment , recruitment and administration of civilian personnel in peace-keeping and other field missions as appropriate ; ensures the timely preparation of proposed staffing tables for new and expanded missions according to operational plans derived from Security Council decisions ; ensures the timely provision of civilian personnel to field missions ; and serves as a point of contract for information required by the Organization 's intergovernmental and expert bodies , as well as representatives of Member States .  
This seminar will provide instruction in the development of peace-keeping training methods and programmes to a select group of military and civilian police officers who already have previous United Nations peace-keeping experience and who are presently involved in peace-keeping training at the national level , or will likely become involved in the future .  
Since lasting democracy requires the solid foundation of law , the process of building a functioning judicial system and a professional civilian police force in Haiti is of paramount importance for the future of that country .  
The most updated theory of international aviation law states than an aircraft designed for " civilian " air transport belonging to a private airline and operated by a civilian crew may in a particular situation be considered to be " State aircraft " if it performs a military , customs or police function . . .  Other aircraft , besides those involved in military , customs or police services , could also be considered " State aircraft " because the enumeration in the Convention is not preclusive .  
The three country studies are being complemented by comparative analyses of selected United Nations missions , interviews with key personnel in civilian and military peace-keeping as well as national policy makers ; analyses of United Nations documentation and reports with a view to improving coordination between Headquarters and field commanders ; and review of press reports to gauge public reaction to the way in which peace-keeping operations are conducted .  
The continuing presence of the international civilian personnel and local staff in the mission area during the withdrawal period is required to provide uninterrupted administrative support to the contingents and to ensure the recovery , collection , disposal and shipment of the United Nations-owned and leased assets , hand-over of rented premises , and settlement of commercial contracts and agreements with the local vendors . 
Recalling also additional Security Council resolutions , in particular resolutions 824 ( 1993 ) of 6 May 1993 and 836 ( 1993 ) of 4 June 1993 , in which the Council declared that Sarajevo , Tuzla , _ epa , Gora _ de , Biha _ , Srebrenica and their surroundings should be treated as safe areas , that international humanitarian agencies should be given free and unimpeded access to those areas and that there should be freedom of movement for the civilian population and humanitarian goods to , from and within the areas ,  
Concerned about continuing indiscriminate and deliberate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers ,  
Noting with interest that the Government of Nigeria , on 1 October 1995 , affirmed the principle of multi-party democracy , announcing its intent to accept the principle of power-sharing , lift the ban on political activity and the press , devolve power to local levels of government and subordinate the military to civilian authority , but disappointed that only limited action in this regard has followed ,  
The cost of the mission for the 12-month period amounts to $ 7,302,500 gross ( $ 6,795,200 net ) and provides for 44 military observers , maintenance and operating costs for 38 United Nations-owned vehicles , one air support helicopter and one fixed-wing aircraft for supply purposes and overall logistic support and civilian support of 24 international and 35 local staff .  
The Advisory Committee inquired as to the administrative , organizational and resource requirements for UNFICYP 's humanitarian activities and was informed that a military unit comprising from 15 to 20 personnel , including civilian local level staff , was involved in this activity . 
As indicated in the executive summary of the report of the Secretary-General , the cost estimate of $ 17.1-million gross provides for a strength of 135 military observers and 139 civilian staff ( 64 international and 75 local ) and reflects " a moderate increase over the prior period " .  
Taking into account the geographical size of the Mission area and the number of military and civilian personnel and the premises of UNAVEM III , it is considered essential that personnel from the aforementioned sections be deployed in the regional headquarters to administer and monitor related activities under the supervision of their respective sections at Mission headquarters .  
In the light of the review of the overall staffing structure of the civilian administration of UNAVEM and its current operational requirements , the proposed staffing reflects an increase of 57 international posts ( 3 P-3 , 5 P-2 / P-1 , 27 General Service ( Other level ) and 22 Field Service ) which is offset by a decrease of 57 posts ( 5 General Service ( Principal level ) and 52 local ) , the total number of staff remaining at its currently authorized level of 714 .  
As the Mission approaches full deployment and with the operations of the logistic support service contract , emphasis was given to the strengthening of selected areas of administration and integrated support services to ensure optimum efficiency in the utilization of human resources and the timely provision of services to military and civilian personnel .  
Upon instructions from my Government , I have the honour to request Your Excellency to convene an urgent meeting of the Security Council to consider the grave situation in Lebanon resulting from the large-scale Israeli bombardment of many towns and villages in my country , including the southern suburb of Beirut , causing alarming numbers of civilian dead and wounded , thousands of displaced persons and severe damage to property .  
The United States is now engaged in an intensive diplomatic effort to restore calm and establish a more stable situation in the area which would enhance the security and well-being of the civilian population of both southern Lebanon and northern Israel .  
Israel 's premeditated and unbridled aerial and artillery attacks over the past five days against many civilian quarters in towns and villages of Lebanon , including the southern suburbs of Beirut , and its naval blockade of the port of Beirut are prime examples of acts of terrorism by Israeli policy makers , who all too readily and conveniently label others either as terrorists or as supporters of terrorists . 
The Chinese delegation expresses its profound concern at the large-scale military offensive launched by Israel in recent days in southern Lebanon , which has resulted in the loss of innocent civilian lives , the massive destruction of property and a large number of civilians ' becoming homeless or refugees , consequently further escalating the conflict in southern Lebanon and aggravating the already tense situation .  
In the meantime , Mr . Cassoulides , the official spokesman of the Greek Cypriot administration , has confirmed that in the context of the so-called " joint defence doctrine " the construction in south Cyprus of an air force base for Greece is effectively under way , and that the existing Paphos airport has already been closed to civilian air traffic for this purpose .  
In paragraph 3 of its resolution 900 ( 1994 ) of 4 March 1994 , the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to appoint , for a limited period , a senior civilian official who would draw up an overall assessment and plan of action for the restoration of essential public services in the various opstinas of Sarajevo , other than the city of Pale , and who would assist the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , in close coordination with all relevant local authorities , in the implementation of the plan .  
I should like to inform you that United States warplanes operating from bases in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are continuing to violate the airspace of the Republic of Iraq and are engaging in acts of reconnaissance , breaking the sound barrier and dropping heat flares over public and private property in the north and south of Iraq , causing damage and spreading alarm among the civilian population .  
The progress achieved in the peace negotiations and the temporary suspension of offensive and counterrevolutionary activity have created new conditions capable of permitting decisive progress in fulfilling the commitment to eradicate the suffering the internal armed confrontation has caused for the civilian population and of building confidence in the peace process .  
The Mission is deeply concerned at the continuation of this practice , which , given the army 's historic influence over such committees , undermines the primacy of civilian authority and also affects the human rights situation , in that members of the voluntary civil defence committees and former military commissioners are implicated in numerous complaints of human rights violations .  
These incursive and cruel activities which resulted in numerous human casualties and material damages to civilian population constitute a grave violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Islamic Republic of Iran .  
It urges you to intervene with the Government of the United States of America with a view to halting and preventing any repetition of hostile acts in flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law that are being committed by a State that is a permanent member of the Security Council against another Member State of the United Nations whose sovereignty , security and territorial integrity are thereby threatened and whose civilian population is thereby left in a state of alarm .  
The revised cost estimates submitted in document A / 50 / 696 / Add . 1 of 30 October 1995 amounted to $ 890,230,900 gross ( $ 881,791,500 net ) , compared to the original estimates of $ 1,013,629,900 gross ( $ 1,002,021,100 net ) and took into consideration reduced requirements for military and civilian personnel , rental of premises , transport operations , air operations and the purchase of equipment .  
On the contrary , armed forces fighting the Afghan Government would find such a situation very convenient for further expanding their acts of aggression including the firing of artillery and rockets on the civilian population of the capital and other acts against the humanitarian laws .  NULLAs far as the implementation of the arms embargo against the armed groups fighting the Government is concerned , these groups are not legal subjects of international law .  
The objectives of the review were to determine whether the management structure of the civilian component was appropriate in providing the necessary support service to UNPF , to assess the adequacy of management systems and internal controls and to ascertain whether the use of United Nations resources ( human , physical and financial ) was adequately planned , organized , directed and monitored , and whether value for money was achieved .  
These included changing mandates and constant uncertainties in the Mission , delays in budgetary authorization , delays in issuing budgetary allotments , cumbersome and inflexible procurement procedures , lack of experienced United Nations staff , frequent rotation of military personnel , difficulty in integrating military and civilian components and intractability of some local authorities with respect to their obligations under the various status of forces agreements . 
Cuba considers that the considerable problems with anti-personnel mines experienced by a number of third world countries are due in large part , if we limit ourselves to the most direct causes , to the unscrupulous export policies which have been extensively practised by several developed countries ; these have made substantial profits from such operations and taken little account of the impact on the civilian populations of many countries .  
Growing stocks of surplus fissile material from the military sector and growing amounts of plutonium in civilian fuel cycles make accountancy and control an urgent task of paramount importance .  
It recently took concrete form , as everyone knows , through the freezing of the Israeli withdrawal from Hebron , the refusal to resume negotiations on the final situation in the occupied Palestinian territories , the return to the policy of settlements , the blocking off of the Palestinian territories , the confiscation of Arab lands and the collective economic sanctions and daily acts of violence against the unarmed civilian population .  
In view of the sharp exacerbation of the crisis in Afghanistan , a meeting of the Security Council must be held immediately with the participation of the countries concerned for the purpose of drawing up urgent measures to halt the bloodshed , bring about a political settlement of the conflict and extend assistance to the civilian population and the numerous refugees .  
Despite the interest expressed in these projects , inter alia , by the countries where these peacekeeping missions are carried out , subsequent project proposals related to training needs of the civilian police of the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia , Baranja and Western Sirmium ( UNTAES ) , the International Police Task Force ( IPTF ) of the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina ( UNMIBH ) and the local police forces , including the establishment of a focal point for strengthening of criminal justice institutions , have so far received little support .  
In my view , the presence and assistance of the international community will continue to be required beyond November 1996 to help the Government of Haiti set up a professional , well - managed and well-equipped civilian police and ensure that a stable environment will be consolidated , that democracy will take root and that economic and social development will translate into a visible improvement of the living conditions of the people . 
I should also like to reiterate my firm conviction that the continued presence of United Nations civilian police monitors is contingent upon the existence of a secure environment maintained by a credible international military force ( see S / 1995 / 1031 , para .  29 ) .  
The Advisory Committee was informed that voluntary contributions had been received in the amount of $ 12.3-million from the Governments of Canada ( $ 1.7-million ) and the United States of America ( $ 10.6-million ) to provide for all direct and indirect costs of 670 troops , including the standard troop cost reimbursement and allowances , contingent-owned equipment reimbursement , death and disability compensation , rations , fuel , miscellaneous supplies , logistics support services and civilian staff required for administrative purposes , for the period from 1 July to 30 November 1996 .  
The revised cost estimates for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 amounted to $ 31,902,000 gross and reflected a 39 per cent decrease in gross terms in comparison with the original cost estimates , taking into account that it provided for the reduced strength of 230 military observers and 9 civilian police observers , supported by a civilian establishment of 167 personnel ( 102 international and 65 local ) and 2 observers from the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) .  
Further , a multitude of executive orders criminalizing far too many aspects of normal civilian conduct , prescribing grossly disproportionate penalties and authorizing arrest and detention without judicial review , leads the Special Rapporteur to conclude that a significant percentage of all arrests and detentions are arbitrary when measured by international standards .  
While judicial guarantees set out in the now defunct Constitution , according to the Government , do not apply , through correspondence received by the Centre for Human Rights , the former Special Rapporteur had been informed by the Government of Myanmar that those elaborated in the Code of Criminal Procedure applied in all cases heard in civilian courts even when the detention was carried out under a SLORC order or an emergency regulation .  
At the same time , the absence of an independent judiciary , coupled with a host of executive orders criminalizing far too many aspects of normal civilian conduct , prescribing enormously disproportionate penalties and authorizing arrest and detention without judicial review or any other form of judicial authorization , leads the Special Rapporteur to conclude that a significant percentage of all arrests and detentions in Myanmar are arbitrary when measured by generally accepted international standards .  
We propose that a special meeting of the Security Council of the United Nations should be held without delay , with the participation of interested countries , with a view to adopting urgent measures to halt the fighting and achieve a comprehensive political settlement of the Afghan conflict , and to arrange for the provision by the international community of humanitarian assistance to the civilian population and refugees .  
Since then , agreements have been concluded on human rights ; the resettlement of persons displaced by the armed conflict ; the establishment of the historical clarification commission ; the identity and rights of indigenous peoples ; social and economic aspects and the agrarian situation ; and now , the strengthening of civilian power and the role of the armed forces in a democratic society .  
It is vitally important to strengthen civilian power as the expression of the will of the people through the exercise of political rights , reinforce the legislative branch , reform the administration of justice and guarantee public security , all of which are crucial for the enjoyment of civil liberties and rights ; and , within a democratic institutional framework , it is incumbent upon the Guatemalan armed forces to discharge the essential task of protecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity ,  
In that connection , based on the updated deployment table contained in annex V , the inclusion of 8 additional international staff and 25 local staff for six months , the application of the Zagreb salary scales for local staff as at 1 July 1996 and the inclusion under common staff costs of provision for contributions to the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund for local staff , the net reduction to civilian staff costs is only $ 642,000 .  
The " policies " and " practices " affecting human rights that came within the scope of investigation by the Special Committee referred , in the case of " policies " , to any course of action consciously adopted and pursued by the Government of Israel as part of its declared or undeclared intent ; while " practices " referred to those actions which , irrespective of whether or not they were in implementation of a policy , reflected a pattern of behaviour on the part of the Israeli authorities towards the civilian population in the occupied areas .  
The Inspectors note that the questions raised and recommendations made in the report are similar in nature to those contained in the JIU report entitled " Staffing of the United Nations peace-keeping and related missions ( civilian component ) " ( JIU / REP / 93 / 6 , annex ) which , although not referenced in the report , was welcomed by the Secretary-General as a valuable and timely contribution to both the planning and management aspects of field operations and approved by the General Assembly .  
Those constraints included the numerous changes in its mandate , as well as other uncertainties in its operating environment , delays in budgetary authorization , cumbersome and inflexible procurement practices and procedures , a lack of experienced United Nations staff , the frequent rotation of personnel , the difficulty of integrating military and civilian components , and the intractability of some local authorities with respect to their obligations under the various status-of-forces agreements .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
This biased attitude of the republic of Croatia is evident also in the report of Ms . Elizabeth Rehn of 14 March 1996 , which contains ( on pp . 62-86 ) numerous examples of human rights violations , killings , and mistreatment of the civilian population , destruction of private property , prevention of the return of refugees and so on effected by wilful extremists whose behaviour escapes control .  
For that period the General Assembly had appropriated a total amount of $ 11,948,718 gross and the actual expenditure had been $ 9,978,000 gross : the unencumbered balance of $ 1,970,718 gross had resulted from a number of factors , in particular the release of fixed-wing aircraft earlier than had been anticipated , and savings on civilian personnel costs owing mainly to the fact that the vacancy rate had been higher than expected . 
The Committee advised applicant States wishing to undertake energy-related exports to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for humanitarian purposes , that it was not in a position to approve the supply of energy-related products to the country for general distribution ; however , without prejudice to its final decision , the Committee expressed readiness to consider requests for authorization of shipments of strictly limited quantities of fuel targeting specific end-users among the most vulnerable groups of civilian population and for purely humanitarian purposes .  
The multidimensional , intra-State nature of conflicts required that United Nations peacekeeping operations should be equipped with the skills to tackle a variety of military , political , humanitarian and civilian problems .  
Concrete measures which had been identified included improved police training methods , a protection programme for witnesses of human rights violations , assistance to victims of violent crimes , transfer to civilian courts of competence to try military police crimes , and federal investigation of human rights violations .  
Although the establishment of a rapidly deployable mission headquarters was a constructive step , it would not be a panacea for the range of problems experienced in previous United Nations peacekeeping missions ; it would provide operational and planning improvements , however , and would enable the United Nations to deploy more quickly to the field a well-prepared and jointly trained team of military and civilian personnel in the most critical phase of peacekeeping operations .  
The civilian component of the mission , acting under the broadened political mandate thus granted to my Special Representative , has assisted in bringing together various segments of the population in an effort to promote mutual understanding between communities , monitor human rights and ease political and inter-ethnic tensions within the country .  
Please provide information on all the measures adopted pursuant to article 38 , paragraph 4 , and in accordance with the State 's obligations under international humanitarian law to protect the civilian population in armed conflicts , including measures of a legislative , administrative , budgetary and other nature , to ensure the protection and care of children who are affected by an armed conflict .  
Concerned about continuing deliberate and indiscriminate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers involved in Operation Lifeline Sudan and international private voluntary agencies ,  
In order to meet the increasing demand for the participation of civilian police in United Nations peacekeeping operations , as well as their enhanced role in fostering the political reconciliation process and the promotion of peace between warring factions , the Secretary-General will address this issue in the context of future budgetary proposals , as appropriate .  
The suffering of the Afghan civilian population , who continue to bear the main brunt of the civil war , and the dangers that that war creates for regional stability , oblige the international community to intensify its search for a peaceful solution , despite the fact that certain Afghan parties seem to continue to favour the military option .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
The cost estimates contained in annex III to document A / 50 / 696 / Add . 4 covered the pre-liquidation period from 1 January to 30 June 1996 and provided for the repatriation travel of 309 military observers and 7,463 contingent personnel , as well as for the maintenance of an average monthly strength of 1,237 contingent personnel , 293 international civilian staff , 458 local staff , 725 international contractual personnel and 23 United Nations Volunteers .  
UNMIBH was established pursuant to annex 11 of the Peace Agreement to assist the parties in their obligations of providing a safe and secure environment for all persons in their respective jurisdictions , by maintaining civilian law enforcement agencies operating in accordance with internationally recognized standards and with respect for internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Concerned about continuing deliberate and indiscriminate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers involved in Operation Lifeline Sudan and international private voluntary agencies ,  
Calls upon the Government of Myanmar and other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully the obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , [ 117 ] to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population and to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law , and to avail itself of such services as may be offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
Security Council resolution 1080 ( 1996 ) established a two-part mandate for the multinational force : facilitating the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the effective delivery by civilian relief organizations of humanitarian aid to alleviate the immediate suffering of displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire ; and facilitating the voluntary , orderly repatriation of refugees by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as well as the voluntary return of displaced persons .  
Secondly , the reasons for raising the minimum age to 18 years are not only associated with recruitment methods but with the physical , psychosocial and emotional impact on the young person , the teaching of military skills and attitudes and the deprivation of opportunities to develop educational and social skills more appropriate for civilian life .  
A number of major causes of the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina have yet to be removed and it is only the continuing sound international presence , both military and civilian , that can prevent the resumption of hostilities even on a minor scale .  
While peacekeeping , civilian , humanitarian , economic , social , and political activities are all part of the integrated process of peace-building , special attention should be given to the observance of the norms and principles of international law , including international humanitarian law .  
The ICRC is particularly concerned with emergency situations arising from armed conflict and internal violence , which are often marked by widespread and urgent needs among the civilian population and by the breakdown of political , economic and civic institutions .  
I should like to conclude my remarks by expressing the Government of Japan \ x { e5b8 } deep appreciation to all the countries and international institutions that are engaged in the noble and difficult tasks , both civilian and military , that are required for the implementation of the Peace Agreement .  
This is the response of the international community aimed at achieving a complete ban on these treacherous and barbarous weapons , which are contrary to international humanitarian law , so that future generations will be free from the suffering of today \ x { e5b8 } civilian victims , in particular children .  
The treaty represents a solid international humanitarian commitment to alleviate the cruel and indiscriminate suffering caused by mines which have been placed throughout the world , affecting innocent civilian populations , and also to provide assistance to facilitate their rehabilitation and their social reintegration .  
In such conflicts , particularly in the case of a civil war , it is often difficult to determine which party is guilty of violating the peace , and the sanctions themselves may be indiscriminate , non-specific and , consequently ineffective and may only increase the already excessive burdens and sufferings borne by the innocent civilian population .  
It follows that any sanctions should be part of the search for a long-term political settlement of the conflict , reflect the strategic goals of the entire international community , take account of the political and " physical " ( in terms of death and suffering among the civilian population and the destruction of material values ) cost of such actions .  
We further call upon the international community and all its relevant institutions to meet their responsibility to halt these violations forthwith , to ensure the necessary protection for all missing persons , detainees and prisoners and to put an end to practices involving violence and threat of violence that have the basic purpose of spreading terror among the innocent civilian inhabitants of the area and uprooting them .  
Concerned about continuing deliberate and indiscriminate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers involved in Operation Lifeline Sudan and with international private voluntary agencies ,  
Calls upon the Government of Myanmar and other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully the obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , [ 8 ] to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law and to avail itself of such services as may be offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
The resettlement and integration verification area would consist of the Chief ( P-5 ) , one-P-4 to liaise with the international and national institutions responsible for the resettlement of displaced persons , one P-3 ( local ) to deal with the legal aspects of repatriation and documentation of ex-combatants , one military liaison officer , and one civilian police observer , supported by three Local level staff .  
This concern has found expression at the meetings , seminars and study groups held in various parts of the world that have considered the grievous suffering caused by the sanctions and by the embargo and that have addressed urgent appeals to the United Nations and the international community as a whole for action to lift the sanctions imposed on the Iraqi people and to enable that people , through the use of its own resources and capacities , to secure the provision of its basic civilian needs . 
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , their expulsion from their land , the bombardment of peaceful villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;  
Greatly concerned , the Islamic State of Afghanistan wishes to request you to take appropriate preventive measures in order to halt the planned massive military assault which would inevitably entail the loss of many lives of the innocent civilian population .  
Calls upon the Government of Guatemala , URNG and Guatemalan society as a whole to make every possible effort to familiarize the Guatemalan people with the content of the Peace agreements as quickly as possible , to ensure the full participation of the people in building the new multi _ ethnic , multicultural and plurilingual nation , establishing a democratic society with social justice , initiating a period of sustained and sustainable economic and social development and ensuring the pre _ eminence of civilian authority in national decision _ making ;  
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , their expulsion from their land , the bombardment of peaceful villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;  
Calls upon all parties to the hostilities to respect fully the applicable provisions of international humanitarian law including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , to halt the use of weapons , including landmines , against the civilian population and to protect all civilians , especially women , members of minorities and children , from violations of human rights and humanitarian law , including forcible displacement , arbitrary detention , ill _ treatment , torture and summary executions ;  
Regarding crimes against humanity , article 3 of the statute of the International Tribunal for Rwanda stresses the prosecution of persons responsible for crimes " when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population on national , political , ethnic , racial or religious grounds " , that is , it does not associate those crimes primarily with armed conflicts .  
In an earlier report ( S / 25274 , para . 56 ) , the Commission stated that : " ' Ethnic cleansing ' has been carried out by means of murder , arbitrary arrest and detention , extra-judicial executions , rape and sexual assault , confinement of civilian population in ghetto areas , forcible removal , displacement and deportation of civilian population , deliberate military attacks or threats of attacks on civilians and civilian areas , and wanton destruction of property . "  
The ethnic factor , in conjunction with other political , economic , historical and cultural factors , is eating away at the fragile political ties in Africa , with the harrowing consequences of confrontation _ whose main victims are civilian populations _ and a resurgence of the crime of genocide .  
It is against this background of societies repeatedly traumatized by economic , social , cultural and other factors that such extreme situations develop , in which the breakdown of the institutional order opens the floodgates to widespread violence and massacres of the civilian population , frequently leading in the end to actual genocide .  
The Civil Affairs Unit has focused on the wide range of issues related to civilian reintegration , including the technical and substantive matters addressed in the 24 joint implementation committees and subcommittees which brought together Serb and Croat experts to resolve mutual problems .  
We urge the Government of Angola , and in particular UNITA , to make haste and complete the remaining political and military aspects of the peace process , including the normalization of State administration throughout the national territory in accordance with the agreed timetable and procedures ; the transformation of the UNITA radio station into a non-partisan broadcasting facility ; the registration and demobilization of all remaining military elements ; the elimination of all obstacles to the free circulation of people and goods ; and the disarmament of the civilian population .  
The permanent reintegration of ex-combatants into civilian life extends well beyond successful disarmament and is determined by whether or not there exist concrete , long-term options for obtaining a sustainable livelihood and participating in the social and political life of the country .  
Many of the overall civilian implementation tasks coordinated by my Office , such as the building of common institutions , supporting economic reconstruction , creating communications and transport links between the entities , and providing a basis for a functioning civil society are fundamental to creating the necessary conditions for the return of displaced persons and refugees .  
Their experience provided valuable input for the design of future peacekeeping missions , pointing to the need to accord a greater role to the civilian component and to ensure increased cooperation with local and national civic movements .  
I should like in the present letter to alert you to the fact that between 1 January and 30 June 1997 United States and other warplanes continued to violate the airspace of the Republic of Iraq from military bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and to engage in such hostile , provocative and inflammatory actions as the dropping of heat flares in civilian areas and on civilian installations in Iraq .  
With its leaner and more focused mandate , the Mission will undergo a corresponding reduction of its personnel and will thus complete its transformation from the large peacekeeping operation established in 1995 , with a strength of approximately 6,000 military and 700 civilian police personnel , to a contingent of 250 civilian police and a headquarters unit of 50 military personnel having full command and control over a voluntarily funded security element .  
Less than two weeks ago , through a presidential statement , the Security Council said that civilian police in peacekeeping operations carry our indispensable functions in monitoring and training national police forces , as well as in restoring civil order , supporting the rule of law and fostering reconciliation at the national level .  
With regard to Haiti , the establishment and training of a professional civilian police force will be a fundamental factor in maintaining peace and security and in ensuring the real and effective functioning of democratic institutions , the rule of law and full respect for human rights .  
Likewise , the categorized list contains certain items the export of which to Iraq must be notified to the joint unit established by Security Council resolution 1051 ( 1996 ) as these items will be subject to monitoring because of their possible dual use for civilian or for prohibited purposes under Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) and other relevant resolutions .  
At his initial appearance on 31 May 1996 before Trial Chamber I , composed of Judge Jorda ( presiding ) , Judge Odio-Benito and Judge Riad , Dra _ en Erdemovi _ pleaded guilty to one count of a crime against humanity for his participation in the summary execution of approximately 1,200 unarmed civilian Muslim men at a farm near Pilica , located in the Zvornik municipality of eastern Bosnia , following the fall of Srebrenica to Bosnian Serb forces in July 1995 .  
Provision of $ 1,519,800 is made for the salaries of international civilian personnel based on the phased reduction of personnel as detailed in the table contained in paragraph 22 of the main report and annex IV and includes the provision of eight person / months for the completion of residual administrative tasks in New York by the Chief Finance Officer ( P-4 ) and one Field Service staff member beyond 31 December 1997 .  
The replaced Taliban forces north of Kabul , however , are being brought daily to Kunduz civilian airport for further acts of genocide in northern Afghanistan , of which the ethnically oriented carnage and the burial in a mass grave on 14 September 1997 of more than 100 civilians in the village of Qizil-Abad , in northern Balkh province , as reported by the Reuters correspondent Alistair Lyon , is a testimony . 
While peacekeeping , civilian , humanitarian , economic , social and political activities are all part of the integrated process of peace-building , special attention should be given to the observance of the norms and principles of international law , including international humanitarian law .  
At the same time , the absence of an independent judiciary , coupled with a host of executive orders criminalizing far too many aspects of normal civilian conduct that prescribe enormously disproportionate penalties and authorize arrest and detention without judicial review or any other form of judicial authorization , leads the Special Rapporteur to conclude that a significant percentage of all arrests and detentions in Myanmar are arbitrary when measured against generally accepted international standards .  
The project covers five main areas of activity : human rights education and training for the judiciary , the military , the gendarmerie , the police , prison administration personnel , other civil servants and members of local human rights non-governmental organizations ; capacity-building in the sector of civilian and military justice ; capacity support for human rights non-governmental organizations ; the popularization of human rights through formal and informal education and promotion activities ; and support for genocide victims and vulnerable groups .  
On the other hand , it was generally assumed by the Panel members that the measures for prevention should be applied primarily to the small arms and light weapons manufactured to military specifications , because in this case the question has to be addressed on a global basis and because the issue of civilian firearms regulation is currently being taken up by the United Nations Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice .  
The visits to Kibungo Prison and the communal cachots and the discussions with the civilian , military , prison and judicial officials who met with the Special Representative provided valuable insight into the prevailing conditions of detention and the urgency of conducting fair and effective criminal trials for those accused of genocide and related acts .  
As documented in the present report and in previous reports , these restrictions relate primarily to access by Operation Lifeline Sudan to needy populations , whether in the form of relief flights from the base at Lokichokio into southern Sudan , humanitarian action in favour of the over 2-million internally displaced persons living in and around greater Khartoum , or permission to assess the conditions of civilian populations in the Nuba Mountains or in new areas of need created as a result of a resurgence of hostilities .  
A matter of particular concern was that the unregulated use of sanctions had resulted in unnecessary suffering for innocent civilian populations ; sanctions should be imposed only as a last resort , and the proposals for ameliorating the plight of third States must be carefully studied .  
Crimes against humanity require that certain capital crimes ( such as murder , extermination , imprisonment , torture , rape or persecution on political , racial and religious grounds ) are committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack against any civilian population on national , political , ethnical , racial or religious grounds .  
Calls upon the Government of Myanmar and other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully the obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , [ 8 ] to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law and to avail itself of such services as may be offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
New policy perspectives coordinating the commercial , consumer and strategic requirements on a national and international level needed to be established , and the dialogue between military , industry and civilian users needed to be extended .  
The unencumbered balance resulted mainly from savings attributable to lower deployment of civilian and military personnel , availability of rent-free premises and accommodation , lower requirements for transport and communication spare parts than earlier estimated owing to the implementation of the wet lease and self-sustainment arrangements under the new reimbursement procedures for contingent-owned equipment and the continued availability of supplies from existing UNPF stock .  
Calls upon all Governments and parties in complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in countries where humanitarian personnel are operating , in conformity with the relevant provisions of international law and national laws , to cooperate fully with the United Nations and other humanitarian agencies and organizations and to ensure the safe and unhindered access of humanitarian personnel in order to allow them to perform efficiently their task of assisting the affected civilian population , including refugees and internally displaced persons ;  
Norway firmly believes that the stabilizing presence of a NATO-led military follow-on force , authorized by a Security Council mandate , will also be required after June 1998 , when the current SFOR mandate expires , in order to consolidate our gains and provide vital support to the civilian agencies involved .  
In such conflicts , particularly in the case of a civil war , it is often difficult to determine which party is guilty of violating the peace , and the sanctions themselves may be indiscriminate , non-specific and , consequently ineffective and may only increase the already excessive burdens and sufferings borne by the innocent civilian population .  
It follows that any sanctions should be part of the search for a long-term political settlement of the conflict , reflect the strategic goals of the entire international community , take account of the political and ' physical ' ( in terms of death and suffering among the civilian population and the destruction of material values ) cost of such actions .  
Special emphasis is being put on and we have started work towards the reorganization of the army , with the objective of gradually having a smaller , more efficient and professional force under strict civilian control , in conformity with all standards of modern armies , capable of performing its functions properly and of being a genuine partner in partnership activities .  
The efforts at domestic stabilization through reorganization of the State and the reconciliation of opinions and the return to work of the civilian population are accompanied by other efforts aimed at achieving peace and regional stability in order to create economic and political conditions conducive to productive national and foreign investment .  
At the internal level , the relation between the Government and its citizens is based , as I said before , on constitutional legitimacy ; on equality among all citizens , whether male or female ; on equality in rights and obligations of men and women alike ; on the freedom of individuals and groups ; on the freedom of association to parties , trade unions and civilian community organizations ; on freedom of the press ; and on the protection of human rights .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
I should like in the present letter to alert you to the fact that between 1 July and 31 December 1996 United States and other warplanes continued to violate the airspace of the Republic of Iraq from military bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and to engage in such hostile , provocative and inflammatory actions as the dropping of heat flares in civilian areas and on civilian installations in Iraq .  
As you may be aware , the agreements on Hebron do not only refer to the redeployment of Israeli military forces in the city , but also to agreed security arrangements , joint security measures , the deployment of the Palestinian police and various civilian matters relating to the normal and effective functioning of the city , and the Israeli and Palestinian populations therein .  
Egypt is aware of the magnitude and severity of the problems related to the proliferation of anti _ personnel landmines , which is above all a humanitarian issue given the suffering they inflict on civilian populations , the heavy financial burden and the limited nature of the technology used in the detection and deactivation of these mines . 
The three country studies are being complemented by comparative analyses of selected United Nations missions , interviews with key personnel in civilian and military peacekeeping as well as national policy makers ; analyses of United Nations documentation and reports with a view to improving coordination between Headquarters and field commanders ; and review of press reports to gauge public reaction to the way in which peacekeeping operations are conducted .  
Pursuant to my letter to you dated 19 January 1997 concerning the forcible transfer and deportation of the civilian population of the districts north of Kabul ( S / 1997 / 54 , annex ) , I inform you with deep sorrow that the inhuman practice of mass deportation of ethnic Tajik residing in the districts north of Kabul is being continued by the Taliban mercenaries .  
In order to cut the main links between the insurgent groups and the civilian population , SLORC has forced entire communities living in the border area between Myanmar and Thailand to move to relocation sites which are subject to tight military control .  
Numerous testimonies received by the Special Rapporteur indicate that the civilian population living in or near the combat zone is the most susceptible to being forced to move : in these grey zones ( zones controlled or influenced by the insurgents ) the armed forces often resort to ground searches , destruction and burning of houses , and confiscation of property and food , which lead the people to move temporarily or permanently .  
The Special Rapporteur also observes that article 17 of Protocol II Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 requires that , in the case of displacements carried out for the safety of civilians or for imperative military reasons , the responsible party must take all possible measures . . . in order that the civilian population may be received under satisfactory conditions of shelter , hygiene , health , safety and nutrition .  Article 14 of the same instrument also stipulates a prohibition of starvation of civilians under the control of organized armed forces .  
The reported unencumbered balance resulted from savings attributable primarily to ( a ) lower transportation costs than estimated in the budget in respect of repatriation of troops and military observers , civilian police and international staff ; ( b ) fewer rented vehicles and lower requirements for spare parts and maintenance of the vehicle fleet ; ( c ) lower hire / charter costs and aviation fuel charges ; and ( d ) lower actual charges for the shipment of ONUMOZ - and contingent-owned equipment .  
The net additional requirements of $ 536,400 for commercial communications were attributable to the satellite user charges from the previous mandate period ( $ 356,200 ) , recorded in the reporting period because of the late submission of invoices and the extensive use of satellite facilities by the military , civilian police and electoral observer components of the mission in November and December 1994 ( $ 626,000 ) . ( b ) Main trunking contract .  
The second phase of Operation Joint Guard , the stabilization phase , has now begun , and over the coming months SFOR will continue its efforts to keep the peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina by accomplishing its principal military tasks and by providing selective support to the international civil organizations in theatre , thereby contributing to a progressive implementation of broad civilian programmes .  
The Assistance Mission 's mandate has been revised and extended by the Council in subsequent resolutions , most recently in resolution 1029 ( 1995 ) of 12 December 1995 , which extended the Mission for a final period until 8 March 1996 .  In the same resolution , the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to reduce the military personnel level to 1,400 , to withdraw the civilian police component and to initiate planning for the complete withdrawal of UNAMIR within a period of six weeks after the expiry of its mandate .  
Calls upon the Government of Guatemala , URNG and Guatemalan society as a whole to make every possible effort to familiarize the Guatemalan people with the content of the Peace agreements as quickly as possible , to ensure the full participation of the people in building the new multi _ ethnic , multicultural and multilingual nation , establishing a democratic society with social justice , initiating a period of sustained and sustainable economic and social development and ensuring the pre _ eminence of civilian authority in national decision _ making ;  
Calls upon all parties to the hostilities to respect fully the applicable provisions of international humanitarian law including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , to halt the use of weapons , including landmines , against the civilian population and to protect all civilians , especially women , members of minorities and children , from violations of human rights and humanitarian law , including forcible displacement , arbitrary detention , ill _ treatment , torture and summary executions ;  
In paragraph 17 of his statement , the Secretary-General proposes to head the five verification areas ( human rights ; indigenous affairs ; social , economic and agrarian aspects ; strengthening of civilian power ; and resettlement and integration ) at the D-1 level instead of the current P-5 level .  
Turning to the operative part of the draft resolution , he said that , while paragraph 1 welcomed his Governments declared commitment to civilian rule , there was no mention of the positive steps which it had taken to fulfil that commitment , which included the establishment of a national electoral commission , the registration of voters and political parties and the delimitation of constituencies .  
The unencumbered balance resulted mainly from delays in the deployment of civilian personnel , reduced rental requirements related to the deployment of the International Police Task Force ( IPTF ) , the cost of the use of government-provided helicopters based on actual use rather than commercially provided helicopters and the availability of some equipment and supplies from surplus stock .  
This document addressed a wide range of problems , including a worrying increase in crime throughout Bermuda ; low deployment of officers on patrol ; an excessively high ratio of officers of the rank of superintendent or above ; an extremely low proportion of civilian staff ; and police stations and accommodation that were cramped , badly designed or not of an acceptable standard .  
Such violations shall include , but not be limited to , murder , ill _ treatment or deportation to slave labour or for any other purpose of civilian population of or in occupied territory , murder or ill _ treatment of prisoners of war or persons on the seas , killing of hostages , plunder of public or private property , wanton destruction of cities , towns or villages , or devastation not justified by military necessity ;  
While the operation is financed from income accruing as a result of a limited exception to the sanctions regime , the resolution prescribes numerous safeguards to be implemented in order to ensure that the humanitarian assistance is not used for purposes other than those specifically authorized and that it benefits , in equal measure , the needy civilian population as a whole .  
While peacekeeping , civilian , humanitarian , economic , social , and political activities are all part of the integrated process of peace-building , special attention should be given to the observance of the norms and principles of international law , including international humanitarian law .  
The Front ( UINFSA ) calls upon the Taliban to take into serious account the sufferings and miseries of the innocent civilian population in Afghanistan resulting from the protracted imposed war and to declare their readiness through joining a genuine intra-Afghan dialogue aimed at achieving a negotiated settlement , rather than pursuing the dangerous option of continuing war in Afghanistan .  
Croatia 's position is that , with the successful holding of elections , UNTAES has completed the executive part of its mandate : authority over the region should therefore be transferred to Croatia , the UNTAES military component should be withdrawn and the remaining United Nations civilian presence restricted to a monitoring and observation mission pending its replacement by a long-term OSCE observation mission .  
However , illegal weapons do not have that protection , and their war-time use easily meets the rest of the definition of torture : their use causes severe pain and suffering , both physical and mental ; their use is intentional ; they are used to unduly coerce the enemy or the civilian population into surrender , submission or other state favourable to the user of the weapons ; and their use is under the direct order of public officials .  
Deeply concerned by the numerous reports from a large number of reliable sources attesting that , regardless of human dignity , armed groups of religious extremists , who act in flagrant violation of the principles of tolerance of Islam , are terrorising civilian populations in order to force them to support their cause , by resorting , inter alia , to summary executions , the cruelty of which adds futile suffering to the fate of innocent victims of decapitation or throat cutting , including old people , women and children ,  
The agreements reached by Committee members to set up a subregional early warning mechanism , to control the illicit trade in arms and drugs , to retrain demobilized troops for civilian life and to enhance the capacity of Central African States to participate more effectively in future peace missions in the area would , if implemented , contribute significantly to continuing efforts to end the scourge of violence , destruction and suffering in the subregion . 
Given the vast territory of Angola and the deployment of MONUA at Luanda , six regional headquarters and 18 provincial offices , these aircraft are essential in providing support for the transport of military and civilian personnel , the transport of medium and heavy cargo from the Viana logistics base throughout the mission area and for medical and casualty evacuation purposes .  
The major issues addressed included providing an enabling environment for conversion at both national and local levels ; the role of public and private sectors ; conversion of military bases and defence industries to export processing zones ; tourism development in former military bases and defence complexes ; civilian manufacturing , prospects for small and medium-sized enterprise development ; and continuity of social infrastructure services .  
It has done so despite the exceptional circumstances , well known to the international community , that Iraq is experiencing because of the maintenance of the comprehensive embargo imposed on it in August 1990 and because of the brutal military aggression of January 1991 that created highly abnormal conditions in all spheres of civilian life and for all groups of the population .  
Those suffering the most are the civilian population of the occupied territories , whose standard of living has been eroded steadily as a result of the very serious economic and social situation .  
It is my firm belief that for the time being there could be no civil implementation without the strong international military force available immediately to ensure the secure environment , which is also mandatory for the work of the civilian organizations .  
The statute also specifies that for rape to be considered a crime against humanity , it must be a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population on national , political , ethnic , racial or religious grounds .  
An increasing role in peacekeeping operations was being played by civilian police , who assisted local police forces in restoring public order , upholding the rule of law and promoting civil reconciliation .  
During the 1980s , the region experienced its longest period of elected Governments and constitutional processes , reduced military spending , and the acceptance by the armed forces of civilian governmental authority .  
The report should have contained a functional analysis of the backstopping requirements of peacekeeping operations as they relate to the implementation of their mandates ( military , civilian police , human rights monitoring , humanitarian , electoral assistance ) .  
There is an increasing trend of more joint satellite missions , both on a national basis ( e.g . by merging military and civilian systems ) and through international cooperation .  
We are also grateful to the entire international community for rendering invaluable assistance to Tajikistan at the critical stage of the formation of its statehood and of the foundations for the normal functioning of civilian society .  
The Department had given special attention to the emerging role of civilian police in peacekeeping operations , which represented a new dimension of the efforts to respond effectively to the complex problems posed by civil conflict .  
Once an FMCT has been adopted , there would be a reasonable chance that the main nuclear _ weapon States would commit themselves voluntarily to placing irreversible fissile material transferred from military uses to civilian ones under full IAEA safeguards .  
In pleading guilty , the former Prime Minister not only acknowledged and confirmed that genocide did indeed occur in Rwanda in 1994 but also indicated that it was organized and planned at the highest levels , both civilian and military .  
Social development is impossible when basic essential social services are denied to the civilian population and where vulnerable members of the community are indiscriminately exposed to bombing , summary execution , rape and the threat of landmines .  
In light of the repatriation of the military engineering support unit during the 1998 / 99 financial period , it is proposed that the Missions civilian staffing establishment be reduced by 5 international and 10 local posts authorized in connection with the deployment of the unit ( see A / 52 / 730 / Add . 2 , paras . 23 and 24 ) .  
Urges States to uphold the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and settlements , inter alia , through effective measures to prevent the infiltration of armed elements , to identify and separate any such armed elements from refugee populations , to settle refugees in secure locations and to afford to the Office of the High Commissioner and other appropriate humanitarian organizations prompt , unhindered and safe access to asylum-seekers , refugees and other persons of concern ;  
At the normative level , it is important to emphasize that , despite the specific nature of today 's armed conflicts , the international community seems to have at its disposal a sufficient arsenal of legal instruments to protect civilian populations .  
There is a common thread running through the preceding statements that makes unequivocally clear one of the characteristics of the recent armed conflicts that have led to political or military action by this Organization : the fact that their first and principal target has been the civilian population , in particular its most vulnerable sectors children , women , the elderly , the sick , refugees and internally displaced persons .  
Canada has always distinguished itself by an honourable , consistent and outstanding involvement in United Nations efforts to achieve international peace and security , in particular by its humanitarian devotion to alleviating the suffering of civilian populations in armed conflicts .  
The success of these programmes would not have been possible without the respect for international humanitarian law and the direct and indirect cooperation of the parties to the conflict , which in practice shared common areas of mutual respect , to the benefit of the civilian population and the national and international non-governmental humanitarian assistance organizations , particularly the International Committee of the Red Cross .  
The second level is a complex one that involves a specific mechanism consisting of various interrelated elements , ranging from the body of international humanitarian norms and provisions to the agencies authorized to ensure the rights of the civilian population in situations of armed conflict and to provide humanitarian assistance for them , and so on . 
The Department of Peacekeeping Operations is currently gathering statistics provided by Member States contributing personnel so as to provide data on the participation of women in their military and civilian police establishments , in order to have a better understanding of the potential to increase the participation of women in peacekeeping in the foreseeable future .  
Support to peacekeeping exercises focuses on the multidimensional and multinational aspects of this training and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations routinely provides not just military and civilian police role players and trainers , but also Special Representatives of the Secretary-General , political , legal and public information staff members and humanitarian , human rights and non-governmental organization coordinators .  
Noting with grave concern the content of the report of the Commission of Inquiry of the International Labour Organization , [ 5 ] appointed in March 1997 in accordance with article 26 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organization , regarding the observance by Myanmar of the Forced Labour Convention , 1930 ( No .  29 ) , which indicates a widespread and systematic use of forced labour imposed by the military on the civilian population ,  
We fully agree with the Norwegian State Secretary when she said last week that excess material that is removed from the military production cycle should no longer have the status of military non _ verifiable material , but gradually be made subject to a transparent , non _ military and civilian regime subject to international verification .  
The timely response to the recruitment exercise facilitated the expeditious processing of the recruitment of civilian and active military and civilian police personnel , in accordance with established recruitment and placement procedures , involving appointment and promotion bodies which formulated recommendations for selection of the best qualified candidates with due regard to the need to ensure the widest possible geographical basis and with regard to gender .  
With regard to conduct forbidden by international humanitarian law , there were numerous cases of murders of protected persons , torture , taking of hostages , attacks on the civilian population and forced displacements , which followed a systematic pattern .  
Additional requirements of $ 1,991,900 are recorded under civilian personnel costs , due to various developments such as the unbudgeted increase in local staff salaries , noted in paragraph 27 above ; as well as the delayed termination / separation of individual local contractors employed under special service agreements ( SSA ) , and of local staff hired as general temporary assistance whose contracts expired beyond 30 June 1997 .  
The unencumbered balance of $ 2,556,300 gross ( $ 2,216,500 net ) was attributable to the delayed deployment of civilian personnel , fewer rotation of military observers and a substantial portion of the Missions equipment requirements being obtained through transfers from the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi .  
In view of the substantial withdrawal of MONUA military units and observers , logistical support provided by the Observer Mission to the civilian police component was augmented both in terms of geographical coverage and the increased number of police observers , which reached their authorized strength of 345 by October 1998 .  
With the completion of the phased withdrawal of UNAVEM III formed military units , the authorized strength of MONUA from 1 March 1998 comprised 90 military observers , 955 contingent personnel , 345 civilian police observers , supported by a civilian establishment of 281 international staff , 225 local staff and 71 United Nations Volunteers .  
Given the vast territory of Angola and the deployment of MONUA at Luanda , six regional headquarters and 18 provincial offices , these aircraft provided air support for the transport of military and civilian personnel , medium and heavy cargo from the Viana logistics base throughout the mission area and for medical and casualty evacuation purposes .  
And all other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully their obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law and to avail themselves of services offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
At the impact of the current conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effect on the civilian population , in particular women and children , and at continuing serious violations of human rights , fundamental freedoms and relevant provisions of international humanitarian law perpetrated by all parties to the conflict , in particular :  
It is incomprehensible to request the withdrawal of the legitimate forces of a sovereign State from its own territory instead of calling for an urgent ending of foreign military aggression , killing of civilians and destruction of civilian targets .  
The induction of lightly armed international civilian security officers and additional local watchmen has further augmented the existing internal security arrangements .  
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and west Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , the expulsion from their land , the bombardment of villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;  
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and west Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , the expulsion from their land , the bombardment of villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;  
To cease immediately its continued repressive practices , including the practice of forced deportation and relocation , against the Iraqi Kurds , Assyrians and Turkmen , and against the population of the southern marsh areas , where drainage projects have provoked environmental destruction and a deterioration of the situation of the civilian population , and to ensure the personal integrity and freedoms , including the full freedom of belief , of the Shia and their religious establishment ;  
At the impact of the current conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effect on the civilian population , in particular women and children , and at continuing serious violations of human rights , fundamental freedoms and relevant provisions of international humanitarian law perpetrated by all parties to the conflict , in particular :  
And all other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully their obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law and to avail themselves of services offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
As reflected in the aforementioned resolutions , from the outset , the Security Council gave early recognition to the suffering of the Iraqi civilians under a very rigorous sanctions regime and , concerned with the serious nutritional and health situation of the Iraqi civilian population , laid down the foundation for establishing a humanitarian programme .  
It observes with the deepest concern that guerrilla activities continue to be directed against civilians ( in particular the totally unacceptable practice of hostage _ taking under the threat of death among nationals or foreigners who are neither personally involved in nor responsible for the conflict or its conduct ) and attacks on infrastructure , including the bombing of pipelines , which have caused numerous deaths , great suffering amongst the civilian population and grave destruction .  
Gravely concerned by such recent outrages as the murder of three human rights defenders and mass abduction from an aircraft , for which guerrilla groups were responsible , it calls on the guerrilla groups to respect norms of international humanitarian law , especially to refrain from killings and all attacks on the civilian population , indiscriminate massacres , hostage _ taking and the widespread use of anti _ personnel landmines , and to fulfil their own pledges not to recruit children .  
The budgets provide for the continued deployment of 1,350 military contingent personnel and 24 police officers , supported by an increased civilian staffing establishment of 114 international staff , 111 local staff and 13 United Nations Volunteers , with provisions for the Missions liquidation reflected in the proposed 1999 / 00 budget .  
Moreover , although related costs for international salaries and common staff costs were calculated on the basis of 50 per cent of staff on appointments of limited duration , mission appointees ranged from 75 to 80 per cent of the total , contributing to additional savings under civilian personnel costs . 
Further escalation of military action , barbaric bombings of industrial , social , cultural and civilian targets and the peaceful population are all assuming horrible proportions .  
The unencumbered balance of $ 4,571,900 gross ( $ 4,275,100 net ) resulted from reduced requirements as follows : military personnel costs ( $ 83,000 ) , civilian personnel costs ( $ 4,368,400 ) , operational costs ( $ 2,247,300 ) and staff assessment ( $ 296,800 ) ; these were offset by additional requirements amounting to $ 2,423,600 as follows : other programmes ( $ 19,300 ) and United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi ( $ 2,404,300 ) ( A / 53 / 908 , annex II ) .  
The need for humanitarian responses to address the special reproductive health needs of girls and women , including those arising from pregnancy as a result of rape , sexual mutilation , childbirth at an early age or infection with sexually transmitted diseases was emphasized and gender-sensitized education programmes for armed forces and civilian police were called for .  Specific dangers faced by girls in conjunction with child labour were highlighted .  
The revised budget for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 is therefore based on the maintenance of 1,350 military contingent personnel , 24 civilian police officers supported by the increased ( from 1 March 1999 ) civilian staffing establishment of 114 international staff , 111 local staff and 13 United Nations Volunteers .  
We also finance the operating subsidy of the RMS St . Helena , at present the sole regular means of physical access to the island ( an examination of the economic feasibility of developing an eventual air link is currently under way , alongside our discussions with the United States Government about opening up Wideawake Airfield on Ascension to civilian charter flights ) .  
This political solution should be followed by specific steps towards the establishment of the structures necessary for a civilian administration , economic rebuilding and development , democratic institutions and the rule of law , as well as security and respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms for all , regardless of ethnic background or religious affiliation .  
The joint unit established by resolution 1051 ( 1996 ) will continue to review the categorized list , in the light of additional information that may become available , for the purposes of identifying items that are subject to monitoring because of their possible dual use for civilian and prohibited purposes under Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) of 3 April 1991 and other relevant resolutions .  
Projects aimed at the strengthening of macroeconomic management capacity , legislative systems , the legal framework , the judiciary , civilian police and election management capacity , along with mechanisms for political reconciliation , public administration and civil service reform , inter alia , must be explored , particularly in Kosovo , taking advantage of national human resources , experience and skills .  
In addition to the human costs of the conflict , evidenced notably by numerous civilian casualties , the destruction of major industries by the air bombardment , as well as damage caused to infrastructure and essential services such as water and electricity supply , health services , education , communications , heating , the damage to land and river transportation links and the loss of trade , have caused tremendous economic and social hardship for the civilian populations . 
This includes regular army and naval forces , armed civilian groups , associated paramilitary groups , air forces , national guards , border police , army reserves , military police , intelligence services , federal and Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs local , special , riot and anti-terrorist police , and any other groups or individuals so designated by the international security force ( KFOR ) commander ;  
These included the bringing of armed civilian groups under strict control and the prompt arrest and prosecution of those who incited or threatened to use violence , a ban on rallies by armed groups , the redeployment of Indonesian military forces , the immediate institution of a process of laying down of arms by all armed groups to be completed well in advance of the holding of the ballot and the freedom of association and expression of all political forces and tendencies .  
The forthcoming fiftieth anniversary of the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 which deal with international humanitarian law provides an opportunity for States which have signed and become party to the Conventions to reflect upon the degree of applicability of the provisions governing conduct of hostilities and respect for the civilian population , including vulnerable persons considered as non-combatants .  
They expressed serious concern with regard to grave breaches , breaches and violations by Israel , the occupying Power , of the Fourth Geneva Convention , including arbitrary detention , ill-treatment of and violence against the civilian population , torture , summary execution , confiscation and destruction of property , forcible transfers and deportations , and the various forms of collective punishment , as well as the destruction of economic and social structures of the Occupied Territory .  
The Council condemned and deplored the repeated Israeli aerial assaults that had sought to destroy civilian installations and the infrastructure of the Lebanese Republic , had left a number of innocent civilians dead and wounded and had undermined security and stability in the region .  
They include the need for effective demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants into productive civilian life ; post-conflict reconstruction and reconciliation in stable and secure environments ; reform and capacity-building of police , judicial and penal systems ; and promotion of respect for international humanitarian law , including with regard to the use and transfer of small arms .  
At the functional level , UNMIK has established joint civilian commissions ( JCCs ) to facilitate the process of a mediated and controlled transition to integrated public institutions and to address such contentious issues as administration and staffing of various public facilities . 
Following on the report of the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa ( S / 1998 / 318 ) , the Council addressed this question last year in its resolution 1208 ( 1998 ) which , in unequivocal terms , called on all concerned to respect the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and condemned the use of such camps by combatants for the furtherance of military aims .  
In this connection , there is an obvious need for international legal regulation of the worldwide development of civilian and military information technology , and for the formulation of a coordinated international policy on information safety that meets the needs of international security .  
They expressed serious concern with regard to grave breaches , breaches and violations by Israel , the occupying Power , of the Fourth Geneva Convention , including arbitrary detention , ill-treatment of and violence against the civilian population , torture , summary execution , confiscation , and destruction of property , forcible transfers and deportations , and the various forms of collective punishment , as well as the destruction of economic and social structures of the Occupied Territory .  
This provides for the gradual phasing in of an additional 140 military observers , the establishment of a second-line medical capability with 35 medical personnel and the expansion of the Observer Mission by 59 international civilian and 21 local staff as well as for the required logistical support .  
Such personnel , installations , material , units or vehicles were entitled to that protection given to civilians or civilian objects under the international law of armed conflict and the accused was aware of the factual circumstances that established that protection .  
There can be no doubt that the atrocities committed against the civilian population of Sierra Leone , including widespread systematic killings , rapes and amputations , constitute massive violations of international human rights and humanitarian law .  
In addition , the office would manage any new United Nations civilian mission , facilitate continuing dialogue among key actors in Haiti and the international community , support the democratization process , help to mobilize international political and financial support for Haiti and provide the political framework and focal point for integrating and coordinating the activities of the international community .  
In this regard , it is also my profound hope that the alarming levels of social and criminal violence will continue to be addressed by Governments through strengthened civilian police , more efficient judicial systems , independent ombudsmen and permanent respect for human rights and the rule of law .  
In light of the foregoing , KFOR , in close consultation with my Special Representative , is developing a concept for demobilization of the KLA , offering individual members an opportunity to participate in a disciplined , professional , multi-ethnic civilian emergency corps .  
Underlining the importance of the widest possible dissemination of international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law and of relevant training for , inter alia , civilian police , armed forces , members of the judicial and legal professions , civil society and personnel of international and regional organizations ,  
We also join the call to move away from double standards in the field of human rights , and we believe that the same attention should be devoted to those situations , wherever they may arise , that involve a loss of civilian life in armed conflict or which are a source of untold suffering , without allowing the political considerations of Council members , and especially of the permanent ones , to prevail over the collective considerations of the Council and of the United Nations as a whole .  
Most important and this is to be welcomed it has recognized in its resolutions adopted in recent years that repression of the civilian population , ethnic cleansing , genocide , large-scale forced displacement and relocation of civilians and other flagrant violations of international humanitarian law constitute a threat to international peace and security .  
Underlining the importance of the widest possible dissemination of international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law and of relevant training for , inter alia , civilian police , armed forces , members of the judicial and legal professions , civil society and personnel of international and regional organizations ,  
The Taliban 's conduct of forced displacement of the civilian population during their recent offensive in the Shomali plains is a particularly alarming signal which reflects the movement 's apparent disregard for the concerns expressed by the international community .  
It also reminded States with a system of compulsory military service , where such a provision has not already been made , of its recommendation that they provide for conscientious objectors various forms of alternative service which are compatible with the reasons for conscientious objection , of non-combatant or civilian character , in the public interest and of not punitive nature .  
When we think of the incalculable number of civilian victims that these weapons claim including women , children and the elderly we realize the urgency of adopting or strengthening measures , on the national , regional and international levels , enabling us to regulate the proliferation of small arms and light weapons .  
This year , Nigeria , the giant of Africa , has achieved an impressively quick return to civilian rule after multi-party elections , while South Africa , the continent 's economic powerhouse , has successfully held its second democratic election , as well as undergone a smooth transition from the tenure of President Mandela to that of President Mbeki .  
Even though the primary responsibility of maintaining security and the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and areas always lies with the host State , the international community is duty bound to assist governments in this task and , above all , to bear the bulk of the costs to African States whose financial and logistic capacities are limited .  
There are two priorities in addressing the situation in West Timor : first , the Indonesian government must provide all necessary security measures to secure both refugees and humanitarian agencies , maintain the civilian character of refugee sites , and facilitate humanitarian activities ; second , whatever option refugees will choose - return , remain or go elsewhere in Indonesia - it will have to be free and informed , impartially ascertained , respected and fulfilled . 
Authorizes the establishment , for an initial period of six months until 15 April 2000 , of the United Nations Office in Angola ( UNOA ) staffed with the personnel necessary to liaise with the political , military , police and other civilian authorities , with a view to exploring effective measures for restoring peace , assisting the Angolan people in the area of capacity-building , humanitarian assistance , the promotion of human rights , and coordinating other activities ;

Recalling also its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
The UNMIK civilian police will provide a broad spectrum of basic law enforcement services , including patrolling , crime prevention , active street-level policing functions and assisting citizens and business owners in rebuilding safe and livable communities , as well as providing traffic policing , border police controls , criminal investigations , security for at-risk populations and interdiction against organized crime .  
Recalling also its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
The methodology of the report is accountable for another obfuscation : in an effort to scale down their size and significance , the human rights abuses evident in the use of cluster bombs and depleted uranium , the ethnic cleansing of Serbs after the aggression and the destruction of civilian infrastructure are immediately referenced to alleged violations of human rights by the Yugoslav side .  
The representatives of the people of Iraq urge an immediate halt to the daily attacks being carried out by United States and British aircraft under the cloak of the so-called aerial exclusion zones imposed on Iraq without any legal basis , inasmuch as these attacks target civilian and services-related installations such as electric power stations and water treatment plants in such a way as to affect the lives of Iraqis in an adverse manner and inflict harm on them .  
After a further massive loss of human lives , increased suffering of the civilian population and immense physical destruction , the two sides found themselves roughly at the same positions they held in late 1998 .  
Noting that , as the century draws to a close , the Central American countries have achieved significant progress towards the consolidation of democracy and good governance , the strengthening of civilian Governments , respect for human rights and the rule of law , and the promotion of State and economic reforms , sustainable development and regional integration , reflecting the desire of the Central American peoples to live and prosper in a climate of peace and solidarity ,  
The proposed budget of UNMIK for the period from its inception on 10 June 1999 to 30 June 2000 provides for a total strength of 9,812 personnel , including 38 military liaison officers , 4,718 civilian police , 1,269 international staff , 3,566 local staff , 18 National Officers and 203 United Nations Volunteers , and amounts to $ 456,451,200 gross , inclusive of the commitment authority of $ 200-million already authorized by the General Assembly in its resolution 53 / 241 of 28 July 1999 .  
Despite repeated appeals from United Nations bodies , bombing of the civilian population , enforced displacement both within and outside the country , summary and extrajudicial execution , violation of the right to life and the right to physical safety of prisoners of war , attacks on the civilian population , abduction and subjection to forced labour of women and children and obstruction of humanitarian assistance continued unabated .  
The Special Rapporteur is concerned that this situation , combined with peer pressure and misconceived collegial loyalty , may work to the detriment of civilian victims and their families and seriously circumscribe their opportunities to have their cases heard before a competent , independent and impartial tribunal , as provided for in the Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary .  
Urges States to uphold the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and settlements , inter alia , through effective measures to prevent the infiltration of armed elements , to identify and separate any such armed elements from refugee populations , to settle refugees in secure locations , and to afford to the Office of the High Commissioner and other appropriate humanitarian organizations prompt , unhindered and safe access to asylum-seekers , refugees and other persons of concern ;  
Noting that , as the century draws to a close , the Central American countries have achieved significant progress towards the consolidation of democracy and good governance , the strengthening of civilian Governments , respect for human rights and the rule of law , and the promotion of State and economic reforms , sustainable development and regional integration , reflecting the desire of the Central American peoples to live and prosper in a climate of peace and solidarity ,  
The Lebanese Government strongly condemns Israel 's arbitrary actions against the Lebanese civilian population , and it requests you to do your utmost to induce the Israeli authorities concerned to halt these inhuman and unlawful practices and , at last , to close down the Khiyam centre that they maintain inside Lebanese territory .  
Expressing its grave concern for the well-being of internally displaced persons , particularly in Kabul and in the Panjsher , Bamian and Kunduz regions , and for the civilian population of Afghanistan living without shelter , who face a long winter possibly deprived of basic foods as a result of the recent fighting , as well as the denial by the warring factions of adequate conditions for the delivery of aid by humanitarian organizations ,  
In response to increasing reports of violence and human rights abuses attributed to Indonesian government forces since the beginning of the year , the Special Rapporteur had repeatedly sent urgent appeals to the Government urging the authorities to protect the safety and integrity of the civilian population in East Timor and to ensure that the police and military were conducting their operations in strict compliance with international human rights and humanitarian law standards . 
At the impact of the current armed conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effect on the civilian population , in particular women and children , and continuing serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by all parties , in particular :  
With regard to accountability of United Nations military and civilian police observers for losses of or damage to United Nations property caused by them , the current common practice in field missions is to withhold two weeks of mission subsistence allowance entitlements prior to the departure of the military or police observers concerned , in respect of cases in which they are involved , pending the taking of a decision by the Headquarters Property Survey Board .  
Such personnel , installations , material , units or vehicles were entitled to that protection given to civilians or civilian objects under the international law of armed conflict and the accused was aware of the factual circumstances that established that protection .

Recalling also its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
The military authorities specifically reiterated their public pledge not only to support the ongoing peace and democratic processes but also to transform the armed forces into a more professional republican army subordinate to civilian authorities following the elections .  
There are two priorities in addressing the situation in western Timor : first , the Indonesian Government must provide all necessary security measures to secure both refugees and humanitarian agencies , maintain the civilian character of refugee sites , and facilitate humanitarian activities ; second , whatever option refugees will choose return , remain or go elsewhere in Indonesia it will have to be free and informed , impartially ascertained , respected and fulfilled . 
The proliferation of conflicts , internal as well as international , of which civilian populations are the innocent victims , can only reaffirm to us the need to work towards the ideal embodied in that tradition by encouraging States , in conformity with the United Nations Charter , to resolve their differences through peaceful means .  
Recalling its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
It is no secret that the Government of the United Kingdom joined the United States administration in carrying out its threats to use force , heedless of the Security Council , the United Nations and world public opinion , in its comprehensive military attack on Iraq from 16 to 20 December 1998 , which destroyed a large number of Iraqi civilian installations and led to the death and injury of a large number of Iraqi people .  
Once again he drew the attention of the Burundi authorities to the urgent need to ensure the observance of international standards of humanitarian law and human rights , which prohibited indiscriminate attacks against the civilian population and civilian targets during military operations .  
It also supported the recommendation that a broad geographical base that took into account the sizes of the contingents from the various contributing countries should be used in selecting civilian police commissioners and appointing other senior police personnel for peacekeeping operations .  
They also trained the Kamajor paramilitary troops who are fighting the rebel forces of the overthrown Government with the acquiescence of the current Government and are responsible for grave human rights violations against prisoners and the civilian population .  
The projection provides for the retention in MINURCA of 1 , 350 military personnel , inclusive of the 35 additional military personnel referred to in paragraph 44 of my main report , and 25 civilian police advisers , supported by 179 international and local staff .  
At its fifty _ fourth session , the Commission , in resolution 1998-75 , recognizing the urgent need for the adoption of effective measures , nationally , regionally and internationally , to protect the civilian population , especially women and children , in northern Uganda from the effects of armed conflict , requested the Secretary _ General to report on the implementation of that resolution to the Commission at its fifty _ fifth session .  
They demanded that the missile batteries be withdrawn and returned to their original sites within 48 hours of the date of the above position ; that there should be no flights of any civilian or military fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters south of the 32 nd parallel ; and that Iraq should undertake no illumination or tracing by radar of any aircraft and should flash no signals indicating a hostile intention .  
The mandate of UNMIBH is to assist the parties in their obligations to provide a safe and secure environment for all persons in their respective jurisdictions by maintaining civilian law enforcement agencies operating in accordance with internationally recognized standards and with respect for internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms.The Mission consists of an International Police Task Force ( IPTF ) and a civilian office .  
During the relevant period , United States warplanes engaged in such hostile , provocative and inflammatory acts as dropping heat flares and breaking the sound barrier over Iraqi civilian areas and establishments , and United States naval vessels also engaged in acts of aggression inside and outside Iraqi territorial waters . 
While military observers and most of the international civilian staff left the mission area by 30 September 1997 as scheduled , owing to the unforeseen scope and complexity of residual administrative tasks involving , inter alia , the re-creation of the Missions financial records lost during hostilities in April 1996 , the Missions in situ liquidation was extended until 28 February 1998 , with a small liquidation team continuing work at United Nations Headquarters until 30 June 1998 .  
Numerous testimonies received by the Special Rapporteur indicate that the civilian population living in or near the combat zone is generally forced to move : in these " grey zones " ( zones controlled or influenced by the insurgents ) the armed forces often resort to searches , destruction and burning of houses , and confiscation of property and food to force the people to move , temporarily or permanently .  
The basic premise is to encourage bilateral and multilateral dialogue so as to promote international understanding and cooperation on the basis of the concepts identified in the preambular paragraphs of this draft : that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress and science and technology for civilian applications need to be maintained and encouraged.There are two operational components to this draft resolution . 
Mexico attended the Review Conference for the 1980 Convention with the firm intention and the hope of ending a tragedy that is of vast proportions , afflicting daily the civilian population , which is exposed to the more than 100-million such devious artifacts ready to explode under innocent feet .  
A further review during the past six months has focused on bringing UNFICYP into line with the approaches in more recently established peacekeeping missions , while achieving additional efficiencies by integrating civilian and military personnel in terms of sharing responsibilities and decision-making , establishing more transparency and better financial control .  
The reorganized Civil Affairs Branch will be headed by a civilian chief , at the P-4 level , with political legal background , assisted by a civil affairs officer at the P-3 level .  
In order to achieve the objectives described therein , the plan of operations for the Observer Mission headed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General , calls for the phased deployment , as security conditions permit , of the authorized strength of 70 military observers , a 15 - person medical unit and 5 civilian police advisers supported by 50 international civilian and 48 local staff .  
During the budget period , owing to the poor road infrastructure and prevailing security situation , the MI-8 helicopter would be utilized for the transportation of UNOMSIL military and civilian personnel , logistical support and supply resupply tasking , as well as for casualty and medical evacuation , if required .  
It was therefore imperative that the international community should pursue ways and means of enhancing the safety of all United Nations personnel both military and civilian in order to maintain the effective functioning and timely deployment of peacekeeping operations .  
This criminal , unprecedented act of aggression , in clear support of separatism and terrorism , has already caused massive human losses and enormous destruction of civilian infrastructure all over Yugoslavia , thus provoking enormous humanitarian suffering .  
To cease immediately its continued repressive practices , including the practice of forced deportation and relocation , against the Iraqi Kurds , Assyrians and Turkmen , and against the population of the southern marsh areas , where drainage projects have provoked environmental destruction and a deterioration of the situation of the civilian population , and to ensure the personal integrity and freedoms , including the full freedom of belief , of the Shia and their religious establishment ;  
During the relevant period , United States warplanes engaged in such hostile , provocative and inflammatory acts as dropping heat flares and breaking the sound barrier over Iraqi civilian areas and installations , and United States naval vessels also engaged in acts of aggression inside and outside Iraqi territorial waters .  
At the impact of the current armed conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effect on the civilian population , in particular women and children , at continuing serious violations of human rights , and international humanitarian law by all parties , in particular :  
After a further massive loss of human lives , increased suffering of the civilian population and immense physical destruction , the two sides found themselves roughly in the same positions they held in late 1998 .

During the past six months , fighting continued in south Lebanon and the situation in the area remained volatile , although the level of hostility was somewhat reduced and civilian casualties decreased .  
The human rights violations reported to him by credible eyewitnesses had included forced displacement of the civilian population , deliberate burning of houses , summary execution of noncombatants , arbitrary detention and forced labour .  
The elimination of this scourge requires vigorous , coordinated international action so that the illicit trafficking in light weapons stops devastating civilian populations and causing humanitarian crises throughout the world .  
In the case of an emerging widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population , the intent clause of the last element indicates that this mental element is satisfied if the perpetrator intended to further such an attack .  
In the case of an emerging widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population , the intent clause of the last element indicates that this mental element is satisfied if the perpetrator intended to further such an attack .  
In recent years , the grave threat posed by small arms especially by the illicit manufacture of and trafficking and trade in small arms to social development , civilian safety and regional security has become a common concern of the international community .  
The prohibition on attacks against civilians is based on the most fundamental distinction drawn in international humanitarian law between the civilian and the military and the absolute prohibition on directing attacks against the former .  
The first threeweek period of full control by these entities over Freetown marked the most intensified , systematic and widespread violations of human rights and international humanitarian law against the civilian population .  
In the case of an emerging widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population , the intent clause of the last element indicates that this mental element is satisfied if the perpetrator intended to further such an attack .  
Once again , we have witnessed with dreary familiarity a major military offensive late this past summer , with all the consequent displacement and suffering of the civilian population .  
In Zaire and in Haiti , the armed conflicts resulted from the actions of hardened , corrupt , dictatorial governments that turned their backs on the civilian population and established violence as the norm of political discourse and squandered national resources .  
In summing up , the basic issue before us today is the following choice between two alternatives : either we seize this opportunity to radically simplify and promote the flow of everyday civilian goods into Iraq , thereby establishing beyond any doubt that the international community is giving paramount importance to humanitarian concerns , while keeping sensitive goods under control ; or we preserve the status quo .  
The main objective of the Kindu deployment , which would be robust enough to deter any potential attackers , would be to establish a secure base from which civilian personnel who deal with disarmament , demobilization , reintegration , repatriation ( DDRR ) and human rights issues and provide humanitarian assistance would be able to go into the area to carry out their work .  
However , for independence to be fully enjoyed , the following three pillars are essential for a functioning democracy in a new , independent country : an impartial and independent judiciary , a competent and fully trained civilian police service , and a solid and broad-based administrative framework .  
At the same time , we feel that it is equally important to ensure that the interests and well-being of innocent civilian populations are protected in pursuing that objective , consistent with the existing practice of protecting the interests of civilians in conflict situations .  
Israel recognizes , and has repeatedly expressed its sympathy for , the unfortunate deaths of Palestinian civilians and for the Palestinian populations that must endure the precautionary security measures foisted upon Israel by the inaction of the Palestinian leadership .  But while Israel considers the death of any civilian , whether Israeli or Palestinian , to be tragic , for the Palestinian terrorist , these deaths are deliberate , premeditated and desired .  
She further notes with regret that in some countries Governments have made use of excessive and indiscriminate force in their efforts to counter armed opposition groups , which in some cases has involved summary executions of captured combatants and resulted in extensive civilian casualties and fatalities .  
Moreover , pending the conclusion of consultations with the Government of Angola and until the establishment by the Security Council in its resolution 1268 ( 1999 ) of 15 October 1999 of the United Nations Office in Angola , the substantive MONUA personnel required to maintain liaison with the political , military , police and other civilian authorities of Angola , as well as its human rights component , were also retained in the country as part of the Observer Missions staffing establishment .  
The Special Representative wishes , once more , to conclude his report by urging all concerned authorities and organizations , in Africa as well as in the United Nations , to use all possible means to ensure that peace and security finally prevail and are respected throughout the Great Lakes region ; that all civilian populations in the region are fully protected ; and that their basic economic needs are fulfilled .  These are the fundamental requirements for allowing a culture of human rights to develop and to take deep root in the region .  
The provisional expansion of UNOMSIL was supported by additional resources utilized for the deployment of military observers and additional international civilian staff in the fields of political and civil affairs and human rights , as well as for the necessary administrative , technical and logistical support services .  
While UNAMSIL took over the substantive civilian and military components of UNOMSIL , as well as its assets , the significant expansion of the Mission necessitated commensurate strengthening of its civilian staffing establishment , logistical and technical support structures , the provision of additional communications , electronic data-processing and other equipment , acquisition of vehicles and contracting additional air assets .  
A provision of $ 337,500 was made to cover the cost of peacekeeping assistance team seminars in South America , training courses for military and civilian police and national trainers on peacekeeping , human rights and humanitarian assistance at the International Training Centre of the International Labour Organization at Turin , Italy , as well as for assistance to national and regional training and to multilateral and multidimensional exercises .  
Even after signing the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement , the Ethiopian hordes had wilfully , wantonly and methodically launched indiscriminate attacks against civilian targets , taken prisoners , tortured , raped and murdered , attacked and destroyed villages , public facilities , cultural and religious infrastructures and institutions and engaged in ethnic cleansing , causing large numbers of persons to become displaced .  
Reiterates its call upon all States and parties to the Peace Agreement to ensure that the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms and effective , functioning democratic institutions will be central elements in developing civilian structures consistent with the territorial integrity of all States in the region , within their internationally recognized borders , taking fully into account all relevant Security Council resolutions ;  
Strongly condemns the continued use of disproportionate and indiscriminate force by Russian military forces , federal servicemen and State agents , including attacks against civilians and other breaches of international law as well as serious violations of human rights , such as forced disappearances , extrajudicial , summary and arbitrary executions , torture and other inhuman and degrading treatment , and calls upon the Government of the Russian Federation to comply with its international human rights and humanitarian law obligations in its operations against Chechen fighters and to take all measures to protect the civilian population ;  
Calls upon the Russian Federation to ensure that both civilian and military prosecutors offices undertake systematic , credible and exhaustive criminal investigations and prosecutions of all violations of international humanitarian law and human rights , in particular of those members of federal forces , federal servicemen and the personnel of law enforcement agencies against civilians allegedly implicated in war crimes and human rights violations and to pursue with rigour the cases which have been referred to them ;  
The time has come for the United Nations to have its say on the matter of this aggression , which is in flagrant violation of international law and the Charter of the United Nations and whose victims comprise some hundreds of dead and thousands of wounded among the innocent civilian population , to say nothing of the deliberate destruction of the infrastructure that is vital to the economy and to everyday life in Iraq .  
The United States of America and the United Kingdom are committing acts of aggression and violating Iraqs airspace and territory on a daily basis on the pretext of allegedly enforcing the illegal and unlawful no-flight zones that were imposed by these two countries in a pathological display of military power that poses a threat to the security and safety of innocent civilian citizens and represents an assault on the sovereignty of an independent Member State of the United Nations .  
Moreover , Israeli settlers have been engaged in a daily terror campaign against the Palestinian civilian population during which they have shot civilians , blocked roads , burned orchards , destroyed infrastructures and have committed a wide range of other atrocities .  
Expressing its deep concern over the severity of humanitarian sufferings of affected civilian populations , the World Conference requests the relevant international institutions to continue rendering urgent financial and humanitarian assistance to populations expelled from their homes and calls for enabling refugees and internally displaced persons to return to their homes voluntarily , in safety and dignity ;  
It can not but be recognized that small arms are , paradoxically , those that claim the most victims , both civilian and military , given the nature of the current conflicts afflicting many countries , small arms and light weapons , apart from their undeniable advantage in terms of cost , proving to be the most adapted to the terrain and to the actions engaged in : easily transportable , they can be rapidly distributed and concealed . 
The Armenian falsifiers would rather prefer to claim that if any single Turk was killed during these tragic times , then that was strictly due to self-defence , that no civilian Turks were murdered , raped or pillaged whereas even the Tsarist officers were horrified to see the frenzy of massacring defenceless Turks perpetrated by armed Armenian gangs and paramilitaries in the most vicious manner .  
Our country went through a very trying and turbulent period at that time , resulting in lawlessness , the loss of a few lives , a severe economic downtown , the purported abrogation of the Constitution , the imposition of martial law , the dismissal of the elected Government while it was in captivity , a change of the presidency and the appointment of the civilian interim Government . 
The Ivorian patriots were just savouring that victory , so dearly yet so proudly won over the military regime , whose rule had been marked by numerous barbaric acts committed against civilian populations , when , to their great surprise , there rang out over foreign radio stations appeals by the Rassemblement des Rpublicains ( RDR ) , calling upon its militants to oppose the victory of candidate Laurent Gbagbo and thereby calling into question the presidential election of 22 October 2000 .  
Finally , blurred lines between the civilian and military character of camps expose civilians inside to the risk of attack by opposing forces , where camps are perceived to serve as launching pads for renewed fighting .  
The joint unit established by resolution 1051 ( 1996 ) will continue to review the categorized list in the light of additional information that may become available for the purposes of identifying items that are covered under the relevant provisions of that resolution , because of their possible dual use for civilian and prohibited purposes under resolution 687 ( 1991 ) of 3 April 1991 and other relevant resolutions .  
At its fifty-seventh session , in April 2001 , the Commission on Human Rights adopted , without a vote , resolution 2001 / 13 on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan , in which it strongly condemned the mass killings and systematic human rights violations against civilians and persons deprived of their liberty , for reasons related to the armed conflict , resulting in the massive , forced displacement of the civilian population .  
The Section will be responsible for mid - and long-term planning , including succession planning , developing mission modules / templates , determining staffing tables and levels , anticipating future skills requirements , analysing and monitoring human resource trends , identifying new sources of recruitment , and managing the civilian rapid deployment capability .  
Further phases are planned and the eventual decision support system will contain all tactical information required to support the planning assumptions for rapid mission deployment , mission liquidation and redeployment of assets , build-up and deployment of surplus assets , personnel and contingent placements and mobilization , military and civilian mobilization , and financial and administrative information to support budget planning and financial analyses ( $ 150,000 ) . 
Attacks against the civilian population and systematic killings and summary executions have been a part of the pattern of egregious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law perpetrated by different factions in the protracted armed conflict in Sierra Leone .  
During the summit , there was a general consensus of the urgent need for the implementation of an immediate ceasefire in the areas of military operation in southern Sudan in order to accelerate the flow of humanitarian assistance to the needy civilian population in those areas , and to facilitate for constructive negotiations between the Government and the rebel movement ( SPLM / A ) , with the ultimate aim of reaching a peaceful resolution of the conflict in the south . 
My Governments continued call for a comprehensive ceasefire in the war-affected areas in the south will obviously , if implemented , alleviate the suffering of the civilian population in those areas and provide a conducive atmosphere for a peaceful settlement of the conflict .  
This resolution , however , representing as it does a dangerous precedent in which the Security Council gives unlimited authorization to States cooperating with the Government of Kuwait to interfere with civilian trade , is not based on Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations and does not therefore make it permissible to use coercive military measures for its enforcement .  
The manifestations of that daily horror are daily massacres of the civilian population , summary and extrajudicial executions , the deportation of entire populations , the taking of hostages , hijacking , the illegal capture and destruction of aircraft , the systematic rape and burying alive of women , destitution , other serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , the deliberate and criminal spread of HIV / AIDS , and so forth .  
The Secretary-General has also recommended the Member States ensure that their military , civilian and police personnel involved in United Nations peacekeeping operations be trained with regard to international human rights , humanitarian law and refugee law , especially as concerns the rights and protection of children and women , in advance of troop deployment to United Nations operations .  
The Missions initial objective in phase III would be to establish a mixed civilian and military presence , as well as a forward support base , in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
Preparations are under way for recruitment and deployment of adequate numbers of United Nations civilian personnel to accompany the military deployment , including political , human rights , humanitarian , child protection , public information , disarmament , demobilization and reintegration and logistical personnel .  
Recalling also its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
The problem of the illicit traffic in and the circulation of small arms and light weapons within the region of Southeastern Europe is of particular concern for the Republic of Macedonia , especially after the 1997 civilian unrest in Albania and the conflict in Kosovo ; it poses a serious threat not only to the security and stability of my country but to the broader region as well , particularly through its severe , adverse impact on economic , social and human development .  
The plan provides for an integrated peacekeeping mission headed by a Special Representative of the Secretary-General , which would be composed of a military component , a civilian police component , and a small civilian component , including experts who would provide crucial assistance to the emergent East Timorese administration .  The latter component will be essential to the functioning of the government in the immediate post-independence period .  
Moreover , the civilian self-defence policy encouraged by the Government , which has enabled civilians to be trained in weapons handling , has spread to most of the northern , southern , eastern and central provinces .  
The revised concept of operation of UNAMSIL is based on the forward deployment , in successive phases and in an integrated fashion , of the Missions military force of 17,500 personnel as well as United Nations civil affairs , civilian police and human rights personnel , representatives of humanitarian agencies and government personnel and assets to establish and consolidate State authority and basic services in areas controlled by RUF , including diamond producing regions , and in some border areas .  
In addition , pursuant to Security Council resolution 1308 ( 2000 ) of 17 July 2000 , and in the light of the potential spread of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection among the population of Sierra Leone as well as among the Missions military and civilian personnel , it is proposed that a post for an HIV / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) policy officer be established at the P-4 level .  
The primary strategic objective of the Missions public information programme is to project , country-wide , the efforts of the military and civilian components of UNAMSIL in facilitating the peace process in Sierra Leone and the promotion of a better understanding of the mandate of the Mission and the activities of other international organizations that are operating in the country .  
The Office of the Spokesman includes a civilian spokesman and a military spokesman who jointly conduct twice-weekly press briefings and speak on behalf of the Mission , aggressively and strategically utilizing the Missions achievements at press briefings ; participating in weekly briefings of members of UNAMSIL civilian and military staff , as well as other United Nations agencies ; organizing and conducting tours for journalists ; providing timely and aggressive responses to negative or inaccurate media coverage ; and regularly participating in local radio and television programmes . 
Recalling also its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
The objectives of the plan include improving police competency and integrity , organizational capacity , institutional integrity and cooperation between civilian police and the judiciary ; fully establishing the State border service ; enhancing cooperation among law enforcement institutions ; and increasing police and public awareness of their respective rights , duties , and role as members of the international community .  
Calls upon all Governments and parties in complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular in armed conflicts and in post-conflict situations , in countries in which humanitarian personnel are operating , in conformity with the relevant provisions of international law and national laws , to cooperate fully with the United Nations and other humanitarian agencies and organizations and to ensure the safe and unhindered access of humanitarian personnel in order to allow them to perform efficiently their task of assisting the affected civilian population , including refugees and internally displaced persons ;  
In his opening statement he said that , as Chair of the Ad Hoc Group of Governmental Experts , he had been involved in the Convention process for a long time and considered it to be an innovative and indispensable international legal instrument which had significantly reduced the number of innocent victims among civilian populations .  
The principal objective of the Convention and its annexed Protocols was to protect civilians and their property , either by banning the use of certain particularly cruel and inhumane weapons or by restricting their use in any circumstances in which lives might be lost , civilians injured or civilian property damaged .  
And all other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully their obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions , of 12 August 1949 , to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law , to end the use of children as soldiers and to avail themselves of services offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
At the impact of the ongoing armed conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effect on the civilian population , in particular women and children , and at continuing serious violations of human rights , fundamental freedoms and international humanitarian law by all parties to the conflict , in particular :  
At the preoccupying situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , particularly in the eastern parts of the country , and at the continuing violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , including atrocities against civilian populations , committed , often with impunity , by all parties in the conflict throughout the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , while stressing in this context that occupying forces should be held responsible for human rights violations in territory under their control , and in particular condemns :  
The situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , and particularly in the zones held by the rebel groups and under foreign occupation , and the persistent violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law , including the atrocities against the civilian populations , usually committed with complete impunity , while emphasizing in this regard that the occupying forces should be held accountable for the violations of human rights in the territories under their control .

To establish or strengthen operational coordination mechanisms for the competent institutions so as to increase the effectiveness of national and regional efforts to combat crime and all threats to democratic security necessitating the use of military , security or civilian police forces , such as terrorism , illicit arms trafficking , drug trafficking and organized crime ; Article 18 .  
Multinationals are the main engine of world economic growth , especially international investment .  In the last several years , multinationals have engaged in and controlled 1 / 3 of the world 's gross product , 2 / 3 of the world trade , 70% of the direct investment , and 80% of the technology transfer and the research and development of civilian technology .  
The United States , mouthing human rights , in the end utilized concentrated bombing and depleted uranium bombs - - weapons prohibited by international law , and bombed residential sites , schools , hospital , and other civilian targets , even flagrantly bombing chemical installations , causing the spread of chemicals and reagents , seemingly carrying out chemical warfare .  
[ Li Dingfan ] For many years while making efforts to enter the international market for peaceful utilization of nuclear energy , China 's nuclear industry has fully developed and utilized nuclear energy resources to serve the construction of the national economy and the livelihood of the people ; constructed many nuclear power projects , such as the Qinshan and Daya Bay nuclear power stations ; developed newly rising high-tech industries in which nuclear fuel , civilian-use nuclear technology , and production of nonnuclear civilian goods support and complement one another ;  
[ Li Dingfan ] In the new century , the CNNC 's entire line of thinking on development is to further cut the new development path of " integrating military and civilian production , developing nuclear energy power generation , readjusting the structure , giving prominence to efficiency , strengthening management , and invigorating the nuclear industry with science and technology . "  
do a good job in diverting redundant workers to other jobs and increasing efficiency with reduced staff ; put it in a prominent place to improve efficiency ; and establish a new-type small and efficient nuclear technology industrial system based on the integration of military and civilian production .  
For medium-sized and small enterprises , we have tried to gradually develop them into professional and special enterprises characterized by being " focused , excellent , unique , and modern " by helping them increase profits and make up losses , and realize investment diversity through adopting such policies as separating the production of military and civilian products , and make full use of merger for the bankrupt , and turning debt to equity .  
At present , China 's civilian networks are widely distributed , and the web sites and net points are scattering everywhere .  To enable these scattered strengths to really form an integrated joint force for attack and defense during the war , we must establish a highly authoritative , centralized and united network people 's war organizational organ .  
In line with a civilian market having abundant technology and products that are suited to the requirements of military equipment , many civilian-use technologies such as electronics technology , information technology , production technology , and materials technologies , all of which have developed rapidly , our army has instituted several " joint logistics reforms " and logistics reforms with " socialized support " as the main content , thus decreasing the burden and lengthening the strides forward .  
By 2010 , military specialized technical cadres competent for both military and civilian services should basically be trained mainly by regular schools of higher learning , and a proper number of graduates from regular schools of higher learning should be selected to fill command posts , so that the knowledge structure and scientific and cultural levels of military cadres can be improved fundamentally and a military personnel training system compatible with China 's national conditions and our army 's characteristics can take shape .  
Xiamen now ranks as one of the top-ten economically strong cities in the country .  To meet the need of the state 's safety , Xiamen has initially built an industrial system , which can rapidly covert civilian production to defense technology industry .  Electronic , machine tool , and chemical industrial enterprises constitute a major part of this industrial system .  
The city has developed , in a selected and planned manner , more than 130 projects that can manufacture products both for military and civilian purposes .  To meet the need of military maneuvers , the city has repeatedly made such a conversion in an effort to turn sci-tech achievements into combat capability .  Now a total of 16 high-tech industrial enterprises are able to manufacture military articles to meet various needs at short notice .  
In the meantime , to meet the need of military combat readiness in the new period , they have integrated wartime and peacetime work , coordinated military and civilian affairs , and worked out an overall plan on building regional battlegrounds in cooperation with the troops stationed in the relevant region , by focusing on port , communication , and ship building .  
After a certain number of years ' efforts , the army 's technical cadres with specialties of both military and civilian applicability will be cultivated mainly through regular higher education , some outstanding regular college graduates will fill the commander 's position of the army 's grass-roots units , and around 40 percent of the army 's annual cadre replenishment will be those trained through regular higher education .  
Cultivating military cadres with the assistance of civilian colleges and universities is an inevitable choice made to adapt to the world 's military development trends , to the " Two fundamental changes " in our military construction and to the needs for " winning wars " in the future .  It is a practical step in carrying out and implementing the essence of Chairman Jiang 's directives .  
Like their civilian counterparts , the legal affairs that military lawyers have to handle involve those relevant to criminal , civil , economic , administrative , maritime , and financial laws , and so they must be totally familiar with the laws and regulations of the country so that they can properly handle the legal affairs in the armed forces and legal affairs that involve both military and civilian departments ;  
The training exercise command center on board the vessel , which had been jointly set up by the units of the state organs or military units concerned , had found out or tackled problems through coordination ; had revised in a timely fashion both the measures and steps for the wartime emergency mobilization and requisition of civilian vessels ; and had built a faster and highly efficient operational mechanism during the training exercise .  
Relevant military and civilian personnel generally think that frequent exercises not only have rigorously trained the front-support contingent participating in sea battles , but also have strengthened the military-government and military-people relationships in coastal regions and raised the national defense awareness of the masses in these regions .  
A number of large and medium cities seized the opportunity of the rapid development of capital construction , quickly building new large and medium leading projects to make products for both peacetime and wartime use , and building underground bomb shelters integrated with civilian buildings , for a simultaneous growth of war readiness , social , and economic efficiency .  
The bloody Palestinian-Israeli conflicts that had continued for two weeks escalated intensely on the afternoon of 12 October . The Palestinian Self-Rule Authority [ PSRA ] , the Voice of Palestine radio station , the Gaza port , and other places in Gaza as well as the Ramallah City Palestinian Police Office and some Palestinian civilian facilities in the Gaza Strip were all attacked by missiles fired by Israeli helicopters , leaving two Palestinian civilians and four policemen dead and more than 30 people wounded .  
With the efforts made in the past years , a system for training a new type of anti-chemical-warfare capable personnel has been formed in our armed forces .  At present , major combat equipment , including tanks , airplanes and vessels can better resist nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , and both the armed forces and the civilian basically have complete sets of equipment for protection against such weapons .  
Leaders and institutions at all levels should strengthen their contact with administrative departments in civilian governments at all levels , properly handle cases in which economic construction projects involve military facilities , crack down on conduct which results in damage to military facilities , and make positive contributions to protecting military facilities and maintaining national security .  
I propose that military units stationed in western China should be authorized to take special preferential measures for retaining and attracting useful personnel .  There should be stronger leadership over the programs by which military and civilian authorities will support each other and work together in promoting the construction of a civil society ; and the military should support local economic construction projects with its advantages in terms of personnel , technical , and information .  
The large-scale Chinese military and civilian action of searching for Wang Wei , the missing parachuting pilot , was concluded at 18:00 yesterday .  The people of all walks of life in Hainan Province expressed deep sorrow at the fact that there is no possibility of Wang Wei returning alive , and acclaimed him as a hero in defending the motherland .  
We should target the characteristic that most logistical science and technology have military and civilian applications as we vigorously bring in local advanced and practical scientific and technological results , put civilian work to military use and promptly turn them into a military economic benefit , so that they can provide a service and boost our safeguard capability .  We should pay attention to using society 's R &amp; D capability to accelerate the strong pace of using scientific and technological advancement to achieve security .  
At the ongoing Beijing International Week , the Great Wall Rocket Company is a very eye-catching exhibitor .  Visitors are amazed by the gigantic models of the advanced carrier rockets of the Long March series , electronic traffic maps , sensors , satellite positioning and navigation instruments , TV receivers that can receive high-resolution pictures via satellites , and other high-tech civilian products on display at the company 's booths .  
Jiang Yongquan who was locked up at the Jiaohe Detention Center for suspected murder never had anyone coming to see him and give him money or articles of daily use since his detention .  The civilian police at the detention center brought a change of cloth and a cotton quilt from home and gave these to him .  Deeply moved , Jiang volunteered to confess the truth about how he collaborated with others in robbing taxi drivers at knife point , thus solving a major case which remained unresolved for three long years .  
At the meeting , Jiang Zemin , on behalf of the party Central Committee , the State Council , and the Central Military Commission , extended warm congratulations to national model military officers transferred to civilian work and to advanced units and workers engaged in work in resettling demobilized officers and extended cordial regards to the military officers to be transferred to civilian work and to those comrades engaged in resettling such military personnel .  
the proportion of the gross industrial product made up of dominant products , high-tech products and technical products for both military and civilian use rising to 40 percent from the current approximately 30 percent ;  
According to what is understood , for more than 20 years China 's national defense science and technology industry has gradually realized a transformation from an industry that produces industrial products for military use only , to one that produces products that integrate military and civilian use .  Every industry within the military industrial complex has fundamentally formed a developmental pattern with professional characteristics for products for the civilian industry .  
As China 's accession to the WTO is approaching , the government has changed their views on civilian-run economic sectors , and civilian capital has also increased .  As a result , the authorities responsible for the media formally clarified their stand a month ago on foreign capital 's participation in media operations .  
The provincial military district system , in accordance with relevant regulations at a national level and in the military , integrate political education , organization and rectification , military training , recruitment work , and major holiday and commemoration activities , accomplishing national defense of civilian militia reserves .  
The party , government , military , and civilian must pool their efforts , coordinate closely , and expand in a deep and sustained way the advertisement of the " National Defense Education Law " , creating a fine social atmosphere that all people will focus on , be concerned with , and support .  
They have also dispatched the fleet to the sea to conduct test training in different sea areas and under different weather conditions .  They have successively completed more than 30 difficult training courses , including replenishment in rocky areas at night , round-the-clock comprehensive supplies from all directions , replenishment in strong waves and winds , and joint logistical replenishment tasks by military and civilian vessels .  
The PLA , armed police , and law enforcement units stationed in Tibet are strong pillars and loyal guards who safeguard the motherland 's frontier areas and Tibet 's stability .  They are important forces for building the socialist material and spiritual civilizations in Tibet . They must continue to carry forward their fine traditions and work styles , ensure their own construction , strengthen their unity with the local governments , civilian authorities , and the people , and make new contributions to Tibet 's stability and development .  
Since the introduction of the reform and opening-up program , our army has firmly implemented the Party 's basic line , and supported reform with actual deeds .  It has correctly dealt with difficult problems such as helping officers and men transfer to civilian jobs , become decommissioned , and settle down , and assisting their family members find jobs .  It has successfully fulfilled the task of reshuffling and streamlining the army , actively participated in and supported the local economic construction projects , and resolutely strengthened unity and stability in the country .  
Since the 1991 Gulf War , the US and British aircraft have been flying on patrol missions in two " no-fly zones , " set up over the north and south of Iraq respectively , frequently striking at various civilian and military targets in Iraq , and resulting in losses in human life and property .  
actively organize and encourage both army troops and militia reserves to plunge themselves in the current large-scale development of the country 's western region ; take up urgent , difficult , dangerous , and heavy tasks on our own initiative ; and strive for dual effects of promoting economic development and consolidating the defense building in line with the principle of manufacturing products for both peacetime and wartime use and for both military and civilian use .  
The key to building a system of logistics support that is adaptable to joint operations and to fundamentally eliminating such deficiencies as multiple channeling , separation of the general-purpose support and the special-purpose support , and operation via separate bodies is to take the road of integration .  This will bring about a new setup of logistics support where support for the three armed services are integrated as one , the system is compatible to both the military and the civilian , and the general-purpose logistics supplies and services are all supported in a unified way .  
In 1994 , Russia changed into following the gradualist approach to changing products .  After a few years , the situation of militarization of the national economy was changed ; the value of output of armament industries represented a reduced proportion of the GDP , and civilian products constituted a growing proportion in terms of the product mix of armament industry complexes .  
However , the absolute quantity of civilian products produced by armament industry enterprises declined rapidly , mainly because of insufficient investment , debt payment failures , competition of foreign goods , unsuccessful privatization , and technological and operational difficulties in changing products .

Its basic characteristic is the comprehensive use of various high-tech information technology [ IT ] developed in the 1990 ' s to conduct rapid , hidden , and destructive damage to the enemy 's military and civilian computer networks and communication systems , cutting off the enemy 's military contacts , disabling command , dowsing the fighting spirit , and bringing great chaos to the economy and society of the country concerned .  This will finally allow the attacking side to achieve the goal of striking the first blows without shedding a drop of blood .  
During the visit , Jiang Zemin urged all departments participating in the cooperation of war industries to implement the principle of " the integration of military and civilian use , and the integration of wartime and peacetime needs , " meet the needs of the new situation of the development of the socialist market economy , adhere to the principle of turning civilians into a part of the armed forces , and establish a vigorous structure for the development science and technology for national defense ;  
We must obtain maximum results from our limited resources , form a complete set of effective mechanisms for competition , appraisal , and supervision , optimize the distribution of the science , technology and productive forces of the whole society , promote the ties , integration and cooperation between the military and civilian scientific research structures , and enable the achievements in technological innovation to be turned faster and better into productive forces for national defense and economic development .  
A few days ago , at a certain sea port in northern Jiangsu , more than 30 civilian ships of large tonnage called up by the Jiangsu Provincial Military District carried officers and men of a certain motorized infantry brigade and heavy equipment and sailed towards the wavy Huang Hai sea area to start a two-day , two-night sea-crossing and military tactics and technology training .  
Upon receiving an emergency order , the naval training vessel " Shichang " set sail in a thick fog with visibility of only 15 m .  It braved the wind and the waves of a near Force 10 typhoon for 17 days , sailing 4000 nautical miles .  It satisfactorily completed comprehensive training in maritime national defense mobilization with " wartime civilian vessels emergency mobilization and acquisition " as its main task .  The vessel returned to a certain military port in the Bo Hai a few days ago .  
Wen Jiabao pointed out : The troops and the civilian people in Hainan Province demonstrated a great indomitable spirit in fighting against floods by working with one heart and one mind without being daunted by dangers and difficulties , and won the initial victory in the work of resisting floods and restoring normal production .  
The circular finally stressed : We should make vigorous efforts to train and utilize qualified personnel capable of working in both military and civilian posts and this is at once a need of army building and a need for tackling the problem of lack of qualified personnel in the rural areas and promoting rural development as well . 
AMEEGC General Manger Xia Guohong told this reporter during the air show in Zhuhai that the AMEEGC will , by adhering to the guiding thought of " gearing to the market , with aerospace as the principal line , striving for scientific and technological innovations , prevailing on the strength of quality , " speed up the general adoption of the market principle and the process of converting military enterprises to civilian production in order to maintain a sustained , sound and fast development of China 's space undertakings under the conditions of market economy .  
The CWC is an important international disarmament treaty against proliferation .  It aims at the comprehensive ban and complete destruction of weapons of mass destruction .  Accordingly , the Convention seeks to exercise control and monitoring over the destruction of chemical weapons and civilian industrial enterprises producing relevant chemicals through the mandatory declaration of data and on-site inspections .  
The " Epilogue - - China 's New Century " gave full expression to the firm determination of the entire military troops and civilian people throughout the country to closely rally around the party central leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core and build our country into a rich and powerful modern socialist nation with a high degree of civilization and democracy in the new century .  
According to the " Provisional Procedure , " military cadres at the divisional level and those who are below the battalion level and who have served in the military for less than 20 years will continue to be assigned jobs when transferred to civilian work .  The local party committees and governments concerned should be responsible for arranging jobs for these cadres .  
The amount of the pension should be calculated on the basis of 80 percent of the monthly pay , military-rank pay , plus the standard allowance of the military cadre at the level equivalent to the new civilian job and the total of basic and length-of-service wages in the military .  
We should - - by means of making enterprises go listed inside and outside the territory , utilizing foreign capital , absorbing social entities , and attracting civilian capital - - bring in investment from all sides and form multiple investment entities , so as to bring about aggregate increase in the state-owned economy , yet with a decreased proportion of state-owned capital and greater control .  
The SCDS consulted the department management and staff before making its recommendations .  They considered that the pay advantage which the disciplined services now enjoy over the civilian grades in recognition of their special job factors should be preserved , but some adjustment would be justified to that element of the starting salaries of recruits entering the disciplined services which is based on academic qualification benchmarks in order to maintain broad comparability with the rest of the civil service .  
In addition , the Bureau proposes to accept the Standing Committee 's recommendations on individual JRAs payable to disciplined services staff .  It further proposes that the modified JRA governing principles should apply to civilian grades and the disciplined services alike in order to maintain broad consistency in the administration of JRAs in respect of the civilian grades and the disciplined services .  
When a scene takes place in the emperor 's palace the most formal of all costumes , the Mang , is worn by both civilian and military officials . In ordinary scenes such characters would wear a less formal Pi , and when in their homes they can wear the even more casual Chetzu . These three costumes are made of soft material and have gentle lines .  
Rising up to take advantage of this opportunity and lay a comprehensive and lasting foundation for the future of the Chinese people is the common responsibility of the 1.2 billion Chinese at home and abroad . It is also the duty of the people on our bastion of national revival , civilian and military alike , to lead the way with great wisdom , determination , and solidarity , based on our many years of experience and achievements in implementing political democracy and an economy that benefits the people .  
An ad hoc task force comprising both civilian and military investigators is now hard at work on the case , but has discovered signs that many documents have either been lost or falsified . Many worrisome questions remain unanswered : How many people are involved ? How high up does the case reach ?  
The Taiwan Garrison Command was established in 1958 , assuming complete control over martial law , police functions , entry to and exit from Taiwan , media and cultural censorship , postal spying , and military trials ( which could also be used in civilian cases ) .  
The civilian population of the occupied territories has continued to suffer a heavy toll of casualties caused by the disproportionately harsh and violent methods employed by the Israeli authorities to repress the popular uprising .  
In flagrant defiance of international humanitarian law , crimes such as " ethnic cleansing " , mass rapes , torture and deliberate bombing of civilian targets continue to be committed against the innocent Bosnian people .  
VHF equipment is required to provide static , mobile and portable communications to military observers , civilian police monitors , civilian engineering services , civil affairs and administrative support units in the area of operation .  
The unencumbered balance of appropriations , $ 34,655,950 gross ( $ 35,247,050 net ) as at 31 December 1993 , will be sufficient to meet the cost of maintaining MINURSO at its current military and civilian strength for a period of some 10 months .  
These estimates provide for a total of 354 military observers , 6,226 military contingent personnel ( out of an authorized level of 6,625 ) , 128 civilian police observers , 243 international civilian staff , 200 United Nations Volunteers and 500 local staff .  
Several major cities remained under siege , encircled or under sustained military pressure by one or the other side , resulting in increased hardship for the civilian population and compounding the already disastrous humanitarian situation .  
The initial requirement would be to bring UNAVEM II rapidly to its previous level of 350 military observers , 126 police observers and 14 military medical staff , with an appropriate number of international and local civilian staff .  
Considers that an international tribunal with general jurisdiction should be established urgently to prosecute genocide , crimes against humanity , including murder , extermination , enslavement , deportation , imprisonment , torture , rape , persecutions on political , racial and religious grounds and other inhumane acts directed against any civilian population , and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the Additional Protocols of 1977 thereto ;  
To meet the growing need for civilian personnel during crises , Canada will offer the United Nations secondment or the loan of civilian personnel on a short-term urgent basis to help in the development of a fully trained capacity in the areas of human rights , legal advice , humanitarian assistance , and other aspects of a rapid civilian response to crises . 
In the context of our common endeavour we must encourage international cooperation in all possible uses of science and advanced technology for both military and civilian purposes so-called dual-use through the transfer and exchange of scientific and technical know-how for the peaceful purposes of promoting sustainable development and the preservation of international security .  
This calls for the strengthening of preventive diplomacy , including developing adequate early warning capacities , dispatching field missions , and utilizing the good offices of Governments , international or regional organizations or eminent personalities in order to get to the source of an imminent conflict and safeguard the security , well-being and human rights of the affected civilian population .  
These have been the tasks of protecting humanitarian operations during continuing warfare , protecting civilian populations in designated safe areas and pressing the parties to achieve national reconciliation at a pace faster than they were ready to accept . 
In this context , my Government wishes to emphasize the need for the quick deployment of UNAVEM III , because it alone as we all know will bear responsibility for the quartering , disarming and selection of UNITA troops that are to be integrated into the unified national army of Angola and for the demobilization of the excess military personnel that will be reintegrated into civilian life after receiving vocational training .  
Four of the five nuclear-weapon States and some of their allies had taken a clear position on the Treaty 's indefinite and unconditional extension , but with regard to such matters as the pace of the negotiations on a complete test-ban treaty , peaceful nuclear explosions , the future of nuclear energy for civilian purposes and negative security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States , the overall impression was that it was business as usual .  
By 21 February , a total of 211 international staff members from 36 countries had joined the Mission , comprising 111 substantive staff , of whom 72 are United Nations Volunteers , 60 administrative and logistical support staff , 10 military liaison officers and 30 civilian police observers .  
Any armed attack on the civilian population is obviously prohibited , and that prohibition does not end even if the indirect aim is to achieve military objectives , unless there is a pressing military need and , at the same time , a certain proportionality between the military objective to be achieved and the expected and foreseeable harm which may be caused to the civilian population .  
Such actions affecting private property or public utilities designed to meet the needs of the civilian population involve a high degree of risk for civilians and can not be justified as legitimate military operations .  
They also shared the view that steps could be taken to facilitate the early conclusion of negotiations on complex substantive issues that are yet to be considered , namely " economic and social issues and the agrarian situation " , " strengthening of civilian power and role of the army in a democratic society " and " constitutional reforms and electoral regime " .  
The revised timetable provides for completion of two main substantive issues ( economic and social issues and the agrarian situation ; and strengthening of civilian power and role of the army in a democratic society ) before the electoral campaign is fully under way .  
These confidence-building measures , which could lead to an informal suspension of offensive military operations , would constitute a demonstration of good will aimed at alleviating the suffering of the civilian population in areas affected by the armed confrontation , protecting human rights and facilitating the work of MINUGUA as well as all national entities devoted to the protection and promotion of human rights . 
With regard to military operations , until such time as a cease-fire is agreed to and takes effect , URNG insists on the commitment to respect the provisions of the comprehensive agreement on human rights intended to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population , protect human rights and facilitate the work of MINUGUA and of all national bodies devoted to the protection and promotion of human rights and the rights deriving from international humanitarian law .  
The travel of international civilian personnel to the mission area has been calculated at an average cost of $ 5,800 per person per round-trip ( basic air fare $ 3,500 and 100 kilograms of unaccompanied baggage $ 2,300 ) , based on actual recent expenditures .  
The cost estimate also makes provision for pending claims by civilian and military personnel for lost personal effects as a result of the civil war ( $ 500,000 ) , of which an amount of $ 375,000 has been brought forward from the previous mandate period .  
Urges all the Afghan parties to respect accepted humanitarian rules , as set out in the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto , of 1977 , to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians from acts of reprisal and violence , including ill-treatment , torture and summary executions , and to expedite the simultaneous release of prisoners wherever they may be held ;  
Deeply concerned further by the increasingly severe and grave violations of human rights by the Government of Iraq against the civilian population in southern Iraq , in particular in the southern marshes , where the combination of massive drainage projects and wide-ranging military operations on the part of the Government of Iraq has forced residents of the marshes to flee in large numbers , many of whom have sought refuge on the border between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran ,  
The progress report focused on prerequisites of learning from experience with United Nations peace-keeping operations , and on the status of a ready capacity to act for six substantive components of complex missions : information , electoral , repatriation , human rights , civilian police and military .  
The travel costs of military and civilian personnel to the mission area on assignment , rotation or repatriation have been estimated at an average of $ 2,000 per person one way , or $ 4,000 round trip ( basic air fare of $ 1,000 , plus 100 kilogrammes of unaccompanied baggage and travel allowances at $ 1,000 ) .  The cost of a round-trip travel on a three-day official mission to New York is estimated at $ 1,400 ( $ 700 basic airfare and $ 700 in allowances and daily subsistence allowance ) .  
The possibility of reducing the huge financial , material and human resources devoted to the military sector and reallocating part of them to the civilian sector of national economies has been the object of deliberations within the framework of the United Nations for over three decades .  
Travel costs for the military and civilian personnel have been calculated on the basis of the following travel rates : ( a ) for repatriation of military contingent personnel , by group travel arrangements , at a rate of $ 540 per person ; and ( b ) for international civilian personnel , by commercial arrangements , at a rate of $ 3,500 per person one way or $ 7,000 round trip , inclusive of the entitlement for excess unaccompanied baggage .  
Acts of inhumanity , cruelty or barbarity directed against the life , dignity or physical or mental integrity of persons [ , in particular wilful killing , torture , mutilation , biological experiments , taking of hostages , compelling a protected person to serve in the forces of a hostile Power , unjustifiable delay in the repatriation of prisoners of war after the cessation of active hostilities , deportation or transfer of the civilian population and collective punishment ] ;  
The Committee was informed that subsequent to the preparation of the Secretary-General 's report , the Security Council , on 10 February 1995 , approved the deployment of an additional 30 civilian police , increasing the authorized level to 120 ( see S / 1995 / 130 ) .  
Estimates for activities ranging from water purification and storage to the number of civilian and military personnel required for the Mission and infrastructure repairs were excessive ; in that regard she fully shared the concerns expressed and the recommendations put forward by the Advisory Committee in paragraphs 24 , 34 , 39 and 42 of its report .  
The ninth report of the Human Rights Division , issued in September 1993 , emphasized that the increase in crime was linked to non-implementation or delayed or incomplete implementation of the agreements : " [ Firstly ] , the failure to confiscate military weapons in the hands of the civilian population . . . 
In a whole range of areas , there is no halt to military actions , in clear violation of the agreements of 21 and 31 December last year between the Bosnian parties on a cease-fire and on a complete cessation of hostilities .  The situation is being aggravated by attempted offensives from the Government forces and by disproportionate responses from the Bosnian Serbs , including acts against the civilian population which is absolutely inadmissible .  
Despite an almost total information blockade and the restriction of the movement of representatives of international organizations by the Croatian side under various pretexts , foreign media have managed to inform the world public about some of the atrocities and the systematic drive of the Croatian military and civilian authorities to erase the traces of these atrocities by burning the dead , burying them in unmarked mass graves or by washing the streets and roads to remove the evidence .  
Consequently , in the Agreement , URNG undertook " to respect the inherent attributes of the human person and to contribute to the effective enjoyment of human rights " and , like the Government , it recognized the need to end the suffering of the civilian population and to respect the human rights of wounded , captured and disabled combatants . 
During the period covered by this report , the Mission verified complaints of alleged violations by both parties of the commitment to respect the human rights of wounded , captured and disabled combatants , as well as to end the suffering of the civilian population .  
In the Mission 's view , the laying of mines in places where people work , live or circulate constitutes a violation of this commitment and of the principles of international humanitarian law , since it puts the civilian population at unnecessary risk and there is no proportionality between the intended military objective and the foreseeable harm that may be caused to that population . 
The Mission believes that URNG has committed human rights violations and has failed to observe the commitment to end the suffering of the civilian population , by making threats and taking action against civilian property for the purpose of collecting the " war tax " ; by unnecessarily endangering civilians not involved in the conflict during attacks on military bases and units ; by laying mines or explosive devices in places where civilians work , live or circulate ; and by taking reprisals . 
Following the perverse logic of ethnic cleansing , ethnic Serbs were often evacuated prior to an attack against civilian targets in ethnically mixed regions so that Serb forces could conduct indiscriminate shelling and wholesale random killings , safe in the knowledge that among the victimized population there were no ethnic Serbs .  
In this difficult moment , I wish to express my Government 's full solidarity with the UNPROFOR forces , particularly with the courageous Dutch soldiers operating in the Srebrenica territory , sharing the hardships of the civilian population they are protecting and facing overwhelmingly superior forces .  
During the Conference , deep concern was voiced over the recent brutal attacks carried out by Bosnian Serbs against United Nations-declared safe areas , special emphasis being given to the massacre of civilians and the continued policy of ethnic cleansing and atrocities committed against the civilian population . 
The Federal Government expects and demands that , proceeding from Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations , the international community , and the Security Council in particular , take immediate and resolute measures to put an end to the aggression and the killing of the innocent civilian population and the prevention of ethnic cleansing and to see to it that Croatian armed forces withdraw to the separation lines established by the relevant resolutions of the Security Council .  
Should evidence surface that unlawful acts were committed , we are determined to bring to justice all those responsible for violations of international humanitarian law , as would anyway be the case with any individual who would be responsible for crimes committed , in particular , against civilian population .  
By the horrifying indiscriminate mass artillery and missile bombardment of predominantly civilian targets in all the towns of Serb Krajina , Croatia unambiguously demonstrated that one of its main goals , apart from imposing its sovereignty over Krajina , was to inflict heavy losses on the civilian population and by so doing incite a mass exodus of Serbs in order to create an ethnically pure Croat state .  
The report also noted that URNG had committed human rights violations and had failed to observe the commitment to end the suffering of the civilian population by making threats and taking action against civilian property for the purpose of collecting " war tax " ; by unnecessarily endangering civilians not involved in the conflict during attacks on military bases and units ; by laying mines and explosive devices in places where civilians work , live or circulate ; and by taking reprisals . 
As a result of insufficient communications infrastructure , unreliable municipal power supply , as well as basic operational needs of the civilian staff and civilian police , an unforeseen expenditure amount of $ 87,100 was required for communication circuits to Port-au-Prince , Les Cayes , Gona \ x { 9d33 } es , and Cap Ha \ x { 9ba0 } ien , two-way radios for the CIVPOL vehicles , batteries , inverters , transformers , and telephone and UHF base installations .  
While the number of those killed , beaten , detained and sexually assaulted remains unknown , consistent accounts by displaced persons and United Nations personnel lead to a strong presumption that Bosnian Serb soldiers committed substantial violations of international humanitarian law following the fall of Srebrenica , including mass arbitrary detention of civilian men and boys , and summary executions .  
Growing stocks of surplus fissile material from the military sector and growing amounts of plutonium in civilian fuel cycles make accountancy and control an urgent task of paramount importance .  
On many occasions in the past we have declared that the practice of waging indiscriminate attacks against a defenceless civilian population is a particularly heinous practice that is totally unacceptable under every standard of civil society .  
The question must be raised : what possible moral authority do NATO and the United Nations have to pursue a relentless campaign of mass bombardment of the Republic of Srpska , causing unprecedented material damage and numerous civilian casualties ?  
It aims at training senior managers of Chinese military enterprises for conversion to production of civilian goods for the domestic and world markets , and facilitating joint ventures by bringing together major domestic and international investors from the private sector in the most attractive and committed Chinese enterprises .  
Priorities included : ( a ) regaining access to civilian populations in areas controlled by factions ; ( b ) preparing a new appeal for humanitarian assistance requirements ; ( c ) meeting the emergency needs of newly displaced populations ; and ( d ) developing a cohesive and shared strategy to meet the needs of the greatest possible number of affected civilians .  
It was also agreed that funds reserved for the civilian component of the Mission should be increased to enable it to deploy constitutional legal experts , human rights monitors and mediators , and to facilitate the process of dialogue and national reconciliation in Burundi .  
The teams found evidence of extrajudicial executions , disappearances , ill treatment , harassment and the systematic and widespread destruction of houses and entire villages carried out by members of the Croatian Army and internal security forces in the Krajina against the remaining civilian population , mostly elderly men and women .  
Although some of the problems raised , such as remuneration of personnel employed in peace-keeping operations and more extensive use of United Nations Volunteers is of concern to JIU and are actually reflected in its report on staffing of the United Nations peace-keeping and related missions ( civilian component ) ( JIU / REP / 93 / 6 ) , it is difficult to make any substantive comments without access to the original records .  
For the period starting on 1 May 1995 up to 31 October 1995 , the MINUSAL team was composed of 11 Professionals , headed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General at the assistant secretary-general level , supported by 8 civilian police , 1 internationally recruited General Service staff and 15 local level staff .  
The travel of international civilian personnel to the mission area has been calculated at an average cost of $ 5,800 per person per round trip ( basic air fare $ 3,500 and 100 kilograms of unaccompanied baggage ( $ 2,300 ) ) , based on actual recent expenditures .  
It is anticipated that one of the areas to be developed is joint peace-keeping seminars , co-sponsored by national staff colleges and the United Nations , with a view to increasing general knowledge and understanding of peace-keeping for mid-level and senior military and civilian officers .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
To supplement premises provided by the Government of Angola under the terms of the status-of-forces agreement , and taking into account the total number of military and civilian personnel of the Verification Mission , UNAVEM requires the continued rental of additional premises for residential and office accommodation at Mission headquarters at Luanda and at six regional headquarters .  
Taking into account the vast area of the country , its ravaged infrastructure and the total number of military and civilian personnel to be mobilized throughout the Mission area , the services of these aircraft are considered essential in accomplishing the operational requirements of the Mission .  
Human rights action teams established by UNCRO , conducting on-site investigations , found " evidence of extrajudicial executions , disappearances , ill treatment , harassment and the systematic and widespread destruction of houses and entire villages carried out by members of the Croatian Army and internal security forces in Krajina against the remaining civilian population , mostly elderly men and women " .  
During the transitional period , civilian tasks include ensuring that refugees and displaced persons can return , supervising property matters , monitoring human rights , re-establishing the normal functioning of all public services , coordinating international support and assistance and organizing and monitoring the conduct of elections .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
United States government civilian employees assigned overseas may receive a taxable post differential of up to 25 per cent of basic salary for posting to duty stations where " extraordinarily difficult or notably unhealthful conditions or excessive physical hardships " exist .  
The living quarters allowance is intended to reimburse United States government civilian employees for costs for a temporary residence or housing whenever Government-owned or rented housing is not provided ( including rent , heat , light , fuel , gas , electricity , water and taxes , insurance and agent 's fees required by law or custom to be paid by the lessee ) .  
These heinous criminal acts , however , were preceded by 170 counts of barbaric and random rocket attack on civilian targets in the heavily crowded residential sectors of the city on 11 November 1995 , which caused the death of 39 citizens of the capital , including schoolgirls and a team of film-makers , and vast destruction of the city , in this regard , I submitted a letter dated 13 November 1995 addressed to you ( see S / 1995 / 950 ) . 
about continuing indiscriminate and deliberate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers ,  
with interest that the Government of Nigeria , on 1 October 1995 , affirmed the principle of multi-party democracy , announcing its intent to accept the principle of power-sharing , lift the ban on political activity and the press , devolve power to local levels of government and subordinate the military to civilian authority , but disappointed that only limited action in this regard has followed ,  
with mounting concern the prolongation , and in some regions the intensification , of armed hostilities among the parties in the country , including indiscriminate attacks on civilians and other violations of international humanitarian law , which have caused significant civilian casualties , displaced populations and destruction of the economic and social infrastructure of the country , in spite of repeated calls by the Security Council and the Secretary-General for a cessation of hostilities ,  
with mounting concern the prolongation , and in some regions the intensification , of armed hostilities among the parties in the country , including indiscriminate attacks on civilians and other violations of international humanitarian law , which have caused significant civilian casualties , displaced populations and destruction of the economic and social infrastructure of the country , in spite of repeated calls by the Security Council and the Secretary-General for a cessation of hostilities ,  
the absence of precise information concerning the operational requirements of each mission , the cost estimates have been based on the average cost per person per day of military personnel and civilian police derived from the commitment authorization of $ 115,373,000 gross ( $ 113,866,300 net ) provided by the General Assembly for the month of December 1995 .  
additional relevant Security Council resolutions , in particular resolutions 824 ( 1993 ) of 6 May 1993 and 836 ( 1993 ) of 4 June 1993 , in which the Council declared that Sarajevo , Tuzla , _ epa , Gora _ de , Biha _ , Srebrenica and their surroundings should be treated as safe areas , that international humanitarian agencies should be given free and unimpeded access to those areas and that there should be freedom of movement for the civilian population and humanitarian goods to , from and within the areas ,  
about continuing indiscriminate and deliberate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers ,  
with interest that the Government of Nigeria , on 1 October 1995 , affirmed the principle of multi-party democracy , announcing its intent to accept the principle of power-sharing , lift the ban on political activity and the press , devolve power to local levels of government and subordinate the military to civilian authority , but disappointed that only limited action in this regard has followed ,  
the past year , there had been increasing reports of slavery and forced labour of women and children belonging to racial , ethnic and religious minorities ; of atrocities against indigenous peoples ; of indiscriminate aerial bombardments against civilian targets , and of unaccompanied minors being conscripted into military service .  
Through its current operation Israel has demonstrated once again its utter contempt for Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) , as well the Charter provisions and principles of international law governing relations between States . My delegation regards this military action , which has brought about scores of casualties among the civilian population , particularly among women and children , as unconscionable . 
It is difficult for us to see how the firing of Katyusha rockets by Hezbollah into northern Israel , condemnable as it is , can be equated with the Israeli artillery bombardments , sea and air attacks and other missile attacks directed at the civilian populations in Lebanese villages , towns and cities , resulting in many deaths , enormous suffering and extensive destruction of property .  
The mechanisms must have a unified and clearly defined command and control structure ensuring the orderly and effective discharge of the mandate assigned to them , and precise coordination of the political , military , humanitarian , civilian and administrative components of any activity must be ensured ;  
When wars break out , once the weapons have fallen silent , the painful aftermath remains , including millions of landmines , which have a devastating , extremely deadly effect , scattered in fields and under roads and have a massive impact on civilian populations , primarily on children . 
But how many millions of these cold , cruel and silent enemies still await our unsuspecting and innocent civilian population in remote areas of the country near the western border ? 
Success in reforms , promotion of the private sector and direct foreign investment , increased activity in the democratic process and the strengthening of civilian society are essential elements of an Agenda for Development , and to a large extent depend on the support of the international community , in terms of resources and political will .  
On another level , this blockade , which has continued for more than 35 years , constitutes a violation of international humanitarian law , because it has led to unimaginable human suffering among the Cuban civilian population by imposing restrictions on the sovereign right of Cuba to develop economic relations with other countries .  
But how many millions of these cold , cruel and silent enemies still await our unsuspecting and innocent civilian population in remote areas of the country near the western border ? 
The suffering they inflict upon civilian populations , their detrimental effects on economic and social development , especially in areas infested with landmines , and the hefty financial burdens , as well as the technological limitations involved in their detection and de-activation , are undeniable . 
The occupation itself constituted the primary violation of the human rights of the civilian population and was the source of other violations and harsh practices by the occupying Israeli authorities , including closure and sealing of the occupied territories , land confiscation , the demolition of Palestinian homes , the detention of Palestinians , and the killing of Palestinians by military and undercover security forces .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
Although the Security Council meets far away from the scene of the events we are discussing today , and although we are not subject to the difficulties faced by the people in the field , I believe it is important that the personnel of the United Nations civilian and military should be aware of our solidarity with them and understanding of the difficult tasks and living conditions that they have to face .  
In welcoming the special envoy of the Secretary-General , Mrs . Sadako Ogata , United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , the Prime Minister went even further , and announced the mechanisms planned as a means to establishing permanent consultation on security measures between the military and civilian authorities concerned and the representatives of United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations .  
However , through our civil military cooperation ( CIMIC ) operations IFOR has established an effective mechanism to coordinate activities with the many international non-governmental and other civilian organizations contributing to the reconstruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
Bildt was invited to meet the NAC on 17 January where he acknowledged the efficient deployment of IFOR and the adequacy of the Peace Agreement structures , outlined the important civilian tasks ahead and emphasized that reconciliation between all the parties was the key to a stable and lasting peace .  
We also welcome the remarkable work carried out every day , frequently in dangerous conditions on the ground , by local and foreign humanitarian organizations and the various programmes , United Nations organs and international institutions to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population and to aid in the rebuilding of the country .  
They engaged in such hostile and provocative actions as breaking the sound barrier over civilian sites , dropping heat flares over agricultural land and intercepting and provoking Iraqi civilian vessels .  
Lightly armed peace-keepers and unarmed civilians were sent into areas of active warfare , where their courageous efforts helped to save untold human lives and to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population .  
In addition , we are very concerned about the continued UNITA military activity in some regions of the country , in a pattern of military movement without prior notification to UNAVEM III and of isolated attacks and ambushes against civilian and military targets alike , almost always resulting in a loss of human life . 
Hiding behind a " living shield " of members of the Government forces , they are continuing attacks which are compelling the command of the armed forces of the Republic of Tajikistan to abandon the positions occupied by it in order to avoid unjustified losses of life among military personnel and the civilian population .  
Noting with mounting concern the prolongation , and in some regions the intensification , of armed hostilities among the parties in the country , including indiscriminate attacks on civilians and other violations of international humanitarian law which have caused significant civilian casualties , displaced populations and destruction of the economic and social infrastructure of the country , in spite of repeated calls by the Security Council and the Secretary-General for a cessation of hostilities ,  
To establish or strengthen operational coordination machinery for the competent institutions so as to increase the effectiveness of national and regional efforts to combat crime and all threats to democratic security necessitating the use of military , security or civilian police forces , such as terrorism , illicit arms trafficking , drug trafficking and organized crime ;  
The permanent communications mechanism which the Parties undertake to establish and put into operation in order to facilitate secure , efficient and rapid communications among the respective competent civilian , military and public security authorities and between them and the Security Commission , with a view to preventing incidents , responding to alerts and contributing to the fulfilment of the objectives and obligations set forth in this Treaty . Article 61 .  
The mechanisms must have a unified and clearly defined command and control structure ensuring the orderly and effective discharge of the mandate assigned to them , and precise coordination of the political , military , humanitarian , civilian and administrative components of any activity must be ensured ;  
Although only the Government can put most of these commitments into effect , URNG , in addition to recognizing the need to put an end to the suffering of the civilian population and to respect the human rights of wounded , captured and disabled combatants , also undertook , inter alia , " to respect the inherent attributes of the human person and to contribute to the effective enjoyment of human rights " ( Comprehensive Agreement , fourth preambular paragraph ) .  
Progress in the political transition , for instance , the consolidation of new democratic institutions , the convergence of opinions in favour of the primacy of civilian authority , the normal conduct of elections , the emergence of new forms of representation of civil society and the national consensus surrounding the broadening of the political sectors incorporated in the Congress of the Republic .  
It ensures the proper application of the Organization 's policies and procedures relating to the assignment , recruitment and administration of civilian personnel in peace-keeping and other field missions as appropriate ; ensures the timely preparation of proposed staffing tables for new and expanded missions according to operational plans derived from Security Council decisions ; ensures the timely provision of civilian personnel to field missions ; and serves as a point of contract for information required by the Organization 's intergovernmental and expert bodies , as well as representatives of Member States .  
This seminar will provide instruction in the development of peace-keeping training methods and programmes to a select group of military and civilian police officers who already have previous United Nations peace-keeping experience and who are presently involved in peace-keeping training at the national level , or will likely become involved in the future .  
Since lasting democracy requires the solid foundation of law , the process of building a functioning judicial system and a professional civilian police force in Haiti is of paramount importance for the future of that country .  
The most updated theory of international aviation law states than an aircraft designed for " civilian " air transport belonging to a private airline and operated by a civilian crew may in a particular situation be considered to be " State aircraft " if it performs a military , customs or police function . . .  Other aircraft , besides those involved in military , customs or police services , could also be considered " State aircraft " because the enumeration in the Convention is not preclusive .  
The three country studies are being complemented by comparative analyses of selected United Nations missions , interviews with key personnel in civilian and military peace-keeping as well as national policy makers ; analyses of United Nations documentation and reports with a view to improving coordination between Headquarters and field commanders ; and review of press reports to gauge public reaction to the way in which peace-keeping operations are conducted .  
The continuing presence of the international civilian personnel and local staff in the mission area during the withdrawal period is required to provide uninterrupted administrative support to the contingents and to ensure the recovery , collection , disposal and shipment of the United Nations-owned and leased assets , hand-over of rented premises , and settlement of commercial contracts and agreements with the local vendors . 
Recalling also additional Security Council resolutions , in particular resolutions 824 ( 1993 ) of 6 May 1993 and 836 ( 1993 ) of 4 June 1993 , in which the Council declared that Sarajevo , Tuzla , _ epa , Gora _ de , Biha _ , Srebrenica and their surroundings should be treated as safe areas , that international humanitarian agencies should be given free and unimpeded access to those areas and that there should be freedom of movement for the civilian population and humanitarian goods to , from and within the areas ,  
Concerned about continuing indiscriminate and deliberate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers ,  
Noting with interest that the Government of Nigeria , on 1 October 1995 , affirmed the principle of multi-party democracy , announcing its intent to accept the principle of power-sharing , lift the ban on political activity and the press , devolve power to local levels of government and subordinate the military to civilian authority , but disappointed that only limited action in this regard has followed ,  
The cost of the mission for the 12-month period amounts to $ 7,302,500 gross ( $ 6,795,200 net ) and provides for 44 military observers , maintenance and operating costs for 38 United Nations-owned vehicles , one air support helicopter and one fixed-wing aircraft for supply purposes and overall logistic support and civilian support of 24 international and 35 local staff .  
The Advisory Committee inquired as to the administrative , organizational and resource requirements for UNFICYP 's humanitarian activities and was informed that a military unit comprising from 15 to 20 personnel , including civilian local level staff , was involved in this activity . 
As indicated in the executive summary of the report of the Secretary-General , the cost estimate of $ 17.1-million gross provides for a strength of 135 military observers and 139 civilian staff ( 64 international and 75 local ) and reflects " a moderate increase over the prior period " .  
Taking into account the geographical size of the Mission area and the number of military and civilian personnel and the premises of UNAVEM III , it is considered essential that personnel from the aforementioned sections be deployed in the regional headquarters to administer and monitor related activities under the supervision of their respective sections at Mission headquarters .  
In the light of the review of the overall staffing structure of the civilian administration of UNAVEM and its current operational requirements , the proposed staffing reflects an increase of 57 international posts ( 3 P-3 , 5 P-2 / P-1 , 27 General Service ( Other level ) and 22 Field Service ) which is offset by a decrease of 57 posts ( 5 General Service ( Principal level ) and 52 local ) , the total number of staff remaining at its currently authorized level of 714 .  
As the Mission approaches full deployment and with the operations of the logistic support service contract , emphasis was given to the strengthening of selected areas of administration and integrated support services to ensure optimum efficiency in the utilization of human resources and the timely provision of services to military and civilian personnel .  
Upon instructions from my Government , I have the honour to request Your Excellency to convene an urgent meeting of the Security Council to consider the grave situation in Lebanon resulting from the large-scale Israeli bombardment of many towns and villages in my country , including the southern suburb of Beirut , causing alarming numbers of civilian dead and wounded , thousands of displaced persons and severe damage to property .  
The United States is now engaged in an intensive diplomatic effort to restore calm and establish a more stable situation in the area which would enhance the security and well-being of the civilian population of both southern Lebanon and northern Israel .  
Israel 's premeditated and unbridled aerial and artillery attacks over the past five days against many civilian quarters in towns and villages of Lebanon , including the southern suburbs of Beirut , and its naval blockade of the port of Beirut are prime examples of acts of terrorism by Israeli policy makers , who all too readily and conveniently label others either as terrorists or as supporters of terrorists . 
The Chinese delegation expresses its profound concern at the large-scale military offensive launched by Israel in recent days in southern Lebanon , which has resulted in the loss of innocent civilian lives , the massive destruction of property and a large number of civilians ' becoming homeless or refugees , consequently further escalating the conflict in southern Lebanon and aggravating the already tense situation .  
In the meantime , Mr . Cassoulides , the official spokesman of the Greek Cypriot administration , has confirmed that in the context of the so-called " joint defence doctrine " the construction in south Cyprus of an air force base for Greece is effectively under way , and that the existing Paphos airport has already been closed to civilian air traffic for this purpose .  
In paragraph 3 of its resolution 900 ( 1994 ) of 4 March 1994 , the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to appoint , for a limited period , a senior civilian official who would draw up an overall assessment and plan of action for the restoration of essential public services in the various opstinas of Sarajevo , other than the city of Pale , and who would assist the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , in close coordination with all relevant local authorities , in the implementation of the plan .  
I should like to inform you that United States warplanes operating from bases in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are continuing to violate the airspace of the Republic of Iraq and are engaging in acts of reconnaissance , breaking the sound barrier and dropping heat flares over public and private property in the north and south of Iraq , causing damage and spreading alarm among the civilian population .  
The progress achieved in the peace negotiations and the temporary suspension of offensive and counterrevolutionary activity have created new conditions capable of permitting decisive progress in fulfilling the commitment to eradicate the suffering the internal armed confrontation has caused for the civilian population and of building confidence in the peace process .  
The Mission is deeply concerned at the continuation of this practice , which , given the army 's historic influence over such committees , undermines the primacy of civilian authority and also affects the human rights situation , in that members of the voluntary civil defence committees and former military commissioners are implicated in numerous complaints of human rights violations .  
These incursive and cruel activities which resulted in numerous human casualties and material damages to civilian population constitute a grave violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Islamic Republic of Iran .  
It urges you to intervene with the Government of the United States of America with a view to halting and preventing any repetition of hostile acts in flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law that are being committed by a State that is a permanent member of the Security Council against another Member State of the United Nations whose sovereignty , security and territorial integrity are thereby threatened and whose civilian population is thereby left in a state of alarm .  
The revised cost estimates submitted in document A / 50 / 696 / Add . 1 of 30 October 1995 amounted to $ 890,230,900 gross ( $ 881,791,500 net ) , compared to the original estimates of $ 1,013,629,900 gross ( $ 1,002,021,100 net ) and took into consideration reduced requirements for military and civilian personnel , rental of premises , transport operations , air operations and the purchase of equipment .  
On the contrary , armed forces fighting the Afghan Government would find such a situation very convenient for further expanding their acts of aggression including the firing of artillery and rockets on the civilian population of the capital and other acts against the humanitarian laws .  NULLAs far as the implementation of the arms embargo against the armed groups fighting the Government is concerned , these groups are not legal subjects of international law .  
The objectives of the review were to determine whether the management structure of the civilian component was appropriate in providing the necessary support service to UNPF , to assess the adequacy of management systems and internal controls and to ascertain whether the use of United Nations resources ( human , physical and financial ) was adequately planned , organized , directed and monitored , and whether value for money was achieved .  
These included changing mandates and constant uncertainties in the Mission , delays in budgetary authorization , delays in issuing budgetary allotments , cumbersome and inflexible procurement procedures , lack of experienced United Nations staff , frequent rotation of military personnel , difficulty in integrating military and civilian components and intractability of some local authorities with respect to their obligations under the various status of forces agreements . 
Cuba considers that the considerable problems with anti-personnel mines experienced by a number of third world countries are due in large part , if we limit ourselves to the most direct causes , to the unscrupulous export policies which have been extensively practised by several developed countries ; these have made substantial profits from such operations and taken little account of the impact on the civilian populations of many countries .  
Growing stocks of surplus fissile material from the military sector and growing amounts of plutonium in civilian fuel cycles make accountancy and control an urgent task of paramount importance .  
It recently took concrete form , as everyone knows , through the freezing of the Israeli withdrawal from Hebron , the refusal to resume negotiations on the final situation in the occupied Palestinian territories , the return to the policy of settlements , the blocking off of the Palestinian territories , the confiscation of Arab lands and the collective economic sanctions and daily acts of violence against the unarmed civilian population .  
In view of the sharp exacerbation of the crisis in Afghanistan , a meeting of the Security Council must be held immediately with the participation of the countries concerned for the purpose of drawing up urgent measures to halt the bloodshed , bring about a political settlement of the conflict and extend assistance to the civilian population and the numerous refugees .  
Despite the interest expressed in these projects , inter alia , by the countries where these peacekeeping missions are carried out , subsequent project proposals related to training needs of the civilian police of the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia , Baranja and Western Sirmium ( UNTAES ) , the International Police Task Force ( IPTF ) of the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina ( UNMIBH ) and the local police forces , including the establishment of a focal point for strengthening of criminal justice institutions , have so far received little support .  
In my view , the presence and assistance of the international community will continue to be required beyond November 1996 to help the Government of Haiti set up a professional , well - managed and well-equipped civilian police and ensure that a stable environment will be consolidated , that democracy will take root and that economic and social development will translate into a visible improvement of the living conditions of the people . 
I should also like to reiterate my firm conviction that the continued presence of United Nations civilian police monitors is contingent upon the existence of a secure environment maintained by a credible international military force ( see S / 1995 / 1031 , para .  29 ) .  
The Advisory Committee was informed that voluntary contributions had been received in the amount of $ 12.3-million from the Governments of Canada ( $ 1.7-million ) and the United States of America ( $ 10.6-million ) to provide for all direct and indirect costs of 670 troops , including the standard troop cost reimbursement and allowances , contingent-owned equipment reimbursement , death and disability compensation , rations , fuel , miscellaneous supplies , logistics support services and civilian staff required for administrative purposes , for the period from 1 July to 30 November 1996 .  
The revised cost estimates for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 amounted to $ 31,902,000 gross and reflected a 39 per cent decrease in gross terms in comparison with the original cost estimates , taking into account that it provided for the reduced strength of 230 military observers and 9 civilian police observers , supported by a civilian establishment of 167 personnel ( 102 international and 65 local ) and 2 observers from the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) .  
Further , a multitude of executive orders criminalizing far too many aspects of normal civilian conduct , prescribing grossly disproportionate penalties and authorizing arrest and detention without judicial review , leads the Special Rapporteur to conclude that a significant percentage of all arrests and detentions are arbitrary when measured by international standards .  
While judicial guarantees set out in the now defunct Constitution , according to the Government , do not apply , through correspondence received by the Centre for Human Rights , the former Special Rapporteur had been informed by the Government of Myanmar that those elaborated in the Code of Criminal Procedure applied in all cases heard in civilian courts even when the detention was carried out under a SLORC order or an emergency regulation .  
At the same time , the absence of an independent judiciary , coupled with a host of executive orders criminalizing far too many aspects of normal civilian conduct , prescribing enormously disproportionate penalties and authorizing arrest and detention without judicial review or any other form of judicial authorization , leads the Special Rapporteur to conclude that a significant percentage of all arrests and detentions in Myanmar are arbitrary when measured by generally accepted international standards .  
We propose that a special meeting of the Security Council of the United Nations should be held without delay , with the participation of interested countries , with a view to adopting urgent measures to halt the fighting and achieve a comprehensive political settlement of the Afghan conflict , and to arrange for the provision by the international community of humanitarian assistance to the civilian population and refugees .  
Since then , agreements have been concluded on human rights ; the resettlement of persons displaced by the armed conflict ; the establishment of the historical clarification commission ; the identity and rights of indigenous peoples ; social and economic aspects and the agrarian situation ; and now , the strengthening of civilian power and the role of the armed forces in a democratic society .  
It is vitally important to strengthen civilian power as the expression of the will of the people through the exercise of political rights , reinforce the legislative branch , reform the administration of justice and guarantee public security , all of which are crucial for the enjoyment of civil liberties and rights ; and , within a democratic institutional framework , it is incumbent upon the Guatemalan armed forces to discharge the essential task of protecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity ,  
In that connection , based on the updated deployment table contained in annex V , the inclusion of 8 additional international staff and 25 local staff for six months , the application of the Zagreb salary scales for local staff as at 1 July 1996 and the inclusion under common staff costs of provision for contributions to the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund for local staff , the net reduction to civilian staff costs is only $ 642,000 .  
The " policies " and " practices " affecting human rights that came within the scope of investigation by the Special Committee referred , in the case of " policies " , to any course of action consciously adopted and pursued by the Government of Israel as part of its declared or undeclared intent ; while " practices " referred to those actions which , irrespective of whether or not they were in implementation of a policy , reflected a pattern of behaviour on the part of the Israeli authorities towards the civilian population in the occupied areas .  
The Inspectors note that the questions raised and recommendations made in the report are similar in nature to those contained in the JIU report entitled " Staffing of the United Nations peace-keeping and related missions ( civilian component ) " ( JIU / REP / 93 / 6 , annex ) which , although not referenced in the report , was welcomed by the Secretary-General as a valuable and timely contribution to both the planning and management aspects of field operations and approved by the General Assembly .  
Those constraints included the numerous changes in its mandate , as well as other uncertainties in its operating environment , delays in budgetary authorization , cumbersome and inflexible procurement practices and procedures , a lack of experienced United Nations staff , the frequent rotation of personnel , the difficulty of integrating military and civilian components , and the intractability of some local authorities with respect to their obligations under the various status-of-forces agreements .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
This biased attitude of the republic of Croatia is evident also in the report of Ms . Elizabeth Rehn of 14 March 1996 , which contains ( on pp . 62-86 ) numerous examples of human rights violations , killings , and mistreatment of the civilian population , destruction of private property , prevention of the return of refugees and so on effected by wilful extremists whose behaviour escapes control .  
For that period the General Assembly had appropriated a total amount of $ 11,948,718 gross and the actual expenditure had been $ 9,978,000 gross : the unencumbered balance of $ 1,970,718 gross had resulted from a number of factors , in particular the release of fixed-wing aircraft earlier than had been anticipated , and savings on civilian personnel costs owing mainly to the fact that the vacancy rate had been higher than expected . 
The Committee advised applicant States wishing to undertake energy-related exports to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for humanitarian purposes , that it was not in a position to approve the supply of energy-related products to the country for general distribution ; however , without prejudice to its final decision , the Committee expressed readiness to consider requests for authorization of shipments of strictly limited quantities of fuel targeting specific end-users among the most vulnerable groups of civilian population and for purely humanitarian purposes .  
The multidimensional , intra-State nature of conflicts required that United Nations peacekeeping operations should be equipped with the skills to tackle a variety of military , political , humanitarian and civilian problems .  
Concrete measures which had been identified included improved police training methods , a protection programme for witnesses of human rights violations , assistance to victims of violent crimes , transfer to civilian courts of competence to try military police crimes , and federal investigation of human rights violations .  
Although the establishment of a rapidly deployable mission headquarters was a constructive step , it would not be a panacea for the range of problems experienced in previous United Nations peacekeeping missions ; it would provide operational and planning improvements , however , and would enable the United Nations to deploy more quickly to the field a well-prepared and jointly trained team of military and civilian personnel in the most critical phase of peacekeeping operations .  
The civilian component of the mission , acting under the broadened political mandate thus granted to my Special Representative , has assisted in bringing together various segments of the population in an effort to promote mutual understanding between communities , monitor human rights and ease political and inter-ethnic tensions within the country .  
Please provide information on all the measures adopted pursuant to article 38 , paragraph 4 , and in accordance with the State 's obligations under international humanitarian law to protect the civilian population in armed conflicts , including measures of a legislative , administrative , budgetary and other nature , to ensure the protection and care of children who are affected by an armed conflict .  
Concerned about continuing deliberate and indiscriminate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers involved in Operation Lifeline Sudan and international private voluntary agencies ,  
In order to meet the increasing demand for the participation of civilian police in United Nations peacekeeping operations , as well as their enhanced role in fostering the political reconciliation process and the promotion of peace between warring factions , the Secretary-General will address this issue in the context of future budgetary proposals , as appropriate .  
The suffering of the Afghan civilian population , who continue to bear the main brunt of the civil war , and the dangers that that war creates for regional stability , oblige the international community to intensify its search for a peaceful solution , despite the fact that certain Afghan parties seem to continue to favour the military option .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
The cost estimates contained in annex III to document A / 50 / 696 / Add . 4 covered the pre-liquidation period from 1 January to 30 June 1996 and provided for the repatriation travel of 309 military observers and 7,463 contingent personnel , as well as for the maintenance of an average monthly strength of 1,237 contingent personnel , 293 international civilian staff , 458 local staff , 725 international contractual personnel and 23 United Nations Volunteers .  
UNMIBH was established pursuant to annex 11 of the Peace Agreement to assist the parties in their obligations of providing a safe and secure environment for all persons in their respective jurisdictions , by maintaining civilian law enforcement agencies operating in accordance with internationally recognized standards and with respect for internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Concerned about continuing deliberate and indiscriminate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers involved in Operation Lifeline Sudan and international private voluntary agencies ,  
Calls upon the Government of Myanmar and other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully the obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , [ 117 ] to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population and to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law , and to avail itself of such services as may be offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
Security Council resolution 1080 ( 1996 ) established a two-part mandate for the multinational force : facilitating the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the effective delivery by civilian relief organizations of humanitarian aid to alleviate the immediate suffering of displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire ; and facilitating the voluntary , orderly repatriation of refugees by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as well as the voluntary return of displaced persons .  
Secondly , the reasons for raising the minimum age to 18 years are not only associated with recruitment methods but with the physical , psychosocial and emotional impact on the young person , the teaching of military skills and attitudes and the deprivation of opportunities to develop educational and social skills more appropriate for civilian life .  
A number of major causes of the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina have yet to be removed and it is only the continuing sound international presence , both military and civilian , that can prevent the resumption of hostilities even on a minor scale .  
While peacekeeping , civilian , humanitarian , economic , social , and political activities are all part of the integrated process of peace-building , special attention should be given to the observance of the norms and principles of international law , including international humanitarian law .  
The ICRC is particularly concerned with emergency situations arising from armed conflict and internal violence , which are often marked by widespread and urgent needs among the civilian population and by the breakdown of political , economic and civic institutions .  
I should like to conclude my remarks by expressing the Government of Japan \ x { e5b8 } deep appreciation to all the countries and international institutions that are engaged in the noble and difficult tasks , both civilian and military , that are required for the implementation of the Peace Agreement .  
This is the response of the international community aimed at achieving a complete ban on these treacherous and barbarous weapons , which are contrary to international humanitarian law , so that future generations will be free from the suffering of today \ x { e5b8 } civilian victims , in particular children .  
The treaty represents a solid international humanitarian commitment to alleviate the cruel and indiscriminate suffering caused by mines which have been placed throughout the world , affecting innocent civilian populations , and also to provide assistance to facilitate their rehabilitation and their social reintegration .  
In such conflicts , particularly in the case of a civil war , it is often difficult to determine which party is guilty of violating the peace , and the sanctions themselves may be indiscriminate , non-specific and , consequently ineffective and may only increase the already excessive burdens and sufferings borne by the innocent civilian population .  
It follows that any sanctions should be part of the search for a long-term political settlement of the conflict , reflect the strategic goals of the entire international community , take account of the political and " physical " ( in terms of death and suffering among the civilian population and the destruction of material values ) cost of such actions .  
We further call upon the international community and all its relevant institutions to meet their responsibility to halt these violations forthwith , to ensure the necessary protection for all missing persons , detainees and prisoners and to put an end to practices involving violence and threat of violence that have the basic purpose of spreading terror among the innocent civilian inhabitants of the area and uprooting them .  
Concerned about continuing deliberate and indiscriminate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers involved in Operation Lifeline Sudan and with international private voluntary agencies ,  
Calls upon the Government of Myanmar and other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully the obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , [ 8 ] to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law and to avail itself of such services as may be offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
The resettlement and integration verification area would consist of the Chief ( P-5 ) , one-P-4 to liaise with the international and national institutions responsible for the resettlement of displaced persons , one P-3 ( local ) to deal with the legal aspects of repatriation and documentation of ex-combatants , one military liaison officer , and one civilian police observer , supported by three Local level staff .  
This concern has found expression at the meetings , seminars and study groups held in various parts of the world that have considered the grievous suffering caused by the sanctions and by the embargo and that have addressed urgent appeals to the United Nations and the international community as a whole for action to lift the sanctions imposed on the Iraqi people and to enable that people , through the use of its own resources and capacities , to secure the provision of its basic civilian needs . 
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , their expulsion from their land , the bombardment of peaceful villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;  
Greatly concerned , the Islamic State of Afghanistan wishes to request you to take appropriate preventive measures in order to halt the planned massive military assault which would inevitably entail the loss of many lives of the innocent civilian population .  
Calls upon the Government of Guatemala , URNG and Guatemalan society as a whole to make every possible effort to familiarize the Guatemalan people with the content of the Peace agreements as quickly as possible , to ensure the full participation of the people in building the new multi _ ethnic , multicultural and plurilingual nation , establishing a democratic society with social justice , initiating a period of sustained and sustainable economic and social development and ensuring the pre _ eminence of civilian authority in national decision _ making ;  
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , their expulsion from their land , the bombardment of peaceful villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;  
Calls upon all parties to the hostilities to respect fully the applicable provisions of international humanitarian law including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , to halt the use of weapons , including landmines , against the civilian population and to protect all civilians , especially women , members of minorities and children , from violations of human rights and humanitarian law , including forcible displacement , arbitrary detention , ill _ treatment , torture and summary executions ;  
Regarding crimes against humanity , article 3 of the statute of the International Tribunal for Rwanda stresses the prosecution of persons responsible for crimes " when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population on national , political , ethnic , racial or religious grounds " , that is , it does not associate those crimes primarily with armed conflicts .  
In an earlier report ( S / 25274 , para . 56 ) , the Commission stated that : " ' Ethnic cleansing ' has been carried out by means of murder , arbitrary arrest and detention , extra-judicial executions , rape and sexual assault , confinement of civilian population in ghetto areas , forcible removal , displacement and deportation of civilian population , deliberate military attacks or threats of attacks on civilians and civilian areas , and wanton destruction of property . "  
The ethnic factor , in conjunction with other political , economic , historical and cultural factors , is eating away at the fragile political ties in Africa , with the harrowing consequences of confrontation _ whose main victims are civilian populations _ and a resurgence of the crime of genocide .  
It is against this background of societies repeatedly traumatized by economic , social , cultural and other factors that such extreme situations develop , in which the breakdown of the institutional order opens the floodgates to widespread violence and massacres of the civilian population , frequently leading in the end to actual genocide .  
The Civil Affairs Unit has focused on the wide range of issues related to civilian reintegration , including the technical and substantive matters addressed in the 24 joint implementation committees and subcommittees which brought together Serb and Croat experts to resolve mutual problems .  
We urge the Government of Angola , and in particular UNITA , to make haste and complete the remaining political and military aspects of the peace process , including the normalization of State administration throughout the national territory in accordance with the agreed timetable and procedures ; the transformation of the UNITA radio station into a non-partisan broadcasting facility ; the registration and demobilization of all remaining military elements ; the elimination of all obstacles to the free circulation of people and goods ; and the disarmament of the civilian population .  
The permanent reintegration of ex-combatants into civilian life extends well beyond successful disarmament and is determined by whether or not there exist concrete , long-term options for obtaining a sustainable livelihood and participating in the social and political life of the country .  
Many of the overall civilian implementation tasks coordinated by my Office , such as the building of common institutions , supporting economic reconstruction , creating communications and transport links between the entities , and providing a basis for a functioning civil society are fundamental to creating the necessary conditions for the return of displaced persons and refugees .  
Their experience provided valuable input for the design of future peacekeeping missions , pointing to the need to accord a greater role to the civilian component and to ensure increased cooperation with local and national civic movements .  
I should like in the present letter to alert you to the fact that between 1 January and 30 June 1997 United States and other warplanes continued to violate the airspace of the Republic of Iraq from military bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and to engage in such hostile , provocative and inflammatory actions as the dropping of heat flares in civilian areas and on civilian installations in Iraq .  
With its leaner and more focused mandate , the Mission will undergo a corresponding reduction of its personnel and will thus complete its transformation from the large peacekeeping operation established in 1995 , with a strength of approximately 6,000 military and 700 civilian police personnel , to a contingent of 250 civilian police and a headquarters unit of 50 military personnel having full command and control over a voluntarily funded security element .  
Less than two weeks ago , through a presidential statement , the Security Council said that civilian police in peacekeeping operations carry our indispensable functions in monitoring and training national police forces , as well as in restoring civil order , supporting the rule of law and fostering reconciliation at the national level .  
With regard to Haiti , the establishment and training of a professional civilian police force will be a fundamental factor in maintaining peace and security and in ensuring the real and effective functioning of democratic institutions , the rule of law and full respect for human rights .  
Likewise , the categorized list contains certain items the export of which to Iraq must be notified to the joint unit established by Security Council resolution 1051 ( 1996 ) as these items will be subject to monitoring because of their possible dual use for civilian or for prohibited purposes under Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) and other relevant resolutions .  
At his initial appearance on 31 May 1996 before Trial Chamber I , composed of Judge Jorda ( presiding ) , Judge Odio-Benito and Judge Riad , Dra _ en Erdemovi _ pleaded guilty to one count of a crime against humanity for his participation in the summary execution of approximately 1,200 unarmed civilian Muslim men at a farm near Pilica , located in the Zvornik municipality of eastern Bosnia , following the fall of Srebrenica to Bosnian Serb forces in July 1995 .  
Provision of $ 1,519,800 is made for the salaries of international civilian personnel based on the phased reduction of personnel as detailed in the table contained in paragraph 22 of the main report and annex IV and includes the provision of eight person / months for the completion of residual administrative tasks in New York by the Chief Finance Officer ( P-4 ) and one Field Service staff member beyond 31 December 1997 .  
The replaced Taliban forces north of Kabul , however , are being brought daily to Kunduz civilian airport for further acts of genocide in northern Afghanistan , of which the ethnically oriented carnage and the burial in a mass grave on 14 September 1997 of more than 100 civilians in the village of Qizil-Abad , in northern Balkh province , as reported by the Reuters correspondent Alistair Lyon , is a testimony . 
While peacekeeping , civilian , humanitarian , economic , social and political activities are all part of the integrated process of peace-building , special attention should be given to the observance of the norms and principles of international law , including international humanitarian law .  
At the same time , the absence of an independent judiciary , coupled with a host of executive orders criminalizing far too many aspects of normal civilian conduct that prescribe enormously disproportionate penalties and authorize arrest and detention without judicial review or any other form of judicial authorization , leads the Special Rapporteur to conclude that a significant percentage of all arrests and detentions in Myanmar are arbitrary when measured against generally accepted international standards .  
The project covers five main areas of activity : human rights education and training for the judiciary , the military , the gendarmerie , the police , prison administration personnel , other civil servants and members of local human rights non-governmental organizations ; capacity-building in the sector of civilian and military justice ; capacity support for human rights non-governmental organizations ; the popularization of human rights through formal and informal education and promotion activities ; and support for genocide victims and vulnerable groups .  
On the other hand , it was generally assumed by the Panel members that the measures for prevention should be applied primarily to the small arms and light weapons manufactured to military specifications , because in this case the question has to be addressed on a global basis and because the issue of civilian firearms regulation is currently being taken up by the United Nations Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice .  
The visits to Kibungo Prison and the communal cachots and the discussions with the civilian , military , prison and judicial officials who met with the Special Representative provided valuable insight into the prevailing conditions of detention and the urgency of conducting fair and effective criminal trials for those accused of genocide and related acts .  
As documented in the present report and in previous reports , these restrictions relate primarily to access by Operation Lifeline Sudan to needy populations , whether in the form of relief flights from the base at Lokichokio into southern Sudan , humanitarian action in favour of the over 2-million internally displaced persons living in and around greater Khartoum , or permission to assess the conditions of civilian populations in the Nuba Mountains or in new areas of need created as a result of a resurgence of hostilities .  
A matter of particular concern was that the unregulated use of sanctions had resulted in unnecessary suffering for innocent civilian populations ; sanctions should be imposed only as a last resort , and the proposals for ameliorating the plight of third States must be carefully studied .  
Crimes against humanity require that certain capital crimes ( such as murder , extermination , imprisonment , torture , rape or persecution on political , racial and religious grounds ) are committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack against any civilian population on national , political , ethnical , racial or religious grounds .  
Calls upon the Government of Myanmar and other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully the obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , [ 8 ] to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law and to avail itself of such services as may be offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
New policy perspectives coordinating the commercial , consumer and strategic requirements on a national and international level needed to be established , and the dialogue between military , industry and civilian users needed to be extended .  
The unencumbered balance resulted mainly from savings attributable to lower deployment of civilian and military personnel , availability of rent-free premises and accommodation , lower requirements for transport and communication spare parts than earlier estimated owing to the implementation of the wet lease and self-sustainment arrangements under the new reimbursement procedures for contingent-owned equipment and the continued availability of supplies from existing UNPF stock .  
Calls upon all Governments and parties in complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in countries where humanitarian personnel are operating , in conformity with the relevant provisions of international law and national laws , to cooperate fully with the United Nations and other humanitarian agencies and organizations and to ensure the safe and unhindered access of humanitarian personnel in order to allow them to perform efficiently their task of assisting the affected civilian population , including refugees and internally displaced persons ;  
Norway firmly believes that the stabilizing presence of a NATO-led military follow-on force , authorized by a Security Council mandate , will also be required after June 1998 , when the current SFOR mandate expires , in order to consolidate our gains and provide vital support to the civilian agencies involved .  
In such conflicts , particularly in the case of a civil war , it is often difficult to determine which party is guilty of violating the peace , and the sanctions themselves may be indiscriminate , non-specific and , consequently ineffective and may only increase the already excessive burdens and sufferings borne by the innocent civilian population .  
It follows that any sanctions should be part of the search for a long-term political settlement of the conflict , reflect the strategic goals of the entire international community , take account of the political and ' physical ' ( in terms of death and suffering among the civilian population and the destruction of material values ) cost of such actions .  
Special emphasis is being put on and we have started work towards the reorganization of the army , with the objective of gradually having a smaller , more efficient and professional force under strict civilian control , in conformity with all standards of modern armies , capable of performing its functions properly and of being a genuine partner in partnership activities .  
The efforts at domestic stabilization through reorganization of the State and the reconciliation of opinions and the return to work of the civilian population are accompanied by other efforts aimed at achieving peace and regional stability in order to create economic and political conditions conducive to productive national and foreign investment .  
At the internal level , the relation between the Government and its citizens is based , as I said before , on constitutional legitimacy ; on equality among all citizens , whether male or female ; on equality in rights and obligations of men and women alike ; on the freedom of individuals and groups ; on the freedom of association to parties , trade unions and civilian community organizations ; on freedom of the press ; and on the protection of human rights .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
I should like in the present letter to alert you to the fact that between 1 July and 31 December 1996 United States and other warplanes continued to violate the airspace of the Republic of Iraq from military bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and to engage in such hostile , provocative and inflammatory actions as the dropping of heat flares in civilian areas and on civilian installations in Iraq .  
As you may be aware , the agreements on Hebron do not only refer to the redeployment of Israeli military forces in the city , but also to agreed security arrangements , joint security measures , the deployment of the Palestinian police and various civilian matters relating to the normal and effective functioning of the city , and the Israeli and Palestinian populations therein .  
Egypt is aware of the magnitude and severity of the problems related to the proliferation of anti _ personnel landmines , which is above all a humanitarian issue given the suffering they inflict on civilian populations , the heavy financial burden and the limited nature of the technology used in the detection and deactivation of these mines . 
The three country studies are being complemented by comparative analyses of selected United Nations missions , interviews with key personnel in civilian and military peacekeeping as well as national policy makers ; analyses of United Nations documentation and reports with a view to improving coordination between Headquarters and field commanders ; and review of press reports to gauge public reaction to the way in which peacekeeping operations are conducted .  
Pursuant to my letter to you dated 19 January 1997 concerning the forcible transfer and deportation of the civilian population of the districts north of Kabul ( S / 1997 / 54 , annex ) , I inform you with deep sorrow that the inhuman practice of mass deportation of ethnic Tajik residing in the districts north of Kabul is being continued by the Taliban mercenaries .  
In order to cut the main links between the insurgent groups and the civilian population , SLORC has forced entire communities living in the border area between Myanmar and Thailand to move to relocation sites which are subject to tight military control .  
Numerous testimonies received by the Special Rapporteur indicate that the civilian population living in or near the combat zone is the most susceptible to being forced to move : in these grey zones ( zones controlled or influenced by the insurgents ) the armed forces often resort to ground searches , destruction and burning of houses , and confiscation of property and food , which lead the people to move temporarily or permanently .  
The Special Rapporteur also observes that article 17 of Protocol II Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 requires that , in the case of displacements carried out for the safety of civilians or for imperative military reasons , the responsible party must take all possible measures . . . in order that the civilian population may be received under satisfactory conditions of shelter , hygiene , health , safety and nutrition .  Article 14 of the same instrument also stipulates a prohibition of starvation of civilians under the control of organized armed forces .  
The reported unencumbered balance resulted from savings attributable primarily to ( a ) lower transportation costs than estimated in the budget in respect of repatriation of troops and military observers , civilian police and international staff ; ( b ) fewer rented vehicles and lower requirements for spare parts and maintenance of the vehicle fleet ; ( c ) lower hire / charter costs and aviation fuel charges ; and ( d ) lower actual charges for the shipment of ONUMOZ - and contingent-owned equipment .  
The net additional requirements of $ 536,400 for commercial communications were attributable to the satellite user charges from the previous mandate period ( $ 356,200 ) , recorded in the reporting period because of the late submission of invoices and the extensive use of satellite facilities by the military , civilian police and electoral observer components of the mission in November and December 1994 ( $ 626,000 ) . ( b ) Main trunking contract .  
The second phase of Operation Joint Guard , the stabilization phase , has now begun , and over the coming months SFOR will continue its efforts to keep the peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina by accomplishing its principal military tasks and by providing selective support to the international civil organizations in theatre , thereby contributing to a progressive implementation of broad civilian programmes .  
The Assistance Mission 's mandate has been revised and extended by the Council in subsequent resolutions , most recently in resolution 1029 ( 1995 ) of 12 December 1995 , which extended the Mission for a final period until 8 March 1996 .  In the same resolution , the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to reduce the military personnel level to 1,400 , to withdraw the civilian police component and to initiate planning for the complete withdrawal of UNAMIR within a period of six weeks after the expiry of its mandate .  
Calls upon the Government of Guatemala , URNG and Guatemalan society as a whole to make every possible effort to familiarize the Guatemalan people with the content of the Peace agreements as quickly as possible , to ensure the full participation of the people in building the new multi _ ethnic , multicultural and multilingual nation , establishing a democratic society with social justice , initiating a period of sustained and sustainable economic and social development and ensuring the pre _ eminence of civilian authority in national decision _ making ;  
Calls upon all parties to the hostilities to respect fully the applicable provisions of international humanitarian law including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , to halt the use of weapons , including landmines , against the civilian population and to protect all civilians , especially women , members of minorities and children , from violations of human rights and humanitarian law , including forcible displacement , arbitrary detention , ill _ treatment , torture and summary executions ;  
In paragraph 17 of his statement , the Secretary-General proposes to head the five verification areas ( human rights ; indigenous affairs ; social , economic and agrarian aspects ; strengthening of civilian power ; and resettlement and integration ) at the D-1 level instead of the current P-5 level .  
Turning to the operative part of the draft resolution , he said that , while paragraph 1 welcomed his Governments declared commitment to civilian rule , there was no mention of the positive steps which it had taken to fulfil that commitment , which included the establishment of a national electoral commission , the registration of voters and political parties and the delimitation of constituencies .  
The unencumbered balance resulted mainly from delays in the deployment of civilian personnel , reduced rental requirements related to the deployment of the International Police Task Force ( IPTF ) , the cost of the use of government-provided helicopters based on actual use rather than commercially provided helicopters and the availability of some equipment and supplies from surplus stock .  
This document addressed a wide range of problems , including a worrying increase in crime throughout Bermuda ; low deployment of officers on patrol ; an excessively high ratio of officers of the rank of superintendent or above ; an extremely low proportion of civilian staff ; and police stations and accommodation that were cramped , badly designed or not of an acceptable standard .  
Such violations shall include , but not be limited to , murder , ill _ treatment or deportation to slave labour or for any other purpose of civilian population of or in occupied territory , murder or ill _ treatment of prisoners of war or persons on the seas , killing of hostages , plunder of public or private property , wanton destruction of cities , towns or villages , or devastation not justified by military necessity ;  
While the operation is financed from income accruing as a result of a limited exception to the sanctions regime , the resolution prescribes numerous safeguards to be implemented in order to ensure that the humanitarian assistance is not used for purposes other than those specifically authorized and that it benefits , in equal measure , the needy civilian population as a whole .  
While peacekeeping , civilian , humanitarian , economic , social , and political activities are all part of the integrated process of peace-building , special attention should be given to the observance of the norms and principles of international law , including international humanitarian law .  
The Front ( UINFSA ) calls upon the Taliban to take into serious account the sufferings and miseries of the innocent civilian population in Afghanistan resulting from the protracted imposed war and to declare their readiness through joining a genuine intra-Afghan dialogue aimed at achieving a negotiated settlement , rather than pursuing the dangerous option of continuing war in Afghanistan .  
Croatia 's position is that , with the successful holding of elections , UNTAES has completed the executive part of its mandate : authority over the region should therefore be transferred to Croatia , the UNTAES military component should be withdrawn and the remaining United Nations civilian presence restricted to a monitoring and observation mission pending its replacement by a long-term OSCE observation mission .  
However , illegal weapons do not have that protection , and their war-time use easily meets the rest of the definition of torture : their use causes severe pain and suffering , both physical and mental ; their use is intentional ; they are used to unduly coerce the enemy or the civilian population into surrender , submission or other state favourable to the user of the weapons ; and their use is under the direct order of public officials .  
Deeply concerned by the numerous reports from a large number of reliable sources attesting that , regardless of human dignity , armed groups of religious extremists , who act in flagrant violation of the principles of tolerance of Islam , are terrorising civilian populations in order to force them to support their cause , by resorting , inter alia , to summary executions , the cruelty of which adds futile suffering to the fate of innocent victims of decapitation or throat cutting , including old people , women and children ,  
The agreements reached by Committee members to set up a subregional early warning mechanism , to control the illicit trade in arms and drugs , to retrain demobilized troops for civilian life and to enhance the capacity of Central African States to participate more effectively in future peace missions in the area would , if implemented , contribute significantly to continuing efforts to end the scourge of violence , destruction and suffering in the subregion . 
Given the vast territory of Angola and the deployment of MONUA at Luanda , six regional headquarters and 18 provincial offices , these aircraft are essential in providing support for the transport of military and civilian personnel , the transport of medium and heavy cargo from the Viana logistics base throughout the mission area and for medical and casualty evacuation purposes .  
The major issues addressed included providing an enabling environment for conversion at both national and local levels ; the role of public and private sectors ; conversion of military bases and defence industries to export processing zones ; tourism development in former military bases and defence complexes ; civilian manufacturing , prospects for small and medium-sized enterprise development ; and continuity of social infrastructure services .  
It has done so despite the exceptional circumstances , well known to the international community , that Iraq is experiencing because of the maintenance of the comprehensive embargo imposed on it in August 1990 and because of the brutal military aggression of January 1991 that created highly abnormal conditions in all spheres of civilian life and for all groups of the population .  
Those suffering the most are the civilian population of the occupied territories , whose standard of living has been eroded steadily as a result of the very serious economic and social situation .  
It is my firm belief that for the time being there could be no civil implementation without the strong international military force available immediately to ensure the secure environment , which is also mandatory for the work of the civilian organizations .  
The statute also specifies that for rape to be considered a crime against humanity , it must be a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population on national , political , ethnic , racial or religious grounds .  
An increasing role in peacekeeping operations was being played by civilian police , who assisted local police forces in restoring public order , upholding the rule of law and promoting civil reconciliation .  
During the 1980s , the region experienced its longest period of elected Governments and constitutional processes , reduced military spending , and the acceptance by the armed forces of civilian governmental authority .  
The report should have contained a functional analysis of the backstopping requirements of peacekeeping operations as they relate to the implementation of their mandates ( military , civilian police , human rights monitoring , humanitarian , electoral assistance ) .  
There is an increasing trend of more joint satellite missions , both on a national basis ( e.g . by merging military and civilian systems ) and through international cooperation .  
We are also grateful to the entire international community for rendering invaluable assistance to Tajikistan at the critical stage of the formation of its statehood and of the foundations for the normal functioning of civilian society .  
The Department had given special attention to the emerging role of civilian police in peacekeeping operations , which represented a new dimension of the efforts to respond effectively to the complex problems posed by civil conflict .  
Once an FMCT has been adopted , there would be a reasonable chance that the main nuclear _ weapon States would commit themselves voluntarily to placing irreversible fissile material transferred from military uses to civilian ones under full IAEA safeguards .  
In pleading guilty , the former Prime Minister not only acknowledged and confirmed that genocide did indeed occur in Rwanda in 1994 but also indicated that it was organized and planned at the highest levels , both civilian and military .  
Social development is impossible when basic essential social services are denied to the civilian population and where vulnerable members of the community are indiscriminately exposed to bombing , summary execution , rape and the threat of landmines .  
In light of the repatriation of the military engineering support unit during the 1998 / 99 financial period , it is proposed that the Missions civilian staffing establishment be reduced by 5 international and 10 local posts authorized in connection with the deployment of the unit ( see A / 52 / 730 / Add . 2 , paras . 23 and 24 ) .  
Urges States to uphold the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and settlements , inter alia , through effective measures to prevent the infiltration of armed elements , to identify and separate any such armed elements from refugee populations , to settle refugees in secure locations and to afford to the Office of the High Commissioner and other appropriate humanitarian organizations prompt , unhindered and safe access to asylum-seekers , refugees and other persons of concern ;  
At the normative level , it is important to emphasize that , despite the specific nature of today 's armed conflicts , the international community seems to have at its disposal a sufficient arsenal of legal instruments to protect civilian populations .  
There is a common thread running through the preceding statements that makes unequivocally clear one of the characteristics of the recent armed conflicts that have led to political or military action by this Organization : the fact that their first and principal target has been the civilian population , in particular its most vulnerable sectors children , women , the elderly , the sick , refugees and internally displaced persons .  
Canada has always distinguished itself by an honourable , consistent and outstanding involvement in United Nations efforts to achieve international peace and security , in particular by its humanitarian devotion to alleviating the suffering of civilian populations in armed conflicts .  
The success of these programmes would not have been possible without the respect for international humanitarian law and the direct and indirect cooperation of the parties to the conflict , which in practice shared common areas of mutual respect , to the benefit of the civilian population and the national and international non-governmental humanitarian assistance organizations , particularly the International Committee of the Red Cross .  
The second level is a complex one that involves a specific mechanism consisting of various interrelated elements , ranging from the body of international humanitarian norms and provisions to the agencies authorized to ensure the rights of the civilian population in situations of armed conflict and to provide humanitarian assistance for them , and so on . 
The Department of Peacekeeping Operations is currently gathering statistics provided by Member States contributing personnel so as to provide data on the participation of women in their military and civilian police establishments , in order to have a better understanding of the potential to increase the participation of women in peacekeeping in the foreseeable future .  
Support to peacekeeping exercises focuses on the multidimensional and multinational aspects of this training and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations routinely provides not just military and civilian police role players and trainers , but also Special Representatives of the Secretary-General , political , legal and public information staff members and humanitarian , human rights and non-governmental organization coordinators .  
Noting with grave concern the content of the report of the Commission of Inquiry of the International Labour Organization , [ 5 ] appointed in March 1997 in accordance with article 26 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organization , regarding the observance by Myanmar of the Forced Labour Convention , 1930 ( No .  29 ) , which indicates a widespread and systematic use of forced labour imposed by the military on the civilian population ,  
We fully agree with the Norwegian State Secretary when she said last week that excess material that is removed from the military production cycle should no longer have the status of military non _ verifiable material , but gradually be made subject to a transparent , non _ military and civilian regime subject to international verification .  
The timely response to the recruitment exercise facilitated the expeditious processing of the recruitment of civilian and active military and civilian police personnel , in accordance with established recruitment and placement procedures , involving appointment and promotion bodies which formulated recommendations for selection of the best qualified candidates with due regard to the need to ensure the widest possible geographical basis and with regard to gender .  
With regard to conduct forbidden by international humanitarian law , there were numerous cases of murders of protected persons , torture , taking of hostages , attacks on the civilian population and forced displacements , which followed a systematic pattern .  
Additional requirements of $ 1,991,900 are recorded under civilian personnel costs , due to various developments such as the unbudgeted increase in local staff salaries , noted in paragraph 27 above ; as well as the delayed termination / separation of individual local contractors employed under special service agreements ( SSA ) , and of local staff hired as general temporary assistance whose contracts expired beyond 30 June 1997 .  
The unencumbered balance of $ 2,556,300 gross ( $ 2,216,500 net ) was attributable to the delayed deployment of civilian personnel , fewer rotation of military observers and a substantial portion of the Missions equipment requirements being obtained through transfers from the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi .  
In view of the substantial withdrawal of MONUA military units and observers , logistical support provided by the Observer Mission to the civilian police component was augmented both in terms of geographical coverage and the increased number of police observers , which reached their authorized strength of 345 by October 1998 .  
With the completion of the phased withdrawal of UNAVEM III formed military units , the authorized strength of MONUA from 1 March 1998 comprised 90 military observers , 955 contingent personnel , 345 civilian police observers , supported by a civilian establishment of 281 international staff , 225 local staff and 71 United Nations Volunteers .  
Given the vast territory of Angola and the deployment of MONUA at Luanda , six regional headquarters and 18 provincial offices , these aircraft provided air support for the transport of military and civilian personnel , medium and heavy cargo from the Viana logistics base throughout the mission area and for medical and casualty evacuation purposes .  
And all other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully their obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law and to avail themselves of services offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
At the impact of the current conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effect on the civilian population , in particular women and children , and at continuing serious violations of human rights , fundamental freedoms and relevant provisions of international humanitarian law perpetrated by all parties to the conflict , in particular :  
It is incomprehensible to request the withdrawal of the legitimate forces of a sovereign State from its own territory instead of calling for an urgent ending of foreign military aggression , killing of civilians and destruction of civilian targets .  
The induction of lightly armed international civilian security officers and additional local watchmen has further augmented the existing internal security arrangements .  
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and west Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , the expulsion from their land , the bombardment of villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;  
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and west Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , the expulsion from their land , the bombardment of villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;  
To cease immediately its continued repressive practices , including the practice of forced deportation and relocation , against the Iraqi Kurds , Assyrians and Turkmen , and against the population of the southern marsh areas , where drainage projects have provoked environmental destruction and a deterioration of the situation of the civilian population , and to ensure the personal integrity and freedoms , including the full freedom of belief , of the Shia and their religious establishment ;  
At the impact of the current conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effect on the civilian population , in particular women and children , and at continuing serious violations of human rights , fundamental freedoms and relevant provisions of international humanitarian law perpetrated by all parties to the conflict , in particular :  
And all other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully their obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law and to avail themselves of services offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
As reflected in the aforementioned resolutions , from the outset , the Security Council gave early recognition to the suffering of the Iraqi civilians under a very rigorous sanctions regime and , concerned with the serious nutritional and health situation of the Iraqi civilian population , laid down the foundation for establishing a humanitarian programme .  
It observes with the deepest concern that guerrilla activities continue to be directed against civilians ( in particular the totally unacceptable practice of hostage _ taking under the threat of death among nationals or foreigners who are neither personally involved in nor responsible for the conflict or its conduct ) and attacks on infrastructure , including the bombing of pipelines , which have caused numerous deaths , great suffering amongst the civilian population and grave destruction .  
Gravely concerned by such recent outrages as the murder of three human rights defenders and mass abduction from an aircraft , for which guerrilla groups were responsible , it calls on the guerrilla groups to respect norms of international humanitarian law , especially to refrain from killings and all attacks on the civilian population , indiscriminate massacres , hostage _ taking and the widespread use of anti _ personnel landmines , and to fulfil their own pledges not to recruit children .  
The budgets provide for the continued deployment of 1,350 military contingent personnel and 24 police officers , supported by an increased civilian staffing establishment of 114 international staff , 111 local staff and 13 United Nations Volunteers , with provisions for the Missions liquidation reflected in the proposed 1999 / 00 budget .  
Moreover , although related costs for international salaries and common staff costs were calculated on the basis of 50 per cent of staff on appointments of limited duration , mission appointees ranged from 75 to 80 per cent of the total , contributing to additional savings under civilian personnel costs . 
Further escalation of military action , barbaric bombings of industrial , social , cultural and civilian targets and the peaceful population are all assuming horrible proportions .  
The unencumbered balance of $ 4,571,900 gross ( $ 4,275,100 net ) resulted from reduced requirements as follows : military personnel costs ( $ 83,000 ) , civilian personnel costs ( $ 4,368,400 ) , operational costs ( $ 2,247,300 ) and staff assessment ( $ 296,800 ) ; these were offset by additional requirements amounting to $ 2,423,600 as follows : other programmes ( $ 19,300 ) and United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi ( $ 2,404,300 ) ( A / 53 / 908 , annex II ) .  
The need for humanitarian responses to address the special reproductive health needs of girls and women , including those arising from pregnancy as a result of rape , sexual mutilation , childbirth at an early age or infection with sexually transmitted diseases was emphasized and gender-sensitized education programmes for armed forces and civilian police were called for .  Specific dangers faced by girls in conjunction with child labour were highlighted .  
The revised budget for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 is therefore based on the maintenance of 1,350 military contingent personnel , 24 civilian police officers supported by the increased ( from 1 March 1999 ) civilian staffing establishment of 114 international staff , 111 local staff and 13 United Nations Volunteers .  
We also finance the operating subsidy of the RMS St . Helena , at present the sole regular means of physical access to the island ( an examination of the economic feasibility of developing an eventual air link is currently under way , alongside our discussions with the United States Government about opening up Wideawake Airfield on Ascension to civilian charter flights ) .  
This political solution should be followed by specific steps towards the establishment of the structures necessary for a civilian administration , economic rebuilding and development , democratic institutions and the rule of law , as well as security and respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms for all , regardless of ethnic background or religious affiliation .  
The joint unit established by resolution 1051 ( 1996 ) will continue to review the categorized list , in the light of additional information that may become available , for the purposes of identifying items that are subject to monitoring because of their possible dual use for civilian and prohibited purposes under Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) of 3 April 1991 and other relevant resolutions .  
Projects aimed at the strengthening of macroeconomic management capacity , legislative systems , the legal framework , the judiciary , civilian police and election management capacity , along with mechanisms for political reconciliation , public administration and civil service reform , inter alia , must be explored , particularly in Kosovo , taking advantage of national human resources , experience and skills .  
In addition to the human costs of the conflict , evidenced notably by numerous civilian casualties , the destruction of major industries by the air bombardment , as well as damage caused to infrastructure and essential services such as water and electricity supply , health services , education , communications , heating , the damage to land and river transportation links and the loss of trade , have caused tremendous economic and social hardship for the civilian populations . 
This includes regular army and naval forces , armed civilian groups , associated paramilitary groups , air forces , national guards , border police , army reserves , military police , intelligence services , federal and Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs local , special , riot and anti-terrorist police , and any other groups or individuals so designated by the international security force ( KFOR ) commander ;  
These included the bringing of armed civilian groups under strict control and the prompt arrest and prosecution of those who incited or threatened to use violence , a ban on rallies by armed groups , the redeployment of Indonesian military forces , the immediate institution of a process of laying down of arms by all armed groups to be completed well in advance of the holding of the ballot and the freedom of association and expression of all political forces and tendencies .  
The forthcoming fiftieth anniversary of the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 which deal with international humanitarian law provides an opportunity for States which have signed and become party to the Conventions to reflect upon the degree of applicability of the provisions governing conduct of hostilities and respect for the civilian population , including vulnerable persons considered as non-combatants .  
They expressed serious concern with regard to grave breaches , breaches and violations by Israel , the occupying Power , of the Fourth Geneva Convention , including arbitrary detention , ill-treatment of and violence against the civilian population , torture , summary execution , confiscation and destruction of property , forcible transfers and deportations , and the various forms of collective punishment , as well as the destruction of economic and social structures of the Occupied Territory .  
The Council condemned and deplored the repeated Israeli aerial assaults that had sought to destroy civilian installations and the infrastructure of the Lebanese Republic , had left a number of innocent civilians dead and wounded and had undermined security and stability in the region .  
They include the need for effective demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants into productive civilian life ; post-conflict reconstruction and reconciliation in stable and secure environments ; reform and capacity-building of police , judicial and penal systems ; and promotion of respect for international humanitarian law , including with regard to the use and transfer of small arms .  
At the functional level , UNMIK has established joint civilian commissions ( JCCs ) to facilitate the process of a mediated and controlled transition to integrated public institutions and to address such contentious issues as administration and staffing of various public facilities . 
Following on the report of the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa ( S / 1998 / 318 ) , the Council addressed this question last year in its resolution 1208 ( 1998 ) which , in unequivocal terms , called on all concerned to respect the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and condemned the use of such camps by combatants for the furtherance of military aims .  
In this connection , there is an obvious need for international legal regulation of the worldwide development of civilian and military information technology , and for the formulation of a coordinated international policy on information safety that meets the needs of international security .  
They expressed serious concern with regard to grave breaches , breaches and violations by Israel , the occupying Power , of the Fourth Geneva Convention , including arbitrary detention , ill-treatment of and violence against the civilian population , torture , summary execution , confiscation , and destruction of property , forcible transfers and deportations , and the various forms of collective punishment , as well as the destruction of economic and social structures of the Occupied Territory .  
This provides for the gradual phasing in of an additional 140 military observers , the establishment of a second-line medical capability with 35 medical personnel and the expansion of the Observer Mission by 59 international civilian and 21 local staff as well as for the required logistical support .  
Such personnel , installations , material , units or vehicles were entitled to that protection given to civilians or civilian objects under the international law of armed conflict and the accused was aware of the factual circumstances that established that protection .  
There can be no doubt that the atrocities committed against the civilian population of Sierra Leone , including widespread systematic killings , rapes and amputations , constitute massive violations of international human rights and humanitarian law .  
In addition , the office would manage any new United Nations civilian mission , facilitate continuing dialogue among key actors in Haiti and the international community , support the democratization process , help to mobilize international political and financial support for Haiti and provide the political framework and focal point for integrating and coordinating the activities of the international community .  
In this regard , it is also my profound hope that the alarming levels of social and criminal violence will continue to be addressed by Governments through strengthened civilian police , more efficient judicial systems , independent ombudsmen and permanent respect for human rights and the rule of law .  
In light of the foregoing , KFOR , in close consultation with my Special Representative , is developing a concept for demobilization of the KLA , offering individual members an opportunity to participate in a disciplined , professional , multi-ethnic civilian emergency corps .  
Underlining the importance of the widest possible dissemination of international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law and of relevant training for , inter alia , civilian police , armed forces , members of the judicial and legal professions , civil society and personnel of international and regional organizations ,  
We also join the call to move away from double standards in the field of human rights , and we believe that the same attention should be devoted to those situations , wherever they may arise , that involve a loss of civilian life in armed conflict or which are a source of untold suffering , without allowing the political considerations of Council members , and especially of the permanent ones , to prevail over the collective considerations of the Council and of the United Nations as a whole .  
Most important and this is to be welcomed it has recognized in its resolutions adopted in recent years that repression of the civilian population , ethnic cleansing , genocide , large-scale forced displacement and relocation of civilians and other flagrant violations of international humanitarian law constitute a threat to international peace and security .  
Underlining the importance of the widest possible dissemination of international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law and of relevant training for , inter alia , civilian police , armed forces , members of the judicial and legal professions , civil society and personnel of international and regional organizations ,  
The Taliban 's conduct of forced displacement of the civilian population during their recent offensive in the Shomali plains is a particularly alarming signal which reflects the movement 's apparent disregard for the concerns expressed by the international community .  
It also reminded States with a system of compulsory military service , where such a provision has not already been made , of its recommendation that they provide for conscientious objectors various forms of alternative service which are compatible with the reasons for conscientious objection , of non-combatant or civilian character , in the public interest and of not punitive nature .  
When we think of the incalculable number of civilian victims that these weapons claim including women , children and the elderly we realize the urgency of adopting or strengthening measures , on the national , regional and international levels , enabling us to regulate the proliferation of small arms and light weapons .  
This year , Nigeria , the giant of Africa , has achieved an impressively quick return to civilian rule after multi-party elections , while South Africa , the continent 's economic powerhouse , has successfully held its second democratic election , as well as undergone a smooth transition from the tenure of President Mandela to that of President Mbeki .  
Even though the primary responsibility of maintaining security and the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and areas always lies with the host State , the international community is duty bound to assist governments in this task and , above all , to bear the bulk of the costs to African States whose financial and logistic capacities are limited .  
There are two priorities in addressing the situation in West Timor : first , the Indonesian government must provide all necessary security measures to secure both refugees and humanitarian agencies , maintain the civilian character of refugee sites , and facilitate humanitarian activities ; second , whatever option refugees will choose - return , remain or go elsewhere in Indonesia - it will have to be free and informed , impartially ascertained , respected and fulfilled . 
Authorizes the establishment , for an initial period of six months until 15 April 2000 , of the United Nations Office in Angola ( UNOA ) staffed with the personnel necessary to liaise with the political , military , police and other civilian authorities , with a view to exploring effective measures for restoring peace , assisting the Angolan people in the area of capacity-building , humanitarian assistance , the promotion of human rights , and coordinating other activities ;

Recalling also its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
The UNMIK civilian police will provide a broad spectrum of basic law enforcement services , including patrolling , crime prevention , active street-level policing functions and assisting citizens and business owners in rebuilding safe and livable communities , as well as providing traffic policing , border police controls , criminal investigations , security for at-risk populations and interdiction against organized crime .  
Recalling also its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
The methodology of the report is accountable for another obfuscation : in an effort to scale down their size and significance , the human rights abuses evident in the use of cluster bombs and depleted uranium , the ethnic cleansing of Serbs after the aggression and the destruction of civilian infrastructure are immediately referenced to alleged violations of human rights by the Yugoslav side .  
The representatives of the people of Iraq urge an immediate halt to the daily attacks being carried out by United States and British aircraft under the cloak of the so-called aerial exclusion zones imposed on Iraq without any legal basis , inasmuch as these attacks target civilian and services-related installations such as electric power stations and water treatment plants in such a way as to affect the lives of Iraqis in an adverse manner and inflict harm on them .  
After a further massive loss of human lives , increased suffering of the civilian population and immense physical destruction , the two sides found themselves roughly at the same positions they held in late 1998 .  
Noting that , as the century draws to a close , the Central American countries have achieved significant progress towards the consolidation of democracy and good governance , the strengthening of civilian Governments , respect for human rights and the rule of law , and the promotion of State and economic reforms , sustainable development and regional integration , reflecting the desire of the Central American peoples to live and prosper in a climate of peace and solidarity ,  
The proposed budget of UNMIK for the period from its inception on 10 June 1999 to 30 June 2000 provides for a total strength of 9,812 personnel , including 38 military liaison officers , 4,718 civilian police , 1,269 international staff , 3,566 local staff , 18 National Officers and 203 United Nations Volunteers , and amounts to $ 456,451,200 gross , inclusive of the commitment authority of $ 200-million already authorized by the General Assembly in its resolution 53 / 241 of 28 July 1999 .  
Despite repeated appeals from United Nations bodies , bombing of the civilian population , enforced displacement both within and outside the country , summary and extrajudicial execution , violation of the right to life and the right to physical safety of prisoners of war , attacks on the civilian population , abduction and subjection to forced labour of women and children and obstruction of humanitarian assistance continued unabated .  
The Special Rapporteur is concerned that this situation , combined with peer pressure and misconceived collegial loyalty , may work to the detriment of civilian victims and their families and seriously circumscribe their opportunities to have their cases heard before a competent , independent and impartial tribunal , as provided for in the Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary .  
Urges States to uphold the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and settlements , inter alia , through effective measures to prevent the infiltration of armed elements , to identify and separate any such armed elements from refugee populations , to settle refugees in secure locations , and to afford to the Office of the High Commissioner and other appropriate humanitarian organizations prompt , unhindered and safe access to asylum-seekers , refugees and other persons of concern ;  
Noting that , as the century draws to a close , the Central American countries have achieved significant progress towards the consolidation of democracy and good governance , the strengthening of civilian Governments , respect for human rights and the rule of law , and the promotion of State and economic reforms , sustainable development and regional integration , reflecting the desire of the Central American peoples to live and prosper in a climate of peace and solidarity ,  
The Lebanese Government strongly condemns Israel 's arbitrary actions against the Lebanese civilian population , and it requests you to do your utmost to induce the Israeli authorities concerned to halt these inhuman and unlawful practices and , at last , to close down the Khiyam centre that they maintain inside Lebanese territory .  
Expressing its grave concern for the well-being of internally displaced persons , particularly in Kabul and in the Panjsher , Bamian and Kunduz regions , and for the civilian population of Afghanistan living without shelter , who face a long winter possibly deprived of basic foods as a result of the recent fighting , as well as the denial by the warring factions of adequate conditions for the delivery of aid by humanitarian organizations ,  
In response to increasing reports of violence and human rights abuses attributed to Indonesian government forces since the beginning of the year , the Special Rapporteur had repeatedly sent urgent appeals to the Government urging the authorities to protect the safety and integrity of the civilian population in East Timor and to ensure that the police and military were conducting their operations in strict compliance with international human rights and humanitarian law standards . 
At the impact of the current armed conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effect on the civilian population , in particular women and children , and continuing serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by all parties , in particular :  
With regard to accountability of United Nations military and civilian police observers for losses of or damage to United Nations property caused by them , the current common practice in field missions is to withhold two weeks of mission subsistence allowance entitlements prior to the departure of the military or police observers concerned , in respect of cases in which they are involved , pending the taking of a decision by the Headquarters Property Survey Board .  
Such personnel , installations , material , units or vehicles were entitled to that protection given to civilians or civilian objects under the international law of armed conflict and the accused was aware of the factual circumstances that established that protection .

Recalling also its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
The military authorities specifically reiterated their public pledge not only to support the ongoing peace and democratic processes but also to transform the armed forces into a more professional republican army subordinate to civilian authorities following the elections .  
There are two priorities in addressing the situation in western Timor : first , the Indonesian Government must provide all necessary security measures to secure both refugees and humanitarian agencies , maintain the civilian character of refugee sites , and facilitate humanitarian activities ; second , whatever option refugees will choose return , remain or go elsewhere in Indonesia it will have to be free and informed , impartially ascertained , respected and fulfilled . 
The proliferation of conflicts , internal as well as international , of which civilian populations are the innocent victims , can only reaffirm to us the need to work towards the ideal embodied in that tradition by encouraging States , in conformity with the United Nations Charter , to resolve their differences through peaceful means .  
Recalling its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
It is no secret that the Government of the United Kingdom joined the United States administration in carrying out its threats to use force , heedless of the Security Council , the United Nations and world public opinion , in its comprehensive military attack on Iraq from 16 to 20 December 1998 , which destroyed a large number of Iraqi civilian installations and led to the death and injury of a large number of Iraqi people .  
Once again he drew the attention of the Burundi authorities to the urgent need to ensure the observance of international standards of humanitarian law and human rights , which prohibited indiscriminate attacks against the civilian population and civilian targets during military operations .  
It also supported the recommendation that a broad geographical base that took into account the sizes of the contingents from the various contributing countries should be used in selecting civilian police commissioners and appointing other senior police personnel for peacekeeping operations .  
They also trained the Kamajor paramilitary troops who are fighting the rebel forces of the overthrown Government with the acquiescence of the current Government and are responsible for grave human rights violations against prisoners and the civilian population .  
The projection provides for the retention in MINURCA of 1 , 350 military personnel , inclusive of the 35 additional military personnel referred to in paragraph 44 of my main report , and 25 civilian police advisers , supported by 179 international and local staff .  
At its fifty _ fourth session , the Commission , in resolution 1998-75 , recognizing the urgent need for the adoption of effective measures , nationally , regionally and internationally , to protect the civilian population , especially women and children , in northern Uganda from the effects of armed conflict , requested the Secretary _ General to report on the implementation of that resolution to the Commission at its fifty _ fifth session .  
They demanded that the missile batteries be withdrawn and returned to their original sites within 48 hours of the date of the above position ; that there should be no flights of any civilian or military fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters south of the 32 nd parallel ; and that Iraq should undertake no illumination or tracing by radar of any aircraft and should flash no signals indicating a hostile intention .  
The mandate of UNMIBH is to assist the parties in their obligations to provide a safe and secure environment for all persons in their respective jurisdictions by maintaining civilian law enforcement agencies operating in accordance with internationally recognized standards and with respect for internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms.The Mission consists of an International Police Task Force ( IPTF ) and a civilian office .  
During the relevant period , United States warplanes engaged in such hostile , provocative and inflammatory acts as dropping heat flares and breaking the sound barrier over Iraqi civilian areas and establishments , and United States naval vessels also engaged in acts of aggression inside and outside Iraqi territorial waters . 
While military observers and most of the international civilian staff left the mission area by 30 September 1997 as scheduled , owing to the unforeseen scope and complexity of residual administrative tasks involving , inter alia , the re-creation of the Missions financial records lost during hostilities in April 1996 , the Missions in situ liquidation was extended until 28 February 1998 , with a small liquidation team continuing work at United Nations Headquarters until 30 June 1998 .  
Numerous testimonies received by the Special Rapporteur indicate that the civilian population living in or near the combat zone is generally forced to move : in these " grey zones " ( zones controlled or influenced by the insurgents ) the armed forces often resort to searches , destruction and burning of houses , and confiscation of property and food to force the people to move , temporarily or permanently .  
The basic premise is to encourage bilateral and multilateral dialogue so as to promote international understanding and cooperation on the basis of the concepts identified in the preambular paragraphs of this draft : that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress and science and technology for civilian applications need to be maintained and encouraged.There are two operational components to this draft resolution . 
Mexico attended the Review Conference for the 1980 Convention with the firm intention and the hope of ending a tragedy that is of vast proportions , afflicting daily the civilian population , which is exposed to the more than 100-million such devious artifacts ready to explode under innocent feet .  
A further review during the past six months has focused on bringing UNFICYP into line with the approaches in more recently established peacekeeping missions , while achieving additional efficiencies by integrating civilian and military personnel in terms of sharing responsibilities and decision-making , establishing more transparency and better financial control .  
The reorganized Civil Affairs Branch will be headed by a civilian chief , at the P-4 level , with political legal background , assisted by a civil affairs officer at the P-3 level .  
In order to achieve the objectives described therein , the plan of operations for the Observer Mission headed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General , calls for the phased deployment , as security conditions permit , of the authorized strength of 70 military observers , a 15 - person medical unit and 5 civilian police advisers supported by 50 international civilian and 48 local staff .  
During the budget period , owing to the poor road infrastructure and prevailing security situation , the MI-8 helicopter would be utilized for the transportation of UNOMSIL military and civilian personnel , logistical support and supply resupply tasking , as well as for casualty and medical evacuation , if required .  
It was therefore imperative that the international community should pursue ways and means of enhancing the safety of all United Nations personnel both military and civilian in order to maintain the effective functioning and timely deployment of peacekeeping operations .  
This criminal , unprecedented act of aggression , in clear support of separatism and terrorism , has already caused massive human losses and enormous destruction of civilian infrastructure all over Yugoslavia , thus provoking enormous humanitarian suffering .  
To cease immediately its continued repressive practices , including the practice of forced deportation and relocation , against the Iraqi Kurds , Assyrians and Turkmen , and against the population of the southern marsh areas , where drainage projects have provoked environmental destruction and a deterioration of the situation of the civilian population , and to ensure the personal integrity and freedoms , including the full freedom of belief , of the Shia and their religious establishment ;  
During the relevant period , United States warplanes engaged in such hostile , provocative and inflammatory acts as dropping heat flares and breaking the sound barrier over Iraqi civilian areas and installations , and United States naval vessels also engaged in acts of aggression inside and outside Iraqi territorial waters .  
At the impact of the current armed conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effect on the civilian population , in particular women and children , at continuing serious violations of human rights , and international humanitarian law by all parties , in particular :  
After a further massive loss of human lives , increased suffering of the civilian population and immense physical destruction , the two sides found themselves roughly in the same positions they held in late 1998 .  
After a further massive loss of human lives , increased suffering of the civilian population and immense physical destruction , the two sides found themselves roughly in the same positions they held in late 1998 .  
During the past six months , fighting continued in south Lebanon and the situation in the area remained volatile , although the level of hostility was somewhat reduced and civilian casualties decreased .  
The human rights violations reported to him by credible eyewitnesses had included forced displacement of the civilian population , deliberate burning of houses , summary execution of noncombatants , arbitrary detention and forced labour .  
The elimination of this scourge requires vigorous , coordinated international action so that the illicit trafficking in light weapons stops devastating civilian populations and causing humanitarian crises throughout the world .  
In the case of an emerging widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population , the intent clause of the last element indicates that this mental element is satisfied if the perpetrator intended to further such an attack .  
In the case of an emerging widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population , the intent clause of the last element indicates that this mental element is satisfied if the perpetrator intended to further such an attack .  
In recent years , the grave threat posed by small arms especially by the illicit manufacture of and trafficking and trade in small arms to social development , civilian safety and regional security has become a common concern of the international community .  
The prohibition on attacks against civilians is based on the most fundamental distinction drawn in international humanitarian law between the civilian and the military and the absolute prohibition on directing attacks against the former .  
The first threeweek period of full control by these entities over Freetown marked the most intensified , systematic and widespread violations of human rights and international humanitarian law against the civilian population .  
In the case of an emerging widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population , the intent clause of the last element indicates that this mental element is satisfied if the perpetrator intended to further such an attack .  
Once again , we have witnessed with dreary familiarity a major military offensive late this past summer , with all the consequent displacement and suffering of the civilian population .  
In Zaire and in Haiti , the armed conflicts resulted from the actions of hardened , corrupt , dictatorial governments that turned their backs on the civilian population and established violence as the norm of political discourse and squandered national resources .  
In summing up , the basic issue before us today is the following choice between two alternatives : either we seize this opportunity to radically simplify and promote the flow of everyday civilian goods into Iraq , thereby establishing beyond any doubt that the international community is giving paramount importance to humanitarian concerns , while keeping sensitive goods under control ; or we preserve the status quo .  
The main objective of the Kindu deployment , which would be robust enough to deter any potential attackers , would be to establish a secure base from which civilian personnel who deal with disarmament , demobilization , reintegration , repatriation ( DDRR ) and human rights issues and provide humanitarian assistance would be able to go into the area to carry out their work .  
However , for independence to be fully enjoyed , the following three pillars are essential for a functioning democracy in a new , independent country : an impartial and independent judiciary , a competent and fully trained civilian police service , and a solid and broad-based administrative framework .  
At the same time , we feel that it is equally important to ensure that the interests and well-being of innocent civilian populations are protected in pursuing that objective , consistent with the existing practice of protecting the interests of civilians in conflict situations .  
Israel recognizes , and has repeatedly expressed its sympathy for , the unfortunate deaths of Palestinian civilians and for the Palestinian populations that must endure the precautionary security measures foisted upon Israel by the inaction of the Palestinian leadership .  But while Israel considers the death of any civilian , whether Israeli or Palestinian , to be tragic , for the Palestinian terrorist , these deaths are deliberate , premeditated and desired .  
She further notes with regret that in some countries Governments have made use of excessive and indiscriminate force in their efforts to counter armed opposition groups , which in some cases has involved summary executions of captured combatants and resulted in extensive civilian casualties and fatalities .  
Moreover , pending the conclusion of consultations with the Government of Angola and until the establishment by the Security Council in its resolution 1268 ( 1999 ) of 15 October 1999 of the United Nations Office in Angola , the substantive MONUA personnel required to maintain liaison with the political , military , police and other civilian authorities of Angola , as well as its human rights component , were also retained in the country as part of the Observer Missions staffing establishment .  
The Special Representative wishes , once more , to conclude his report by urging all concerned authorities and organizations , in Africa as well as in the United Nations , to use all possible means to ensure that peace and security finally prevail and are respected throughout the Great Lakes region ; that all civilian populations in the region are fully protected ; and that their basic economic needs are fulfilled .  These are the fundamental requirements for allowing a culture of human rights to develop and to take deep root in the region .  
The provisional expansion of UNOMSIL was supported by additional resources utilized for the deployment of military observers and additional international civilian staff in the fields of political and civil affairs and human rights , as well as for the necessary administrative , technical and logistical support services .  
While UNAMSIL took over the substantive civilian and military components of UNOMSIL , as well as its assets , the significant expansion of the Mission necessitated commensurate strengthening of its civilian staffing establishment , logistical and technical support structures , the provision of additional communications , electronic data-processing and other equipment , acquisition of vehicles and contracting additional air assets .  
A provision of $ 337,500 was made to cover the cost of peacekeeping assistance team seminars in South America , training courses for military and civilian police and national trainers on peacekeeping , human rights and humanitarian assistance at the International Training Centre of the International Labour Organization at Turin , Italy , as well as for assistance to national and regional training and to multilateral and multidimensional exercises .  
Even after signing the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement , the Ethiopian hordes had wilfully , wantonly and methodically launched indiscriminate attacks against civilian targets , taken prisoners , tortured , raped and murdered , attacked and destroyed villages , public facilities , cultural and religious infrastructures and institutions and engaged in ethnic cleansing , causing large numbers of persons to become displaced .  
Reiterates its call upon all States and parties to the Peace Agreement to ensure that the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms and effective , functioning democratic institutions will be central elements in developing civilian structures consistent with the territorial integrity of all States in the region , within their internationally recognized borders , taking fully into account all relevant Security Council resolutions ;  
Strongly condemns the continued use of disproportionate and indiscriminate force by Russian military forces , federal servicemen and State agents , including attacks against civilians and other breaches of international law as well as serious violations of human rights , such as forced disappearances , extrajudicial , summary and arbitrary executions , torture and other inhuman and degrading treatment , and calls upon the Government of the Russian Federation to comply with its international human rights and humanitarian law obligations in its operations against Chechen fighters and to take all measures to protect the civilian population ;  
Calls upon the Russian Federation to ensure that both civilian and military prosecutors offices undertake systematic , credible and exhaustive criminal investigations and prosecutions of all violations of international humanitarian law and human rights , in particular of those members of federal forces , federal servicemen and the personnel of law enforcement agencies against civilians allegedly implicated in war crimes and human rights violations and to pursue with rigour the cases which have been referred to them ;  
The time has come for the United Nations to have its say on the matter of this aggression , which is in flagrant violation of international law and the Charter of the United Nations and whose victims comprise some hundreds of dead and thousands of wounded among the innocent civilian population , to say nothing of the deliberate destruction of the infrastructure that is vital to the economy and to everyday life in Iraq .  
The United States of America and the United Kingdom are committing acts of aggression and violating Iraqs airspace and territory on a daily basis on the pretext of allegedly enforcing the illegal and unlawful no-flight zones that were imposed by these two countries in a pathological display of military power that poses a threat to the security and safety of innocent civilian citizens and represents an assault on the sovereignty of an independent Member State of the United Nations .  
Moreover , Israeli settlers have been engaged in a daily terror campaign against the Palestinian civilian population during which they have shot civilians , blocked roads , burned orchards , destroyed infrastructures and have committed a wide range of other atrocities .  
Expressing its deep concern over the severity of humanitarian sufferings of affected civilian populations , the World Conference requests the relevant international institutions to continue rendering urgent financial and humanitarian assistance to populations expelled from their homes and calls for enabling refugees and internally displaced persons to return to their homes voluntarily , in safety and dignity ;  
It can not but be recognized that small arms are , paradoxically , those that claim the most victims , both civilian and military , given the nature of the current conflicts afflicting many countries , small arms and light weapons , apart from their undeniable advantage in terms of cost , proving to be the most adapted to the terrain and to the actions engaged in : easily transportable , they can be rapidly distributed and concealed . 
The Armenian falsifiers would rather prefer to claim that if any single Turk was killed during these tragic times , then that was strictly due to self-defence , that no civilian Turks were murdered , raped or pillaged whereas even the Tsarist officers were horrified to see the frenzy of massacring defenceless Turks perpetrated by armed Armenian gangs and paramilitaries in the most vicious manner .  
Our country went through a very trying and turbulent period at that time , resulting in lawlessness , the loss of a few lives , a severe economic downtown , the purported abrogation of the Constitution , the imposition of martial law , the dismissal of the elected Government while it was in captivity , a change of the presidency and the appointment of the civilian interim Government . 
The Ivorian patriots were just savouring that victory , so dearly yet so proudly won over the military regime , whose rule had been marked by numerous barbaric acts committed against civilian populations , when , to their great surprise , there rang out over foreign radio stations appeals by the Rassemblement des Rpublicains ( RDR ) , calling upon its militants to oppose the victory of candidate Laurent Gbagbo and thereby calling into question the presidential election of 22 October 2000 .  
Finally , blurred lines between the civilian and military character of camps expose civilians inside to the risk of attack by opposing forces , where camps are perceived to serve as launching pads for renewed fighting .  
The joint unit established by resolution 1051 ( 1996 ) will continue to review the categorized list in the light of additional information that may become available for the purposes of identifying items that are covered under the relevant provisions of that resolution , because of their possible dual use for civilian and prohibited purposes under resolution 687 ( 1991 ) of 3 April 1991 and other relevant resolutions .  
At its fifty-seventh session , in April 2001 , the Commission on Human Rights adopted , without a vote , resolution 2001 / 13 on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan , in which it strongly condemned the mass killings and systematic human rights violations against civilians and persons deprived of their liberty , for reasons related to the armed conflict , resulting in the massive , forced displacement of the civilian population .  
The Section will be responsible for mid - and long-term planning , including succession planning , developing mission modules / templates , determining staffing tables and levels , anticipating future skills requirements , analysing and monitoring human resource trends , identifying new sources of recruitment , and managing the civilian rapid deployment capability .  
Further phases are planned and the eventual decision support system will contain all tactical information required to support the planning assumptions for rapid mission deployment , mission liquidation and redeployment of assets , build-up and deployment of surplus assets , personnel and contingent placements and mobilization , military and civilian mobilization , and financial and administrative information to support budget planning and financial analyses ( $ 150,000 ) . 
Attacks against the civilian population and systematic killings and summary executions have been a part of the pattern of egregious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law perpetrated by different factions in the protracted armed conflict in Sierra Leone .  
During the summit , there was a general consensus of the urgent need for the implementation of an immediate ceasefire in the areas of military operation in southern Sudan in order to accelerate the flow of humanitarian assistance to the needy civilian population in those areas , and to facilitate for constructive negotiations between the Government and the rebel movement ( SPLM / A ) , with the ultimate aim of reaching a peaceful resolution of the conflict in the south . 
My Governments continued call for a comprehensive ceasefire in the war-affected areas in the south will obviously , if implemented , alleviate the suffering of the civilian population in those areas and provide a conducive atmosphere for a peaceful settlement of the conflict .  
This resolution , however , representing as it does a dangerous precedent in which the Security Council gives unlimited authorization to States cooperating with the Government of Kuwait to interfere with civilian trade , is not based on Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations and does not therefore make it permissible to use coercive military measures for its enforcement .  
The manifestations of that daily horror are daily massacres of the civilian population , summary and extrajudicial executions , the deportation of entire populations , the taking of hostages , hijacking , the illegal capture and destruction of aircraft , the systematic rape and burying alive of women , destitution , other serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , the deliberate and criminal spread of HIV / AIDS , and so forth .  
The Secretary-General has also recommended the Member States ensure that their military , civilian and police personnel involved in United Nations peacekeeping operations be trained with regard to international human rights , humanitarian law and refugee law , especially as concerns the rights and protection of children and women , in advance of troop deployment to United Nations operations .  
The Missions initial objective in phase III would be to establish a mixed civilian and military presence , as well as a forward support base , in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
Preparations are under way for recruitment and deployment of adequate numbers of United Nations civilian personnel to accompany the military deployment , including political , human rights , humanitarian , child protection , public information , disarmament , demobilization and reintegration and logistical personnel .  
Recalling also its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
The problem of the illicit traffic in and the circulation of small arms and light weapons within the region of Southeastern Europe is of particular concern for the Republic of Macedonia , especially after the 1997 civilian unrest in Albania and the conflict in Kosovo ; it poses a serious threat not only to the security and stability of my country but to the broader region as well , particularly through its severe , adverse impact on economic , social and human development .  
The plan provides for an integrated peacekeeping mission headed by a Special Representative of the Secretary-General , which would be composed of a military component , a civilian police component , and a small civilian component , including experts who would provide crucial assistance to the emergent East Timorese administration .
