Whenever a temple celebration took place , by the side of the glistening green rice paddies could be seen the strangest of processions : following in twos and threes behind the manically colorful flower trucks were old gents on bicycles and youngsters on motorcycles , as if under a magic spell , eyes fixed straight ahead on the dancing and twisting flower truck girls , to whom " wearing clothes and being naked is about the same thing .

CLA chairman Chan Huo-sheng also promises that in the future , unemployment insurance will be gradually extended to cover these workers .  
The problem was eventually fixed through the combined efforts of a number of American computer scientists . Realizing that the increasing size and complexity of computer networks made it impossible for any individual to discover all the holes within them , these scientists established the Computer Emergency Response Team ( CERT ) at Carnegie-Mellon University . They hoped that by working together , network security issues could be predicted and resolved .  
Lie-chi likes to recall the time a music troupe came all the way from southern Taiwan with a large gong that needed tuning . Lin Wu tapped it a few times , sized up the problem , and with one sharp whack of his wooden mallet announced that the gong was fixed .

They keep their eyes firmly fixed on the males , watching their every move , ready to reward them for their efforts by choosing the partner that pleases them best .  
" Although the pattern in international medical aid is to offer long-term aid at fixed locations , the TRMPC will at least for the near future continue its approach of not adopting any fixed location , but of doing volunteer care deep in those areas that local medical systems do not reach , " says TRMPC President Liu Chi-chun . Like explorers on the Discovery Channel , the TRMPC 's tramping through the developing world has yielded some valuable academic discoveries .  
Wu says that the causes of low creativity and the cultural context are being fixed , but no systematic changes have been made as yet . One encouraging point is that the MOE has included creativity as a core educational ability . Industry , government , and the educational sector , however , have yet to come together . If all of them can move forward together and embrace one another , the circle will get larger and larger .  
In line with the harsh predictions concerning " dejobbing " set forth in the book Jobshift : How to Prosper in a Workplace without Jobs , regular full-time , lifelong jobs with fixed objectives are quickly and quietly disappearing .

The attainment of that goal meant the final elimination of nuclear weapons , since the existence of such weapons still constituted a serious threat to the main purpose of the United Nations - the maintenance of international peace and security .  36 .

Five features of these transactions are noteworthy : reciprocity ( " I help you , you help me , when in need " ) ; insignificant transaction costs ; the open-ended ( no fixed maturity ) nature of many of these financial contracts ; the informality of screening devices ( personal knowledge of borrowers ) used in making loans ; and the informal sanctions ( such as social shunning of delinquents ) employed to enforce contracts .

In many ways the performance of the Canadian economy last year was closer to that of western Europe than that of the United States : annual growth averaged some 1.5 per cent , rather less than in 1995 ; relatively weak labour markets and increased taxes held back the growth of personal disposable income , although consumption picked up to a large extent because of a steep fall in the savings ratio ; and business fixed investment is also more concerned with rationalization than expanding capacities .  
The Policy Forum will provide institutional support for a process of consultation , coordination and action among Governments and other stakeholders interested in taking timely steps towards the establishment of a limited-scale international GHG trading system , possibly starting with a few interested countries , with allowances based on CO2 from major fixed sources and with adequate provisions for the expansion of the trading system to include additional countries , gases , sources and sinks .

Regarding market price support measures , for instance , in several developing countries the total current AMS , the difference between the administered price and the nominally fixed external reference price ( ERP ) , in domestic currency terms had exceeded its bound level as a result of the high rate of inflation experienced by them in the years since the base period ( 1986-1988 ) .  
As experienced by some developing countries , the calculated product-specific AMS of a market price support measure could become a negative figure when the administered market price dropped below the ERP nominally fixed to the world price in the 1986-1988 base period to meet the objective of supporting food purchases by poor households .
