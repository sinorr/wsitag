The Japanese prime minister 's brazenly paying his respects shows that Yakusuni Shrine is a symbol of aggressive war ; it has overtones of a public and official provocation , and indicates contempt for the people of those countries which suffered from that aggression .  It recalls for those people the pain they suffered , so is it not something natural , a matter of course , for the Chinese people to express their strong indignation and firm opposition ?

When conducting a " strategic security tour " to Washington in April 1999 , he had extensive contacts with US congressmen and officials .

First of all , after Chen Shuibian 's " inauguration ceremony " on 20 May , US President Clinton wrote to express congratulations , and the government and public in the United States expressed " satisfaction " with Chen 's " inaugural speech " ; as a result Chen Shuibian became cocky and boasted that he had already reached the first standard of " satisfying the United States " set in his pre-office speeches .

"  
However , because some mass organizations threatened to surround the Legislative Yuan to express their anti-nuclear opinions and dismiss legislators who advocate the construction of nuclear power plant and because some legislators received threats , those legislators who support the nuclear power plant have to ask for personal protection .

15 .  We must point out that legislative interpretation is not equivalent to amendment .  Legislative interpretation must be faithful to the true legislative intent .

A satisfactory resolution of a situation is dependent upon close co-operation among team members .  In a large-scale or drawn-out negotiation , every team member - the negotiator , the strategist and the requirement officer - contributes equally to a successful negotiation .

During the talk , negotiators can then detect the ' weak points ' at the bottom of their hearts and talk them out of the attempt . "  
" Although it is inherent in the established civil service pay adjustment mechanism that some of the factors for determining the annual civil service pay adjustment may have a positive or negative impact on the size of the pay adjustment , the contractual employment arrangements between the Government and the vast majority of serving civil servants do not contain an express provision authorising the Government to reduce pay .  
They do n't just want to cover their bodies from the elements but also to express themselves in clothing . So as living standards increase , the textile industry is going to be more promising .

So starting from the present , the party should expand the channels for participation and communication , so that party members and cadres have ample opportunity to express their opinions .

His words illustrate the type of thinking that lay behind the art of embroidery in ancient times . The use of celestial bodies and aspects of nature as designs for clothing reflects the harmony and fusion of man and nature . The flowery fowl is the brightly colored pheasant , the aquatic grasses express cleanliness , fire stands for illumination , and rice represents nourishment . Together the patterns are a symbol of the moral ideal of government , of concern over the destiny of mankind and compassion for the people .  
Despite its foreign origins in both physical reality and artistic representation , the pomegranate has been able to express even more of its charm in China . Well suiting the Chinese national spirit , it has long been broadly popular among the people , as well as marking a pleasant footnote in the history of cultural and artistic interchange between East and West .

From Peachwood Charms to New Year 's Scrolls : Ever since ancient times , everybody from high officials to lowly peddlers has used these scrolls to display their literary proficiency or express their yearnings for the future . The joyous red-scribed scrolls , their contents ranging across the spectrum of hopes and propitious wishes , never fail to get the spring season off to a rousing start .  
Sometimes I separate my use of black-and - white and color photographs : For external things , such as traditional street festivals , I use color , while I use black-and-white to express the unseen , what is hidden .  
Perhaps he concentrated too intently on the glottal , natural style of traditional singing . When receiving Western style vocal training at the Institute of Art , for a while Buhe could not sing at all . The contradictions made him ponder whether it was not impossible to express traditional songs using the abdominal singing techniques of the West .  
Also , Lisa 's grasp of the computer profession is so good that she can be very faithful and fluent , and she can translate concisely while maintaining the subtle innuendos and insinuating tones . " For example , she used a slang term in Taiwanese meaning " Is that real ? " to express the dubious veracity of an event . She described the end of a big computer exhibition as a " leftover meal . " Such succinct and incisive language causes readers to infuse their own imagination into the spaces of the text .  
Chen was Lai Ho 's companion in literature , and the two developed a close bond . They often interacted through poems and songs . The two of them joined together with a group of highly educated and politically aware writers to form the ' Ying Society . ' They composed poetry to express their concerns about current events and their sympathy with the lives of the masses , and they also used this to carry on the Chinese cultural tradition .

Overall , in terms of cross-strait relations , Chen sees Lee 's inaugural address as being a moderate and not especially innovative speech , but it certainly did express a considerably friendly attitude and reopened the door to discussions . However , people should not expect any sudden breakthrough in cross-strait relations , because Taiwan and the PRC are in a " cold peace " situation , and there is no need to rush things .  
Given that everyone is exposed to the mass media today , it is hard to ensure that the views and statements that senior citizens express about the past have not been guided by the current context .

Perhaps a passage by veteran reporter Ku Meng-jen , written as a commentary on Chong Shu 's novel The Chinese People , is particularly apropos : " From the Chinese laborers of the past to the immigrants of today , from the narrow alleys of Chinatown to present-day Silicon Valley , the peregrine steps of the overseas Chinese on the one hand reflect the changes of the times , and on the other hand express the growth of the Chinese people in foreign society .  
Kyle Cheng , the radio host , points out that the rap and hip hop dance music which the LA Boyz introduced to Taiwan had its origins within America 's street youth subculture .

Although its strivings have produced no small number of impressive works , many of the generation 's artists have yet to come completely into their prime-particularly in regard to manifesting the " full human potential " sought by traditional literati ink painting .

Kuo says that it is impossible to see how Diamond Stage had real respect for these low-status people . Most of the time in the " social concern segments " was spent in bantering among the hosts ( who got their start doing vulgar " dinner shows " ) and the guest star .

When one mentions the standard of English among schoolchildren and students in Hong Kong , professors at leading local academic institutions such as the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology ( HKUST ) generally express the view that it often leaves much to be desired .

Men and women together have built up and share a common image of a new man .  
According to museum employee Lu Yu-hua , many people express surprise that there should be an entire museum devoted solely to paper , but when you really think about it , there 's really nothing strange about it . When paper was first invented , the raw materials from which it was made differed from one region to the next . A single sheet of paper spoke volumes about local climates and vegetation ; its very existence enabled the spread of knowledge , and could record the history of an individual or an entire nation !  
She says that at the beginning their limbs were stiff and they were rather inhibited and unwilling to express themselves , and were always looking down at the floor . But as they gradually grew more practiced and skillful , they also learned to open up and display their emotions , and in this way their dancing became more and more confident and beautiful .  
I do n't have any plans to pose for a racy photo album . If I were in a movie and they wanted me to do a scene in the nude , it would n't be a problem . But I do n't think that a photo album would a way to express the ideal of male beauty . Maybe the Japanese pop idol Miyazawa Rie can express her own pure esthetic appeal through a photo album , but for a man to convey that kind of natural feeling through still photos is not an easy thing .  
To avoid people being denied the right to medical self-determination because they are unable to express their will , anyone over 20 years of age and of full capacity may make an " advance declaration " of their wishes ( also known as a " living will " ) , and may appoint a medical representative who is empowered to sign a consent form on their behalf if they are unable to express themselves .  
Of course we are well aware that statesmanship ca n't be learned just from a short series of classes , but we hope that by laying on these courses from our standpoint as a cultural and educational foundation , and not from a party political standpoint , we can make a start by using culture and education to purify people 's hearts . Because in fact a real political leader needs to speak from the heart and express his true hopes .  
They express their opinions and get to know each other . The online authors that publishing companies are focusing on are but a tiny fraction of the online population . What is more , even a cursory search of the Web will bring up hundreds of websites devoted to online literature . The body of literature represented therein is both vast and varied in format , and only a tiny bit of it can be reflected in the output of traditional publishers .  
Chu Ge noted that he strongly encouraged Lee to use the traditional Chinese medium of ink , because ink by nature is best suited to express abstract ideas . Lee , having never before painted a traditional ink painting , has proved even more capable than most of transcending concrete forms to let the ink freely play out in a way that characterizes his most recent series of compositions , " Language of Ink . "  
Ho Chun-jui , head of the Center for the Study of Sexualities at National Central University , analyzes the movie in terms of time , place and people thus : The gradual legitimization of homosexuality in Taiwanese culture has lessened the taboo against Lan Yu ; the two cool male protaganists not only show passion and warmth , but also pointedly express intimate tenderness , a breakthrough in the portrayal of the traditional male lead ; and the contradiction between love vs class background and tradition-told without leaving the parameters of a love story-all naturally please the audience .  
Its personnel and programs have made an outstanding contribution , earning the title " the quiet achievers . " The low-profile AVDRC specially organized the open day to express gratitude for the tremendous support that the host nation has provided . In addition , the center also hopes to use media coverage to demonstrate to Taiwan 's citizens their nation 's critical contribution to bettering the lives of people throughout Asia .  
Unlike the literati of the Southern and Northern dynasty ( 420-589 ) who emphasized classical allusions and symmetrical verses , Han Yu left the world of the classics and instead chose the middle and lower classes as his point of departure . He wrote about mundane things in artistic , truly beautiful writing , and yet managed to indirectly express grander thinking about the governance of the nation .  
Who can avoid the reach of multi-media consortiums , with their tremendous financial resources and influence ? They can take in politicians who are down on their luck ; and even those who want to get public exposure to express their own ideas end up surrendering to the media . The result is that no one-neither the idealistic politician nor the deep thinker-ends up staying true to personal principles .  
Huang Ming-che cut an impressive figure among his generation of young painters , the more so because through his engagement with Western masters close to his own sensibility , he continuously rediscovered where he needed to go . Without turning his back on his unique artistic qualities , Huang had the courage to accept other artists ' strong points . He gradually developed his own style and found new techniques to express it . His painting style evolved from Taiwanese localism to sentimentalism .

However , the costs involved with using stainless steel boxes were higher , meaning they could only offer them on the seat-bookable and deluxe expresses , while passengers on the basic and express trains were sold lunches in the old fiberboard boxes .  
Would n't they fail to reach their warm breeding grounds to propagate their young ? In Sweden , where environmental education is well developed , outdoor education in elementary and secondary schools goes something like this : Students select a lakeside for long-term observation of changes to its plants , insects , water and shoreline , and try to find the causes for environmental ills . Some schools go to nearby islands for fieldwork , and teachers lead students to sit on the cliffs , experience the ocean and write poetry to express their feelings .  
Society sighs and shakes it collective head at this subgroup , which consists of disadvantaged individuals , often unemployed and / or single parents , stuck on the lower rungs both socially and economically .

They express their growing concern over the continued spread of drug trafficking and the enormous danger it poses to social institutions , to the observance of human rights and to democratic stability in their countries .  
During this Week , we should express our faith in the foundations of harmonious coexistence of peoples , the need to promote international cooperation , the defence and protection of human rights , progress , economic and social development and the full flourishing of democracy .  All of this should undoubtedly lead to the maintenance of authentic and stable peace .  
While we call upon Iraq to respond fully to the behests of international legality , we must voice our concern over the territorial integrity , sovereignty and unity of Iraq which must be preserved and express sympathy with the brotherly Iraqi people who endure difficult economic and social conditions that should end once their causes cease to exist .

The report is lucid , concise and clear , and I take this opportunity to express OIC 's appreciation to the Secretary-General not only for the timely presentation of the useful material , but also for his continuing untiring efforts towards finding a just and honourable solution of the issue of Palestine .  
I wish to express the hope that the practical implementation of this document will contribute to the continuation of the negotiating process towards the final settlement of the problem by political means and to the establishment of lasting peace and mutual understanding in the Middle East , and will serve the cause of the Palestinian people 's exercise of its right to national self-determination through the creation of an independent State of Palestine .  
My delegation would like to express its conviction that the establishment of such a forum or of other independent national or international bodies , whether public or private , should be made proof against egoistic interests , cliquishness , and the belief that success and efficiency can be the exclusive possession of any party .  
I express my fervent hope that the successful conclusion of the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) this year and the indefinite extension of the Treaty will help to strengthen its effective implementation and speed progress towards the ultimate goal of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons .

It was also stated that the sensitive issue of national criminal jurisdiction , as well as the principle of State sovereignty , would make express prior consent of States a prerequisite for the establishment of the Court as a system of international criminal jurisdiction .  
For these reasons , many non-nuclear-weapon States continued to express strong preference for a multilateral , legally binding international accord , which would be equal in status to the obligations contained in the non-proliferation Treaty .  
The first concern is that the judges of the international criminal court will have made a public and solemn undertaking under article 14 to exercise their functions under the statute " impartially and conscientiously " and in fairness to this judicial oath a dissenting judge should perhaps be allowed to make his dissent known where the judgement does not express the unanimous opinion of the judges .  
At the outset of this statement , I should like to express our deepest sympathy to the delegation and Government of France and to the families of the two valiant and honourable members of the United Nations Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) whose valuable lives were cut short at such an early age by the merciless and cold-blooded actions of professional killers , whoever they may be .

However , instead of differentiating the list of relief available to those representatives , it was considered preferable to express those differences by including a wording in the article that would make it clear that , in granting relief under article 17 to a representative of a foreign non-main proceeding , the court had to be satisfied that the relief related to assets falling under the authority of that representative or that it concerned information required in the foreign non-main proceeding .  
Expresses its concern that most of the representatives duly elected in 1990 are still excluded from participating in the meetings of the National Convention , created to prepare basic elements for the drafting of a new constitution , and that one of the objectives of the Convention is to maintain the participation of the armed forces in a leading role in the future political life of the State , and notes also with concern that the working procedures of the National Convention do not permit the elected representatives of the people freely to express their views ;

Although an express prohibition of arbitrary displacement is contained in international humanitarian law ( Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols ) and in the law relating to indigenous peoples , in human rights law , by contrast , the prohibition is only implicit in various provisions , particularly in the rights to freedom of movement , choice of residence and housing , and freedom from arbitrary interference with ones home .

However , we believe it is fitting to express our thanks for the support and cooperation of the United Nations , the friendly countries that directly supported the peace processes in Guatemala , Nicaragua and El Salvador , and the cooperating community , whose technical and financial assistance complemented the political and diplomatic efforts to achieve peace in the region .  
We also express our commitment to all the various tracks of the peace process without exception , with a view to guaranteeing Israel 's total withdrawal from all occupied Arab and Palestinian territories , including the Syrian Golan , southern Lebanon and the Beka'a valley , and respect by Israel for international law and for the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people , including its rights to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent State on its national territory , with Al-Quds as its capital .  
An express and clear incitement to hatred or to the use of violence that poses a clear and imminent danger to the legitimate interests of the State and all of its citizens calls for the State to take strong action to protect all human rights as well as national security and public order , bearing in mind the necessity and proportionality of those measures in relation to the threat posed .  
The only explanation seems to lie in the fact that Israel has realized that the Security Council is not prepared to live up to its commitments to stop aggression , thanks to the unqualified and continuous support of certain members who , at most and out of sheer embarrassment , express dissatisfaction with the atrocious Israeli practices in the occupied areas .  
We would like to express our delight and gratitude to the entire military and civil staff of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan for the devotion and bravery they demonstrated in complicated and often life-threatening situations as they carried out the very difficult duties assigned them by the Security Council .

the substantive discussion of nuclear disarmament issues through which the international community can be better informed on a continuing basis , can express its views as to the process , and can identify issues which might be subject to multilateral negotiations .  
While the Commission could not express an opinion , for example , on whether expropriation was a continuing or a completed wrongful act , it could emphasize the primacy of article 18 , so that acts that had been complete at a time when they had been lawful did not subsequently become the subject of contention because the law had changed .  
I would like in conclusion to express our readiness and sincere desire to work together with all other nations to build a peaceful world in which all people can live happy and productive lives , free from political , social and economic anxieties .  
Mr . Ibrahim ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) ( spoke in Arabic ) : I wish to express our thanks and gratitude to all those who contributed to the preparatory work for this meeting so that we can meet and study this vital and sensitive issue , and then together , in a spirit of partnership based on mutual respect , face the challenges hindering a balance between population and resources and find the best methods for dealing positively with the links between population and development .

Allow me also to express the hope that this recently adopted decision will constitute a spur to promote the work of the Conference on Disarmament and afford us a real opportunity to share with the five new members the arduous work which the international community expects of us in negotiating multilateral disarmament treaties with particular attention to the objective of achieving a world which is free of nuclear weapons .

My delegation also wishes to express very special appreciation for the excellent work accomplished by the Counsel of the Brazilian Mission , Mrs . Marcela Nicodemos who for the third year in a row led the informal consultations that brought about the final text of this draft resolution in an effective , professional and expeditious manner .  
All the Movement ' s conferences have addressed it with the utmost gravity , because the Movement is fully aware that , despite international developments and the vast increase in the number of States Members of the United Nations , those States do not enjoy genuine representation commensurate with their number , international influence and desire to express their legitimate interests .  
The draft resolution is also silent on the current impasse in the Conference on Disarmament due to the inflexibility shown by a few delegations on the questions of nuclear disarmament and outer space , ignoring the express wishes of the vast majority of its members , which support the commencement of substantive negotiations as part of a balanced and comprehensive programme of work .  
We must express , however , our deep concern that , while at the national level the small island developing States have seriously demonstrated their resolve to implement the Barbados Programme of Action , as they agreed to do five years ago , the adequate and predictable financial resources that the international community pledged to provide to support the implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action have not been fully provided .  
While taking pride in our national economic and social efforts , we should like to express our appreciation and gratitude for the assistance received from our brotherly Arab States , from friendly countries , from United Nations agencies and other international organizations and in particular from the United Nations Development Programme .  
The Commission may wish to express its recognition of outstanding development issues and constraints related to sustainable energy development , which should facilitate sustainable energy policies to be formulated and implemented , especially at the national level within a regional context .  
Besides being sometimes needed to satisfy national constitutional and other requirements , the enactment of express legislative authorization may be an important measure to foster the confidence of potential investors , national or foreign , in a national policy to promote private sector investment in infrastructure .  
Strongly supports the efforts made to enable the people of Haiti to express their political will in the forthcoming legislative and local elections , invites all the political leaders of the country to involve themselves in a constructive dialogue and , in this connection , invites the Government of Haiti to ensure the necessary political and security environment for the holding of free and fair elections in accordance with the schedule recently announced by the Provisional Electoral Council ;

Olara Otunnu .  
Finally , let me express our hope that the current open debate , focused on the Secretary-Generals report on conflict prevention , will foster the effective implementation of the recommendations contained therein and contribute to the goal of mobilizing the collective potential of the United Nations , its Member States and other international stakeholders in eliminating the threat of the emergence of armed conflicts .  
We also express , together with all other Arab States , our concern that Somalia become again a united , fully sovereign and independent State able to defend the vital interests of the Somali people , following the attempts by evil forces external and internal to tear apart the social and political fabric of its society and destroy its economic infrastructure .  
We likewise express our gratitude for the constructive position assumed by the new Government of Indonesia , for we are convinced that political dialogue between the principal players has proved to be an essential element in the progress that has been made .  
I recognize that it has been very difficult for non-members of the Council to be present here today , in view of the many other activities that are taking place and of the fact that our meeting had to start much later than anticipated , since we had to have earlier consultations , the consultations having proved extremely useful on the situation in Afghanistan .

People have noticed that after this incident occurred , political leaders in the United States showed a truculent and unreasonable attitude .  They were forced to express their regret to the Chinese side only after facing tremendous domestic and international pressure .

They publicly denied that they had made apologies to the Chinese side for their mistake , attempted to save face for having sent a letter to express sorry for the incident , and tried to create favorable opinions for the subsequent talks between the two sides .  
Accompanied by Hubei Governor Zhang Guoguang and other comrades , Luo Gan conducted investigation and study of the progress of the struggle to strike hard and put things in order from 11 to 15 May .

The Japanese prime minister 's brazenly paying his respects shows that Yakusuni Shrine is a symbol of aggressive war ; it has overtones of a public and official provocation , and indicates contempt for the people of those countries which suffered from that aggression .

When conducting a " strategic security tour " to Washington in April 1999 , he had extensive contacts with US congressmen and officials .

First of all , after Chen Shuibian 's " inauguration ceremony " on 20 May , US President Clinton wrote to express congratulations , and the government and public in the United States expressed " satisfaction " with Chen 's " inaugural speech " ; as a result Chen Shuibian became cocky and boasted that he had already reached the first standard of " satisfying the United States " set in his pre-office speeches .

"  
However , because some mass organizations threatened to surround the Legislative Yuan to express their anti-nuclear opinions and dismiss legislators who advocate the construction of nuclear power plant and because some legislators received threats , those legislators who support the nuclear power plant have to ask for personal protection .

This underlines the diversity and freedom which are so cherished in Hong Kong .  
15 .  We must point out that legislative interpretation is not equivalent to amendment .  Legislative interpretation must be faithful to the true legislative intent .

A satisfactory resolution of a situation is dependent upon close co-operation among team members .  In a large-scale or drawn-out negotiation , every team member - the negotiator , the strategist and the requirement officer - contributes equally to a successful negotiation .

During the talk , negotiators can then detect the ' weak points ' at the bottom of their hearts and talk them out of the attempt . "  
" Although it is inherent in the established civil service pay adjustment mechanism that some of the factors for determining the annual civil service pay adjustment may have a positive or negative impact on the size of the pay adjustment , the contractual employment arrangements between the Government and the vast majority of serving civil servants do not contain an express provision authorising the Government to reduce pay .  
They do n't just want to cover their bodies from the elements but also to express themselves in clothing . So as living standards increase , the textile industry is going to be more promising .

His words illustrate the type of thinking that lay behind the art of embroidery in ancient times . The use of celestial bodies and aspects of nature as designs for clothing reflects the harmony and fusion of man and nature . The flowery fowl is the brightly colored pheasant , the aquatic grasses express cleanliness , fire stands for illumination , and rice represents nourishment . Together the patterns are a symbol of the moral ideal of government , of concern over the destiny of mankind and compassion for the people .  
Despite its foreign origins in both physical reality and artistic representation , the pomegranate has been able to express even more of its charm in China .

From Peachwood Charms to New Year 's Scrolls : Ever since ancient times , everybody from high officials to lowly peddlers has used these scrolls to display their literary proficiency or express their yearnings for the future . The joyous red-scribed scrolls , their contents ranging across the spectrum of hopes and propitious wishes , never fail to get the spring season off to a rousing start .  
Sometimes I separate my use of black-and - white and color photographs : For external things , such as traditional street festivals , I use color , while I use black-and-white to express the unseen , what is hidden .  
Perhaps he concentrated too intently on the glottal , natural style of traditional singing . When receiving Western style vocal training at the Institute of Art , for a while Buhe could not sing at all . The contradictions made him ponder whether it was not impossible to express traditional songs using the abdominal singing techniques of the West .  
Also , Lisa 's grasp of the computer profession is so good that she can be very faithful and fluent , and she can translate concisely while maintaining the subtle innuendos and insinuating tones . " For example , she used a slang term in Taiwanese meaning " Is that real ? " to express the dubious veracity of an event . She described the end of a big computer exhibition as a " leftover meal . " Such succinct and incisive language causes readers to infuse their own imagination into the spaces of the text .  
Chen was Lai Ho 's companion in literature , and the two developed a close bond . They often interacted through poems and songs . The two of them joined together with a group of highly educated and politically aware writers to form the ' Ying Society . ' They composed poetry to express their concerns about current events and their sympathy with the lives of the masses , and they also used this to carry on the Chinese cultural tradition .  
Some people have questioned whether this position , exposed on all sides , does not have unfavorable fengshui .

China 's Minority Peoples For photographers anxious to free themselves from commonplace and boring subjects , China 's ethnic minorities , with their unique customs , rustic appearances , colorful , varied clothing , and rugged , lofty mountains as a backdrop , hold a glamor that is difficult to express .  
Overall , in terms of cross-strait relations , Chen sees Lee 's inaugural address as being a moderate and not especially innovative speech , but it certainly did express a considerably friendly attitude and reopened the door to discussions . However , people should not expect any sudden breakthrough in cross-strait relations , because Taiwan and the PRC are in a " cold peace " situation , and there is no need to rush things .  
Given that everyone is exposed to the mass media today , it is hard to ensure that the views and statements that senior citizens express about the past have not been guided by the current context .

Perhaps a passage by veteran reporter Ku Meng-jen , written as a commentary on Chong Shu 's novel The Chinese People , is particularly apropos : " From the Chinese laborers of the past to the immigrants of today , from the narrow alleys of Chinatown to present-day Silicon Valley , the peregrine steps of the overseas Chinese on the one hand reflect the changes of the times , and on the other hand express the growth of the Chinese people in foreign society .  
Kyle Cheng , the radio host , points out that the rap and hip hop dance music which the LA Boyz introduced to Taiwan had its origins within America 's street youth subculture .

Although its strivings have produced no small number of impressive works , many of the generation 's artists have yet to come completely into their prime-particularly in regard to manifesting the " full human potential " sought by traditional literati ink painting .

Kuo says that it is impossible to see how Diamond Stage had real respect for these low-status people . Most of the time in the " social concern segments " was spent in bantering among the hosts ( who got their start doing vulgar " dinner shows " ) and the guest star .

When one mentions the standard of English among schoolchildren and students in Hong Kong , professors at leading local academic institutions such as the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology ( HKUST ) generally express the view that it often leaves much to be desired .

Men and women together have built up and share a common image of a new man .  
According to museum employee Lu Yu-hua , many people express surprise that there should be an entire museum devoted solely to paper , but when you really think about it , there 's really nothing strange about it . When paper was first invented , the raw materials from which it was made differed from one region to the next . A single sheet of paper spoke volumes about local climates and vegetation ; its very existence enabled the spread of knowledge , and could record the history of an individual or an entire nation !  
She says that at the beginning their limbs were stiff and they were rather inhibited and unwilling to express themselves , and were always looking down at the floor . But as they gradually grew more practiced and skillful , they also learned to open up and display their emotions , and in this way their dancing became more and more confident and beautiful .  
I do n't have any plans to pose for a racy photo album . If I were in a movie and they wanted me to do a scene in the nude , it would n't be a problem . But I do n't think that a photo album would a way to express the ideal of male beauty . Maybe the Japanese pop idol Miyazawa Rie can express her own pure esthetic appeal through a photo album , but for a man to convey that kind of natural feeling through still photos is not an easy thing .  
To avoid people being denied the right to medical self-determination because they are unable to express their will , anyone over 20 years of age and of full capacity may make an " advance declaration " of their wishes ( also known as a " living will " ) , and may appoint a medical representative who is empowered to sign a consent form on their behalf if they are unable to express themselves .  
Of course we are well aware that statesmanship ca n't be learned just from a short series of classes , but we hope that by laying on these courses from our standpoint as a cultural and educational foundation , and not from a party political standpoint , we can make a start by using culture and education to purify people 's hearts . Because in fact a real political leader needs to speak from the heart and express his true hopes .  
They express their opinions and get to know each other . The online authors that publishing companies are focusing on are but a tiny fraction of the online population .

The body of literature represented therein is both vast and varied in format , and only a tiny bit of it can be reflected in the output of traditional publishers .  
Chu Ge noted that he strongly encouraged Lee to use the traditional Chinese medium of ink , because ink by nature is best suited to express abstract ideas . Lee , having never before painted a traditional ink painting , has proved even more capable than most of transcending concrete forms to let the ink freely play out in a way that characterizes his most recent series of compositions , " Language of Ink . "  
Ho Chun-jui , head of the Center for the Study of Sexualities at National Central University , analyzes the movie in terms of time , place and people thus : The gradual legitimization of homosexuality in Taiwanese culture has lessened the taboo against Lan Yu ; the two cool male protaganists not only show passion and warmth , but also pointedly express intimate tenderness , a breakthrough in the portrayal of the traditional male lead ; and the contradiction between love vs class background and tradition-told without leaving the parameters of a love story-all naturally please the audience .  
Its personnel and programs have made an outstanding contribution , earning the title " the quiet achievers . " The low-profile AVDRC specially organized the open day to express gratitude for the tremendous support that the host nation has provided .

Unlike the literati of the Southern and Northern dynasty ( 420-589 ) who emphasized classical allusions and symmetrical verses , Han Yu left the world of the classics and instead chose the middle and lower classes as his point of departure . He wrote about mundane things in artistic , truly beautiful writing , and yet managed to indirectly express grander thinking about the governance of the nation .  
Who can avoid the reach of multi-media consortiums , with their tremendous financial resources and influence ? They can take in politicians who are down on their luck ; and even those who want to get public exposure to express their own ideas end up surrendering to the media . The result is that no one-neither the idealistic politician nor the deep thinker-ends up staying true to personal principles .  
Huang Ming-che cut an impressive figure among his generation of young painters , the more so because through his engagement with Western masters close to his own sensibility , he continuously rediscovered where he needed to go . Without turning his back on his unique artistic qualities , Huang had the courage to accept other artists ' strong points . He gradually developed his own style and found new techniques to express it . His painting style evolved from Taiwanese localism to sentimentalism .  
At this , the TRA immediately ceased using the aluminum boxes , moving on to stainless steel ones .

For these reasons , many non-nuclear-weapon States continued to express strong preference for a multilateral , legally binding international accord , which would be equal in status to the obligations contained in the non-proliferation Treaty .  
The first concern is that the judges of the international criminal court will have made a public and solemn undertaking under article 14 to exercise their functions under the statute " impartially and conscientiously " and in fairness to this judicial oath a dissenting judge should perhaps be allowed to make his dissent known where the judgement does not express the unanimous opinion of the judges .  
At the outset of this statement , I should like to express our deepest sympathy to the delegation and Government of France and to the families of the two valiant and honourable members of the United Nations Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) whose valuable lives were cut short at such an early age by the merciless and cold-blooded actions of professional killers , whoever they may be .

However , instead of differentiating the list of relief available to those representatives , it was considered preferable to express those differences by including a wording in the article that would make it clear that , in granting relief under article 17 to a representative of a foreign non-main proceeding , the court had to be satisfied that the relief related to assets falling under the authority of that representative or that it concerned information required in the foreign non-main proceeding .

We also express our commitment to all the various tracks of the peace process without exception , with a view to guaranteeing Israel 's total withdrawal from all occupied Arab and Palestinian territories , including the Syrian Golan , southern Lebanon and the Beka'a valley , and respect by Israel for international law and for the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people , including its rights to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent State on its national territory , with Al-Quds as its capital .
