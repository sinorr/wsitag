The " Suite of Songs on the Morals of Military Men , " which was organized and created by the General Political Department , has rapidly become popular in military camps north and south of the great river , the frontiers , and islands , and officers and men have received education on our military 's fine traditions and the moral standards of military personnel in the art forms that they love .  
Shoko Asahara proclaimed himself to be " the sacred religious Emperor " and under him there are 21 " ministries and agencies " organized into east followers agency , west followers agency , intelligence ministry , defense agency , foreign affairs ministry , and so on .  He also drafted a so-called " the first draft basic law of the supreme truth country " and made himself the supreme ruler of the " supreme truth . "  
The " Falungong " cult organization has also made great efforts to employ the so-called " political elite and senior consultants , " nurture and plant trusted and backbone followers , and racked their brains to infiltrate the party and government organs , especially vital departments , so as to spy out confidential information of the party and the government .  Furthermore , they deployed a second echelon in a planned and organized manner in an attempt to avoid being cracked down on , and to wage long-term confrontation with the party and the government .  
A large number of facts can prove that this organization of " Falungong " is totally a cult organization opposing the government and the people .  They organized and incited a series of illegal activities , thus openly provoking the socialist country , democracy , and legal system , and endangering national security and social stability .  If they are allowed to wantonly wreak havoc , there will never be days of peace .  
Each area conscientiously organized the Party members and cadres , especially leading cadres and their family members and colleagues to watch the film , " Choosing Between Life and Death " .

Major and serious cases that cause serious harms and bad influence and which the people show strong reactions should be handled by designated departments , the system of responsibility for cracking down on cases should be implemented , and competent people should be organized to crack cases quickly .  
We must not be faint-hearted and hesitant in dealing with the handful of criminals who , with ulterior political motives , held fast to their anti-government , anti-social and anti-people stand , and organized and instigated deceived Falungong maniacs to openly stir up trouble , disrupt public order , and undermine social stability in their attempt to undermine the cause of socialist modernization .  We must deal a resolute blow to them and punish them severely in accordance with law , and must not leave any openings for future trouble .  
He added : Both sides made positive appraisals of the smooth development of their friendly cooperative relations in all fields in recent years .  They unanimously believe that there is great potential in Chinese-Italian relations , which also have bright prospects .  From now on , both sides should strengthen mutual visits between personnel , economic and trade cooperation , cultural exchanges , and cooperation in the judicial field , including making joint efforts in smashing organized crimes .  
They were shocked by and indignant at such an organized and planned scheme , claiming that this incident once again unmasked " Falungong 's " antihuman and antisocial essence of cruelly injuring or killing the people and trampling on human rights .  
I 've come to see more clearly the true nature of " Falungong " as an evil cult .  The fact that this horrifying incident took place in such a special place and at such a special time has fully shown that the incident , in which several people attempted to burn themselves to death , was an organized and premeditated activity .  
I suggest that while stepping up in-depth or meticulous education or transformation work , the government should hold higher the law as a sharp sword ; should more severely crack down on a small number of die-hard elements of " Falungong , " who have plotted or organized activities intended to create a disturbance ; and should firmly prevent such people from fanning the flames of disorder or sabotaging a situation of stability and unity , which we have built with hard efforts .  
Gu Xiulian , vice president of All-China Women 's Federation [ ACWF ] and first secretary of the ACWF Secretariat , stated : The latest incident , which took place on the Tiananmen Square when several people attempted to burn themselves to death , was an organized , premeditated , and plotted activity , which has made clearer the true nature of " Falungong " as an evil cult , which opposes mankind , society , and science .  
He openly defied the laws , organized and instigated besieging of party and government organs and mass media institutions , staged illegal demonstrations and rallies , continuously gathered his followers at Tiananmen Square to carry out trouble-making activities , seriously disrupted the public order and sabotaged social stability .  
In order to help the infatuates gradually stop being dependent on " Falungong " and master scientific ways of staying healthy , we arranged for medical staff and sports teachers to explain to them that healthy sports and recreational activities are the only things that would benefit physical and mental health .  We organized them to practice Taijiquan and fitness exercises ; conducted the activity of singing aloud revolutionary songs , such as " No Communist Party , No New China ; "  
According to the Public Security organs ' preliminary investigation , this incident of self-immolation was totally the result of Li Hongzhi 's poisoning , confusion , instigation , and mental manipulation of " Falungong " fanatics , and it was an organized , premeditated , and planned criminal activity undertaken with measured steps .  
The General Headquarters of Staff , the General Political Department , the General Logistics Department , the General Equipment Department , and all major units studied the concrete methods of education and made careful arrangements in connection with the conditions of the troops , organized theoretical workers to deeply analyze the anti-science , anti-human , anti-society , anti-government reactionary character of the " Falungong " evil cult and provided theoretical guidance to the education activities among the troops .  All units also dispatched elite forces to guide the troops to carry out education and implement the plans .

This was the case especially during the " 96-2 " exercise , which was staged under clear-cut stress involving units from different services and arms .

So far , nearly 300 suspects at large involved in major criminal corruption and bribery cases have fallen into the net of justice .

In step with the global trend to open up the television market , we consider that the Government 's role should be to create an open and competitive market to promote the development of the broadcasting industry .

The Paiwan and Rukai have no clans but rather a system of social classes , similar to the feudal system prevailing during the Chou dynasty ( c . 1066 B . C . to 221 B . C . ) . The Yamis are organized chiefly around " fishing groups . "

In the 1950s , Taiwan received a great deal of aspirations to escape from the post-war hardships and to catch up with advanced Western civilization , young artists organized the " Orient " and " May " art associations .

For example , just prior to the major provincial and municipal elections at the end of last year , Mary Tseng , secretary-general of the Wild Bird Society of Taipei , organized their semi-annual waterfowl festival in Kuantu .

This brought abortion into the realm of public debate , and the " right to choose " became a political issue .  
The songs of the Ami can be traced back to their fishing , farming , and hunting activities in the mountains and along the coast . In their tightly organized villages , through the annual harvest festival , each successive generation was trained and educated in cultural traditions , which is the main reason these songs have been carried forward .

One major problem that has come to light is the chaotic state of Taiwan 's financial system . The KMT government was forever being criticized for allowing the intrusion of politics into the financial arena-the collusion between big money , organized crime , and political forces that is referred to as " black and gold ruling in tandem . "  
Attempts were made to eradicate the influence of organized crime in politics during Lee Teng-hui 's presidency , but the party also needed votes and had to nurture local factions . As Wang points out : " Several ministers of finance were forced out of office for raising taxes . No wonder the public tends to regard the KMT as ' rich but uncouth , ' and as having allowed ' black and gold to rule in tandem . ' "  
The case has elicited the concern of human rights groups around the world . The London headquarters of Amnesty International , which describes the convictions as " the judicial ruling of an uncivilized nation , " has organized several support campaigns for the three men , and last May sent representatives to Taiwan , where they called a press conference and stated , " If Taiwan 's government intends to make human rights a trump card of its foreign policy , it should first grant clemency to the Hsichih trio .

Fourth , they established organized systems of religious practice . Examples are clerics such as Hui Neng , sixth patriarch of Chan Buddhism , Master Xian Shou , who founded the Huayan Sect in the Tang dynasty , and Master Zhi Zhe , who enabled the Tiantai Sect to spread far and wide .

Moreover , this incorrect usage is only gaining prevalence the more it is used .  
So that both citizens of Taiwan and foreigners studying Chinese here wo n't misunderstand and misuse the term " black gold , " which has long been properly used to describe iron , oil and coal ( as my research has demonstrated ) , I hope that instead of " sweeping away black gold " the government will " sweep away the corrupting influence in politics of money from organized crime and the wealthy . "  
Wu Cheng-chun , general manager of the LungYen Group , explains that his company 's funeral service is organized around a simple system , in contrast to the convoluted requirements of a traditional funeral .

" Being involved in a social movement taught me that , at their core , most social problems come down to the fundamental character of human beings .

Today , a century later , its namesake organization selects an annual chief organizer by casting for divination sticks ; this individual is then responsible for arranging the ceremony honoring Lu Ban .

During several specifically focused international conferences organized by the United Nations , an appeal has been made to the developed countries to fulfil their obligations to meet official development assistance targets and to help to create an international economic and political climate conducive to sustained economic growth in developing countries .

In 1993 , UNFPA organized a thematic evaluation of family planning services in eight countries to assess the quality of such services along six dimensions : choice of methods ; technical competence of service providers ; level of information and counselling available to clients ; nature of interpersonal relations between service providers and clients ; the presence of mechanisms within the programme to promote continued contraceptive use ; and the appropriateness and acceptability of services .  
That Department has since passed through successive phases of restructuring and is now organized to follow political developments worldwide , so that it can provide early warning of impending conflicts and analyse possibilities for preventive action by the United Nations , as well as for action to help resolve existing conflicts .  
Among these are chronic hunger , malnutrition , illicit drug problems , organized crime , corruption , foreign occupation , armed conflicts , illicit arms trafficking , terrorism , intolerance and incitement to racial , ethnic , religious and other hatreds , xenophobia , and endemic , communicable and chronic diseases .  
WMO also organized jointly with EPPO and NAPPO symposia and workshops to give practical training in the use of meteorological data in the fight against pest and diseases , in reducing the level of undesired chemicals and in improving the quality of agricultural produce .  
The Committee recognized that for the non-governmental groups to be organized , including through national or regional coalitions , and to be in a position to provide expert advice , it would be essential to ensure that they have effective access to the Committee 's agenda and to the time-limit established for the submission of written information .  
Recognizing that the growing threat of organized crime , with its highly destabilizing and corrupting influence on fundamental social , economic and political institutions , represents a challenge demanding increased and more effective international cooperation ,  
It included , among others , an effective exchange of operative data and information , joint actions in intercepting the organized international traffic routes and many seminars abroad , which Yugoslav experts used to brush up their knowledge in the field of the suppression of illicit traffic in narcotic drugs .  
Among these are chronic hunger , malnutrition , illicit drug problems , organized crime , corruption , foreign occupation , armed conflicts , illicit arms trafficking , terrorism , intolerance and incitement to racial , ethnic , religious and other hatred , xenophobia , and endemic , communicable and chronic diseases .  
For example , at an Expert Group Meeting , jointly organized by the Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development and UNDP in New York , on 14 and 15 December 1994 , it was proposed that a Development Watch should be established to assist decision makers , especially those at the national level , to understand the interaction among physical ( environmental ) , social and economic phenomena and the policy options these interactions suggest .  
While the principle of the severity of the offence is sound in view of the need to address the multitude of activities engaged in by organized transnational criminal groups , further elaboration is needed in the light of the differing national perceptions of the severity of individual offences .  
The recommendations covered several key issues , including the importance of crime prevention and criminal justice , individual and collective security and safety measures in Islamic society , the impact of transnational crime ( such as organized crime and illicit drug trafficking ) in the region , and future measures concerning regional and international collaboration against crime .  
The Fund also held several in-house workshops for members of UNFPA country support teams ( CST ) to enhance their technical skills ; organized a workshop for 14 senior officers from headquarters and the field to improve their management skills ; and organized two regional training courses for field staff to improve financial accountability and to facilitate accurate and transparent reporting of expenditures .  
The frequent appearance of corpses in the so-called " graveyard " bearing signs of torture and coups de grace , the fact that the victims are frequently common criminals , and the inability of the competent national agencies to locate the perpetrators , are characteristic of the modus operandi of the organized groups involved in " social cleansing " campaigns , which can hardly operate without the tolerance , complicity or direct participation of agents of the State .  
In addition to addressing these issues at a national level , the programmes also assist States in fighting transnational crime , including organized criminal activity , economic and environmental criminality and money-laundering .  
They included " Action against national and transnational economic and organized crime and the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment : national experiences and international cooperation " , which was considered in a plenary session , with a special session on corruption .  
Seminars and training programmes were to be organized on the prevention of crime in urban and other areas , and sound crime prevention strategies developed , capable of being adapted to local conditions , with particular reference to the approaches suggested at the relevant workshops held during the Ninth Congress .  
They call for the development of an empirical base of knowledge on the nature , dynamics and operations of new sophisticated and diversified forms of transnational organized , economic and environmental crime that pose a particular threat , and on their linkages with terrorist violence , corruption and money-laundering .  
More effective strategies must be devised against recalcitrant problems , such as rapidly escalating organized , economic and environmental crime , and action efforts pursued at multiple levels - international , regional , national and , with the trend towards decentralization , local as well .  
The rising toll of violence linked to civil strife , terrorism and ordinary street crime , and the price exacted by organized , economic and environmental criminality , have jeopardized some of the gains of development and undermined future prospects .  
The 142 States present at the World Ministerial Conference on Organized Crime proclaimed their political will and strong determination , as well as their unequivocal commitment , to ensure the full and expeditious implementation of the Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , reflecting the urgency and priority attention attached to action against organized transnational crime .  
Efforts had to take into account the current political situation and the ease with which organized criminal groups crossed borders and took advantage of efforts designed to bring countries closer together and increase the free movement of goods , capital , services and people .  
In their search for new opportunities and markets , organized criminal groups were ready to make sizeable investments in both equipment and human resources and were willing to bring their huge financial power to bear , in addition to using other more violent methods , for eliminating competition .  
The prospect of organized criminal groups infiltrating and attaining controlling interests in crucial sectors of the economies of developing countries and countries in transition had contributed to raising awareness and increasing concern among Governments , particularly at a time of joint efforts towards economic restructuring on the basis of free market principles .  
To implement their commitments in the fight against transnational organized crime , they established a group of senior experts , with a temporary mandate to look at existing arrangements for cooperation , both bilateral and multilateral , to identify significant gaps and options for improved coordination and to propose practical action to fill such gaps .  
However , while developed countries already possess the infrastructure and crucial knowledge required in mustering the necessary resources and maximizing their efficiency and effectiveness , developing countries and countries in transition are found in the very difficult position of easily being outpaced by organized criminal groups .  
In the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , States recognized , while acknowledging its global implications , that prevention and control of organized transnational crime must necessarily vary from State to State and region to region and be based upon improvements in national capabilities , increased knowledge and shared experiences about organized criminal groups .  
Further , Governments are alarmed by the increasing involvement of organized transnational crime in legitimate business , coupled with the need of organized criminal groups to find ways of laundering their illicit proceeds .  
While peer pressure in the context of an institutional framework is invaluable , the risk of misperceptions as to ultimate objectives and the ways to achieve them may be too great in view of the implications of organized transnational crime and the threat it poses to developed and developing countries alike .  
The threat posed to the internal security and stability of sovereign States , as well as to international security , by the dramatic increase of organized transnational crime in the past decade is growing and will continue to grow and become more menacing if concerted and decisive action on the part of the international community is delayed .  
While energies have to be focused and action planned in the best and most efficient manner , the ultimate goals of effectively preventing and controlling organized transnational crime in all its forms and dimensions , and arresting its expansion at both the national and international levels , should be guiding the relevant efforts and should constitute the yardstick against which success is to be assessed .  
In addition to examining the opportunity and impact of international instruments such as a convention or conventions against organized transnational crime , and an indication of the issues and elements to be covered therein , priority attention was given to improving reliable knowledge on the structure and dynamics of organized transnational crime , legislative and regulatory measures , and technical cooperation .  
The new responsibilities that Governments have to take on because of the escalation of organized transnational crime and the demand for global strategies to combat it , draw attention to the need for effective instruments , bearing in mind that what is most needed is a comprehensive , multi-layered approach to international cooperation in law enforcement and criminal justice in the fight against organized transnational crime .  
One of the major objectives of international cooperation must be to create greater harmonization in criminal justice systems , by improving the standards of countries with weaker criminal justice systems in general or by developing national legislation specifically directed against organized crime .  
However , in the presence of a strong political will and broad consensus , as evidenced by the priority attached to action against organized transnational crime and the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , it would be possible to ensure that the negotiation process does not result in a diluted document that falls short of establishing the provisions necessary for an effective response to transnational criminal organizations .  
The accumulation of theoretical knowledge has irreplaceable value for the purposes of educating younger generations and the public in general and for devising strategies and developing measures to counter the corrupting effects of organized crime on societal values .  
Academic institutions and professional associations have a major role to play in accumulating theoretical knowledge on organized transnational crime and in disseminating this knowledge , in close cooperation with governmental agencies and the education system , as well as in concert with the media , non-governmental organizations and the private sector .  
Developed countries are generally in a position to devote the necessary resources for acquiring the body of both theoretical and practical knowledge that is required for the effective prevention and control of organized transnational crime and , as discussed earlier , considerable efforts in that direction are in progress .  
Provision of the information and materials requested by the Secretary-General pursuant to Economic and Social Council resolution 1995 / 11 would permit the undertaking of a comprehensive and comparative study of the situation in the various regions of the world , thus contributing to the achievement of the goal of improving reliable knowledge on organized transnational crime , its structure and dynamics .  
Through a global assessment of the transnational organized crime situation , the study would seek to contribute to a better understanding of the problems arising from differences that exist or emerge among various countries in the perception and evaluation of organized transnational crime , thus leading to the gradual development of a common perception of the phenomenon , and a global strategy for more effective international cooperation .  
It should also consider conditions that are conducive to the rise and growth of criminal organizations , such as social , economic and political factors , structural characteristics of organized crime , as well as organizational shortcomings in the control agencies .  
The results of the study would also be used for the development of special programmes , courses and curriculums for academic institutions , to ensure that theoretical knowledge is increased , improved and disseminated , and to create the basis for long-term and consistent action against organized transnational crime .  
In particular , it was recommended that States examine the experience of countries that have confronted organized crime and the intelligence derived from the analysis of its structures and criminal activities , as useful guiding principles concerning which substantive , procedural and regulatory legislation and organizational structures are necessary to combat the phenomenon .  
In the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , States expressed the wish to strengthen and enhance the capability of States , as well as the United Nations and other relevant global and regional organizations , to achieve more effective international cooperation against organized transnational crime , in relation , inter alia , to closer alignment of legislative texts concerning organized crime .  
The realization at the political and decision-making level of the actual magnitude and complexity of organized transnational crime may serve as a basis for elaborating improved forms of international cooperation , drawing on the pool of knowledge and experience in the scientific community .  
In the area of substantive legislation , efforts against organized transnational crime would be considerably strengthened through the introduction of reforms focused on criminalization of participation in a criminal organization , criminalization of conspiracy or similar forms of inchoate offences , prohibition of laundering of criminal proceeds , and sanctions and other measures , such as the confiscation of illicit proceeds , aimed at defeating the economic power of criminal organizations .  
While acknowledging that the problems covered by the mandate are multidimensional , ranging from structural or systemic to individual and less organized incursions against children , for which no single solution will ever be possible , the report nevertheless offers recommendations as to the first steps of a long , arduous journey .  
NULLWithin the framework of the ILO / ALO joint programme agreed upon at the beginning of 1994 , five Arab regional seminars / expert group meetings were organized on the following topics : employment and labour market policies ; small enterprises development ( for employers ' organizations ) ; employment and labour market programmes in the context of sustainable human development ; and Arab and international labour standards .  
When these warnings were coupled with the timely implementation of previously organized preparedness activities , more than 350,000 people were spared personal physical harm from the largest explosive volcanic eruption of the twentieth century .  
Depending on the nature of the hazard , the location of vulnerable people and assets , and designated responsibilities for action , elements of warning systems may be organized and implemented at local , national , regional or international levels .  
" Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
NULLAlthough no complaints were received about violations directly linked to trade union activities during the period in question , complaints continued to be received of violations of the right to swift and effective justice , involving leaders or workers who were subjected to threats , dismissed or subjected to reprisals because they organized themselves into trade unions or asserted their interests as workers .  
The Council considered the theme of coordinated follow-up by the United Nations system and the implementation of the results of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields , during the coordination segment of its substantive session of 1995 .  
The Administrative Committee on Coordination concurred with the proposal that coordinated support for country-level action should be organized , in the first instance , around three interrelated themes : ( a ) the enabling environment for social and economic development ; ( b ) employment and sustainable livelihoods ; and ( c ) basic social services for all .  
In order to provide coordinated support to the country-level follow-up , ACC agreed that such action be organized , in the first instance , around three inter-related themes : ( a ) the enabling environment for social and economic development ; ( b ) employment and sustainable livelihoods ; and ( c ) basic social services for all .  
In his report to the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session , the Secretary-General noted that representation of ACC members was at the senior official level , that this arrangement had led to a substantive dialogue on coordination issues of mutual interest and that he considered that , should the institution of joint meetings continue to be maintained , they should be organized in the future along similar lines ( A / 48 / 639 , para .  NULL  
The coordination of human rights activities throughout the United Nations system was the subject of debate in the framework of the coordination segment of the Economic and Social Council ( 26-30 June 1995 ) which had on its agenda coordinated follow-up by the United Nations system and implementation of the results of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields . 
FAO provided high quality seed of improved varieties and fertilizer , fruit trees and root stock , assisted in introducing judicious use of pesticide through training and extension activities , trained basic veterinary workers and organized vaccination campaigns against infectious diseases of animals .  
Given current financial constraints and the fact that a limited number of persons had access to the seminars organized under the Programme , audiovisual tapes on various subjects of international law were a convenient tool to place at the disposal of educational institutions of States , especially developing States .  
The Committee also decided to strengthen coordinated support for follow-up action at the country level , through inter-agency task forces organized around three interrelated themes : ( a ) the enabling environment for social and economic development ; ( b ) employment and sustainable livelihoods ; and ( c ) basic social services for all .  
Regional meetings to prepare for the mid-term global review were organized by the relevant United Nations regional commissions in accordance with paragraph 4 ( c ) of General Assembly resolution 49 / 98 , and the substantive inputs provided through the preparatory process at this level were transmitted to the Donor-Recipient Meeting in May-June 1995 and to the High-level Intergovernmental Meeting itself . 
Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
In order to pre-empt drastic measures by the countries of asylum and avoid the chaos and probable violence that massive forced repatriation would trigger inside Rwanda , UNHCR is encouraging large-scale organized voluntary repatriation .  
Mr . TRAORE ( Guinea ) said that the five major conferences organized by the United Nations in recent years on questions relating to social development and the conference on human settlements to be held in Istanbul bore witness to the renewed interest and intensive mobilization of the international community in connection with those issues .  
Also decides that the field-level committees organized by the United Nations system country team , which were established in accordance with paragraph 40 of General Assembly resolution 47 / 199 , should review substantive activities - including draft country programmes , sectoral programmes and projects - prior to their approval by individual organizations , and should exchange experience acquired , on the understanding that the result of the work of the review committee should be submitted to national Governments for final approval through the national focal points ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit further recommendations for enhancing the dialogue , taking into consideration the agreed conclusions of the Economic and Social Council on coordinated follow-up by the United Nations system and implementation of the results of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields , [ 3 ] / the outcome of the ongoing discussions in the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group on an Agenda for Development , and on restructuring and revitalization of the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields ;  
Also decides that the field-level committees organized by the United Nations system country team , which were established in accordance with paragraph 40 of General Assembly resolution 47 / 199 , should review substantive activities - including draft country programmes , sectoral programmes and projects - prior to their approval by individual organizations , and should exchange experience acquired , on the understanding that the result of the work of the review committee should be submitted to national Governments for final approval through the national focal points ;

it was true that the staff representatives had contacted the external employers to dissuade them from participating in a badly organized survey , at the same time they had informed the employers that an appeal had already been launched and that any unfavourable results would lead to an additional appeal , during the course of which the data and results would have to be discussed , thereby laying any anomaly open to public scrutiny .  
Faced with the rapid internationalization of organized crime and the rise in urban crime , violent crime and juvenile delinquency , every country was concerned with safety , which was essential for the sustained development of society .  
It is plain to see that the United States authorities were fully aware of the existence of a group organized in United States territory , in possession of aeroplanes and engaged in carrying out activities not in line with the legal provision of international air service , using these aeroplanes with clearly provocative purposes , failing to recognize Cuban sovereignty and ignoring the very regulations of the State where those aeroplanes were registered and where the licences to fly them were issued to their pilots .  
The international community , which is still plagued by persistent violence , organized crime , drugs and terrorism , must translate these recommendations into a reality that will guarantee equitable economic and social development and the free flow of trade between the developed and the developing countries .  
With regard to human rights and fundamental freedoms , I would underline the specific , dynamic and publicly visible results of some recent United Nations decisions , such as the establishment of a High Commissioner for Human Rights , the establishment and effective functioning of International Tribunals to prosecute and judge persons accused of serious violations of human rights in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda , and measures taken , or scheduled to be taken , in combating terrorism and organized crime .  
The consolidation of democracy and the construction of a State based on the rule of law and respect for human rights are positive results of the activities of the international community , as reflected in the resolutions of the United Nations and its specialized agencies as well as in the decisions and recommendations handed down by several conferences organized under United Nations auspices or with its support . 
The sixth and last is the growing menace of organized criminal gangs purveying terror , deadly weapons , illicit drugs , indentured labour , and the bodies of our women and children across international borders .  
Joint action in the field of crime prevention and the elimination of international terrorism envisages closer cooperation between central , regional and border authorities through efficient communications and exchange of information ; a commitment to accede to all relevant international conventions that prevent and punish international crime and terrorism ; joining and participation in specialized regional forums for discussing the problems of illicit drug-trafficking , organized crime and regional anti-terrorist cooperation ; and the elaboration of a regional programme to combat organized crime .  
Since the beginning of this decade the United Nations has initiated and organized a number of world summit conferences on a set of global issues ranging from environment to social development , from population to human rights , from women to children and coming up we have the World Food Summit , the aim of which is to find and implement coordinated measures at all levels national , regional , and international to solve problems of importance for the future of all nations .  
The various summits that it has organized in recent years , coupled with its numerous activities covering the entire spectrum of political , social and economic spheres , in all corners of the world , is testimony to the critical role of the United Nations in resolving the national and international problems facing mankind .  
In the meantime , we are pleased that the five major international summits organized by the United Nations , ranging from the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 to Habitat II in Istanbul earlier this year , have proved to be useful in enabling Member States to focus on the various aspects of development and to cultivate a common vision and a comprehensive strategy for cooperation among themselves .  
At the conclusion of the series of high-level world Conferences organized under the auspices of the United Nations in the course of the 1990s , we noted that their common denominator was the promotion of economic and social justice , with the fundamental objective of approaching the structural causes of poverty in a concerted manner .  
Due to our own painful past experiences , my delegation also commends the ongoing efforts of the Department of Public Information in encouraging the development of a free and responsible press as an essential element for effective democratization through its series of regional seminars , organized in cooperation with the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) , and supported by UNDP , on promoting pluralistic and independent media .  
The international community is faced with the growing threat arising from seemingly unstoppable manifestations of transnational organized crime and international terrorism , which menace both the material and institutional foundations of our societies .  
Poland believes , therefore , that the time has come to make a concerted international effort to agree on , and accede to a comprehensive legal instrument : a convention designed to enhance cooperation between States and facilitate the work of law enforcement agencies in fighting transnational organized crime .  
It should be noted that meetings of experts or decision makers and workshops organized within the United Nations system also provide opportunities to exchange updated technological or policy-related information that is vital in elaborating regional or global strategies for social and economic development with the use of remote sensing technologies .  
Decide to combine their efforts to establish effective legal and judicial cooperation in the prevention of crime , especially transnational and organized crime , and the strengthening of criminal justice systems by developing and promoting international instruments pertaining to criminal justice , such as agreements concerning trafficking in women and children , genocide , war crimes , terrorism and drug-related offences .  
The information base will be organized to identify key objectives of sustainable consumption and production and to report on broad strategies adopted to achieve them , specific characteristics and implementation challenges presented by different economic sectors and the policies and actions adopted by Governments and other major actors to address them .  
The coordination of human rights activities throughout the United Nations system was the subject of debate in the framework of the coordination segment of the Economic and Social Council ( 26-30 June 1995 ) which had on its agenda coordinated follow-up by the United Nations system and implementation of the results of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields . 
To establish or strengthen operational coordination machinery for the competent institutions so as to increase the effectiveness of national and regional efforts to combat crime and all threats to democratic security necessitating the use of military , security or civilian police forces , such as terrorism , illicit arms trafficking , drug trafficking and organized crime ;  
In improving natural and human-made disaster prevention , preparedness , mitigation and response , Governments at the appropriate level , including local authorities , and in close consultation and cooperation with such entities as insurance companies , non-governmental organizations , community-based organizations , organized communities , the academic , health and scientific community , should :  
[ Civil , ethnic and religious strife , nuclear armament , armed conflicts , alien and colonial domination , foreign occupation , international economic imbalance , coercive economic measures , poverty , organized crime , and terrorism in all its forms are destructive to sustainable human settlements development and should therefore be renounced by all States . ]  
Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
Also decides that the field-level committees organized by the United Nations system country team , which were established in accordance with paragraph 40 of General Assembly resolution 47 / 199 , should review substantive activities - including draft country programmes , sectoral programmes and projects - prior to their approval by individual organizations , and should exchange experience acquired , on the understanding that the result of the work of the review committee should be submitted to national Governments for final approval through the national focal points ;  
The Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development of the United Nations Secretariat organized a meeting of the Expert Group on the Identification of Principles of International Law for Sustainable Development , within the framework established by the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development 5 / and Agenda 21 , to identify basic principles of international law for sustainable development , consider possible classifications of such principles , and assess their potential practical implications in a legal context , including their role in the interpretation and application of existing international law in the field .  
Support United Nations development efforts by substantially increasing the resources for operational activities on a predictable , continuous and assured basis commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries as stated in General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 of 22 December 1992 and 48 / 162 of 20 December 1993 , while giving particular consideration to the special needs of LDCs as underlined in the programmes of action of major United Nations conferences organized since 1990 ;  
The United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) , UNEP and the United Nations Institute for Training and Research ( UNITAR ) organized their second training course on environmental law and policy ( March / April 1995 ) , designed to familiarize 30 government lawyers and officials from all geographical regions with the provisions of major environmental instruments , and to compose national legislative strategies for implementing relevant conventions .  
In the same resolution , the Council requested the Secretary-General to submit to Member States for their consideration at the fifth session of the Commission a proposal on the creation of a central repository for existing legislative and regulatory measures and information on organizational structures designed to combat organized transnational crime .  
As may be seen , the United States authorities were perfectly aware of the existence of a group organized in the territory of the United States , equipped with aircraft and involved in carrying out activities inconsistent with the provision of international air services , which uses those aircraft for patently political purposes , disregarding Cuban sovereignty and also ignoring the regulations of the very State in which those aircraft are registered and where its pilots had obtained licences to operate them .  
Concerning cooperation in activities directed against organized crime , particularly crime related to illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , the Commission requested Member States to implement the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan against Organized Transnational Crime , [ 1 ] adopted by the World Ministerial Conference on Organized Transnational Crime held at Naples , Italy , from 21 to 23 November 1994 , and subsequently approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 49 / 159 of 23 December 1994 .  
The Council recognized that it continued to be a widespread international activity frequently involving highly organized international syndicates that trafficked in human cargo without regard to the dangerous and inhumane conditions to which they were subjected , and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards .  
It reported that national action to combat organized crime and the illegal movement of persons across international frontiers fell into three categories : ( a ) legislative measures , which included prohibition and provided for imposition of criminal penalties for involvement in such activities ; ( b ) administrative measures , which included the establishment of agencies to deal with such activities , as well as the provision of appropriate training to enhance efficiency ; and ( c ) technical measures , which included preventive and investigative action .  
Given the complexity of the issues involved and the substantial role played by transnational organized crime in global criminal activity , international cooperation , particularly in trans-border law enforcement , is crucial , and measures need to be specified and applied by all concerned .  
In this field , the Division and UNDCP are currently finalizing a joint project proposal for a global project on money-laundering , aiming at the development of the basic legal and institutional framework for more efficient response to transnational organized crime and illicit money traffic .  
As a result of discussions held at the twelfth meeting of the Group of Experts on Public Administration and Finance , organized by the Department for Development Support and Management Services , in New York , in August 1995 , it was recommended that consideration should be given to establishing training programmes addressed to the most senior levels of the civil service at national , subregional or regional levels to improve the capacity of government to deal with emerging issues of civil society for the revitalization of civil services .  
Ministers and other delegates reported on what they had learned about methods of dealing with organized transnational crime , and formulated a declaration on the subject that was to be implemented in part by two region-wide technical cooperation projects .  
The recipients , selected among 106 nominees from Africa , Asia , Latin America and the Caribbean , eastern Europe and the CIS , focused their work on a wide range of topics , such as illegal arms and drug trafficking , money-laundering , organized crime , reform of the correctional system , juvenile delinquency , computerization of criminal justice information and crime prevention .  
The seminar , which will take place at Bishkek , Kyrgyzstan , from 10 to 12 June 1996 , will deal with the following issues : national reports on drugs and organized crime , including a review of existing legislative and institutional frameworks for prevention and control ; impact of drugs and organized crime on security , democracy and economic reform ; prevention and control of corruption ; money-laundering ; legal and institutional reform ; and regional and international cooperation : conclusions and recommendations .  
56 In view of the renewed discussion of the problem of transnational organized crime at the summit of the seven major industrialized countries ( Group of Seven ) , held at Halifax , Nova Scotia , Canada , the Division would be ready to cooperate with the established group of senior experts in identifying significant gaps and options for improved coordination and to propose practical action to fill such gaps .  
One successor State reported that it adhered to all international treaties , and made proposals to the police of other countries to sign new bilateral agreements , particularly on cooperation in combating all types of transnational crime , such as organized crime , drug trafficking and economic and financial crime .  
Spanish legislation laid down very useful additional measures for cases in which the offences were committed by organized gangs , as well as increasing the penalty imposed , such as the dissolution of the organization , closure of its premises , temporary suspension of its activities and professional disqualification of its members .  
Deregulation processes , new technologies , advancements in telecommunications and the creation of expanded economic spaces and market liberalization have had major implications on the development process , and have induced sizable productivity increases and new opportunities for profits , not only for the legal economy , but also , for organized transnational crime , which coexisted with , and benefited by , the legal economy .  
In the same resolution , the Council requested the Secretary-General to submit to Member States for their consideration at the fifth session of the Commission a proposal on the creation of a central repository for existing legislative and regulatory measures and information on organizational structures designed to combat organized transnational crime , taking into account the capabilities of the United Nations Crime and Justice Information Network .  
Part of the problem for the international community in trying to deal with organized transnational crime is that there is no single organizational or behavioural paradigm that provides a constant and accessible target .  
In the field of labour a major method is racketeering , a term used to describe a variety of tactics such as engaging in fraudulent deals or extortion through intimidation and blackmail or the abuse of legitimate positions for illegitimate ends , as in the case of businessmen or labour union and government officials .  In the field of vice , organized crime engages in trafficking in women , which involves international prostitution and sexual slavery .  
Canada has reported that the five major groupings of criminal organizations operating in the country are outlaw motorcycle groups and Aboriginal , Asian , eastern European and Italian organized crime groups , while there is evidence that Colombian drug cartels and the Jamaican " posses " are also active . 
In a confidential assessment completed by the Australian Federal Police , it was noted that Italian organized criminal organizations had penetrated a number of government and non-government agencies and at least one political party and had entrenched themselves in legitimate business to give themselves an air of respectability . 7 Even when they have not achieved this level of penetration , transplanted criminal organizations can still pose formidable challenges to law enforcement , as Chinese organized criminal organizations seem to be doing in South Africa and Russian organized criminal organizations are doing throughout much of Europe . 
38 Discussions about action against organized transnational crime often assume , sometimes implicitly , that if only Governments devoted more efforts and resources at the national level and increased cooperation at the bilateral level , they could make considerable inroads against organized transnational crime .  
National successes , such as the arrest of the leaders of the Cali cartel , and the priority attention given to action against organized transnational crime by world leaders on numerous occasions , including during the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , as well as the increasing willingness of the international community to place corruption under public scrutiny , are all encouraging developments .  
47 The central theme in all the information provided by States on this subject is the need to further enhance international cooperation which , if integrated with national efforts , will form a comprehensive strategy against organized transnational crime .  
48 Argentina has pointed out the merits of common regional strategies and measures against organized transnational crime , while Australia , Canada , Philippines , Republic of Korea and Turkey have drawn attention to the growing number of their bilateral agreements on extradition and mutual assistance in criminal matters .  
51 The response by Australia to the threat of organized crime has developed into a comprehensive set of measures representing a " whole-system " approach , whose principal features include the creation of a specialized agency , emphasis on cooperation and coordination between the different levels of government and between law enforcement agencies , legislation targeting key aspects of organized crime , and a strategic approach to the problem , based on high-quality strategic intelligence and assessments .  
Cuban legislation has made association with criminal intent an offence and has proscribed as punishable offences those types of behaviour associated with the most common forms of organized transnational crime , but has made no provision for controlled deliveries and electronic surveillance .  
Argentina hopes that the members of the international community will deploy the necessary efforts and resources to make it possible , within a reasonable time , to embody in a general convention the political commitments of countries to combat this form of crime and to ensure mutual cooperation to that end .  The conclusion of a general convention would afford the international community a single , efficient and effective instrument for responding suitably to the activities and manifestations of organized transnational crime .  
Since the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan have made a strong statement on behalf of the world community and have already drawn attention to this pressing issue , the focus should be on implementation and development of other practical measures and instruments to combat organized transnational crime .  NULLIn the view of Cuba , in order to combat organized transnational crime it is not enough to merely establish or even ratify various regional or international instruments .  
Italy has expressed its conviction that , in the face of expanding organized transnational crime and the effects of such expansion on global financial systems , the international community should develop an organized and systematized global response .  The innovative aspect of the World Ministerial Conference held at Naples was its emphasis on a global approach to organized transnational crime regardless of its manifestations .  
Italy is of the opinion that the effectiveness of the implementation of the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan will be maximized if , while advancing the process of elaborating a convention or conventions against organized transnational crime , a group of highly qualified national experts develop specific recommendations , which could be immediately implemented at the national level .  
Japan is of the view that , although it is necessary to consider the formulation of extensive and comprehensive measures , including the preparation of legal norms , in order to standardize the systems of Member States against organized crime , it hardly appears that there is currently an adequate common understanding among Member States regarding the actual pattern of illegal activity in question .  
However , in the absence of a general framework or model for international cooperation against organized transnational crime and in view of the diversity of legal systems , as well as the variety of the legislative agenda of countries , while desirable , it might not be appropriate and effective at present to effect world cooperation through such an international convention .  
Meeting the challenge requires the allocation of commensurate resources by the international community and the maintenance of a strong collective political will , keeping in mind that no State can afford to be complacent in responding to organized transnational crime .  
The Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , complemented by the action already taken by the Commission at its fourth session , have set in motion a process of increased awareness of the threat posed by organized transnational crime and of the need for urgent action at the national and international levels .  
Such a programme might include comparative studies of the situation of organized transnational crime around the world and the establishment and maintenance of a central repository for information on legislation , regulatory measures , organizational structures designed to prevent and control organized transnational crime , and bilateral and multilateral cooperation arrangements .  
38 The Holy See suggested that the Congress should focus on the development of new international legal instruments and forms of international jurisdiction to combat transnational crime linked to : speculative financial transactions severely harming the economy of one or more States ; activities , also undertaken by private persons , provoking very severe harm to the environment of other States ; extensive terrorism resulting from organized transnational crime ; and the role of education in combating violence and organized criminality .  
The Branch has also issued in response to new legislative enactments , additional reports on the review of priority themes , in accordance with Commission resolution 1 / 1 on strategic management ; action against national and transnational economic and organized crime , and the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment ; and capital punishment and implementation of the safeguards guaranteeing the protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty .  
The Copenhagen Programme of Action provides a rich source of ideas and practical suggestions that might constitute elements of effective national strategies that would command the required political support at national level , in full recognition of both the diversity of country situations and the need for coherent , organized efforts , with a clear purpose . 
An important policy question in many countries concerns the future role of different forms of community-initiated programmes , particularly their relationship with established , organized voluntary or charitable organizations , their role in delivering publicly financed services , and , on the one hand , the compatibility of their advocacy role in support of the poor and disadvantaged , and on the other , their role as partners in developing and implementing public policy . 
In this area , special attention must be paid to the challenges inherent in improving the quality of services and strengthening social integration through the organized participation of civil society in the formulation of policies and programmes and in control over their management .  
In accordance with General Assembly resolution 45 / 264 and Council decision 1996 / 203 , the coordination segment of the Council should also be devoted to the consideration of the implementation of the agreed conclusions on the theme of the 1995 coordination segment of the Council relating to the coordinated follow-up by the United Nations system and implementation of the results of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields .

ESCAP and ECLAC have agreed to cooperate in an interregional project , developed by UNCTAD and funded by UNDP , in which the two commissions will undertake studies on the prospects and potential for mutual trade and investment cooperation among their concerned members which will provide the basis for a ministerial meeting of those countries , to be organized by UNCTAD . 
Contacts , coordination and cooperation among these bodies should be encouraged .  In particular , it is of fundamental importance that all existing technical , bilateral and multilateral activities involving technical cooperation be well focused and that the means for coordinating such activities be studied in order to avoid overlapping " ( item 6 of the provisional agenda , entitled " Most effective forms of international cooperation for the prevention and control of organized transnational crime at the investigative , prosecutorial and judicial levels " ) ( E / CONF . 88 / 4 , para .

In Brazil , for example , the National Confederation of Health-care Cooperatives ( Unimed do Brasil ) has grown from a single cooperative set up in 1967 to a business complex now comprising 304 provider-owned health cooperatives , many owning hospitals , organized in 17 State-level networks , and a national holding company that owns subsidiaries in insurance and provides bulk purchasing and common services for members ' hospitals and clinics ; data management and communications ; and training , research and development .  
Recent years have witnessed a wave of democratization at the national level , as an increasing number of countries have adopted multi-party systems , organized free and fair elections and begun the movement towards more open , more participatory societies , frequently with the requested electoral assistance of the United Nations .  
In the light of growing crime worldwide , the opening of the discussion during the coming session of the General Assembly on the elaboration of the convention would contribute greatly to the global struggle against the highly dangerous phenomenon of organized transnational crime and by the same token would permit Member States to concentrate their efforts on the conclusion of this important international instrument .  
The objectives of the review were to determine whether the management structure of the civilian component was appropriate in providing the necessary support service to UNPF , to assess the adequacy of management systems and internal controls and to ascertain whether the use of United Nations resources ( human , physical and financial ) was adequately planned , organized , directed and monitored , and whether value for money was achieved .

If steps are not taken to curb the fighting , then the current situation in the West Bank , which has turned into a grim confrontation between organized forces , may do immeasurable damage to the already shaky efforts for a just , lasting and comprehensive peace in the region .  
Regarding organized crime , a number of specific measures had been taken that responded to part II of Congress resolution 1 , 1 / dealing with action against transnational and organized crime , particularly at the regional level , by updating domestic legislation in the area of money laundering , extradition and mutual assistance ; establishing separate units to deal with organized crime and improving legislation on environmental protection .  
The Secretary-General concluded that , given the complexity of the issues involved and the substantial role played by transnational organized crime in global criminal activity , international cooperation , particularly in trans-border law enforcement , was crucial , and measures needed to be specified and applied by all concerned .  
The Secretary-General submitted to the Commission a report that provided an overview of the differences and similarities between transnational organized crime and terrorist crimes , as well as a summary of the responses received from States . 8 / The report concluded that , while the links between transnational organized crime and terrorist crimes are usually more circumstantial than institutional , both forms of crime present formidable challenges to the international community and require improved international cooperation .  
Especially fruitful cooperation was established with the Agency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation , which funded and organized the printing and dissemination of additional copies of the Compendium of United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice in French , as well as the translation into French of the Basic Training Manual for Correctional Workers , and provided financial support also for the implementation of a comprehensive project in assistance to the criminal justice system for Burkina Faso , which was undertaken in March 1996 .  
While the Bureau agreed that the rules of procedure needed to be fully respected and that specific decisions on the participation of major groups in the session would be taken by the General Assembly , it also agreed that a number of activities could be organized during the special session with a view to ensuring effective input of major groups and their active inter-action with government representatives .  
Concerned with the growing threat of organized crime , including the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , money laundering , illicit traffic in arms , nuclear material and explosive devices , motor vehicles , objects of arts ,  
Aware that organized crime , in its national and transnational dimensions , destabilizes international relations , including interregional , regional , subregional and bilateral cooperation , by exerting influence on politics , the media , public administration , judicial authorities and the economy by establishing commercial or business-like structures ,  
The Institute was encouraged by an increased willingness of African States to base their policy decisions with regard to crime prevention and criminal justice issues on appropriate , adequate , valid and reliable data , as has been indicated by several participants of training activities organized by the Institute . The Institute will continue to undertake advisory missions and train national officials towards establishing appropriate structures and systems for the regular production of the required crime data .  
A renewed commitment by all involved in organized society , political parties , religious groups , communal groups , law enforcement agencies , to eschew resort to criminal violence in pursuit of their objectives needs to be declared and implemented .

It is pertinent to note that during the period under review , the secretariat of the AALCC organized , within the framework of the Consultative Committee at its thirty-fifth session , held in March 1996 in Manila , a special meeting on the proposed establishment of an international criminal court , which furnished a forum for an exchange of views on the draft statute prepared by the International Law Commission on that proposed international criminal court . 
Requests the Secretary-General to submit further recommendations for enhancing the dialogue , taking into consideration the agreed conclusions of the Economic and Social Council on coordinated follow-up by the United Nations system and implementation of the results of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields , and the outcome of the ongoing discussions in the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group on an Agenda for Development ;  
The series of major international conferences organized under the auspices of the United Nations since 1990 had created broad public awareness of the existence of global problems and of the fact that their solution required joint efforts by States and by all of the world 's inhabitants .  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit further recommendations for enhancing the dialogue , taking into consideration the agreed conclusions of the Economic and Social Council on coordinated follow-up by the United Nations system and implementation of the results of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields , and the outcome of the ongoing discussions in the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group on an Agenda for Development ;

Hungary supported any substantive joint international initiatives , convinced that only a universal effort coordinated by the United Nations through its crime-prevention mechanisms could combat transnational organized crime .  
Deeply concerned about the rising level of crime in many parts of the world , jeopardizing political stability and the internal and external security of States , his country supported the draft United Nations framework convention against organized crime submitted by Poland ( A / C . 3 / 51 / 7 ) , and other relevant initiatives . 
The unprecedented globalization and diversification of organized transnational crime constituted a major threat to security , social and economic stability and the democratic development of States .  
In that context , she felt it was important that the terms " organized " and " transnational " crime should not be used to describe controversial political ideas , but restricted to agreed social and legal dimensions .  
While today 's major challenges are undeniably global in character , it is at the local level where their impact is felt most directly , which is why local authorities , such as mayors and metropolitan officials , have become notably more active on global issues and , in some cases , collectively organized across countries on matters of common concern .  
We therefore organized national workshops and two regional workshops to discuss internal problems , to collect input from the persons directly concerned , including those responsible for violations and the victims and those in charge of the administration of justice and those to whom it is administered , to publicize the progress of the research and to make the final results known .  
The participating States reached agreements concerning their future actions in various fields of regional cooperation , such as political cooperation ; stability and development of good-neighbourly relations ; economic cooperation in fields of mutual interest ; joint actions for environmental protection ; promotion of humanitarian , social and cultural cooperation ; cooperation in law enforcement , justice and combating organized crime , terrorism , drugs and arms trafficking .

The level of electoral participation is the result of many different social and political factors , including the impact of civil institutions on the daily lives of Guatemalans , the capacity of political parties to fulfil people 's expectations , the degree of organized participation by citizens in social and political life and their level of civic education , all of which are elements which the package of peace agreements already signed seeks to strengthen .  The electoral process is marred by specific shortcomings which impede the effective enjoyment of the right to vote .  
He noted that humanitarian law initially had been developed in response to ordinary international armed conflicts wherein organized regular armies faced each other , and the content of humanitarian law clearly reflected its origin .  
The Plan includes clear objectives , target audience ( organized and unorganized elements of society ) , strategies ( trainers training , organization of networks , integration of human rights in all educational curricula , utilization of village-level officials to reach out to the community level , promotional campaigns including artistic and cultural activities , development of monitoring and evaluation systems , etc . ) and programmes , including the creation of a human rights training , documentation and research centre ( the Human Rights Academy ) .  
Despite the insecurity and precarious balance of terror that have marked three years of civil war in Burundi , it still has an organized Government that is capable of acting , unlike other countries torn apart by internal conflicts .  
Aspects of organized crime , violence against women and violence in the society , in particular as evident in the alarming increase in xenophobic and racist behaviour in some countries , were all topics that could benefit from information exchange and concerted global efforts and at the same time would address some of the pressing issues facing UNHCR as the refugee protection agency . 
Those topics should be related to the most urgent problems , demanding concerted action of particular importance , such as the struggle against transnational organized crime and terrorism , which had a detrimental impact on the full enjoyment of human rights and constituted a serious danger to peace and security , at both the national and international levels .  
As for the plenary and the workshop topics , the International Federation recommended the following topics : ( a ) global money-laundering , suggested practical measures to combat it ; ( b ) improving extradition measures to deal with fugitives at large ; ( c ) combating organized transnational crime and links with terrorist crime ; ( d ) the ill effects of drug trafficking ; ( e ) combating bribery and corruption in all forms ; and ( f ) combating violent crimes , such as murder , gang rape with violence , armed robbery and extortion .  
In welcoming the participants , he emphasized the growing threat posed by organized transnational crime in all its insidious forms , including theft of and illicit trafficking in motor vehicles .  
Theft of and illicit trafficking in motor vehicles had become another activity of organized crime that employed methods such as corruption of public officials and bribery in the private sector , thereby undermining both democratic and economic institutions .  
The characteristics of those criminal groups , which closely resemble those of groups operating in other countries , their hierarchical structure , internal code of conduct , resources available and ability to penetrate the market , make local organized crime a highly dangerous feature for the newly established social and economic setting of Belarus .  
The main conclusions of the seminar were that relevant international organizations should provide their assistance to countries in need , while the latter should make every possible effort to ratify existing relevant international instruments and to elaborate new ones aimed at combating organized transnational crime .  8 .  Bosnia and Herzegovina indicated that its criminal legislation contained provisions that would allow it to deal with criminal acts carried out by organized crime groups .  
In particular , the country had witnessed during the war forms of crimes that , given their sophistication and the means employed , were classified as organized criminal activities , in particular illicit trafficking in stolen cars , passing of counterfeit banknotes , mostly United States dollars and deutsche mark , and suspicious financial transactions that were considered to cover up money - laundering schemes .  
Owing to the cross-border character of those criminal activities , Bosnia and Herzegovina recognized the importance of and was ready for cooperation with other members of the international community in fighting organized crime , starting with the regional level , where the Government was preparing a draft agreement to be signed with a neighbouring country on mutual assistance and collaboration in preventing and controlling organized crime , illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and terrorism .  
The Cook Islands pointed out that although organized transnational crime had not yet appeared within its territory , law enforcement authorities continued to be informed of developments overseas and had suggested to the relevant political authorities that they consider promulgating legislation to prevent and control organized transnational crime and that they also strengthen international cooperation in the field by acceding to relevant conventions and instruments .  
Its strategy was based on a number of measures , which were summarized as legislative provisions in the areas of proceeds of crime , improvement of law enforcement capabilities , relying on the assistance and expertise of other countries that had already experienced organized crime problems and had developed methods to prevent and control it , better coordination among the relevant national authorities and improved international cooperation .  
The Estonian criminal code considered as organized crime groups those criminal associations composed of three or more members who , on a constant basis and with identified functions , committed serious criminal offences ; using that definition , the Estonian authorities reported that in the last decade more than 10 criminal associations had been identified in the country , 8 of them operating permanently since their formation in the mid-1980s .  
Greece indicated that although no legal provisions had been enacted that dealt with organized transnational crime in particular , its law enforcement agencies were operating against organized crime and making use of criminal legislation designed to tackle illicit drug trafficking , crimes related to firearms , money-laundering , trafficking in illegal migrants and other offences typically committed by organized crime groups , and that a number of characteristics of organized crime had been identified within the framework of EU and were being applied by national authorities to classify an illegal action as a form of organized crime .  
The Government of India had recognized the threat posed by organized transnational crime and measures had been taken at both the organizational and legislative levels by streamlining and reinforcing law enforcement agencies dealing with sophisticated forms of crime , as well as by drafting and passing legislation that dealt with , inter alia , terrorism , drug trafficking , smuggling of valuables and money-laundering .  
Those measures included the establishment of a national standing committee composed of law enforcement officers and academic experts charged with undertaking research on various forms of crime usually carried out by criminal organizations and of a department of public security specialized in organized crime , as well as the development of specialized training programmes for law enforcement personnel and public awareness campaigns to sensitize the Saudi public to the dangers posed by organized crime .  
The Slovak authorities , concerned that illicit drug trafficking , terrorism , arms trafficking , fraud , money-laundering and other criminal activities being carried out by criminal groups with international connections might have a negative impact on the still relatively young national institutions and society in general , had taken steps to strengthen the law enforcement capacity of the national agencies , to create a better understanding among the population of the risks posed by organized crime and to reinforce international cooperation with a view to fighting internationally operating criminal groups .  
Spain submitted a study on the structure and dynamics of organized transnational crime based on information collected at the national level by means of a questionnaire completed by all units of the judicial police .  
Major criminal activities in which organized transnational crime was engaged were violent behaviour and the use of bribery , graft and extortion that could lead to the subversion of the political , social and economic infrastructure , drug trafficking , terrorist activities , kidnapping , prostitution , counterfeiting of currencies , manipulation of financial institutions and markets , international money-laundering and financial fraud , arms smuggling , alien smuggling and computer crime .  
The United States was active on the international scene both at the bilateral level , where it carried out joint operations and cooperated with many countries of different regions , and at the multilateral level , through supporting the work of the United Nations in preventing and controlling crime , as well as through the cooperation with its partners of the Group of Seven major industrialized countries plus the Russian Federation ( G-7 / P-8 ) to coordinate efforts against transnational organized crime .  
The participants expressed deep concern at the aggravation of the situation of organized transnational crime , including illicit drug trafficking , corruption and money-laundering , experienced throughout the region and emphasized the threat posed by those forms of criminal activity to government structures and democratic institutions and to the population in general .  
At the international level , the participants felt that the United Nations and other relevant international organizations should strengthen the provision of technical assistance and advisory services to the countries of the region , and called for the acceleration of the process of developing an international convention against organized transnational crime .  
The importance of controlling the spread of organized crime in the region and enabling the national criminal justice systems to deal with the threat was also recognized by the development of a project that would encompass two training seminars in the application of the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) , with a focus on extradition and organized transnational crime , for judges , prosecutors and police officers from west African States .  
Their main objectives include assistance in drafting and implementing up-to-date legislation in the field of preventing and controlling organized transnational crime and associated criminal activities ; assistance to selected government departments in meeting problems raised by the legal reform process through training and the provision of short-term expertise ; and strengthening of the criminal justice system capacity to fight organized crime , also in cooperation with international counterparts .  
The Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice , at its fifth session , proposed the establishment of a central repository for information on legislation , regulatory measures , organizational structures designed to prevent and control organized transnational crime and bilateral and multilateral cooperation agreements .  
In order to assist countries in need and to render more operational its technical assistance activities , the Division , as requested by the Economic and Social Council in its resolution 1996 / 27 , will also develop a training manual for specialized law enforcement and investigative personnel on action against organized transnational crime .  
The Senior Expert Group , which was also asked to ensure the active follow-up of the implementation of the 40 recommendations it had prepared , continued to meet and to examine various issues relating to international action against organized crime , including the question of the elaboration of a convention against organized transnational crime and the work that is being carried out by the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice with a view to increasing cooperation and coordinated action between the Group of Seven and the relevant United Nations entities .  
The follow-up to the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan has generated both a focused discussion on the issue of organized transnational crime , as well as a wealth of information that would need systematization and analysis to be transformed into practical tools , in particular model legislation , training for law enforcement and advisory assistance for the reform of the criminal justice system .  
It has also become clear that the problems created for countries by organized transnational crime may be solved only through the adoption and implementation of measures that could comprise up-to-date legislation to deal with this criminal phenomenon ; increased capacity of criminal justice systems to enforce existing legislation and control organized transnational crime ; strengthened ability to gather and analyse reliable information on organized crime activities , with a view to devising preventive and control policies ; and more effective inter-state cooperation when investigating , prosecuting or judging organized transnational crime offences .  
The structure of a work programme on organized transnational crime should consist of three main elements : reliable knowledge for informed decision-making ; provision of assistance in the legislative and regulatory fields ; and advisory services and training . 
For purposes of building mutual trust during the first , second and third stages of reintegration , constant contacts shall be established and maintained at the level of unit commanders , contacts among personnel shall be organized and special measures for joint training shall be conducted .  
At the coordination segment of the Council of 1995 , devoted to coordinated follow-up by the United Nations system and implementation of the results of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields , the Council decided that it would ensure the harmonization and coordination of the agendas and work programmes of the functional commissions by promoting a clearer division of labour among them and providing clear policy guidance to them ( thirteenth paragraph of agreed conclusions 1995 / 1 ) .  
Against this backdrop , the Survey is organized as follows : chapter I briefly describes how the developing ESCAP region fares in the emerging global scene ; chapter II shows the recent performance of individual countries in terms of selected macroeconomic and social development indicators which impinge on participation in the globalization and regionalization processes ; chapters III and IV analyse the benefits and risks of integration into the international and regional economy focusing on foreign trade and external finance ( including FDI ) . 
Considering the crucial importance of financial investigations designed to target the wealth of organized crime and thereby deprive it of one of the most important means of its power , the working group agreed that measures could be implemented to detect and monitor the physical transportation of cash and bearer negotiable instruments at the border , subject to strict safeguards to ensure proper use of information thereby obtained and without impeding in any way the freedom of movement of legitimate capital .  
The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung elucidated in an all-round way the questions on the founding of the DCRK , including the problem of forming a supreme national confederal assembly with an equal number of representatives from the north and the south and an appropriate number of representatives of overseas nationals under which a confederal standing committee is organized to discuss and decide on common issues related to the overall interests of the country and nation . 
At the national level , review arrangements , such as the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) - sponsored round-table meetings and the World Bank consultative and aid groups , organized by the least developed countries with the support of the respective organizations , have been further consolidated during the early 1990s , with additional countries joining or rejoining the process and meetings taking place more frequently and on a more regular basis .  
This programme comprises , mainly , the organized transfer of meteorological and hydrological knowledge and proven methodology among the members of the organization , with the overall objective of enabling the national meteorological and hydrological services of members States , especially the least developed and other developing countries , to provide the best possible level of services so as to ensure public safety , management of water resources , support sustainable socio-economic development and safeguard the environment .  
An indigenous participant from South America reported on some activities carried on in the field of indigenous rights and human rights : seminars and workshops had been organized and a number of publications had been distributed with a view to improving understanding of international legal instruments regarding indigenous peoples and monitoring their implementation .  
At the same time , it was evident that the problem was a long-term one of unprecedented complexity , which could not be resolved without the concerted efforts of the entire international community , as had recently been confirmed during the scientific conferences organized to mark the tenth anniversary of Chernobyl .  
While it is evident that crime , particularly economic and organized crime in its transnational dimensions , is detrimental to the sustainable development of the African countries , financial cuts in this research area may have negative long-term consequences for the continent as a whole .  
The Institute continued to use every opportunity , especially its biannual newsletter and its participation in subregional , regional and international meetings , to raise the awareness of all concerned that research in this area is the basis for developing effective practical measures to combat crime , especially transnational organized crime .  
ECA has collaborated with OAU in various meetings and seminars organized in the following areas : domestic mobilization of financial resources for the development of Africa ; the role of African workers and trade unions in subregional and regional economic integration ; the mobilization of resources and public awareness for refugees in Africa ; trade policies and World Trade Organization negotiations ; future relations between the African , Caribbean and Pacific Group of States and the European Union ; and globalization , development and international labour standards .  
In recent experience United Nations electoral assistance has been geared more to smaller missions that provide technical assistance to the electoral authorities of the Member State concerned with coordinating support provided by others or to providing a symbolic United Nations presence , compared with the large missions of prior years that organized , conducted or observed the elections .  
These include ethnic conflicts and disputes arising out of the neglect of the rights of persons belonging to national minorities ; border disputes that could lead to armed conflicts ; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems ; international terrorism ; organized crime and illegal trafficking in arms and drugs ; money-laundering , contraband and clandestine migration ; and transnational environmental degradation .  
The Seventh United Nations International Training Course on Remote Sensing Education for Educators , held at Stockholm and Kiruna , Sweden , from 5 May to 13 June 1997 , was organized by the United Nations Programme on Space Application in cooperation with the Government of Sweden . The course was conducted specifically for the benefit of educators from developing countries with the objective of enabling them to introduce remote sensing courses in their respective academic institutions .  
That mandate is underlined by the Secretary-General in paragraph 11 of his report submitted pursuant to paragraph 2 of Security Council resolution 808 ( 1993 ) ( S / 25704 ) , in which he recalled that the Council had condemned the practice of ethnic cleansing and the massive , organized and systematic detention and rape of women , and reaffirmed that those who commit or have committed or order or have ordered the commission of such acts will be held individually responsible in respect of such acts .  
The 1996 special seminars organized by the Office of Legal Affairs and UNITAR covered the following topics : 13 ( a ) International protection of human rights ; ( b ) International humanitarian law ; ( c ) Refugee law ; ( d ) International law and sustainable development ; ( e ) International economic law ; ( f ) World Trade Organization and the multilateral trading system ; ( g ) International environmental law ; and ( h ) Law of the sea .  
Joint ventures , often utilizing extrabudgetary funds , have been organized with influential media organizations , leaders of civil society , intellectual and educational groups , the business community , appropriate private enterprises and relevant governmental institutions .  
The Parties have agreed to cooperate actively in combating illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , the smuggling of weapons and ammunition and of explosive , toxic and radioactive materials , organized crime , illegal migration and terrorism .  
It is worth noting as background to this that , between April 1994 and September 1997 , the special authorities responsible for internal security and order obtained information about more than 30 planned terrorist attacks against Cuba organized and prepared in Miami , in the United States , more than 15 of which involved the use of explosives of the type known as C _ 4 .  
The Centre established a comprehensive data base on non-governmental organizations and other partners active in human settlements and is expanding its programme with those partners which had participated actively in the Habitat II preparatory process and had organized their own forums and presented their declarations and commitments to Committee II of the Conference . 11 .  At the present time , the main operational activity of the Centre in relation to the Global Strategy for Shelter , is the application of the urban and housing indicators .  
We must be prepared to face other kinds of war : social war against poverty ; judicial war against organized crime ; political war against interventionism in our sovereign economies ; and moral war against the violation of human rights . 
The Secretary-General alluded to this development in his report on the work of this Organization , where he recognized that the same technological means that foster globalization and the transnational expansion of civil society also provide the infrastructure for expanding global networks of uncivil society - organized crime , drug-traffickers , money-launderers and terrorists .  
The world is currently passing through highly interwoven and complicated circumstances , where progress and its horizons mingle with backwardness and its dangers while humanity takes pride in such achievements as economic progress and the development of technology and informatics , it is still suffering from the practices of terrorism , drug trafficking , organized crime , the spread of corruption , the overflow of refugees , the challenges posed by war criminals , crimes of genocide and mass murder , and the negative effects of racism and religious discrimination . 
The same gang of ultraconservatives and gangsters is responsible for the acquittal of hijackers and impedes the use of the term terrorists , while with a silent and mysterious complicity they are bolstered , funded , organized , armed , trained and assigned to intelligence missions .  
These disturbing trends are in contrast with the global consensus that has emerged during major international conferences organized over the past decade under the auspices of the United Nations . They raise legitimate questions as to the very future of the system established to organize international cooperation for development .  
From this standpoint , the countries that are weakest in terms of economic , institutional , material and technological capacity are the most vulnerable developing countries in general and African countries in particular because the automatic effect of the activities of developed countries to prevent and combat organized crime is to condemn such countries to becoming new zones of expansion .  
And yet in my country , which today is in the grip of civil war , almost everything has been done since the sovereign national conference to spare our young democracy from the tragic upheavals inherent in any sudden social change , which in this case consisted of the move from a single-party political regime banning any organized opposition to a veritable explosion of freedoms individual , political and religious .  
Indeed , since the beginning of this decade , each of the global conferences which have been organized under the auspices of the United Nations from the Children \ x { e5b8 } Summit , held in 1990 , to the Conference on Human Settlements , held in Istanbul in 1996 has drawn a link between its own central theme and the pervasive issue of poverty and how its structural causes are to be addressed .  
Among the key objectives of this policy are the sustainable development of the region , based on overcoming poverty , and the participation of organized civil society and the population in general , as well as environmental preservation and the rational and sustainable use of natural resources .  
The World Summit for Social Development organized two years ago in a post-cold-war international environment characterized by profound social , economic and political changes and increasing globalization represented a milestone in the history of international cooperation .  
Although pre _ colonial Rwanda was inhabited by the same peoples as are found there today , namely , the Hutus ( of Bantu origin ) , the Tutsi ( of Hamitic descent ) and the Twas ( pymoid type ) , these three peoples , organized in more or less autonomous kingdoms , did not constitute opposing dominant and dominated ethnic groups . 
As a cooperative activity of UNEP , the World Resources Institute ( WRI ) and IUCN , a set of guidelines on the preparation of biodiversity strategies and action plans was prepared and global biodiversity forums were organized to assist Governments and the public in integrating biodiversity components in improving the understanding of the role of biodiversity in sustainable development and in monitoring implementation and the reporting of progress made .  
On behalf of the Society for the Reform of Criminal Law , the Centre was responsible for the organization of an international conference on the theme " Challenges to criminal justice in a changing world " , which took place at Whistler , British Columbia , from 21 to 24 August 1996 , and examined the challenges posed by increasing opportunities in organized economic crime .  
The Special Rapporteur also observes that article 17 of Protocol II Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 requires that , in the case of displacements carried out for the safety of civilians or for imperative military reasons , the responsible party must take all possible measures . . . in order that the civilian population may be received under satisfactory conditions of shelter , hygiene , health , safety and nutrition .  Article 14 of the same instrument also stipulates a prohibition of starvation of civilians under the control of organized armed forces .  
In order to protect borders effectively it is necessary for countries to enter into bilateral and mulitlateral agreements on transborder police cooperation to deal with organized or unorganized attempts at illegal migration ; set up an information support system for flexible cooperation between internal and external security forces ; train police officers and embassy staff regarding counterfeit documents ; and pay close attention to security aspects of the issuance of visas .  
Workshop / Seminars : These activities can be held before or during the UNISPACE III Conference and could be organized by interested specialized agencies of the United Nations and other international organizations on topics consistent with the objectives of the UNISPACE III Conference that would fit within the agreed structure and that would be relevant to their expertise and mandate . 
Insufficient cooperation among law enforcement agencies , lack of appropriate controls prior to the registration of a motor vehicle , corruption , legislative discrepancies with regard to bona fide possession of a motor vehicle in various regions of the world , a variety of registration practices and differences in the level of training of vehicle inspectors are generally indicated as factors facilitating the involvement of organized transnational crime in this profitable form of illicit trafficking .  
Germany reported that illicit trafficking in motor vehicles was an area covered by the act to suppress illegal drug trafficking and other manifestations of organized crime ( OrgKG ) of 15 July 1992 , which contained specific legal provisions imposing severe penalties . 
The Armenian nationalists were particularly inhumane and used refined methods of cruelty in dealing with their victims , which is attested by signs of desecration of the victims ' bodies , looting and the presence in the surrounding forests of the frozen bodies of many old people , women and children who , unable to break through the encirclement , fell victim to ambushes organized by the Armenians .  
There is need for a coherent set of legislative measures with programmes to achieve strengthening of the small business [ and informal ] sector through the development of appropriate legal , management and financial structures , to enable the sector to develop in a sustained and organized way ; and to initiate and strengthen financing mechanism that enhance small business [ and informal ] sector access to financial services and to reduce the cost of providing and acquiring these services .  
Encouraging States Parties also to take all reasonable steps to put in place effective bilateral , multilateral or regional arrangements for cooperation in the prevention , detection , prosecution and punishment of acts of tourism organized with the purpose of facilitating the effecting of a commercial sexual relationship with a child ,

In this regard , they concurred on the need for a process of transition leading to transparent , fair and inclusive elections which would be organized and supervised by an independent body and monitored by the international community .  
On the other hand , it should be understood that such operations must not be sporadic and that they are planned or prepared by organized armed groups capable of taking concerted action .  
No comparison should be drawn between the legitimate struggle of peoples against colonial or foreign domination , and terrorist acts instigated , organized , directed or financed by one State or any of its organizations against another with the aim of undermining its political , economic and social system or subverting its Government .  
Reiterates that the main objective of the First United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty is to achieve the goal of eradicating absolute poverty and reducing overall poverty substantially in the world through decisive national actions and international cooperation in implementing fully and effectively the relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations and all agreements and commitments agreed upon at the United Nations major conferences and summits organized since 1990 as they relate to poverty eradication ;  
Algeria stated that , in the light of the need to provide States with effective instruments for international cooperation in the fight against organized transnational crime , it supported the spirit and principles embodied in the draft framework convention and hoped that such a convention could soon be adopted .  
Austria continued to be sceptical about the feasibility of elaborating a useful convention against organized transnational crime , as organized crime was a complex phenomenon that raised a number of legal issues that were not adequately covered in the draft .  
Canada pointed out that , while the idea of an " omnibus convention " on organized transnational crime was an attractive proposition that might have the effect of sending a strong public signal that the international community would not accept criminal abuse of the very positive global trend to loosen international boundaries , it had concerns about that proposal , particularly as far as the possible duplication with other legal instruments and cooperative mechanisms was concerned , at least until the issue of whether such a convention was intended to supersede or supplement existing instruments was clarified .  
Finally , Canada expressed the view that the ratification and implementation of existing international instruments represented a first step towards creating a comprehensive and successful legal framework for international cooperation against organized transnational crime .  
Turkey considered that such a convention should also include organized transnational crimes committed in the perpetration of or linked to terrorist acts and illicit trafficking in firearms , in chemical and nuclear materials and in children and other persons .  24 .  The United States noted that Member States had not had sufficient time to discuss the question of the elaboration of an international convention against organized crime and to exchange their views on the issue .  
Finally , the United States pointed out that , although it was engaged in a continuous process of seeking and establishing , whenever possible , more effective bilateral and multilateral means of combating all forms of organized transnational crime , it agreed that the time had come to give serious consideration to the elaboration of a single new international convention in that area .

Welcoming the fact that the call of the World Conference on Human Rights for a United Nations system _ wide approach to human rights issues has been reflected in the recommendations of major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields ,  
Recent experience has demonstrated , however , that United Nations assistance rendered in the field of electoral assistance is geared more and more to smaller missions , which give technical assistance to the electoral authorities of the Member State concerned in coordinating the electoral support provided by others , or provide a symbolic United Nations presence , rather than the large missions of prior years for which it organized and conducted ( e.g . Cambodia ) or observed ( e.g .  
The High Contracting Parties shall cooperate in combating crime , especially organized crime , terrorism in all its forms and manifestations , including criminal acts directed against the safety of maritime navigation , civil aviation and other forms of transport , illegal trafficking in radioactive materials , weapons , narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and contraband , including the illegal transfer across the border of objects of cultural , historical or artistic value .

We recognize that poverty , unemployment and other obstacles to human development , such as civil strife and war , as well as crime and social injustices , render our States and societies vulnerable to transnational organized crime and corruption ; and we are , therefore , resolved to undertake and intensify all necessary steps and measures to address such problems , with the cooperation and support of the international community .  
We express our strong hope to participate in the work of the inter-sessional open-ended intergovernmental group of experts of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice1 charged with elaborating a preliminary draft of an international convention against organized transnational crime , so as to fully support the efforts of the Commission in elaborating such a convention , and we call upon the Commission to pursue those efforts as a matter of the utmost urgency .  
We call upon donor countries , the United Nations Development Programme , the World Bank , the African Development Bank and other international , regional and national funding agencies to give favourable consideration to project proposals on strengthening our national or regional capacities and creating the expertise required for the prevention and control of organized transnational crime and corruption , elaborated by the Division and submitted to them .  
We regard the project proposals that we have reviewed ( reflected in annex III of the report of the Regional Ministerial Workshop ) as viable and important regional initiatives , containing the basic elements of a concerted approach to the problems faced by all States of the region in the prevention and control of organized transnational crime , money-laundering and corruption .

It has also formulated a proposal for a project whose main objective is to assess the major and emerging groups involved in transnational organized crime according to their level of dangerousness .  
The degree of dangerousness will be assessed through a multidimensional approach based on different conceptual areas and related indicators that characterize organized criminal groups , such as financial strength , use of violence , capacity to infiltrate public institutions and legal environment in which they operate .  
The aim of the latter project is to publish a world report on organized crime every two years , which will provide qualitative and quantitative information on trends in organized crime activities and structures of groups operating at the international level ; types and distribution of illicit markets ; major international initiatives ; and developments in national legislation against organized crime .

Enforcement in the Convention according to the latter meaning of the term , and thus establishment of the right of States Parties to refuse extradition on the grounds that the State requesting extradition may impose an unreasonably mild punishment on the offender , would be a risky though progressive step towards limiting even further the possibilities for members of organized criminal groups to find a safe haven .  
For combating such negative phenomena as drugs , organized crime and money-laundering , strengthened international cooperation by combining national efforts , the adoption of multilateral norms and international codes of conduct , as appropriate , and the development of multilateral regional or subregional cooperation , wherever suitable , are obvious areas requiring ongoing United Nations initiatives and action .

Transnational crime , which may or may not be committed by organized criminal groups , also constitutes a new challenge to conventional models of the rule of law because the rule of law is based on a traditional framework in which sovereign powers , including those to make , enforce and administer the law , are exercised at the national level .  
Many countries share a common legal definition of what is considered to be an organized criminal group ( for example , a group composed of three or more individuals , driven by the pursuit of profit , suspected of committing or having committed serious criminal offences and existing for a prolonged or indefinite period of time ) .  
Transnational organized crime includes tax evasion , the forgery of clothes and electronic equipment , fraud against international financial institutions , unfair competition on international markets , industrial espionage , the import and export of protected plants and animals , trafficking in works of art and the illegal dumping of toxic industrial waste .  
Related to this assumption is the implicit association of this type of activity with organized crime , therefore conveying the notion that those engaged are full-time criminal entrepreneurs who have developed expertise and accumulated resources in previous illegal activities .  
Therefore criminal groups spread into sectors where the risk of being arrested and heavily sentenced is relatively low , especially compared to the attractive economic return . 15 Responses are advocated that may reduce such normative inconsistencies while reducing the mobility of transnational organized groups .

Furthermore , they deployed a second echelon in a planned and organized manner in an attempt to avoid being cracked down on , and to wage long-term confrontation with the party and the government .  
A large number of facts can prove that this organization of " Falungong " is totally a cult organization opposing the government and the people .  They organized and incited a series of illegal activities , thus openly provoking the socialist country , democracy , and legal system , and endangering national security and social stability .  If they are allowed to wantonly wreak havoc , there will never be days of peace .  
Each area conscientiously organized the Party members and cadres , especially leading cadres and their family members and colleagues to watch the film , " Choosing Between Life and Death " .

They have combined the scattered self-studies with appropriate group studies , finished reading about 400,000 words of study items which are specified by the Central Authorities as compulsory , conducted intensive reading of some key study items , and organized in-depth discussions of special topics and some leading comrades even gave study guidance in the light of actual conditions .  
In view of the grave situation where local and foreign triads are running rampant throughout the mainland and even infiltrating Chinese communist party and government organs , Beijing started a massive campaign to strike hard at triads across the land in September this year .

On the afternoon of 22 December , the National People 's Congress [ NPC ] Standing Committee organized its members to join in a group discussion to deliberate a draft Decision on Safeguarding Internet Security .

Major and serious cases that cause serious harms and bad influence and which the people show strong reactions should be handled by designated departments , the system of responsibility for cracking down on cases should be implemented , and competent people should be organized to crack cases quickly .  
We must not be faint-hearted and hesitant in dealing with the handful of criminals who , with ulterior political motives , held fast to their anti-government , anti-social and anti-people stand , and organized and instigated deceived Falungong maniacs to openly stir up trouble , disrupt public order , and undermine social stability in their attempt to undermine the cause of socialist modernization .  We must deal a resolute blow to them and punish them severely in accordance with law , and must not leave any openings for future trouble .  
He added : Both sides made positive appraisals of the smooth development of their friendly cooperative relations in all fields in recent years .  They unanimously believe that there is great potential in Chinese-Italian relations , which also have bright prospects .  From now on , both sides should strengthen mutual visits between personnel , economic and trade cooperation , cultural exchanges , and cooperation in the judicial field , including making joint efforts in smashing organized crimes .  
They were shocked by and indignant at such an organized and planned scheme , claiming that this incident once again unmasked " Falungong 's " antihuman and antisocial essence of cruelly injuring or killing the people and trampling on human rights .  
I 've come to see more clearly the true nature of " Falungong " as an evil cult .  The fact that this horrifying incident took place in such a special place and at such a special time has fully shown that the incident , in which several people attempted to burn themselves to death , was an organized and premeditated activity .  
I suggest that while stepping up in-depth or meticulous education or transformation work , the government should hold higher the law as a sharp sword ; should more severely crack down on a small number of die-hard elements of " Falungong , " who have plotted or organized activities intended to create a disturbance ; and should firmly prevent such people from fanning the flames of disorder or sabotaging a situation of stability and unity , which we have built with hard efforts .  
Gu Xiulian , vice president of All-China Women 's Federation [ ACWF ] and first secretary of the ACWF Secretariat , stated : The latest incident , which took place on the Tiananmen Square when several people attempted to burn themselves to death , was an organized , premeditated , and plotted activity , which has made clearer the true nature of " Falungong " as an evil cult , which opposes mankind , society , and science .  
He openly defied the laws , organized and instigated besieging of party and government organs and mass media institutions , staged illegal demonstrations and rallies , continuously gathered his followers at Tiananmen Square to carry out trouble-making activities , seriously disrupted the public order and sabotaged social stability .  
In order to help the infatuates gradually stop being dependent on " Falungong " and master scientific ways of staying healthy , we arranged for medical staff and sports teachers to explain to them that healthy sports and recreational activities are the only things that would benefit physical and mental health .  We organized them to practice Taijiquan and fitness exercises ; conducted the activity of singing aloud revolutionary songs , such as " No Communist Party , No New China ; "  
According to the Public Security organs ' preliminary investigation , this incident of self-immolation was totally the result of Li Hongzhi 's poisoning , confusion , instigation , and mental manipulation of " Falungong " fanatics , and it was an organized , premeditated , and planned criminal activity undertaken with measured steps .  
The General Headquarters of Staff , the General Political Department , the General Logistics Department , the General Equipment Department , and all major units studied the concrete methods of education and made careful arrangements in connection with the conditions of the troops , organized theoretical workers to deeply analyze the anti-science , anti-human , anti-society , anti-government reactionary character of the " Falungong " evil cult and provided theoretical guidance to the education activities among the troops .  All units also dispatched elite forces to guide the troops to carry out education and implement the plans .  
Theoretical study classes and Marxist philosophy lectures were organized at all levels to help leading cadres systematically study the theory of dialectical materialism and historical materialism and to guide grass-roots officers and servicemen and cadets in military schools and academies to master the basic viewpoints of the materialist and atheist theory of Marxism .

This was the case especially during the " 96-2 " exercise , which was staged under clear-cut stress involving units from different services and arms .

So far , nearly 300 suspects at large involved in major criminal corruption and bribery cases have fallen into the net of justice .

In step with the global trend to open up the television market , we consider that the Government 's role should be to create an open and competitive market to promote the development of the broadcasting industry .

Health talks are also organized to disseminate information on genetic diseases , including inherited retinal degenerative diseases , to members of the public and health care organizations in order to enhance public awareness of the diseases .  
This process of change has been accelerated by the economic crisis in 1997 , which has spread to all parts of Asia .

Sociologically speaking , six of the groups are clan systems . Among these , the Saisiat , Bunun and Tsou peoples have patriarchal societies ; the Taiya are lineal patriarchal ; and the Ami and Peinan are matriarchal . The Paiwan and Rukai have no clans but rather a system of social classes , similar to the feudal system prevailing during the Chou dynasty ( c . 1066 B . C . to 221 B . C . ) . The Yamis are organized chiefly around " fishing groups . "

In the 1950s , Taiwan received a great deal of aspirations to escape from the post-war hardships and to catch up with advanced Western civilization , young artists organized the " Orient " and " May " art associations .

For example , just prior to the major provincial and municipal elections at the end of last year , Mary Tseng , secretary-general of the Wild Bird Society of Taipei , organized their semi-annual waterfowl festival in Kuantu .

Back in the 1970s , when women in the US and Europe began fighting for " reproductive autonomy , " the socially and politically influential Catholic Church entered the debate right at the start . The Church positioned itself as speaking " for the rights of the unborn child , " providing an organized anti-abortion force . This brought abortion into the realm of public debate , and the " right to choose " became a political issue .  
The songs of the Ami can be traced back to their fishing , farming , and hunting activities in the mountains and along the coast . In their tightly organized villages , through the annual harvest festival , each successive generation was trained and educated in cultural traditions , which is the main reason these songs have been carried forward .  
" For example , I discovered the Focolare Movement , founded fifty years ago by an Italian woman , Chiara Lubich .

Disaster struck again in October at the 10,000-man tug-of-war organized by the Taipei City Government when the rope broke , causing two people to lose arms and others to suffer internal injuries .

Last year the Buddha 's Light International Association organized New Year 's Eve dinners in the north , center and south of Taiwan , which were attended by more than 5,000 old folk who live alone . This year they are repeating the exercise , and are including a special event in Nantou County to bring some warmth and love to elderly survivors of the 9 / 21 earthquake there .

Taking as a precedent his approach to the Mass Rapid Transit System when he was mayor of Taipei , Chen says that during the mayoral elections he opposed the embryonic mass transit system , but he did not tear it down just to fulfill a campaign promise .

One major problem that has come to light is the chaotic state of Taiwan 's financial system . The KMT government was forever being criticized for allowing the intrusion of politics into the financial arena-the collusion between big money , organized crime , and political forces that is referred to as " black and gold ruling in tandem . "  
Attempts were made to eradicate the influence of organized crime in politics during Lee Teng-hui 's presidency , but the party also needed votes and had to nurture local factions . As Wang points out : " Several ministers of finance were forced out of office for raising taxes . No wonder the public tends to regard the KMT as ' rich but uncouth , ' and as having allowed ' black and gold to rule in tandem . ' "  
The case has elicited the concern of human rights groups around the world . The London headquarters of Amnesty International , which describes the convictions as " the judicial ruling of an uncivilized nation , " has organized several support campaigns for the three men , and last May sent representatives to Taiwan , where they called a press conference and stated , " If Taiwan 's government intends to make human rights a trump card of its foreign policy , it should first grant clemency to the Hsichih trio . "  
Fourth , they established organized systems of religious practice . Examples are clerics such as Hui Neng , sixth patriarch of Chan Buddhism , Master Xian Shou , who founded the Huayan Sect in the Tang dynasty , and Master Zhi Zhe , who enabled the Tiantai Sect to spread far and wide . A final characteristic of the most distinctive figures in Buddhism is that their stories were avidly related by later generations .  
Politicians , academics , the media , and ordinary people are therefore all misusing the term when they employ it to describe the financial power of hei dao ( which literally translates as " the black way " and means " organized crime " ) or jin niu ( which translates literally as " gold bulls " and means " wealthy individuals who use their money for political leverage " ) . Moreover , this incorrect usage is only gaining prevalence the more it is used .  
So that both citizens of Taiwan and foreigners studying Chinese here wo n't misunderstand and misuse the term " black gold , " which has long been properly used to describe iron , oil and coal ( as my research has demonstrated ) , I hope that instead of " sweeping away black gold " the government will " sweep away the corrupting influence in politics of money from organized crime and the wealthy . "  
Wu Cheng-chun , general manager of the LungYen Group , explains that his company 's funeral service is organized around a simple system , in contrast to the convoluted requirements of a traditional funeral . All the essential rites are included , but not the various bizarre and superfluous additions that are often seen .  
" Being involved in a social movement taught me that , at their core , most social problems come down to the fundamental character of human beings . So having been part of an organized movement , having worked within a group , I 've gone back to the beginning and am looking at myself . " Even as a child , Chen was introspective and given to challenging anything she perceived as unfair .  
Hsu Yang-ming , deputy secretary-general of the DPP , says that traditional local powers-that-be-groups built around organized crime , collusion between officials and businessmen , and local factions-are now more like powers-that-were .

Li Tung-liang , a director of the Chaoyang Lukang Association , points out that in the early years of the Guangxu reign period ( 1871-1908 ) of the Qing dynasty , the Quanzhou woodcarving master Li Ko-chiu moved to Lukang , where he gathered together all the local wood sculptors and organized a guild . Today , a century later , its namesake organization selects an annual chief organizer by casting for divination sticks ; this individual is then responsible for arranging the ceremony honoring Lu Ban .  
Its personnel and programs have made an outstanding contribution , earning the title " the quiet achievers . " The low-profile AVDRC specially organized the open day to express gratitude for the tremendous support that the host nation has provided .

The difficulties of construction included record-setting bridges , tunnels and challenges of all kinds .  
A perfect travel guide It may have been because they are looking to expand their business with the huge mainland Chinese tourist market , but the Hungarian National Tourist Office ( HNTO ) was very solicitous of us .

In former times , the emperor had the final say in how urban spaces were organized , and all buildings took the imperial palace as their yardstick .

During several specifically focused international conferences organized by the United Nations , an appeal has been made to the developed countries to fulfil their obligations to meet official development assistance targets and to help to create an international economic and political climate conducive to sustained economic growth in developing countries .  
This means that nothing could be done in the absence of the political will of States that bear the responsibility of dispelling doubts and remedying the disaffection that is noticeable today vis - - vis the United Nations by giving true meaning to the Organization 's invaluable and multifarious contributions towards the promotion of an international society that is more just , better organized and better structured .

For example , at an Expert Group Meeting , jointly organized by the Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development and UNDP in New York , on 14 and 15 December 1994 , it was proposed that a Development Watch should be established to assist decision makers , especially those at the national level , to understand the interaction among physical ( environmental ) , social and economic phenomena and the policy options these interactions suggest .  
While the principle of the severity of the offence is sound in view of the need to address the multitude of activities engaged in by organized transnational criminal groups , further elaboration is needed in the light of the differing national perceptions of the severity of individual offences .  
The recommendations covered several key issues , including the importance of crime prevention and criminal justice , individual and collective security and safety measures in Islamic society , the impact of transnational crime ( such as organized crime and illicit drug trafficking ) in the region , and future measures concerning regional and international collaboration against crime .  
The Fund also held several in-house workshops for members of UNFPA country support teams ( CST ) to enhance their technical skills ; organized a workshop for 14 senior officers from headquarters and the field to improve their management skills ; and organized two regional training courses for field staff to improve financial accountability and to facilitate accurate and transparent reporting of expenditures .  
The frequent appearance of corpses in the so-called " graveyard " bearing signs of torture and coups de grace , the fact that the victims are frequently common criminals , and the inability of the competent national agencies to locate the perpetrators , are characteristic of the modus operandi of the organized groups involved in " social cleansing " campaigns , which can hardly operate without the tolerance , complicity or direct participation of agents of the State .  
In addition to addressing these issues at a national level , the programmes also assist States in fighting transnational crime , including organized criminal activity , economic and environmental criminality and money-laundering .  
They included " Action against national and transnational economic and organized crime and the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment : national experiences and international cooperation " , which was considered in a plenary session , with a special session on corruption .  
Seminars and training programmes were to be organized on the prevention of crime in urban and other areas , and sound crime prevention strategies developed , capable of being adapted to local conditions , with particular reference to the approaches suggested at the relevant workshops held during the Ninth Congress .  
They call for the development of an empirical base of knowledge on the nature , dynamics and operations of new sophisticated and diversified forms of transnational organized , economic and environmental crime that pose a particular threat , and on their linkages with terrorist violence , corruption and money-laundering .  
More effective strategies must be devised against recalcitrant problems , such as rapidly escalating organized , economic and environmental crime , and action efforts pursued at multiple levels - international , regional , national and , with the trend towards decentralization , local as well .  
The rising toll of violence linked to civil strife , terrorism and ordinary street crime , and the price exacted by organized , economic and environmental criminality , have jeopardized some of the gains of development and undermined future prospects .  
The 142 States present at the World Ministerial Conference on Organized Crime proclaimed their political will and strong determination , as well as their unequivocal commitment , to ensure the full and expeditious implementation of the Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , reflecting the urgency and priority attention attached to action against organized transnational crime .  
Efforts had to take into account the current political situation and the ease with which organized criminal groups crossed borders and took advantage of efforts designed to bring countries closer together and increase the free movement of goods , capital , services and people .  
In their search for new opportunities and markets , organized criminal groups were ready to make sizeable investments in both equipment and human resources and were willing to bring their huge financial power to bear , in addition to using other more violent methods , for eliminating competition .  
The prospect of organized criminal groups infiltrating and attaining controlling interests in crucial sectors of the economies of developing countries and countries in transition had contributed to raising awareness and increasing concern among Governments , particularly at a time of joint efforts towards economic restructuring on the basis of free market principles .  
To implement their commitments in the fight against transnational organized crime , they established a group of senior experts , with a temporary mandate to look at existing arrangements for cooperation , both bilateral and multilateral , to identify significant gaps and options for improved coordination and to propose practical action to fill such gaps .  
However , while developed countries already possess the infrastructure and crucial knowledge required in mustering the necessary resources and maximizing their efficiency and effectiveness , developing countries and countries in transition are found in the very difficult position of easily being outpaced by organized criminal groups .  
In the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , States recognized , while acknowledging its global implications , that prevention and control of organized transnational crime must necessarily vary from State to State and region to region and be based upon improvements in national capabilities , increased knowledge and shared experiences about organized criminal groups .  
Further , Governments are alarmed by the increasing involvement of organized transnational crime in legitimate business , coupled with the need of organized criminal groups to find ways of laundering their illicit proceeds .  
While peer pressure in the context of an institutional framework is invaluable , the risk of misperceptions as to ultimate objectives and the ways to achieve them may be too great in view of the implications of organized transnational crime and the threat it poses to developed and developing countries alike .  
The threat posed to the internal security and stability of sovereign States , as well as to international security , by the dramatic increase of organized transnational crime in the past decade is growing and will continue to grow and become more menacing if concerted and decisive action on the part of the international community is delayed .  
While energies have to be focused and action planned in the best and most efficient manner , the ultimate goals of effectively preventing and controlling organized transnational crime in all its forms and dimensions , and arresting its expansion at both the national and international levels , should be guiding the relevant efforts and should constitute the yardstick against which success is to be assessed .  
In addition to examining the opportunity and impact of international instruments such as a convention or conventions against organized transnational crime , and an indication of the issues and elements to be covered therein , priority attention was given to improving reliable knowledge on the structure and dynamics of organized transnational crime , legislative and regulatory measures , and technical cooperation .  
The new responsibilities that Governments have to take on because of the escalation of organized transnational crime and the demand for global strategies to combat it , draw attention to the need for effective instruments , bearing in mind that what is most needed is a comprehensive , multi-layered approach to international cooperation in law enforcement and criminal justice in the fight against organized transnational crime .  
One of the major objectives of international cooperation must be to create greater harmonization in criminal justice systems , by improving the standards of countries with weaker criminal justice systems in general or by developing national legislation specifically directed against organized crime .  
However , in the presence of a strong political will and broad consensus , as evidenced by the priority attached to action against organized transnational crime and the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , it would be possible to ensure that the negotiation process does not result in a diluted document that falls short of establishing the provisions necessary for an effective response to transnational criminal organizations .  
The accumulation of theoretical knowledge has irreplaceable value for the purposes of educating younger generations and the public in general and for devising strategies and developing measures to counter the corrupting effects of organized crime on societal values .  
Academic institutions and professional associations have a major role to play in accumulating theoretical knowledge on organized transnational crime and in disseminating this knowledge , in close cooperation with governmental agencies and the education system , as well as in concert with the media , non-governmental organizations and the private sector .  
Developed countries are generally in a position to devote the necessary resources for acquiring the body of both theoretical and practical knowledge that is required for the effective prevention and control of organized transnational crime and , as discussed earlier , considerable efforts in that direction are in progress .  
Provision of the information and materials requested by the Secretary-General pursuant to Economic and Social Council resolution 1995 / 11 would permit the undertaking of a comprehensive and comparative study of the situation in the various regions of the world , thus contributing to the achievement of the goal of improving reliable knowledge on organized transnational crime , its structure and dynamics .  
Through a global assessment of the transnational organized crime situation , the study would seek to contribute to a better understanding of the problems arising from differences that exist or emerge among various countries in the perception and evaluation of organized transnational crime , thus leading to the gradual development of a common perception of the phenomenon , and a global strategy for more effective international cooperation .  
It should also consider conditions that are conducive to the rise and growth of criminal organizations , such as social , economic and political factors , structural characteristics of organized crime , as well as organizational shortcomings in the control agencies .  
The results of the study would also be used for the development of special programmes , courses and curriculums for academic institutions , to ensure that theoretical knowledge is increased , improved and disseminated , and to create the basis for long-term and consistent action against organized transnational crime .  
In particular , it was recommended that States examine the experience of countries that have confronted organized crime and the intelligence derived from the analysis of its structures and criminal activities , as useful guiding principles concerning which substantive , procedural and regulatory legislation and organizational structures are necessary to combat the phenomenon .  
In the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , States expressed the wish to strengthen and enhance the capability of States , as well as the United Nations and other relevant global and regional organizations , to achieve more effective international cooperation against organized transnational crime , in relation , inter alia , to closer alignment of legislative texts concerning organized crime .  
The realization at the political and decision-making level of the actual magnitude and complexity of organized transnational crime may serve as a basis for elaborating improved forms of international cooperation , drawing on the pool of knowledge and experience in the scientific community .  
In the area of substantive legislation , efforts against organized transnational crime would be considerably strengthened through the introduction of reforms focused on criminalization of participation in a criminal organization , criminalization of conspiracy or similar forms of inchoate offences , prohibition of laundering of criminal proceeds , and sanctions and other measures , such as the confiscation of illicit proceeds , aimed at defeating the economic power of criminal organizations .  
While acknowledging that the problems covered by the mandate are multidimensional , ranging from structural or systemic to individual and less organized incursions against children , for which no single solution will ever be possible , the report nevertheless offers recommendations as to the first steps of a long , arduous journey .  
NULLWithin the framework of the ILO / ALO joint programme agreed upon at the beginning of 1994 , five Arab regional seminars / expert group meetings were organized on the following topics : employment and labour market policies ; small enterprises development ( for employers ' organizations ) ; employment and labour market programmes in the context of sustainable human development ; and Arab and international labour standards .  
When these warnings were coupled with the timely implementation of previously organized preparedness activities , more than 350,000 people were spared personal physical harm from the largest explosive volcanic eruption of the twentieth century .  
Depending on the nature of the hazard , the location of vulnerable people and assets , and designated responsibilities for action , elements of warning systems may be organized and implemented at local , national , regional or international levels .  
" Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
NULLAlthough no complaints were received about violations directly linked to trade union activities during the period in question , complaints continued to be received of violations of the right to swift and effective justice , involving leaders or workers who were subjected to threats , dismissed or subjected to reprisals because they organized themselves into trade unions or asserted their interests as workers .  
The Council considered the theme of coordinated follow-up by the United Nations system and the implementation of the results of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields , during the coordination segment of its substantive session of 1995 .  
The Administrative Committee on Coordination concurred with the proposal that coordinated support for country-level action should be organized , in the first instance , around three interrelated themes : ( a ) the enabling environment for social and economic development ; ( b ) employment and sustainable livelihoods ; and ( c ) basic social services for all .  
In order to provide coordinated support to the country-level follow-up , ACC agreed that such action be organized , in the first instance , around three inter-related themes : ( a ) the enabling environment for social and economic development ; ( b ) employment and sustainable livelihoods ; and ( c ) basic social services for all .  
In his report to the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session , the Secretary-General noted that representation of ACC members was at the senior official level , that this arrangement had led to a substantive dialogue on coordination issues of mutual interest and that he considered that , should the institution of joint meetings continue to be maintained , they should be organized in the future along similar lines ( A / 48 / 639 , para .  NULL  
The coordination of human rights activities throughout the United Nations system was the subject of debate in the framework of the coordination segment of the Economic and Social Council ( 26-30 June 1995 ) which had on its agenda coordinated follow-up by the United Nations system and implementation of the results of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields . 
FAO provided high quality seed of improved varieties and fertilizer , fruit trees and root stock , assisted in introducing judicious use of pesticide through training and extension activities , trained basic veterinary workers and organized vaccination campaigns against infectious diseases of animals .  
Given current financial constraints and the fact that a limited number of persons had access to the seminars organized under the Programme , audiovisual tapes on various subjects of international law were a convenient tool to place at the disposal of educational institutions of States , especially developing States .  
The Committee also decided to strengthen coordinated support for follow-up action at the country level , through inter-agency task forces organized around three interrelated themes : ( a ) the enabling environment for social and economic development ; ( b ) employment and sustainable livelihoods ; and ( c ) basic social services for all .  
Regional meetings to prepare for the mid-term global review were organized by the relevant United Nations regional commissions in accordance with paragraph 4 ( c ) of General Assembly resolution 49 / 98 , and the substantive inputs provided through the preparatory process at this level were transmitted to the Donor-Recipient Meeting in May-June 1995 and to the High-level Intergovernmental Meeting itself . 
Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
In order to pre-empt drastic measures by the countries of asylum and avoid the chaos and probable violence that massive forced repatriation would trigger inside Rwanda , UNHCR is encouraging large-scale organized voluntary repatriation .  
Mr . TRAORE ( Guinea ) said that the five major conferences organized by the United Nations in recent years on questions relating to social development and the conference on human settlements to be held in Istanbul bore witness to the renewed interest and intensive mobilization of the international community in connection with those issues .  
Also decides that the field-level committees organized by the United Nations system country team , which were established in accordance with paragraph 40 of General Assembly resolution 47 / 199 , should review substantive activities - including draft country programmes , sectoral programmes and projects - prior to their approval by individual organizations , and should exchange experience acquired , on the understanding that the result of the work of the review committee should be submitted to national Governments for final approval through the national focal points ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit further recommendations for enhancing the dialogue , taking into consideration the agreed conclusions of the Economic and Social Council on coordinated follow-up by the United Nations system and implementation of the results of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields , [ 3 ] / the outcome of the ongoing discussions in the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group on an Agenda for Development , and on restructuring and revitalization of the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields ;

it was true that the staff representatives had contacted the external employers to dissuade them from participating in a badly organized survey , at the same time they had informed the employers that an appeal had already been launched and that any unfavourable results would lead to an additional appeal , during the course of which the data and results would have to be discussed , thereby laying any anomaly open to public scrutiny .  
Faced with the rapid internationalization of organized crime and the rise in urban crime , violent crime and juvenile delinquency , every country was concerned with safety , which was essential for the sustained development of society .  
It is plain to see that the United States authorities were fully aware of the existence of a group organized in United States territory , in possession of aeroplanes and engaged in carrying out activities not in line with the legal provision of international air service , using these aeroplanes with clearly provocative purposes , failing to recognize Cuban sovereignty and ignoring the very regulations of the State where those aeroplanes were registered and where the licences to fly them were issued to their pilots .  
The international community , which is still plagued by persistent violence , organized crime , drugs and terrorism , must translate these recommendations into a reality that will guarantee equitable economic and social development and the free flow of trade between the developed and the developing countries .  
With regard to human rights and fundamental freedoms , I would underline the specific , dynamic and publicly visible results of some recent United Nations decisions , such as the establishment of a High Commissioner for Human Rights , the establishment and effective functioning of International Tribunals to prosecute and judge persons accused of serious violations of human rights in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda , and measures taken , or scheduled to be taken , in combating terrorism and organized crime .  
The consolidation of democracy and the construction of a State based on the rule of law and respect for human rights are positive results of the activities of the international community , as reflected in the resolutions of the United Nations and its specialized agencies as well as in the decisions and recommendations handed down by several conferences organized under United Nations auspices or with its support . 
The sixth and last is the growing menace of organized criminal gangs purveying terror , deadly weapons , illicit drugs , indentured labour , and the bodies of our women and children across international borders .  
Joint action in the field of crime prevention and the elimination of international terrorism envisages closer cooperation between central , regional and border authorities through efficient communications and exchange of information ; a commitment to accede to all relevant international conventions that prevent and punish international crime and terrorism ; joining and participation in specialized regional forums for discussing the problems of illicit drug-trafficking , organized crime and regional anti-terrorist cooperation ; and the elaboration of a regional programme to combat organized crime .  
Since the beginning of this decade the United Nations has initiated and organized a number of world summit conferences on a set of global issues ranging from environment to social development , from population to human rights , from women to children and coming up we have the World Food Summit , the aim of which is to find and implement coordinated measures at all levels national , regional , and international to solve problems of importance for the future of all nations .  
The various summits that it has organized in recent years , coupled with its numerous activities covering the entire spectrum of political , social and economic spheres , in all corners of the world , is testimony to the critical role of the United Nations in resolving the national and international problems facing mankind .  
In the meantime , we are pleased that the five major international summits organized by the United Nations , ranging from the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 to Habitat II in Istanbul earlier this year , have proved to be useful in enabling Member States to focus on the various aspects of development and to cultivate a common vision and a comprehensive strategy for cooperation among themselves .  
At the conclusion of the series of high-level world Conferences organized under the auspices of the United Nations in the course of the 1990s , we noted that their common denominator was the promotion of economic and social justice , with the fundamental objective of approaching the structural causes of poverty in a concerted manner .  
Due to our own painful past experiences , my delegation also commends the ongoing efforts of the Department of Public Information in encouraging the development of a free and responsible press as an essential element for effective democratization through its series of regional seminars , organized in cooperation with the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) , and supported by UNDP , on promoting pluralistic and independent media .  
The international community is faced with the growing threat arising from seemingly unstoppable manifestations of transnational organized crime and international terrorism , which menace both the material and institutional foundations of our societies .  
Poland believes , therefore , that the time has come to make a concerted international effort to agree on , and accede to a comprehensive legal instrument : a convention designed to enhance cooperation between States and facilitate the work of law enforcement agencies in fighting transnational organized crime .  
It should be noted that meetings of experts or decision makers and workshops organized within the United Nations system also provide opportunities to exchange updated technological or policy-related information that is vital in elaborating regional or global strategies for social and economic development with the use of remote sensing technologies .  
Decide to combine their efforts to establish effective legal and judicial cooperation in the prevention of crime , especially transnational and organized crime , and the strengthening of criminal justice systems by developing and promoting international instruments pertaining to criminal justice , such as agreements concerning trafficking in women and children , genocide , war crimes , terrorism and drug-related offences .  
The information base will be organized to identify key objectives of sustainable consumption and production and to report on broad strategies adopted to achieve them , specific characteristics and implementation challenges presented by different economic sectors and the policies and actions adopted by Governments and other major actors to address them .  
The coordination of human rights activities throughout the United Nations system was the subject of debate in the framework of the coordination segment of the Economic and Social Council ( 26-30 June 1995 ) which had on its agenda coordinated follow-up by the United Nations system and implementation of the results of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields . 
To establish or strengthen operational coordination machinery for the competent institutions so as to increase the effectiveness of national and regional efforts to combat crime and all threats to democratic security necessitating the use of military , security or civilian police forces , such as terrorism , illicit arms trafficking , drug trafficking and organized crime ;  
In improving natural and human-made disaster prevention , preparedness , mitigation and response , Governments at the appropriate level , including local authorities , and in close consultation and cooperation with such entities as insurance companies , non-governmental organizations , community-based organizations , organized communities , the academic , health and scientific community , should :  
[ Civil , ethnic and religious strife , nuclear armament , armed conflicts , alien and colonial domination , foreign occupation , international economic imbalance , coercive economic measures , poverty , organized crime , and terrorism in all its forms are destructive to sustainable human settlements development and should therefore be renounced by all States . ]  
Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
Also decides that the field-level committees organized by the United Nations system country team , which were established in accordance with paragraph 40 of General Assembly resolution 47 / 199 , should review substantive activities - including draft country programmes , sectoral programmes and projects - prior to their approval by individual organizations , and should exchange experience acquired , on the understanding that the result of the work of the review committee should be submitted to national Governments for final approval through the national focal points ;  
The Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development of the United Nations Secretariat organized a meeting of the Expert Group on the Identification of Principles of International Law for Sustainable Development , within the framework established by the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development 5 / and Agenda 21 , to identify basic principles of international law for sustainable development , consider possible classifications of such principles , and assess their potential practical implications in a legal context , including their role in the interpretation and application of existing international law in the field .  
Support United Nations development efforts by substantially increasing the resources for operational activities on a predictable , continuous and assured basis commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries as stated in General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 of 22 December 1992 and 48 / 162 of 20 December 1993 , while giving particular consideration to the special needs of LDCs as underlined in the programmes of action of major United Nations conferences organized since 1990 ;  
The United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) , UNEP and the United Nations Institute for Training and Research ( UNITAR ) organized their second training course on environmental law and policy ( March / April 1995 ) , designed to familiarize 30 government lawyers and officials from all geographical regions with the provisions of major environmental instruments , and to compose national legislative strategies for implementing relevant conventions .  
In the same resolution , the Council requested the Secretary-General to submit to Member States for their consideration at the fifth session of the Commission a proposal on the creation of a central repository for existing legislative and regulatory measures and information on organizational structures designed to combat organized transnational crime .  
As may be seen , the United States authorities were perfectly aware of the existence of a group organized in the territory of the United States , equipped with aircraft and involved in carrying out activities inconsistent with the provision of international air services , which uses those aircraft for patently political purposes , disregarding Cuban sovereignty and also ignoring the regulations of the very State in which those aircraft are registered and where its pilots had obtained licences to operate them .  
Concerning cooperation in activities directed against organized crime , particularly crime related to illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , the Commission requested Member States to implement the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan against Organized Transnational Crime , [ 1 ] adopted by the World Ministerial Conference on Organized Transnational Crime held at Naples , Italy , from 21 to 23 November 1994 , and subsequently approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 49 / 159 of 23 December 1994 .  
The Council recognized that it continued to be a widespread international activity frequently involving highly organized international syndicates that trafficked in human cargo without regard to the dangerous and inhumane conditions to which they were subjected , and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards .  
It reported that national action to combat organized crime and the illegal movement of persons across international frontiers fell into three categories : ( a ) legislative measures , which included prohibition and provided for imposition of criminal penalties for involvement in such activities ; ( b ) administrative measures , which included the establishment of agencies to deal with such activities , as well as the provision of appropriate training to enhance efficiency ; and ( c ) technical measures , which included preventive and investigative action .  
Given the complexity of the issues involved and the substantial role played by transnational organized crime in global criminal activity , international cooperation , particularly in trans-border law enforcement , is crucial , and measures need to be specified and applied by all concerned .  
In this field , the Division and UNDCP are currently finalizing a joint project proposal for a global project on money-laundering , aiming at the development of the basic legal and institutional framework for more efficient response to transnational organized crime and illicit money traffic .  
As a result of discussions held at the twelfth meeting of the Group of Experts on Public Administration and Finance , organized by the Department for Development Support and Management Services , in New York , in August 1995 , it was recommended that consideration should be given to establishing training programmes addressed to the most senior levels of the civil service at national , subregional or regional levels to improve the capacity of government to deal with emerging issues of civil society for the revitalization of civil services .  
Ministers and other delegates reported on what they had learned about methods of dealing with organized transnational crime , and formulated a declaration on the subject that was to be implemented in part by two region-wide technical cooperation projects .  
The recipients , selected among 106 nominees from Africa , Asia , Latin America and the Caribbean , eastern Europe and the CIS , focused their work on a wide range of topics , such as illegal arms and drug trafficking , money-laundering , organized crime , reform of the correctional system , juvenile delinquency , computerization of criminal justice information and crime prevention .  
The seminar , which will take place at Bishkek , Kyrgyzstan , from 10 to 12 June 1996 , will deal with the following issues : national reports on drugs and organized crime , including a review of existing legislative and institutional frameworks for prevention and control ; impact of drugs and organized crime on security , democracy and economic reform ; prevention and control of corruption ; money-laundering ; legal and institutional reform ; and regional and international cooperation : conclusions and recommendations .  
56 In view of the renewed discussion of the problem of transnational organized crime at the summit of the seven major industrialized countries ( Group of Seven ) , held at Halifax , Nova Scotia , Canada , the Division would be ready to cooperate with the established group of senior experts in identifying significant gaps and options for improved coordination and to propose practical action to fill such gaps .  
One successor State reported that it adhered to all international treaties , and made proposals to the police of other countries to sign new bilateral agreements , particularly on cooperation in combating all types of transnational crime , such as organized crime , drug trafficking and economic and financial crime .  
Spanish legislation laid down very useful additional measures for cases in which the offences were committed by organized gangs , as well as increasing the penalty imposed , such as the dissolution of the organization , closure of its premises , temporary suspension of its activities and professional disqualification of its members .  
Deregulation processes , new technologies , advancements in telecommunications and the creation of expanded economic spaces and market liberalization have had major implications on the development process , and have induced sizable productivity increases and new opportunities for profits , not only for the legal economy , but also , for organized transnational crime , which coexisted with , and benefited by , the legal economy .  
In the same resolution , the Council requested the Secretary-General to submit to Member States for their consideration at the fifth session of the Commission a proposal on the creation of a central repository for existing legislative and regulatory measures and information on organizational structures designed to combat organized transnational crime , taking into account the capabilities of the United Nations Crime and Justice Information Network .  
Part of the problem for the international community in trying to deal with organized transnational crime is that there is no single organizational or behavioural paradigm that provides a constant and accessible target .  
In the field of labour a major method is racketeering , a term used to describe a variety of tactics such as engaging in fraudulent deals or extortion through intimidation and blackmail or the abuse of legitimate positions for illegitimate ends , as in the case of businessmen or labour union and government officials .  In the field of vice , organized crime engages in trafficking in women , which involves international prostitution and sexual slavery .  
Canada has reported that the five major groupings of criminal organizations operating in the country are outlaw motorcycle groups and Aboriginal , Asian , eastern European and Italian organized crime groups , while there is evidence that Colombian drug cartels and the Jamaican " posses " are also active . 
In a confidential assessment completed by the Australian Federal Police , it was noted that Italian organized criminal organizations had penetrated a number of government and non-government agencies and at least one political party and had entrenched themselves in legitimate business to give themselves an air of respectability . 7 Even when they have not achieved this level of penetration , transplanted criminal organizations can still pose formidable challenges to law enforcement , as Chinese organized criminal organizations seem to be doing in South Africa and Russian organized criminal organizations are doing throughout much of Europe . 
38 Discussions about action against organized transnational crime often assume , sometimes implicitly , that if only Governments devoted more efforts and resources at the national level and increased cooperation at the bilateral level , they could make considerable inroads against organized transnational crime .  
National successes , such as the arrest of the leaders of the Cali cartel , and the priority attention given to action against organized transnational crime by world leaders on numerous occasions , including during the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , as well as the increasing willingness of the international community to place corruption under public scrutiny , are all encouraging developments .  
47 The central theme in all the information provided by States on this subject is the need to further enhance international cooperation which , if integrated with national efforts , will form a comprehensive strategy against organized transnational crime .  
48 Argentina has pointed out the merits of common regional strategies and measures against organized transnational crime , while Australia , Canada , Philippines , Republic of Korea and Turkey have drawn attention to the growing number of their bilateral agreements on extradition and mutual assistance in criminal matters .  
51 The response by Australia to the threat of organized crime has developed into a comprehensive set of measures representing a " whole-system " approach , whose principal features include the creation of a specialized agency , emphasis on cooperation and coordination between the different levels of government and between law enforcement agencies , legislation targeting key aspects of organized crime , and a strategic approach to the problem , based on high-quality strategic intelligence and assessments .  
Cuban legislation has made association with criminal intent an offence and has proscribed as punishable offences those types of behaviour associated with the most common forms of organized transnational crime , but has made no provision for controlled deliveries and electronic surveillance .  
Argentina hopes that the members of the international community will deploy the necessary efforts and resources to make it possible , within a reasonable time , to embody in a general convention the political commitments of countries to combat this form of crime and to ensure mutual cooperation to that end .  The conclusion of a general convention would afford the international community a single , efficient and effective instrument for responding suitably to the activities and manifestations of organized transnational crime .  
Since the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan have made a strong statement on behalf of the world community and have already drawn attention to this pressing issue , the focus should be on implementation and development of other practical measures and instruments to combat organized transnational crime .  NULLIn the view of Cuba , in order to combat organized transnational crime it is not enough to merely establish or even ratify various regional or international instruments .  
Italy has expressed its conviction that , in the face of expanding organized transnational crime and the effects of such expansion on global financial systems , the international community should develop an organized and systematized global response .  The innovative aspect of the World Ministerial Conference held at Naples was its emphasis on a global approach to organized transnational crime regardless of its manifestations .  
Italy is of the opinion that the effectiveness of the implementation of the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan will be maximized if , while advancing the process of elaborating a convention or conventions against organized transnational crime , a group of highly qualified national experts develop specific recommendations , which could be immediately implemented at the national level .  
Japan is of the view that , although it is necessary to consider the formulation of extensive and comprehensive measures , including the preparation of legal norms , in order to standardize the systems of Member States against organized crime , it hardly appears that there is currently an adequate common understanding among Member States regarding the actual pattern of illegal activity in question .  
However , in the absence of a general framework or model for international cooperation against organized transnational crime and in view of the diversity of legal systems , as well as the variety of the legislative agenda of countries , while desirable , it might not be appropriate and effective at present to effect world cooperation through such an international convention .  
Meeting the challenge requires the allocation of commensurate resources by the international community and the maintenance of a strong collective political will , keeping in mind that no State can afford to be complacent in responding to organized transnational crime .  
The Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , complemented by the action already taken by the Commission at its fourth session , have set in motion a process of increased awareness of the threat posed by organized transnational crime and of the need for urgent action at the national and international levels .  
Such a programme might include comparative studies of the situation of organized transnational crime around the world and the establishment and maintenance of a central repository for information on legislation , regulatory measures , organizational structures designed to prevent and control organized transnational crime , and bilateral and multilateral cooperation arrangements .  
38 The Holy See suggested that the Congress should focus on the development of new international legal instruments and forms of international jurisdiction to combat transnational crime linked to : speculative financial transactions severely harming the economy of one or more States ; activities , also undertaken by private persons , provoking very severe harm to the environment of other States ; extensive terrorism resulting from organized transnational crime ; and the role of education in combating violence and organized criminality .

The Copenhagen Programme of Action provides a rich source of ideas and practical suggestions that might constitute elements of effective national strategies that would command the required political support at national level , in full recognition of both the diversity of country situations and the need for coherent , organized efforts , with a clear purpose . 
An important policy question in many countries concerns the future role of different forms of community-initiated programmes , particularly their relationship with established , organized voluntary or charitable organizations , their role in delivering publicly financed services , and , on the one hand , the compatibility of their advocacy role in support of the poor and disadvantaged , and on the other , their role as partners in developing and implementing public policy . 
In this area , special attention must be paid to the challenges inherent in improving the quality of services and strengthening social integration through the organized participation of civil society in the formulation of policies and programmes and in control over their management .  
In accordance with General Assembly resolution 45 / 264 and Council decision 1996 / 203 , the coordination segment of the Council should also be devoted to the consideration of the implementation of the agreed conclusions on the theme of the 1995 coordination segment of the Council relating to the coordinated follow-up by the United Nations system and implementation of the results of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields .

If steps are not taken to curb the fighting , then the current situation in the West Bank , which has turned into a grim confrontation between organized forces , may do immeasurable damage to the already shaky efforts for a just , lasting and comprehensive peace in the region .  
Regarding organized crime , a number of specific measures had been taken that responded to part II of Congress resolution 1 , 1 / dealing with action against transnational and organized crime , particularly at the regional level , by updating domestic legislation in the area of money laundering , extradition and mutual assistance ; establishing separate units to deal with organized crime and improving legislation on environmental protection .  
The Secretary-General concluded that , given the complexity of the issues involved and the substantial role played by transnational organized crime in global criminal activity , international cooperation , particularly in trans-border law enforcement , was crucial , and measures needed to be specified and applied by all concerned .  
The Secretary-General submitted to the Commission a report that provided an overview of the differences and similarities between transnational organized crime and terrorist crimes , as well as a summary of the responses received from States . 8 / The report concluded that , while the links between transnational organized crime and terrorist crimes are usually more circumstantial than institutional , both forms of crime present formidable challenges to the international community and require improved international cooperation .  
Especially fruitful cooperation was established with the Agency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation , which funded and organized the printing and dissemination of additional copies of the Compendium of United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice in French , as well as the translation into French of the Basic Training Manual for Correctional Workers , and provided financial support also for the implementation of a comprehensive project in assistance to the criminal justice system for Burkina Faso , which was undertaken in March 1996 .

Concerned with the growing threat of organized crime , including the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , money laundering , illicit traffic in arms , nuclear material and explosive devices , motor vehicles , objects of arts ,  
Aware that organized crime , in its national and transnational dimensions , destabilizes international relations , including interregional , regional , subregional and bilateral cooperation , by exerting influence on politics , the media , public administration , judicial authorities and the economy by establishing commercial or business-like structures ,  
The Institute was encouraged by an increased willingness of African States to base their policy decisions with regard to crime prevention and criminal justice issues on appropriate , adequate , valid and reliable data , as has been indicated by several participants of training activities organized by the Institute . The Institute will continue to undertake advisory missions and train national officials towards establishing appropriate structures and systems for the regular production of the required crime data .

The series of major international conferences organized under the auspices of the United Nations since 1990 had created broad public awareness of the existence of global problems and of the fact that their solution required joint efforts by States and by all of the world 's inhabitants .  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit further recommendations for enhancing the dialogue , taking into consideration the agreed conclusions of the Economic and Social Council on coordinated follow-up by the United Nations system and implementation of the results of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields , and the outcome of the ongoing discussions in the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group on an Agenda for Development ;

Hungary supported any substantive joint international initiatives , convinced that only a universal effort coordinated by the United Nations through its crime-prevention mechanisms could combat transnational organized crime .  
Deeply concerned about the rising level of crime in many parts of the world , jeopardizing political stability and the internal and external security of States , his country supported the draft United Nations framework convention against organized crime submitted by Poland ( A / C . 3 / 51 / 7 ) , and other relevant initiatives . 
The unprecedented globalization and diversification of organized transnational crime constituted a major threat to security , social and economic stability and the democratic development of States .  
In that context , she felt it was important that the terms " organized " and " transnational " crime should not be used to describe controversial political ideas , but restricted to agreed social and legal dimensions .  
While today 's major challenges are undeniably global in character , it is at the local level where their impact is felt most directly , which is why local authorities , such as mayors and metropolitan officials , have become notably more active on global issues and , in some cases , collectively organized across countries on matters of common concern .  
We therefore organized national workshops and two regional workshops to discuss internal problems , to collect input from the persons directly concerned , including those responsible for violations and the victims and those in charge of the administration of justice and those to whom it is administered , to publicize the progress of the research and to make the final results known .  
The participating States reached agreements concerning their future actions in various fields of regional cooperation , such as political cooperation ; stability and development of good-neighbourly relations ; economic cooperation in fields of mutual interest ; joint actions for environmental protection ; promotion of humanitarian , social and cultural cooperation ; cooperation in law enforcement , justice and combating organized crime , terrorism , drugs and arms trafficking .

The level of electoral participation is the result of many different social and political factors , including the impact of civil institutions on the daily lives of Guatemalans , the capacity of political parties to fulfil people 's expectations , the degree of organized participation by citizens in social and political life and their level of civic education , all of which are elements which the package of peace agreements already signed seeks to strengthen .  The electoral process is marred by specific shortcomings which impede the effective enjoyment of the right to vote .  
He noted that humanitarian law initially had been developed in response to ordinary international armed conflicts wherein organized regular armies faced each other , and the content of humanitarian law clearly reflected its origin .  
The Plan includes clear objectives , target audience ( organized and unorganized elements of society ) , strategies ( trainers training , organization of networks , integration of human rights in all educational curricula , utilization of village-level officials to reach out to the community level , promotional campaigns including artistic and cultural activities , development of monitoring and evaluation systems , etc . ) and programmes , including the creation of a human rights training , documentation and research centre ( the Human Rights Academy ) .  
Despite the insecurity and precarious balance of terror that have marked three years of civil war in Burundi , it still has an organized Government that is capable of acting , unlike other countries torn apart by internal conflicts .  
Aspects of organized crime , violence against women and violence in the society , in particular as evident in the alarming increase in xenophobic and racist behaviour in some countries , were all topics that could benefit from information exchange and concerted global efforts and at the same time would address some of the pressing issues facing UNHCR as the refugee protection agency . 
Those topics should be related to the most urgent problems , demanding concerted action of particular importance , such as the struggle against transnational organized crime and terrorism , which had a detrimental impact on the full enjoyment of human rights and constituted a serious danger to peace and security , at both the national and international levels .  
As for the plenary and the workshop topics , the International Federation recommended the following topics : ( a ) global money-laundering , suggested practical measures to combat it ; ( b ) improving extradition measures to deal with fugitives at large ; ( c ) combating organized transnational crime and links with terrorist crime ; ( d ) the ill effects of drug trafficking ; ( e ) combating bribery and corruption in all forms ; and ( f ) combating violent crimes , such as murder , gang rape with violence , armed robbery and extortion .  
In welcoming the participants , he emphasized the growing threat posed by organized transnational crime in all its insidious forms , including theft of and illicit trafficking in motor vehicles .  
Theft of and illicit trafficking in motor vehicles had become another activity of organized crime that employed methods such as corruption of public officials and bribery in the private sector , thereby undermining both democratic and economic institutions .  
The characteristics of those criminal groups , which closely resemble those of groups operating in other countries , their hierarchical structure , internal code of conduct , resources available and ability to penetrate the market , make local organized crime a highly dangerous feature for the newly established social and economic setting of Belarus .  
The main conclusions of the seminar were that relevant international organizations should provide their assistance to countries in need , while the latter should make every possible effort to ratify existing relevant international instruments and to elaborate new ones aimed at combating organized transnational crime .  8 .  Bosnia and Herzegovina indicated that its criminal legislation contained provisions that would allow it to deal with criminal acts carried out by organized crime groups .  
In particular , the country had witnessed during the war forms of crimes that , given their sophistication and the means employed , were classified as organized criminal activities , in particular illicit trafficking in stolen cars , passing of counterfeit banknotes , mostly United States dollars and deutsche mark , and suspicious financial transactions that were considered to cover up money - laundering schemes .  
Owing to the cross-border character of those criminal activities , Bosnia and Herzegovina recognized the importance of and was ready for cooperation with other members of the international community in fighting organized crime , starting with the regional level , where the Government was preparing a draft agreement to be signed with a neighbouring country on mutual assistance and collaboration in preventing and controlling organized crime , illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and terrorism .  
The Cook Islands pointed out that although organized transnational crime had not yet appeared within its territory , law enforcement authorities continued to be informed of developments overseas and had suggested to the relevant political authorities that they consider promulgating legislation to prevent and control organized transnational crime and that they also strengthen international cooperation in the field by acceding to relevant conventions and instruments .  
Its strategy was based on a number of measures , which were summarized as legislative provisions in the areas of proceeds of crime , improvement of law enforcement capabilities , relying on the assistance and expertise of other countries that had already experienced organized crime problems and had developed methods to prevent and control it , better coordination among the relevant national authorities and improved international cooperation .  
The Estonian criminal code considered as organized crime groups those criminal associations composed of three or more members who , on a constant basis and with identified functions , committed serious criminal offences ; using that definition , the Estonian authorities reported that in the last decade more than 10 criminal associations had been identified in the country , 8 of them operating permanently since their formation in the mid-1980s .  
Greece indicated that although no legal provisions had been enacted that dealt with organized transnational crime in particular , its law enforcement agencies were operating against organized crime and making use of criminal legislation designed to tackle illicit drug trafficking , crimes related to firearms , money-laundering , trafficking in illegal migrants and other offences typically committed by organized crime groups , and that a number of characteristics of organized crime had been identified within the framework of EU and were being applied by national authorities to classify an illegal action as a form of organized crime .  
The Government of India had recognized the threat posed by organized transnational crime and measures had been taken at both the organizational and legislative levels by streamlining and reinforcing law enforcement agencies dealing with sophisticated forms of crime , as well as by drafting and passing legislation that dealt with , inter alia , terrorism , drug trafficking , smuggling of valuables and money-laundering .  
Those measures included the establishment of a national standing committee composed of law enforcement officers and academic experts charged with undertaking research on various forms of crime usually carried out by criminal organizations and of a department of public security specialized in organized crime , as well as the development of specialized training programmes for law enforcement personnel and public awareness campaigns to sensitize the Saudi public to the dangers posed by organized crime .  
The Slovak authorities , concerned that illicit drug trafficking , terrorism , arms trafficking , fraud , money-laundering and other criminal activities being carried out by criminal groups with international connections might have a negative impact on the still relatively young national institutions and society in general , had taken steps to strengthen the law enforcement capacity of the national agencies , to create a better understanding among the population of the risks posed by organized crime and to reinforce international cooperation with a view to fighting internationally operating criminal groups .  
Spain submitted a study on the structure and dynamics of organized transnational crime based on information collected at the national level by means of a questionnaire completed by all units of the judicial police .  
Major criminal activities in which organized transnational crime was engaged were violent behaviour and the use of bribery , graft and extortion that could lead to the subversion of the political , social and economic infrastructure , drug trafficking , terrorist activities , kidnapping , prostitution , counterfeiting of currencies , manipulation of financial institutions and markets , international money-laundering and financial fraud , arms smuggling , alien smuggling and computer crime .  
The United States was active on the international scene both at the bilateral level , where it carried out joint operations and cooperated with many countries of different regions , and at the multilateral level , through supporting the work of the United Nations in preventing and controlling crime , as well as through the cooperation with its partners of the Group of Seven major industrialized countries plus the Russian Federation ( G-7 / P-8 ) to coordinate efforts against transnational organized crime .  
The participants expressed deep concern at the aggravation of the situation of organized transnational crime , including illicit drug trafficking , corruption and money-laundering , experienced throughout the region and emphasized the threat posed by those forms of criminal activity to government structures and democratic institutions and to the population in general .  
At the international level , the participants felt that the United Nations and other relevant international organizations should strengthen the provision of technical assistance and advisory services to the countries of the region , and called for the acceleration of the process of developing an international convention against organized transnational crime .  
The importance of controlling the spread of organized crime in the region and enabling the national criminal justice systems to deal with the threat was also recognized by the development of a project that would encompass two training seminars in the application of the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) , with a focus on extradition and organized transnational crime , for judges , prosecutors and police officers from west African States .  
Their main objectives include assistance in drafting and implementing up-to-date legislation in the field of preventing and controlling organized transnational crime and associated criminal activities ; assistance to selected government departments in meeting problems raised by the legal reform process through training and the provision of short-term expertise ; and strengthening of the criminal justice system capacity to fight organized crime , also in cooperation with international counterparts .  
The Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice , at its fifth session , proposed the establishment of a central repository for information on legislation , regulatory measures , organizational structures designed to prevent and control organized transnational crime and bilateral and multilateral cooperation agreements .  
In order to assist countries in need and to render more operational its technical assistance activities , the Division , as requested by the Economic and Social Council in its resolution 1996 / 27 , will also develop a training manual for specialized law enforcement and investigative personnel on action against organized transnational crime .  
The Senior Expert Group , which was also asked to ensure the active follow-up of the implementation of the 40 recommendations it had prepared , continued to meet and to examine various issues relating to international action against organized crime , including the question of the elaboration of a convention against organized transnational crime and the work that is being carried out by the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice with a view to increasing cooperation and coordinated action between the Group of Seven and the relevant United Nations entities .  
The follow-up to the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan has generated both a focused discussion on the issue of organized transnational crime , as well as a wealth of information that would need systematization and analysis to be transformed into practical tools , in particular model legislation , training for law enforcement and advisory assistance for the reform of the criminal justice system .  
It has also become clear that the problems created for countries by organized transnational crime may be solved only through the adoption and implementation of measures that could comprise up-to-date legislation to deal with this criminal phenomenon ; increased capacity of criminal justice systems to enforce existing legislation and control organized transnational crime ; strengthened ability to gather and analyse reliable information on organized crime activities , with a view to devising preventive and control policies ; and more effective inter-state cooperation when investigating , prosecuting or judging organized transnational crime offences .  
The structure of a work programme on organized transnational crime should consist of three main elements : reliable knowledge for informed decision-making ; provision of assistance in the legislative and regulatory fields ; and advisory services and training . 
For purposes of building mutual trust during the first , second and third stages of reintegration , constant contacts shall be established and maintained at the level of unit commanders , contacts among personnel shall be organized and special measures for joint training shall be conducted .  
At the coordination segment of the Council of 1995 , devoted to coordinated follow-up by the United Nations system and implementation of the results of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields , the Council decided that it would ensure the harmonization and coordination of the agendas and work programmes of the functional commissions by promoting a clearer division of labour among them and providing clear policy guidance to them ( thirteenth paragraph of agreed conclusions 1995 / 1 ) .  
Against this backdrop , the Survey is organized as follows : chapter I briefly describes how the developing ESCAP region fares in the emerging global scene ; chapter II shows the recent performance of individual countries in terms of selected macroeconomic and social development indicators which impinge on participation in the globalization and regionalization processes ; chapters III and IV analyse the benefits and risks of integration into the international and regional economy focusing on foreign trade and external finance ( including FDI ) . 
Considering the crucial importance of financial investigations designed to target the wealth of organized crime and thereby deprive it of one of the most important means of its power , the working group agreed that measures could be implemented to detect and monitor the physical transportation of cash and bearer negotiable instruments at the border , subject to strict safeguards to ensure proper use of information thereby obtained and without impeding in any way the freedom of movement of legitimate capital .  
The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung elucidated in an all-round way the questions on the founding of the DCRK , including the problem of forming a supreme national confederal assembly with an equal number of representatives from the north and the south and an appropriate number of representatives of overseas nationals under which a confederal standing committee is organized to discuss and decide on common issues related to the overall interests of the country and nation . 
At the national level , review arrangements , such as the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) - sponsored round-table meetings and the World Bank consultative and aid groups , organized by the least developed countries with the support of the respective organizations , have been further consolidated during the early 1990s , with additional countries joining or rejoining the process and meetings taking place more frequently and on a more regular basis .  
This programme comprises , mainly , the organized transfer of meteorological and hydrological knowledge and proven methodology among the members of the organization , with the overall objective of enabling the national meteorological and hydrological services of members States , especially the least developed and other developing countries , to provide the best possible level of services so as to ensure public safety , management of water resources , support sustainable socio-economic development and safeguard the environment .  
An indigenous participant from South America reported on some activities carried on in the field of indigenous rights and human rights : seminars and workshops had been organized and a number of publications had been distributed with a view to improving understanding of international legal instruments regarding indigenous peoples and monitoring their implementation .  
At the same time , it was evident that the problem was a long-term one of unprecedented complexity , which could not be resolved without the concerted efforts of the entire international community , as had recently been confirmed during the scientific conferences organized to mark the tenth anniversary of Chernobyl .  
While it is evident that crime , particularly economic and organized crime in its transnational dimensions , is detrimental to the sustainable development of the African countries , financial cuts in this research area may have negative long-term consequences for the continent as a whole .  
The Institute continued to use every opportunity , especially its biannual newsletter and its participation in subregional , regional and international meetings , to raise the awareness of all concerned that research in this area is the basis for developing effective practical measures to combat crime , especially transnational organized crime .  
ECA has collaborated with OAU in various meetings and seminars organized in the following areas : domestic mobilization of financial resources for the development of Africa ; the role of African workers and trade unions in subregional and regional economic integration ; the mobilization of resources and public awareness for refugees in Africa ; trade policies and World Trade Organization negotiations ; future relations between the African , Caribbean and Pacific Group of States and the European Union ; and globalization , development and international labour standards .  
In recent experience United Nations electoral assistance has been geared more to smaller missions that provide technical assistance to the electoral authorities of the Member State concerned with coordinating support provided by others or to providing a symbolic United Nations presence , compared with the large missions of prior years that organized , conducted or observed the elections .  
These include ethnic conflicts and disputes arising out of the neglect of the rights of persons belonging to national minorities ; border disputes that could lead to armed conflicts ; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems ; international terrorism ; organized crime and illegal trafficking in arms and drugs ; money-laundering , contraband and clandestine migration ; and transnational environmental degradation .  
The Seventh United Nations International Training Course on Remote Sensing Education for Educators , held at Stockholm and Kiruna , Sweden , from 5 May to 13 June 1997 , was organized by the United Nations Programme on Space Application in cooperation with the Government of Sweden . The course was conducted specifically for the benefit of educators from developing countries with the objective of enabling them to introduce remote sensing courses in their respective academic institutions .  
That mandate is underlined by the Secretary-General in paragraph 11 of his report submitted pursuant to paragraph 2 of Security Council resolution 808 ( 1993 ) ( S / 25704 ) , in which he recalled that the Council had condemned the practice of ethnic cleansing and the massive , organized and systematic detention and rape of women , and reaffirmed that those who commit or have committed or order or have ordered the commission of such acts will be held individually responsible in respect of such acts .  
The 1996 special seminars organized by the Office of Legal Affairs and UNITAR covered the following topics : 13 ( a ) International protection of human rights ; ( b ) International humanitarian law ; ( c ) Refugee law ; ( d ) International law and sustainable development ; ( e ) International economic law ; ( f ) World Trade Organization and the multilateral trading system ; ( g ) International environmental law ; and ( h ) Law of the sea .  
Joint ventures , often utilizing extrabudgetary funds , have been organized with influential media organizations , leaders of civil society , intellectual and educational groups , the business community , appropriate private enterprises and relevant governmental institutions .  
The Parties have agreed to cooperate actively in combating illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , the smuggling of weapons and ammunition and of explosive , toxic and radioactive materials , organized crime , illegal migration and terrorism .  
It is worth noting as background to this that , between April 1994 and September 1997 , the special authorities responsible for internal security and order obtained information about more than 30 planned terrorist attacks against Cuba organized and prepared in Miami , in the United States , more than 15 of which involved the use of explosives of the type known as C _ 4 .  
The Centre established a comprehensive data base on non-governmental organizations and other partners active in human settlements and is expanding its programme with those partners which had participated actively in the Habitat II preparatory process and had organized their own forums and presented their declarations and commitments to Committee II of the Conference . 11 .  At the present time , the main operational activity of the Centre in relation to the Global Strategy for Shelter , is the application of the urban and housing indicators .  
We must be prepared to face other kinds of war : social war against poverty ; judicial war against organized crime ; political war against interventionism in our sovereign economies ; and moral war against the violation of human rights . 
The Secretary-General alluded to this development in his report on the work of this Organization , where he recognized that the same technological means that foster globalization and the transnational expansion of civil society also provide the infrastructure for expanding global networks of uncivil society - organized crime , drug-traffickers , money-launderers and terrorists .  
The world is currently passing through highly interwoven and complicated circumstances , where progress and its horizons mingle with backwardness and its dangers while humanity takes pride in such achievements as economic progress and the development of technology and informatics , it is still suffering from the practices of terrorism , drug trafficking , organized crime , the spread of corruption , the overflow of refugees , the challenges posed by war criminals , crimes of genocide and mass murder , and the negative effects of racism and religious discrimination . 
The same gang of ultraconservatives and gangsters is responsible for the acquittal of hijackers and impedes the use of the term terrorists , while with a silent and mysterious complicity they are bolstered , funded , organized , armed , trained and assigned to intelligence missions .  
These disturbing trends are in contrast with the global consensus that has emerged during major international conferences organized over the past decade under the auspices of the United Nations . They raise legitimate questions as to the very future of the system established to organize international cooperation for development .  
From this standpoint , the countries that are weakest in terms of economic , institutional , material and technological capacity are the most vulnerable developing countries in general and African countries in particular because the automatic effect of the activities of developed countries to prevent and combat organized crime is to condemn such countries to becoming new zones of expansion .  
And yet in my country , which today is in the grip of civil war , almost everything has been done since the sovereign national conference to spare our young democracy from the tragic upheavals inherent in any sudden social change , which in this case consisted of the move from a single-party political regime banning any organized opposition to a veritable explosion of freedoms individual , political and religious .  
Indeed , since the beginning of this decade , each of the global conferences which have been organized under the auspices of the United Nations from the Children \ x { e5b8 } Summit , held in 1990 , to the Conference on Human Settlements , held in Istanbul in 1996 has drawn a link between its own central theme and the pervasive issue of poverty and how its structural causes are to be addressed .  
Among the key objectives of this policy are the sustainable development of the region , based on overcoming poverty , and the participation of organized civil society and the population in general , as well as environmental preservation and the rational and sustainable use of natural resources .  
The World Summit for Social Development organized two years ago in a post-cold-war international environment characterized by profound social , economic and political changes and increasing globalization represented a milestone in the history of international cooperation .  
Although pre _ colonial Rwanda was inhabited by the same peoples as are found there today , namely , the Hutus ( of Bantu origin ) , the Tutsi ( of Hamitic descent ) and the Twas ( pymoid type ) , these three peoples , organized in more or less autonomous kingdoms , did not constitute opposing dominant and dominated ethnic groups . 
As a cooperative activity of UNEP , the World Resources Institute ( WRI ) and IUCN , a set of guidelines on the preparation of biodiversity strategies and action plans was prepared and global biodiversity forums were organized to assist Governments and the public in integrating biodiversity components in improving the understanding of the role of biodiversity in sustainable development and in monitoring implementation and the reporting of progress made .  
On behalf of the Society for the Reform of Criminal Law , the Centre was responsible for the organization of an international conference on the theme " Challenges to criminal justice in a changing world " , which took place at Whistler , British Columbia , from 21 to 24 August 1996 , and examined the challenges posed by increasing opportunities in organized economic crime .  
The Special Rapporteur also observes that article 17 of Protocol II Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 requires that , in the case of displacements carried out for the safety of civilians or for imperative military reasons , the responsible party must take all possible measures . . . in order that the civilian population may be received under satisfactory conditions of shelter , hygiene , health , safety and nutrition .  Article 14 of the same instrument also stipulates a prohibition of starvation of civilians under the control of organized armed forces .  
In order to protect borders effectively it is necessary for countries to enter into bilateral and mulitlateral agreements on transborder police cooperation to deal with organized or unorganized attempts at illegal migration ; set up an information support system for flexible cooperation between internal and external security forces ; train police officers and embassy staff regarding counterfeit documents ; and pay close attention to security aspects of the issuance of visas .  
Workshop / Seminars : These activities can be held before or during the UNISPACE III Conference and could be organized by interested specialized agencies of the United Nations and other international organizations on topics consistent with the objectives of the UNISPACE III Conference that would fit within the agreed structure and that would be relevant to their expertise and mandate . 
Insufficient cooperation among law enforcement agencies , lack of appropriate controls prior to the registration of a motor vehicle , corruption , legislative discrepancies with regard to bona fide possession of a motor vehicle in various regions of the world , a variety of registration practices and differences in the level of training of vehicle inspectors are generally indicated as factors facilitating the involvement of organized transnational crime in this profitable form of illicit trafficking .  
Germany reported that illicit trafficking in motor vehicles was an area covered by the act to suppress illegal drug trafficking and other manifestations of organized crime ( OrgKG ) of 15 July 1992 , which contained specific legal provisions imposing severe penalties . 
The Armenian nationalists were particularly inhumane and used refined methods of cruelty in dealing with their victims , which is attested by signs of desecration of the victims ' bodies , looting and the presence in the surrounding forests of the frozen bodies of many old people , women and children who , unable to break through the encirclement , fell victim to ambushes organized by the Armenians .  
There is need for a coherent set of legislative measures with programmes to achieve strengthening of the small business [ and informal ] sector through the development of appropriate legal , management and financial structures , to enable the sector to develop in a sustained and organized way ; and to initiate and strengthen financing mechanism that enhance small business [ and informal ] sector access to financial services and to reduce the cost of providing and acquiring these services .  
Encouraging States Parties also to take all reasonable steps to put in place effective bilateral , multilateral or regional arrangements for cooperation in the prevention , detection , prosecution and punishment of acts of tourism organized with the purpose of facilitating the effecting of a commercial sexual relationship with a child ,  
A technical seminar will be organized in October l997 , supported by the Government of the Netherlands and the European Union , on the theme of " Preventing and combating the illegal employment of foreigners in selected OECD countries : effectiveness of national policies and action for cooperation at the international level " .  
In this regard , they concurred on the need for a process of transition leading to transparent , fair and inclusive elections which would be organized and supervised by an independent body and monitored by the international community .  
On the other hand , it should be understood that such operations must not be sporadic and that they are planned or prepared by organized armed groups capable of taking concerted action .  
No comparison should be drawn between the legitimate struggle of peoples against colonial or foreign domination , and terrorist acts instigated , organized , directed or financed by one State or any of its organizations against another with the aim of undermining its political , economic and social system or subverting its Government .  
Reiterates that the main objective of the First United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty is to achieve the goal of eradicating absolute poverty and reducing overall poverty substantially in the world through decisive national actions and international cooperation in implementing fully and effectively the relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations and all agreements and commitments agreed upon at the United Nations major conferences and summits organized since 1990 as they relate to poverty eradication ;  
Algeria stated that , in the light of the need to provide States with effective instruments for international cooperation in the fight against organized transnational crime , it supported the spirit and principles embodied in the draft framework convention and hoped that such a convention could soon be adopted .  
Austria continued to be sceptical about the feasibility of elaborating a useful convention against organized transnational crime , as organized crime was a complex phenomenon that raised a number of legal issues that were not adequately covered in the draft .  
Canada pointed out that , while the idea of an " omnibus convention " on organized transnational crime was an attractive proposition that might have the effect of sending a strong public signal that the international community would not accept criminal abuse of the very positive global trend to loosen international boundaries , it had concerns about that proposal , particularly as far as the possible duplication with other legal instruments and cooperative mechanisms was concerned , at least until the issue of whether such a convention was intended to supersede or supplement existing instruments was clarified .  
Finally , Canada expressed the view that the ratification and implementation of existing international instruments represented a first step towards creating a comprehensive and successful legal framework for international cooperation against organized transnational crime .  
Turkey considered that such a convention should also include organized transnational crimes committed in the perpetration of or linked to terrorist acts and illicit trafficking in firearms , in chemical and nuclear materials and in children and other persons .  24 .  The United States noted that Member States had not had sufficient time to discuss the question of the elaboration of an international convention against organized crime and to exchange their views on the issue .  
Finally , the United States pointed out that , although it was engaged in a continuous process of seeking and establishing , whenever possible , more effective bilateral and multilateral means of combating all forms of organized transnational crime , it agreed that the time had come to give serious consideration to the elaboration of a single new international convention in that area .  
Concerned with the growing threat of organized crime , including the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , money-laundering , illicit traffic in arms , nuclear material and explosive devices , motor vehicles , objects of art ,  
Aware that organized crime , in its national and transnational dimensions , destabilizes international relations , including interregional , regional , subregional and bilateral cooperation , by exerting influence on politics , the media , public administration , judicial authorities and the economy by establishing commercial or business-like structures ,  
Welcoming the fact that the call of the World Conference on Human Rights for a United Nations system _ wide approach to human rights issues has been reflected in the recommendations of major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields ,  
Welcoming the fact that the call of the World Conference on Human Rights for a United Nations system _ wide approach to human rights issues has been reflected in the recommendations of major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields ,  
Recent experience has demonstrated , however , that United Nations assistance rendered in the field of electoral assistance is geared more and more to smaller missions , which give technical assistance to the electoral authorities of the Member State concerned in coordinating the electoral support provided by others , or provide a symbolic United Nations presence , rather than the large missions of prior years for which it organized and conducted ( e.g . Cambodia ) or observed ( e.g .

We recognize that poverty , unemployment and other obstacles to human development , such as civil strife and war , as well as crime and social injustices , render our States and societies vulnerable to transnational organized crime and corruption ; and we are , therefore , resolved to undertake and intensify all necessary steps and measures to address such problems , with the cooperation and support of the international community .  
We express our strong hope to participate in the work of the inter-sessional open-ended intergovernmental group of experts of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice1 charged with elaborating a preliminary draft of an international convention against organized transnational crime , so as to fully support the efforts of the Commission in elaborating such a convention , and we call upon the Commission to pursue those efforts as a matter of the utmost urgency .  
We call upon donor countries , the United Nations Development Programme , the World Bank , the African Development Bank and other international , regional and national funding agencies to give favourable consideration to project proposals on strengthening our national or regional capacities and creating the expertise required for the prevention and control of organized transnational crime and corruption , elaborated by the Division and submitted to them .  
We regard the project proposals that we have reviewed ( reflected in annex III of the report of the Regional Ministerial Workshop ) as viable and important regional initiatives , containing the basic elements of a concerted approach to the problems faced by all States of the region in the prevention and control of organized transnational crime , money-laundering and corruption .  
In his opening address , the Prime Minister of Senegal expressed the hope that the Regional Ministerial Workshop would focus on strengthening international cooperation in technical and substantive fields , in order to improve the professional skills of criminal justice personnel and thereby enable them to achieve greater success in the fight against organized transnational crime and corruption .

Regarding the issue of development of Africa , he reminded the Committee that in 1993 Japan had played host to the economic summit of the seven major industrialized countries in Tokyo and had proposed a new development strategy in the context of the newly emerging realities of the post-cold-war era .

Civil peace and security are endangered by the combined impact of various forms of violence and conflict between ethnic , religious , linguistic and other groups , the rise of xenophobia and aggressive nationalism , of fanaticism and fundamentalism of different kinds , of terrorism and organized crime , exclusion and discrimination directed against vulnerable groups within societies , proceeding from a culture of violence and war .  
Finally , at the regional level , joint training in investigation techniques ( profiling , search methods , controlled deliveries etc . ) will be organized , and a framework for periodic consultations on operational issues ( trends , concealment methods etc . ) will be set up .

A document entitled Education for a viable future in the Americas is being prepared , which reflects international thinking on the subject , following the meeting on that theme organized by UNESCO in Thessaloniki , Greece , in December 1997 .  
It is understood that transnational organized crime exists when three or more persons agree to organize or are organized , on a permanent or recurrent basis , to commit acts that in themselves or when combined with others have as an objective or result the commission of a crime or crimes that are identified in article 2 and over which two or more States Parties have established their jurisdiction , in accordance with article 9 of this Convention .

It has also formulated a proposal for a project whose main objective is to assess the major and emerging groups involved in transnational organized crime according to their level of dangerousness .  
The degree of dangerousness will be assessed through a multidimensional approach based on different conceptual areas and related indicators that characterize organized criminal groups , such as financial strength , use of violence , capacity to infiltrate public institutions and legal environment in which they operate .  
The aim of the latter project is to publish a world report on organized crime every two years , which will provide qualitative and quantitative information on trends in organized crime activities and structures of groups operating at the international level ; types and distribution of illicit markets ; major international initiatives ; and developments in national legislation against organized crime .

His delegation was convinced that the final text must meet at least two conditions : it must result in a consistent and well _ organized instrument , which did not duplicate existing international instruments or those under discussion in other forums ; it must be effective , which meant that it must enable States to act effectively against the scourges with which the protocol dealt .  
Encouraging States Parties also to take all reasonable steps to put in place effective bilateral , multilateral or regional arrangements for cooperation in the prevention , detection , prosecution and punishment of acts of tourism organized with the purpose of facilitating the effecting of a commercial sexual relationship with a child ,

Enforcement in the Convention according to the latter meaning of the term , and thus establishment of the right of States Parties to refuse extradition on the grounds that the State requesting extradition may impose an unreasonably mild punishment on the offender , would be a risky though progressive step towards limiting even further the possibilities for members of organized criminal groups to find a safe haven .  
For combating such negative phenomena as drugs , organized crime and money-laundering , strengthened international cooperation by combining national efforts , the adoption of multilateral norms and international codes of conduct , as appropriate , and the development of multilateral regional or subregional cooperation , wherever suitable , are obvious areas requiring ongoing United Nations initiatives and action .

Transnational crime , which may or may not be committed by organized criminal groups , also constitutes a new challenge to conventional models of the rule of law because the rule of law is based on a traditional framework in which sovereign powers , including those to make , enforce and administer the law , are exercised at the national level .  
Many countries share a common legal definition of what is considered to be an organized criminal group ( for example , a group composed of three or more individuals , driven by the pursuit of profit , suspected of committing or having committed serious criminal offences and existing for a prolonged or indefinite period of time ) .  
Transnational organized crime includes tax evasion , the forgery of clothes and electronic equipment , fraud against international financial institutions , unfair competition on international markets , industrial espionage , the import and export of protected plants and animals , trafficking in works of art and the illegal dumping of toxic industrial waste .  
Related to this assumption is the implicit association of this type of activity with organized crime , therefore conveying the notion that those engaged are full-time criminal entrepreneurs who have developed expertise and accumulated resources in previous illegal activities .  
Therefore criminal groups spread into sectors where the risk of being arrested and heavily sentenced is relatively low , especially compared to the attractive economic return . 15 Responses are advocated that may reduce such normative inconsistencies while reducing the mobility of transnational organized groups .

The Ministers recalled that the illicit trade in small arms in the region is mainly associated with drug trafficking , terrorism , transnational organized crime , mercenary activities and other criminal acts , and held that crime prevention must therefore be an integral part of the approach to combating the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects . 
We are fully aware of the close and complex link between terrorism , organized crime , drug-trafficking , the illegal exploitation of natural resources and the illegal trafficking and easy availability of small arms and light weapons .  
In these cases , executive detentions by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General are justified on the basis of security imperatives that involve sensitive intelligence information on extremist and organized crime groups that can not be shared with a court , can not be used as evidence in a trial , or must be invoked because of deficiencies in normal criminal court process itself .  
The illicit trade in small arms and light weapons is directly linked to social , economic and humanitarian problems caused by the domestic civil confrontations and international conflicts , as well as by the ruthless action of organized crime , especially that of terrorism and drug traffickers .  
Such acts were financed from United States territory by organizations led by persons of Cuban origin who practised violence and terror on a daily basis ; terrorist acts against Cuba were organized from there , using mercenaries paid by those organizations , as recognized recently by the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the use of mercenaries as a means of impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination ; and they were trained there , as numerous news media had documented on more than one occasion .

New and more dangerous phenomena have emerged that affect the security of States and their citizens , such as international terrorism , drug trafficking , transnational organized crime , the illegal exploitation of natural resources and other factors that threaten the regional and international security balance of our contemporary world .  
He noted with regret that despite all the collective commitments made by heads of State and Government at the various international conferences held over the past decade and in the Millennium Declaration particularly with regard to social development and poverty eradication , national , regional and international challenges to the fulfilment of those commitments , such as armed and civil racial conflicts , genocide , enforced displacement , the proliferation of drugs , organized crime and terrorism against innocent persons were increasing in an unprecedented manner .  
His delegation called for the strengthening of regional and international mechanisms designed to contain conflicts and their destructive consequences , curb the factors that led to their outbreak and prosecute those responsible for acts involving human rights violations , terrorism , trafficking of drugs and prohibited weapons , organized crime and money-laundering , among others .  
Other requirements in the amount of $ 150,000 would provide for conversion of public information material to HTML for web sites in six official languages ; production of TV and radio products ; public information production costs for translation into local languages and events organized at the national / regional level by United Nations information centres ; the follow-up of the outcome of the Assembly ; the production of press kits ; update of the 1999 Ageing exhibit and production of two banners at the Assembly site .
