In improving the order of market the economy and developing the functions of customs , we should mainly launch incessant struggles against smuggling , work in coordination with concerned departments to crack down on tax rebate fraud , illegal remittance and procurement of foreign exchange and other criminal activities .

At this time when the entire nation is making unremitting efforts to realize the " 10th Five Year " plan , the heretical " Falungong " organization has stirred up trouble again and again , wreaked social havoc , interfered with the normal lives of the masses , and acted as an anti-China tool of hostile Western powers .  This has thoroughly exposed the sinister political motives of Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " and made clear that to achieve complete victory in the struggle still requires our continued efforts .  
The ulterior motive of Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " cult in spreading rumors to confuse the public , breaking the law and creating trouble is to create chaos and social disorder in China , disrupt people 's normal work , study and daily life , and interfere with the central task of economic development , so that they can realize their political aim of overthrowing the leadership of the Chinese communist party and changing China 's socialist system .

By appropriating religious terminology in their attempts to disrupt public order , undermine social stability , defy state law , and endanger people 's lives , Li Hongzhi and the " Falungong " organization under his control have become a highly influential evil force that poses a grave danger to people and society .  Their organizational activities and roles in society are despised by all normal religious organizations that preach good deeds to people .

Through these chats about normal , everyday matters , we found that before becoming obsessed with " Falungong , " many female members had been good employees at work , as well as good mothers , wives and daughters at home ; it was only after being poisoned by Li Hongzhi that they became lost and estranged from their moral sense , sensibilities and affections , and committed some illegal acts .

The Chinese Government banned Falungong in accordance with the law for the very purpose of safeguarding the fundamental interests of the broad masses of people .  By dragging the overwhelming majority of Falungong practitioners back to normal social life from the dangerous " realm , " it has saved the lives of many obsessed practitioners and reflected the strong sense of responsibility it , as a staunch human rights protector , has toward people 's lives .  
The rules of the market economy can not be established without a complete legal system , nor can they be established without effective moral support and constraints ; this is because the law and morality regulate people 's orientation of conduct and value and imperceptibly become social order and the self-discipline norm acknowledged by most people in society ; the law and morality interact , promote each other , and play an important role in ensuring the normal operation of the market .

By appropriating religious terminology in their attempts to disrupt public order , undermine social stability , defy state law , and endanger people 's lives , Li Hongzhi and the " Falungong " organization under his control have become a highly influential evil force that poses a grave danger to people and society .

The Chinese Government banned Falungong in accordance with the law for the very purpose of safeguarding the fundamental interests of the broad masses of people .

The rules of the market economy can not be established without a complete legal system , nor can they be established without effective moral support and constraints ; this is because the law and morality regulate people 's orientation of conduct and value and imperceptibly become social order and the self-discipline norm acknowledged by most people in society ; the law and morality interact , promote each other , and play an important role in ensuring the normal operation of the market .
