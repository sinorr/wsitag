He said : The treaty of friendly cooperation and mutual assistance signed between the two countries four decades ago is a great event in the history of bilateral relations .  It has not only promoted exchanges and cooperation in numerous spheres between our two countries but also strengthened the unity and friendship between our two sides and played a major role in safeguarding world peace .

The foundation of the two countries ' complementary and mutually beneficial economic , trade , and military relationship is solid ; China is Russia 's sixth largest trading partner , and Russia is China 's ninth ; last year their bilateral trade totalled $ 8 billion .  
Still more important , following the reliable legal guarantee for all-round development of bilateral relations provided by the " Sino-Russian Treaty of Good neighborly Friendship and Cooperation , " a new page will be turned in this relationship in the new century , and in the face of the new-style state relations of mutual trust and benefit established by China and Russia , the disintegration strategy pushed by the sole superpower in combination with its cold war mentality unilateralism will be of no avail .

Thus while it acknowledged that individual countries bear the primary responsibility for the attainment of the goals of the conference , it also recognized that the support of the international community as a whole including of the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , bilateral donors , non-governmental organizations and all actors of civil society will be crucial if we are to realize all the objectives of the conference .  
While in the beginning of this partnership large amounts had to be contributed towards emergency measures , today the extensive bilateral development cooperation focuses mainly on the consolidation of structural adaptation processes , the rehabilitation of social infrastructures , the promotion of private enterprises ( including vocational training ) , agricultural development , and the protection of the environment and natural resources .  
The European Union has taken a leading role in the strengthening of regulatory regimes , including in the establishment of the nuclear safety account , administered by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , the G 24 coordinating mechanism , the European Union 's Poland-Hungary Aid for the Reconstruction of the Economy ( PHARE ) and Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States ( TACIS ) programmes , the European Atomic Energy Community loan facility , coordinated support from the international financial institutions for the energy sector , and bilateral cooperation projects .  
At the domestic level , the national Government , owing to radical economic reforms , has made progress in the far-reaching process of bilateral cooperation with countries committed to the peaceful use of nuclear energy .  
This commitment is reflected in the vital and multifaceted relations that we have with African Governments both at the bilateral level and through a range of multilateral agencies , and which take the form of the continuing engagement of Canadian non-governmental organizations throughout the continent , and growing number of partnerships in the private sector . 
The Helms-Burton Act also calls for an annual report that would describe all bilateral assistance provided to Cuba by other countries , including humanitarian assistance ; Cuban debt to third countries , as well as the amount exchanged , forgiven or reduced ; identification of Cuban trading partners ; and a description of the joint ventures completed or under consideration by foreign nationals and business firms .  
Despite the importance of bilateral relations and successful regional organizations , the United Nations remains the principal mechanism capable of ensuring the transition from a bipolar and confrontational world to a multipolar and democratic one . 
Thanks in part to General Assembly support for the universal principles enshrined in the Charter and in part to the intervention of United Nations peacekeeping forces , the countries which emerged following the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia are now increasingly heading towards the objective of peacefully resolving mutual problems on a bilateral basis and through regular multilateral contacts , thereby lessening the need for international involvement and mediation .  
The successful expansion of bilateral neighbourly relations based on internationally accepted principles can not be replaced by the imposition of superfluous and ambitious regional associations .  
We support the conclusion contained in this report that new and additional financial resources from all potential funding sources , especially at the bilateral and regional levels , are necessary to address a variety of persisting economic problems of the affected States , in particular the long-term effects of sanctions on their economies .  
The General Assembly also called on developed countries to refrain from threats to impose commercial and financial restrictions , blockades , embargoes , and other economic sanctions on developing countries , because such practices violate the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and international bilateral and multilateral commitments .  
Recalling the paramount importance of the bilateral talks mediated by some powers with legitimate interests in facilitating a comprehensive solution to the situation in the Middle East , the Brazilian delegation also pays tribute to the indisputable role the United Nations has been playing over the years in this field , not only by means of peacekeeping , but also through economic , social and humanitarian assistance .  
The machinery of the process took the form of numerous negotiating tracks , from a bilateral track to negotiate a withdrawal from the occupied territories , to a multilateral track to negotiate regional questions , such as disarmament , water , Palestinian refugees and the establishment of regional economic cooperation , which , from the outset , was believed to be the next logical step once peace had been secured through a just and comprehensive political settlement .  
The worsening of the external , bilateral and multilateral debt crisis of developing countries ; the erosion and unpredictable nature of resources from export earnings ; restrictions on access to markets ; the lack of fairness in international trade ; one-sided views which affect cooperation ; and the unilateral nature of the world decision-making process : all these highlight in different ways the various obstacles which remain on the path to development .  
The most prominent of these is the elimination or consolidation of redundant paragraphs and the adoption of new language for operative paragraph 10 of last year 's resolution , namely resolution 50 / 69 , which has become operative paragraph 8 in the current draft , so as to urge all States taking interest in conducting activities in outer space to keep the Conference on Disarmament informed of the progress of bilateral or multilateral negotiations relating to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , if any such negotiations take place outside the Conference on Disarmament . 
It further emphasizes the paramount importance of strict compliance with existing arms limitations and disarmament agreements relevant to outer space , including bilateral agreements , and with the existing legal regime concerning the use of outer space , including wide participation in such a legal regime .  
The remaining operative part calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to the objectives and to relevant existing treaties , and urges them to keep the Conference on Disarmament informed of the progress of any bilateral or multilateral negotiations relating to the prevention of such arms races so as to facilitate its work .  
Our previous bilateral efforts have demonstrated that nuclear disarmament is an extremely intricate process involving careful trade-offs , specialized and highly tailored verification , and very sensitive security calculations .  
Requests improved annual reporting on financial flows , including allocations / expenditures , based on consistent criteria and related to the costed elements of the Programme of Action , including a clear account of levels and trends of funding by source ( bilateral , multilateral ( both core and non-core ) and private funds , domestic allocations and the like ) ;  
Calls upon the international community to seek to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including , as mutually agreed , on concessional and grant terms ;  
Also calls upon the international community to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including ( , as mutually agreed , ) on concessional and grant terms ;  
In resolution 45 / 209 , the Assembly stressed the need for comprehensive national , bilateral and multilateral measures to accelerate the exploration and development of energy resources in developing countries , and the need to take into consideration environmental and developmental concerns as they applied to all countries in accordance with their respective capabilities and their responsibilities for global environmental degradation .  
Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;  
In this respect , we regard as encouraging the agreement reached between the Government and UNITA to establish a new timetable in order to move the peace process forward , as well as the resumption of bilateral negotiations to complete the establishment of joint armed forces .  The recent conclusion of an agreement to this end between the two parties is a positive step , which , in spite of certain difficulties which emerged , deserves to be encouraged and supported .  
That principle created a presumption in favour of national jurisdiction for the reasons contained in the report of the Ad Hoc Committee , namely that the parties concerned would work within existing bilateral and multilateral arrangements , applicable law would be more certain , criminal actions would be less costly and the penalties involved would be clearly defined and easy to enforce .  
Donor Governments should consider increasing their financial support to the initiatives undertaken by developing countries and countries with economies in transition , through bilateral and multilateral channels , for national , regional ( including support to regional organizations ) and global programmes .  
Requests the Secretary-General to facilitate , as appropriate , the creation of joint initiatives , including bilateral activities , and the joint formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects benefiting developing countries and countries in transition , involving interested donor countries and funding agencies , particularly the United Nations Development Programme and the World Bank , with a view to establishing and maintaining efficient criminal justice systems on a country-by-country basis as an essential component of developmental efforts ;  
We commit ourselves to strengthening existing financial mechanisms and , where appropriate , developing new mechanisms for financing the implementation of the Habitat Agenda , which will mobilize increased sources of finance - public , private , multilateral , and bilateral - at the international , regional , national and local levels , and will promote the efficient , effective and accountable allocation and management of resources .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , and bilateral - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support sustainable human settlements development .  
Raising the priority of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development among multilateral and bilateral donors and mobilizing their support for national , subregional and regional plans of action of developing countries , especially for interested beneficiary countries ;  
Inviting multilateral and bilateral donors to support countries , particularly developing countries , in their efforts to pursue enabling strategies through which governments , local authorities , communities , and the private and cooperative sectors can form partnerships to participate in the provision of adequate shelter , including social housing and sustainable human settlements development activities ;  
Assessments of the potential impact of variability and change of climate and the atmospheric environment were conducted by some countries through bilateral and multilateral support and as part of the UNEP-implemented World Climate Impact and Response Strategies Programme concerning areas both within and outside their national jurisdiction , including studies of vulnerability to sealevel rise , effects on agriculture , forests and other sensitive and important sectors , either as single or regional group efforts .  
Fourth , disbursements of official development finance ( ODF ) fell : concessional disbursements of official development assistance ( ODA ) rose in both nominal and real terms , but multilateral net lending on non-concessional terms dropped substantially and bilateral net lending on non-concessional terms rose only slightly .  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
In the present instance , Cuba is requesting reopening of the item entitled " United Nations Decade of International Law " , in particular the consideration of respect for international law and its progressive development and codification , which today are under threat from unilateral interpretations by a super-Power which is seeking to impose its bilateral policy interest not only on the political action of the Organization but also on the legal thinking of the sovereign States Members of the international community .  
Requests improved annual reporting on financial flows including allocations / expenditures based on consistent criteria , relating to the costed elements of the Programme of Action , including a clear account of levels and trends of funding by source ( bilateral , multilateral ( both core and non-core ) , private , domestic allocations , etc . ) ;  
In the present instance , Cuba is requesting reopening of the item entitled " United Nations Decade of International Law " , in particular the consideration of respect for international law and its progressive development and codification , which today are under threat from unilateral interpretations by a super-Power which is seeking to impose its bilateral policy interest not only on the political action of the Organization but also on the legal thinking of the sovereign States Members of the international community .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 50 / 146 , requested the Secretary-General to facilitate the creation of joint initiatives , including bilateral activities , and the joint formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects , benefiting developing countries and countries in transition , involving interested donor countries and funding agencies , particularly the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) and the World Bank , with a view to establishing and maintaining efficient criminal justice systems on a country-by-country basis as an essential component of developmental efforts .

Stresses the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , in supporting the efforts of the Central American Governments to implement the new programme for the sustainable development of Central America ;  
Recognizing that El Salvador is at a complex stage in the process of consolidating peace , which calls not only for the implementation of the remaining commitments under the Peace Agreement but also for a new approach involving the implementation and consolidation of medium-term and long-term national development programmes and strategies aimed at resolving the structural problems that are the cause of tension and social instability , and emphasizing the importance and necessity of international technical and financial assistance , both bilateral and multilateral ,  
UNDCP will seek to be more closely engaged in securing the involvement and active commitment of potential bilateral donors , international financial institutions , agencies and programmes within the United Nations system and regional organizations involved in development work .  
In addition , the Council recommended that the expert group should , in the light of the discussion at the workshop held during the Ninth Congress , explore ways and means of increasing the efficiency of extradition and related mechanisms of international cooperation in criminal matters , having due regard to the rule of law and the protection of human rights , including where appropriate such measures as : ( a ) the provision of technical assistance in the development of bilateral and multilateral agreements based on the United Nations model treaties and other sources ;  
The General Assembly in resolution 50 / 146 , paragraph 9 , requested the Secretary-General to facilitate , as appropriate , the creation of joint initiatives , including bilateral activities , and the joint formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects benefiting developing countries and countries in transition , involving interested donor countries and funding agencies , particularly UNDP Programme and the World Bank , with a view to establishing and maintaining efficient criminal justice systems on a country-by-country basis as an essential component of developmental efforts .  
That could include the development of model legislation dealing with matters such as the exercise of jurisdiction over stateless vessels on the high seas ; providing legal authority for stopping , boarding and searching vessels in accordance with article 17 of the 1988 Convention ; and the collection , translation and distribution of relevant legislation , of bilateral and multilateral agreements , and of national and international memoranda of understanding between States , agencies or other entities such as private companies .  
The United Nations system , the World Bank and International Finance Corporation ( IFC ) system and other multilateral and bilateral organizations have continued to provide invaluable support in the formulation of national mineral sector policies , in the enhancement of legal and fiscal systems , in facilitating forums for multi-disciplinary dialogue and in the deepening of necessary institutional infrastructure .  
Directly tied into this process has been the continued dissemination of individual country information through the very successful investment seminars and round-table discussions which have enabled private companies , financial institutions and technical advisers to gain a better understanding of various countries and their risk factors , and to develop good working relationships with private and government officials and the multilateral and bilateral aid institutions , all with a view towards creating a sustainable economic and environmentally sound base of operations on which to build within the various countries .  
The United Nations system , World Bank and the IFC system and other multilateral and bilateral organizations have provided invaluable assistance to industry and host Governments in respect of mineral resource technical support and advice ; training of national staff in all skills required in mineral resource development ; hosting of regional promotional round-table forums to facilitate dialogue between industry , Government and facilitating organizations ; institutional structuring and reforms ; capacity building ; provision of research on trends in mineral , fiscal and legal policies ; and for commodity supply and demand studies .  
In addition , as project funding in emerging markets requires a multi-disciplined approach , including the cooperation and coordination of foreign investors , commercial banks , multilateral and bilateral banks and agencies , the multilateral and bilateral banks and agencies have supplied much needed risk mitigation through co - and re-insurance , through lending of structured finance and through provision of senior loan guarantees which have enabled private investors and local joint venture partners to invest in projects in various jurisdictions . 
Continue to support the role of multilateral and bilateral banks and agencies in the provision of structured finance including loans and equity ; senior lender guarantees ; political risk insurance and re-insurance ; in the development of small supporting businesses , through soft loans ; and in the development of internal financial institutions through loans and guarantees and the introduction of stock exchanges etc .  
One successor State reported that it adhered to all international treaties , and made proposals to the police of other countries to sign new bilateral agreements , particularly on cooperation in combating all types of transnational crime , such as organized crime , drug trafficking and economic and financial crime .  
In addition , the Council invited Member States to cooperate in that regard , with a view to encouraging progressive alignment regarding , inter alia , international cooperation , extradition and other bilateral and multilateral modalities of mutual assistance in criminal matters and requested the Secretary-General to report thereon to the Commission at its fifth session .  
38 Discussions about action against organized transnational crime often assume , sometimes implicitly , that if only Governments devoted more efforts and resources at the national level and increased cooperation at the bilateral level , they could make considerable inroads against organized transnational crime .  
48 Argentina has pointed out the merits of common regional strategies and measures against organized transnational crime , while Australia , Canada , Philippines , Republic of Korea and Turkey have drawn attention to the growing number of their bilateral agreements on extradition and mutual assistance in criminal matters .  
Such a programme might include comparative studies of the situation of organized transnational crime around the world and the establishment and maintenance of a central repository for information on legislation , regulatory measures , organizational structures designed to prevent and control organized transnational crime , and bilateral and multilateral cooperation arrangements .  
Both sides will make efforts and cooperate with other countries for an early conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty , value the speedy coming into effect of the Chemical Weapons Convention and call for accelerated progress in further improving the effectiveness of the Biological Weapons Convention . The two sides are ready to step up bilateral and multilateral cooperation on effective and responsible oversight of transfers of conventional weapons , particularly to regions of conflict .  
To promote the fundamental principles of maintenance of the rule of law and good governance and to increase the capacity of States to devise and implement effective , integrated and consolidated strategies and measures at the national level , and to put into effect bilateral and multilateral arrangements at the regional and international levels .  
This will result in an increase in bilateral and multilateral arrangements at the regional and international levels , together with the promulgation of more effective strategies and measures at the national level to deal with sophisticated forms of crime ;  
The space research activities in Morocco , related to remote sensing and environmental monitoring , were characterized by an active , realistic and long-term policy at both the national level ( coordination , information , training and project formulation ) and the international level ( participation in forums , international committees and bilateral and multilateral projects ) .  
Such steps included : lifting the blockade on the Palestinian territories ; refraining from violating the terms of the bilateral agreements including the imposition of collective punishment in violation of international humanitarian law ; redeploying Israeli forces from Hebron ; establishing a corridor between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip which would ensure contacts between the Palestinian territories ; releasing all Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons ; and pressing forward with the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Area B on the West Bank .  
Also calls upon the international community to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including ( , as mutually agreed , ) on concessional and grant terms ;  
In its decision 96 / 15 , entitled " Allocation of resources to country programmes of the United Nations Population Fund " , the Executive Board reaffirmed that , in order to achieve the goals of the International Conference on Population and Development , there was a need for adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels as well as of new and additional resources to developing countries from all sources , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources .  
Furthermore , while some countries apply the principle of the total programme approach and national execution to all sources / projects of technical cooperation , in most countries existing NEX development planning structures / procedures do not provide for the integration of activities other than those falling strictly within the UNDP country programme ( excluding , for example , projects executed through bilateral aid , development financing institutions , multilateral organizations , trust funds and so forth ) .  
As the implementation of the Habitat Agenda will require adequate funding , we must mobilize financial resources at the national and international levels , including new and additional resources from all sources - multilateral and bilateral , public and private .  In this connection , we must facilitate capacity-building and promote the transfer of appropriate technology and know-how .  
The Ministers , without prejudice to their respective positions of principle regarding the political status of East Timor , continued their discussions on those substantive issues which have been identified related to an eventual framework for the achievement of a just , comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution to the question of East Timor as well as other related issues , inter alia , the preservation and promotion of the cultural identity of the East Timorese people and bilateral relations between Indonesia and Portugal .  
Contacts , coordination and cooperation among these bodies should be encouraged .  In particular , it is of fundamental importance that all existing technical , bilateral and multilateral activities involving technical cooperation be well focused and that the means for coordinating such activities be studied in order to avoid overlapping " ( item 6 of the provisional agenda , entitled " Most effective forms of international cooperation for the prevention and control of organized transnational crime at the investigative , prosecutorial and judicial levels " ) ( E / CONF . 88 / 4 , para .

" To that end , in certain subregions , coordination of bilateral and multilateral technical assistance to combat illicit trafficking of drugs and precursors will be improved , taking into account national priorities and in a continuous dialogue with the competent national authorities " .  
Under the new initiative it would be determined after the initial three-year period whether Naples terms , together with comparable relief by non-Paris Club bilateral donors and commercial creditors , would be sufficient to put the country in a sustainable debt-service position .  
The Committee considered that the mandate received from the General Assembly did not require an opinion on bilateral issues between member States , which is why it makes no statement on the specific measures adopted by the Government of the United States of America in relation to Cuba , such as the embargo imposed for over three decades , while nevertheless noting that such measures raise legal questions in the light of the norms established in articles 18 and 19 of the charter of the Organization of American States ;  
Member States shall promote bilateral , regional multilateral and global law enforcement cooperation and assistance , including , as appropriate , mutual legal assistance arrangements to facilitate the detection , apprehension and prosecution of those who commit or are otherwise responsible for serious transnational crimes and to ensure that law enforcement and other competent authorities can cooperate effectively on an international basis .

In respect of international cooperation and practical technical assistance , the Governments were making efforts to strengthen the rule of law through international cooperation and assistance , improving policy development , increasing the use of bilateral and multilateral agreements and promoting the establishment of integrated regional policies , programmes , plans and mechanisms to prevent crime and ensure justice .  
Aware that organized crime , in its national and transnational dimensions , destabilizes international relations , including interregional , regional , subregional and bilateral cooperation , by exerting influence on politics , the media , public administration , judicial authorities and the economy by establishing commercial or business-like structures ,  
Contributing to this improvement were the slight deceleration of inflation ( as of July 1996 , 17.6 per cent on an annual basis ) ; increase in available foreign exchange owing to a growing number of visitors , both Haitians living abroad and foreigners ; and strengthening of the gourde resulting from the inflow of foreign currency by bilateral or multilateral donors to finance public investments .  
Malta agreed that in order to combat the growing international character of terrorism there was need for enhanced international cooperation , particularly through the exchange of information , the effective implementation of the relevant international conventions and the conclusion of reciprocal judicial assistance and extradition agreements at the bilateral , regional and multilateral levels .  
It is also necessary to facilitate multi - and bilateral technical and financial cooperation with Cuba which can enable its Government and people to continue on the path of the economic reforms in progress and to undertake , on a consensual basis , the political reforms which are urgently called for by the current situation , in particular with respect to human rights .

This is because while members of national military contingents discharge international functions and serve in United Nations peacekeeping operations under the operational control of the Organization , no direct contractual or statutory relationship exists between them and the United Nations ; the terms and conditions of their assignment to the United Nations peacekeeping operations are set out in bilateral agreements and / or understandings entered into between the Organization and their respective Governments . a / General Assembly resolution 50 / 217 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses .  
Member States shall promote bilateral , regional multilateral and global law enforcement cooperation and assistance , including , as appropriate , mutual legal assistance arrangements to facilitate the detection , apprehension and prosecution of those who commit or are otherwise responsible for serious transnational crimes and to ensure that law enforcement and other competent authorities can cooperate effectively on an international basis .

Despite the existence of hundreds of bilateral or regional agreements regulating the use of international watercourses , it had been felt that those rules and prevailing customary international law were still vague and did not cover all the practical problems which might arise between riparian States , especially the problem of water pollution .  
Lastly , the aim should be to elaborate a framework convention enacting the basic principles and setting forth the conceptual basis for eventual bilateral or regional arrangements regarding specific watercourses to be concluded between the watercourse States concerned , taking into account their respective characteristics .  
As to the new proposal regarding the relationship between the future framework convention and existing bilateral or multilateral watercourse agreements , it was his understanding that the draft articles were intended to provide a general framework of rules and principles that would be applicable to future watercourse agreements among concerned watercourse States . The omission from the current draft articles of any reference to existing agreements was not accidental , but the result of a decision taken by the International Law Commission which his delegation fully supported .  
HARRIS ( United States of America ) said that article 3 posed the greatest conceptual difficulties of all the draft articles , because it was always difficult to express the relationship between a new comprehensive agreement and existing bilateral and multilateral agreements on a particular subject .  
In Poland 's view , the proposed new framework convention should be based on existing international instruments regulating illicit narcotic drug trafficking , trafficking in persons , the protection of nuclear material and the import and export of cultural property as well as bilateral and regional agreements on crime prevention .  
The main conclusions and recommendations in that regard were : to prepare and submit to the General Assembly for consideration a comprehensive strategic programme of cooperation with regional organizations in peacekeeping and other peace-related activities , for the development of which it was necessary to establish a project team composed of representatives of all departments concerned ; to conclude bilateral framework agreements between United Nations and regional organizations concerning practical aspects of peacekeeping and other peace-related activities ; and to create a mechanism for cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations .

Strongly calls upon the international community to provide assistance and support for effective participation of all concerned countries in the implementation of their commitments in the field of environment and sustainable development , inter alia , through technical and financial assistance and the use of other appropriate mechanisms , including bilateral and regional channels and multilateral institutions and funds ;  
While bilateral aid from donor countries , support from governmental agencies , assistance from international agencies , international development and aid institutions have an important role in supplementing national and regional endeavours in this regard , it is essential that due importance be given to development mechanisms that are better able to cope with the transboundary movement of marine resources and to address the transboundary nature of marine environmental problems .  
Since her country attached the greatest importance to the recommendations of the Ninth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders , held in Cairo in 1995 , it had developed bilateral , regional and multilateral cooperative links with a view to promoting joint policies , programmes and mechanisms for crime prevention and law enforcement .

Any specific agreements should take into account the special geographic , climatic , historical and hydrological characteristics of a given river , as well as previous bilateral and multilateral agreements and the customary uses of its water resources .  
These challenges have indeed crossed national boundaries to become global issues , and Governments are less able than ever to deal with them alone , without cooperation and mutual coordination , whether on the bilateral , regional or international level . 
The Commission calls upon Governments and the international community to seek to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and to use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including on concessional and grant terms .

Statements were made that judicial cooperation in general , including cooperation in insolvency matters , was governed by bilateral or multilateral treaties , which typically provided for cooperation based on reciprocity .  For some States it was doubtful whether a workable framework for judicial cooperation could be established exclusively by way of a national statute , in particular since it was difficult to incorporate in it the concept of reciprocity .  
The United States was active on the international scene both at the bilateral level , where it carried out joint operations and cooperated with many countries of different regions , and at the multilateral level , through supporting the work of the United Nations in preventing and controlling crime , as well as through the cooperation with its partners of the Group of Seven major industrialized countries plus the Russian Federation ( G-7 / P-8 ) to coordinate efforts against transnational organized crime .

Multilateral and bilateral donors , Governments and the private sector should increase support to non-governmental organizations , particularly to women 's organizations , in playing an active role in advocacy for the implementation of Agenda 21 at the international and national levels , particularly in supporting national policies and programmes for sustainable development in the developing countries .  
Notes that the prevention of mass exoduses requires lasting and effective solutions and requires bilateral and multilateral efforts with specific commitments and effective contributions to developing countries in order to promote the realization of all human rights , in particular the right to development , and welcomes in this regard the holistic approach to promotion and protection of human rights adopted by the High Commissioner .

The Fund and the World Bank have initiated the heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPC ) initiative11 which was first implemented in April 1997 , and which envisages exceptional assistance to a qualifying country from all its bilateral and multilateral creditors to reduce the current value of the country 's debt to a sustainable level .  
The Boards of IMF and the Bank decide whether Naples stock terms , together with at least comparable relief by other bilateral and commercial creditors , are sufficient to bring the country to a sustainable debt-service position , based on a sustainability analysis agreed with the country 's authorities .  This is called the decision point .  
Several Governments have reported efforts to eradicate the illicit cultivation of narcotic plants , and countries in which such illicit cultivation remains a problem have sought international assistance through bilateral or multilateral agreements to implement alternative development programmes .

In the light of that situation , the General Assembly in its resolution 49 / 103 , had noted with concern that the overall resource allocation for the development of food and agriculture in developing countries had continued to decline and urged the international community to place food and agricultural development high on the agenda and to mobilize resources at the national , bilateral and multilateral levels in support of sustainable agriculture in developing countries .  
It should be noted that the countries concerned have paid priority attention to certain important dimensions , such as the mission of national steering committees for the process , internal efforts to mobilize financial resources and the intensification of the consultative process based on efforts to achieve a convergence of views with the main bilateral and multilateral partners .  7 .  At the subregional level , all of the competent organizations are now fully engaged in the formulation of subregional action programmes .  
Those elements included the improvement of current bilateral transit agreements , the promotion of a complementary comprehensive subregional agreement and international transit conventions and agreements , the development of alternative routes , the commercialization of transit services and the development of potential for expanded subregional trade .  
The High Contracting Parties , while independently deciding on matters of national security and military organizational development , shall engage in close cooperation in these areas and determine forms of interaction on the basis of this Treaty , the bilateral Treaty of 16 March 1995 on the Russian military base in the territory of the Republic of Armenia , and other relevant agreements .  
The High Contracting Parties , attaching importance to stable development and the effective exploitation of the economic potential of both States , shall cooperate in implementing the ongoing economic reforms on the basis of market relations , promote the intensification of economic integration between the two States , and create conditions for the establishment of a common economic space in accordance with their obligations under bilateral and multilateral treaties and agreements concluded by the High Contracting Parties within the framework of the Commonwealth of Independent States .

Just last month , on the bilateral level , the United States of America and the Russian Federation announced initiatives taken in the areas of strategic security and nuclear security that will make a positive and constructive contribution to the global nuclear arms control and disarmament agenda .  
International negotiations were central to bilateral and multilateral cooperation between States , to the management of international relations , the peaceful settlement of disputes and the creation of new international norms of conduct , yet the conduct of negotiations was the one type of diplomatic activity that had not been touched by regulation , codification and harmonization .  
The new climate of broadening and deepening international cooperation , both bilateral and multilateral , was the antithesis of the cold-war , zero-sum-game mentality , which , driven by the realities of an increasingly interdependent world , was giving way to more positive and constructive trends and attitudes .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
Sustained pursuit of negotiation , bilateral and multilateral , is indispensable in order to achieve the goal of genuine and complete disarmament , as well as to completely eliminate the massive stockpiles of existing nuclear arsenals .  
Urges concerned Governments , particularly those of sending and receiving countries , to strengthen their national efforts to protect and promote the rights and welfare of women migrant workers through sustained bilateral , regional , interregional and international cooperation , including by developing strategies and joint action , and taking into account innovative approaches and experiences of individual Member States ;  
The Parties believe that it is essential to continue to make joint coordinated efforts with a view to establishing , in the area within the purview of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , bilateral and multilateral international relations based on the generally accepted principles and norms of international law ;

By eliminating the world 's third biggest nuclear arms stock , and by recently signing a number of basic bilateral treaties with its neighbours and the charter on special partnership with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , Ukraine has made an essential contribution to strengthening European and world security , thus having a concrete input in implementing the lofty goals enshrined in the United Nations Charter .  
It also requires building bridges for multilateral cooperation , at both the bilateral and the collective level , on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence , confidence-building , non-interference in the internal affairs of others , mutual respect for regional sovereignties and the resolution of disputes by peaceful means rather than the use of force , in accordance with the rules of international law and the Charters of both the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the United Nations .  
We must mobilize the dynamic private sector , together with bilateral and multilateral official development assistance to secure sustainable growth and poverty reduction in developing countries .  
A low rate of economic growth ; intense demographic pressures ; a decline in agricultural production ; the continuing decrease in bilateral and multilateral aid the result of new alliances ; the burden of debt servicing ; and socio-political conflicts these are the many pitfalls along the path to Africa 's development . 
International cooperation and the benefits that are drawn from it , whether through bilateral or multilateral means , can not be a substitute for what individual countries must do to ensure that sustainable development is achieved and economic growth is realized .  
We believe that serious consideration must be given to the immediate cancellation of the bilateral , multilateral and commercial debts of the least developed countries , without imposing conditionalities that hurt the poor and vulnerable .  
The continuing decline in official development assistance , coupled with a simultaneous growing reliance on bilateral and direct foreign investment , serve as unmistakable indications of this unhealthy process .  
The sponsors are submitting these three draft resolutions driven by a strong desire that the Organization should make a further concrete and constructive contribution to the multiplicity of efforts bilateral , multilateral or undertaken by individuals or by Governments aimed at bringing about a comprehensive , just and lasting settlement of the question of Palestine .  
This reservation is based on the decision of the Council of Arab Foreign Ministers to suspend Arab participation in the multilateral committees until tangible progress is achieved in the peace process , particularly on the bilateral tracks , and until the Israeli Government has fulfilled its commitment to implement the signed agreements and obligations already subscribed to in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions and other resolutions .  
Such an approach could be general or specific ; global or regional ; unilateral , bilateral or multilateral ; separate or interconnected ; step-by-step or all-encompassing , depending on the circumstances .  
Developed countries , in the mutual interests of donors and recipients , must sustain existing levels of bilateral and multilateral ODA and other official finance to developing countries and improve their quality in order to better meet the growing demand for modern economic infrastructure , health and education , environmental protection and policy reforms .  
In that context , the initiative of the IMF Interim Committee and the IMF Development Committee , which at their April 1996 meeting proposed a new framework of action to resolve the debt problems of poor heavily indebted countries , is a real breakthrough , because that initiative is based on a comprehensive approach to the solution of the debt problem that recognizes that all the main creditors ( bilateral and multilateral ) of a particular country should cooperate and coordinate their contributions to the alleviation of the recipient 's debt burden . 
Member States shall promote bilateral , regional , multilateral and global law enforcement cooperation and assistance , including , as appropriate , mutual legal assistance arrangements , to facilitate the detection , apprehension and prosecution of those who commit or are otherwise responsible for serious transnational crimes and to ensure that law enforcement and other competent authorities can cooperate effectively on an international basis .

Governments , national , regional and international bodies , bilateral and multilateral donors and civil society , including non-governmental organizations , should continue to make special efforts to reduce the female illiteracy rate to at least half its 1990 level , with emphasis on rural , migrant and refugee women , internally displaced women and women with disabilities , in keeping with the Beijing Platform for Action .  
Governments and all other actors should make special efforts to achieve the benchmarks set in the Platform for Action of universal access to basic education and completion of primary education by at least 80 per cent of primary school-age children by the year 2000 ; close the gender gap in primary - and secondary-school education by the year 2005 ; provide universal primary education in all countries before the year 2015 ; and consider providing multilateral and bilateral assistance .  
Multilateral and bilateral donors , Governments and the private sector should increase support to non-governmental organizations , particularly to women 's organizations , in playing an active role in advocacy for the implementation of Agenda 21 at the international and national levels , particularly in supporting national policies and programmes for sustainable development in the developing countries .  
On the basis of the bilateral and multilateral treaty instruments signed in recent years , and taking into account the development and intensification of trade and economic relations and also the existence of cooperative links in the past , the parties have reached the conclusion that there is a need to promote in every possible way cooperation in such areas as transport , communications , energy supply , engineering , agriculture , in science and technology and military technology , the environment , humanitarian assistance , tourism , physical culture and sports .

Welcomes the implementation since 1994 by the Paris Club of the Naples terms as well as the decision to go beyond the Naples terms to provide debt reduction for eligible countries , in particular the poorest and most heavily indebted countries , and invites all other bilateral , multilateral and commercial creditors to make an appropriate and consistent contribution to the common objective of debt sustainability ;  
While continuing to expand and strengthen its existing web of bilateral mutual legal assistance treaties with other States , Canada also supported the effective implementation by Member States of the measures contained in international legal instruments , as well as the useful practical and operational measures recommended at various international forums .  
Finally , the United States pointed out that , although it was engaged in a continuous process of seeking and establishing , whenever possible , more effective bilateral and multilateral means of combating all forms of organized transnational crime , it agreed that the time had come to give serious consideration to the elaboration of a single new international convention in that area .  
Aware that organized crime , in its national and transnational dimensions , destabilizes international relations , including interregional , regional , subregional and bilateral cooperation , by exerting influence on politics , the media , public administration , judicial authorities and the economy by establishing commercial or business-like structures ,  
These measures have included reliance on indirect taxes , reliance on declarations and withholding of taxes by third parties , the operation of an efficient system and cross-checking of information , auditing and the unilateral determination of taxable income , the bilateral determination of taxable income ( forfeit method ) and the use of legislative provision administrative rulings and judicial decisions , as well as the enactment and enforcement of penalties .

My delegation is not convinced that a blueprint or a timetable for the achievement of the ultimate goal in nuclear disarmament would be more conducive to , or for that matter a viable alternative to , the existing bilateral reductions in nuclear arsenals .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
Particular emphasis should be given to the cooperative and collaborative efforts of the landlocked and transit developing countries in dealing with the transit problems , inter alia , through improving the transit transport infrastructure facilities and bilateral agreements to govern transit transport operations ; development of joint ventures in the area of transit transport ; and strengthening of institutions and human resources dealing with transit transport .

These included the improvement of current bilateral transit agreements , the promotion of a complementary comprehensive subregional agreement and international transit conventions and agreements , the development of alternative routes , the commercialization of transit services and the development of the potentials for expanded subregional trade .  
On the bilateral level , the Italian Government has established an ad hoc committee , composed of the relevant administrations involved in assistance to Albania and chaired by Commissioner Angioni , to coordinate all bilateral initiatives aimed at the social and economic recovery of the country , giving priority to public education , the health and judicial systems , the promotion of trade , and the fostering of small to medium-size businesses .

At its sixth session , the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice again discussed the smuggling of illegal migrants . 47 Members of the Commission noted that the smuggling of illegal migrants not only caused mental and physical harm and financial hardship to the illegal migrants , but also affected the social stability and bilateral relations of the countries involved . 
For example , financial contributions to relevant multilateral institutions and programmes were often not reported , many national communications provided limited detail on bilateral programmes related to the implementation of the Convention , and there was little discussion of transfer of technology through the private sector . 
One major initiative , of which UNDP was one of the main supporters , was the Micro-credit Summit held in Washington , D.C . , in February 1997 , which brought together 2,500 participants from more than 100 countries , including beneficiaries of micro-finance programmes , organizers of micro-credit projects , commercial and development banks , non-governmental organizations , multilateral and bilateral donors , as well as heads of Government and senior officials who were heads of small business promotional institutions . 
In illustration of a " top-down " method for estimating the impact of coercive economic measures , the expert group referred itself to a recent study that attempts to empirically measure the impact of sanctions on bilateral trade flows , particularly on exports by the United States which is the most frequent sender of unilateral sanctions . 36 But the method used , a common one in economics known as the " gravity model " , also captures the impact on the trade of the target country . 
The importance of international cooperation , including multilateral and bilateral negotiations on contentious issues , and of positive economic measures that involve adequate incentives and reward systems to induce policy changes , when warranted , was reaffirmed and stressed at the meeting as a more rational and viable alternative to unilateral coercive economic measures in most cases .

Emphasizing the importance of further strengthening effective and close cooperation and collaboration between landlocked developing countries and their transit neighbours , at regional , subregional and bilateral levels , inter alia , through cooperative arrangements in developing efficient transit transport systems in landlocked and transit developing countries , and noting the important role of the activities of the regional commissions in this regard ,  
With regard to the external world , the United Arab Emirates has signed a number of agreements and memorandums of understanding and arranged cultural and informational exchanges in the area of education at the bilateral , regional and international level .  
The Italian Government is convinced that bilateral or regional agreements are not enough to meet the need for prompt collaboration in investigating and prosecuting transnational crimes committed by organized crime groups .  
Its members , who were all highly qualified and experienced in their specializations , understood the concerns of developing countries and appreciated what bilateral and multilateral donors required in project design , preparation and implementation .  
While the Cologne debt initiative was a welcome step towards that goal , it must be accompanied by realistic , genuine debt relief measures such as the conversion into grants of any remaining official bilateral and multilateral debt .  
The decrease in official development assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , must be reversed , especially when it was not compensated for by major flows of private capital .  
It is therefore essential that new , concrete financial commitments be made by national Governments and also by bilateral and multilateral donors including the World Bank and the regional development banks , by civil society and by foundations .  
Effective and meaningful collaborative efforts are required , involving Governments , multilateral development institutions , bilateral donors , the private sector , civil society and other relevant stakeholders , to enhance the developmental impact of ICT .

In an act of international solidarity that is commensurate with existing needs , the international community must commit itself to helping the Democratic Republic of the Congo , particularly through the appropriate resumption of multilateral and bilateral structural cooperation , as well as by providing access to various debt-relief mechanisms , including the facilities enjoyed by countries emerging from an armed conflict under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative .  
Mexico will continue encouraging the adoption of measures aimed at consolidating the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , including the universalization and full validity of the various international treaties on the matter , as well as the negotiation of new bilateral and multilateral agreements whose objective is the complete elimination of nuclear weapons , as a step towards the agreed goal of general and complete disarmament under effective international control .  
While it is true that East Timor must rely on its bilateral and multilateral partners and that the mission should not do anything that those partners are prepared to do , I nevertheless believe that there are vital parts of government , particularly in the areas mentioned by the Secretary-General in his report those of central management , fiscal management , justice and human rights , and security and national sovereignty where it would be entirely justified to place advisory staff and a small number of line managers in the East Timor Government . 
This required a continuing dialogue between the relevant professional associations , multilateral financial institutions and bilateral and regional funding agencies and development agencies from developed countries .  
In his view , the most interesting aspect of the Report was the diagnosis which he summarized in three main points : the poor implementation of some policy prescriptions reflected the impossibility of religiously enforcing conditionality ; social policies in favour of the poor needed to be integrated with macroeconomic policies ; and thirdly , aid effectiveness could be enhanced by improving coordination between the Bretton Woods institutions and bilateral donors .  
The European Union considered that there was a need for parallel action on all fronts : the fight against poverty , suppression of trafficking , prosecution of those responsible , education and training , and rehabilitation of child victims ; and that all parties concerned must be mobilized , that international cooperation must be strengthened by multilateral , regional and bilateral arrangements as necessary , and that the private sector ( tourism industry , Internet exploiters ) must be mobilized .

The promise of deep , progressive and irreversible reductions inherent in unilateral and bilateral efforts remains to be fully implemented and may even be threatened by the unravelling of solemn agreements and treaties which served valuable stabilizing roles .  
While the plan for the withdrawal of all foreign forces awaits completion , I am confident that continued implementation of the Lusaka Agreement and the Kampala / Harare disengagement plans , further bilateral contacts and a joint commitment to address the issue of the armed groups in the eastern provinces constitute the surest way of achieving a lasting settlement and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
There is a substantial decrease in the anticipated level of extrabudgetary resources owing to the reduced level of funding from the traditional funding agencies ( UNDP and UNFPA ) for country project activities , the reduced level of involvement by the Department in the execution of a large electricity network rehabilitation project and decreased response to requests for bilateral and multilateral donor funding for technical cooperation activities , except in the area of public administration ( subprogramme 8 ) , where there is an expected increase due to commitments that have been made to the Department .

The nature of a debt problem may vary from acute balance-of-payments difficulties ( instances of illiquidity ) to longer-term structural , financial and resource transfer problems ( cases of insolvency ) . 13 The need for repeated reschedulings of official bilateral debts appears to be related to the fact that the Paris Club approach was originally designed to address liquidity problems hence the importance attached to the cut-off date in Paris Club agreements . 
The international community , including donor countries and financial and development institutions should strengthen their support for national , bilateral and subregional infrastructure and transit transport projects and programmes , including through the provision of adequate financial and technical support to one-stop borders post , as well as through improving current financing modalities and introduction of new facilities , such as co-financing , bank-to-bank loans , guaranties .

In this way , we can jointly push forward the continued development of bilateral ties in breadth and depth .

Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in early 1998 , with the joint efforts made by both sides , relations between China and South Africa have been developing smoothly , and substantive progress has been made in the cooperation between the two countries with broad prospects being shown .  It is hoped that both sides will continue to make efforts and do effective work , thus continuously advancing bilateral friendship and cooperation and achieving more concrete cooperation results to bring benefits to both peoples .  
The fact that the leaders of both countries have maintained contacts and reached a consensus on a wide range of important issues in bilateral relations has played an important and irreplaceable role in promoting the smooth progress of the relations between the two parties and two countries and in the proper solution of problems left by the history of both countries .  
During President Jiang Zemin 's trip to Japan in 1998 , he jointly formulated with Japanese leaders the fundamental policy on developing Japanese-Chinese ties gearing toward the future .  It indicated that Japanese-Chinese ties entered a new phase , and that both countries have established bilateral ties which were varied and mutually interdependent .

Jiang Zemin stressed : Since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1992 , bilateral relations have been healthily and rapidly developing .  Our cooperation in the political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , agricultural , and cultural fields has achieved gratifying results .

Li Ruihuan said that China and Russia are facing huge domestic tasks in developing their economy and improving living standards , and they hold identical or similar views on many major international issues ; their two economies are strongly complementary , and there are broad prospects for developing bilateral friendly cooperation .  
The geographical locations separated by a mere strip of water , close cultural backgrounds , and longstanding contacts and exchange of visits of personnel have provided exceptionally favorable conditions for the development of bilateral economic and trade cooperation .  
It is notable that while continuing to deepen bilateral military alliances with Japan , Australia , and the ROK , the United States is restoring and developing military ties with countries such as Thailand , the Philippines , Vietnam , and Singapore through a variety of military cooperation forms , such as gaining the right to use military facilities , agreements on military unit visits , joint military exercises , and so on , thereby markedly expanding its military presence in non-alliance countries and further increasing its military capability for intervening in Asia-Pacific affairs .  
With regard to strengthening mutual trust and cooperation in the military sphere , although Sergeyev 's visit has avoided another storm arising in bilateral military cooperation ties on account of the espionage affair , the hard ice that has long formed between the two countries can hardly undergo a complete thaw in one or two visits , and " a still more difficult path lies ahead . "  
S . relations with a strategic vision and from the long-term perspective .  In the future , we will continue to work hard with the new administration in the United States to actively advance bilateral relations to make new improvements and new progress , based on the principles of the three Sino-U.S . aftertime , especially mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , non-interference in one another 's internal affairs , and equality and mutual benefit .

Despite the past 50 years and especially the last 10 since the end of the Cold War , the international environment the US faces has undergone tremendous changes but the " support system " the US established and runs has not changed .  Post-Cold War economic and military conflicts between the US and European Union have not caused any bilateral or multilateral damage .  
During his visit Chairman Li Peng specially arranged to see the relatives of Dr .

First , the establishment of mechanisms for military mutual trust must be based on a framework of bilateral or multilateral ties , that is , the parties concerned must have existing basic mechanisms to hold dialogues and channels to facilitate cooperation , and one of the most important preconditions is that they have a certain level of political mutual trust .  Without political consensus and trust , a mechanism for military mutual trust will be infeasible both theoretically and in practice .

Given the reality that European and American free trade areas are growing stronger by the day and that various countries and regions in the Asia-Pacific region are choosing bilateral and small multilateral regional free trade as their next best choice , both sides of the strait must consider the question of forming a unique economic area under the constraints of external influences .

He said : The treaty of friendly cooperation and mutual assistance signed between the two countries four decades ago is a great event in the history of bilateral relations .  It has not only promoted exchanges and cooperation in numerous spheres between our two countries but also strengthened the unity and friendship between our two sides and played a major role in safeguarding world peace .  
This treaty will become a legal document guiding the development of bilateral relations in the new century , and it is bound to have a far-reaching positive impact on the two countries in developing enduring good neighborly , friendly , and mutual beneficial and cooperative relations .

The foundation of the two countries ' complementary and mutually beneficial economic , trade , and military relationship is solid ; China is Russia 's sixth largest trading partner , and Russia is China 's ninth ; last year their bilateral trade totalled $ 8 billion .  
Still more important , following the reliable legal guarantee for all-round development of bilateral relations provided by the " Sino-Russian Treaty of Good neighborly Friendship and Cooperation , " a new page will be turned in this relationship in the new century , and in the face of the new-style state relations of mutual trust and benefit established by China and Russia , the disintegration strategy pushed by the sole superpower in combination with its cold war mentality unilateralism will be of no avail .

3 .  The faction that thinks it is impossible to maintain the status quo , but readjustment should be made gradually : Japan 's demand to become a political and military big country will become an irresistible trend in Japan 's political arena in the future .

Because we live in that kind of economy a key part of our action to deal with the problems of development must , accordingly , be multilateral , and the key problem facing us , both multilaterally and in our bilateral , donor roles , is that within the global economy the gap between rich and poor countries , despite all efforts to resist this , has grown .  
Effective economic cooperation between the countries of the Middle East can be called , without fear of exaggeration , a main component of lasting peace and an essential condition for the development of mutually beneficial and harmonious bilateral and multilateral dialogue .  
The challenge the international community now faces is threefold : to ensure that recent positive developments do not founder for lack of economic and political support , to nurture progress on the other bilateral tracks of negotiations to match that achieved between Israel and the PLO and to prevent acts of violence and terrorism by extremist groups that seek to endanger the peace process and threaten to drive the Middle East back into conflict and suffering .

It is suggested that macroeconomic frameworks conducive to mobilizing financial resources be developed and that the allocation of significant resources through partnership agreements and bilateral or multilateral arrangements be continued and enhanced .  
In order to combat effectively the increase in , and the growing international character and effects of , acts of terrorism , States should enhance their cooperation in this area through , in particular , systematizing the exchange of information concerning the prevention and combating of terrorism , as well as by effective implementation of the relevant international conventions and conclusion of mutual judicial assistance and extradition agreements on a bilateral , regional and multilateral basis ;

There seems to be a common understanding among the above States that bilateral CSBMs , once agreed , should lead to greater transparency in military activities , thus having a stabilizing effect , especially in border areas , and stimulating contacts between the military of the respective States at the lowest possible level .  
Most important , however , remains the need to mobilize new and additional financial resources from all potential funding sources , in particular bilateral donors and also the regional development banks , with a view to mitigating , in an effective and timely manner , the adverse impact of the sanctions regime .  
The implementation of the international instruments for mutual assistance in criminal matters and of the model treaties on different aspects of bilateral and multilateral cooperation also requires technical assistance , and efforts have been made to provide this , beginning with the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) countries of western Africa . 
That was to include the provision of technical assistance for the development of bilateral and multilateral agreements , based on the United Nations model treaties and other sources , and the drafting of proposed model legislation or agreements on international cooperation in criminal matters , alternative or complementary articles for existing model treaties , and articles for possible model multilateral instruments .  
To implement their commitments in the fight against transnational organized crime , they established a group of senior experts , with a temporary mandate to look at existing arrangements for cooperation , both bilateral and multilateral , to identify significant gaps and options for improved coordination and to propose practical action to fill such gaps .  
For example , the Vienna Convention has given rise to a wave of legislative activity at the national level , supported by the legal assistance programme of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme , as well as to the adoption of numerous bilateral and regional agreements that implement and further the Convention 's provisions .  
On the contrary , in 1994 Mexico , recognizing the importance of strengthening its relations with Cuba , a neighbouring country with which it has maintained a tradition of friendly relations based on strict respect for the principles of non-intervention and the self-determination of peoples , sought to strengthen its economic cooperation with that country through bilateral meetings between the two Governments and support for joint investments in Cuba by Mexican companies .

NULLAt the bilateral level , the Algerian Government has made sustained efforts to coordinate policies and strategies to combat terrorism , for example by strengthening judicial cooperation , exchanging information , and circulating details of persons who have committed terrorist acts so that they might be arrested , handed over or extradited . 
But when the time comes to negotiate multilateral replenishments , additional multilateral resources are seen as coming at the expense of already stretched bilateral programmes , which are usually perceived to bring political benefits or to respond more closely to donor Government policies and priorities , since the donor itself is responsible for their supervision and control .  
NULLThe current development of the World Hydrological Cycle Observing System by WMO , with the support of the World Bank and others , will help to coordinate bilateral and multilateral contributions at both international and regional levels to further the coordination and technical consistency of water resource systems in the developing countries within the Hydrology and Water Resources Programme .  
It is also necessary to facilitate multi - and bilateral technical and financial cooperation with Cuba which can enable its Government and people to continue on the path of the economic reforms in progress and to undertake , on a consensual basis , the political reforms which are urgently called for by the current situation , in particular with respect to human rights .

Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
To those who long ago declared invalid any legal measure of a foreign country against their businessmen and nationals , we here send a message of hope : Cuba , the island of the bold , is not going to turn away from the road it has taken ; it will not violate the hopes and trust of its friends or partners , in spite of threats and multilateral or bilateral measures that someone might try to impose upon it . 
Specific requirements should be identified for bilateral and multilateral cooperation in capacity-building and the training of civil servants in the areas of economic and financial management , the creation of jobs , the eradication of poverty , the provision of adequate criminal justice infrastructures and environmental protection .  
With respect to this and to the general follow-up of the subject , we believe that the United Nations Development Programme , which has been doing work of this kind , must continue to play a primary role in this field , helping to coordinate activities in the field at the inter-agency level and promoting complementary activities at the bilateral level , particularly in State reform in the economic and social fields and in the justice sector .  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
Every State has the right to choose its political , economic and social system , to preserve its natural resources and to resort to peaceful negotiations as a means of settling disputes within the context of bilateral , regional and international initiatives and endeavours .  
We also call upon Iran to respond to the peace initiatives we have advanced and which are supported by sisterly and friendly peace-loving countries ; to enter into unconditional bilateral negotiations conducive to a peaceful settlement of the dispute ; or to refer the case to the International Court of Justice .  
Allocating of resources to support the development of developing countries and contributing in various ways to bilateral and multilateral international cooperation for development are wise investments for peace and for the shared future of all of our societies .  
We believe that , with the treaties and bilateral agreements concluded , and the ongoing negotiations among the nuclear-weapon States , and also with the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons last year , the international community is now reaffirming its commitment to global disarmament and renewing the hopes for the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction .  
My delegation is convinced that international cooperation at all levels bilateral , regional and global is crucial for the effective implementation of the goals of the social Summit .  
Thus while it acknowledged that individual countries bear the primary responsibility for the attainment of the goals of the conference , it also recognized that the support of the international community as a whole including of the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , bilateral donors , non-governmental organizations and all actors of civil society will be crucial if we are to realize all the objectives of the conference .  
While in the beginning of this partnership large amounts had to be contributed towards emergency measures , today the extensive bilateral development cooperation focuses mainly on the consolidation of structural adaptation processes , the rehabilitation of social infrastructures , the promotion of private enterprises ( including vocational training ) , agricultural development , and the protection of the environment and natural resources .  
The European Union has taken a leading role in the strengthening of regulatory regimes , including in the establishment of the nuclear safety account , administered by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , the G 24 coordinating mechanism , the European Union 's Poland-Hungary Aid for the Reconstruction of the Economy ( PHARE ) and Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States ( TACIS ) programmes , the European Atomic Energy Community loan facility , coordinated support from the international financial institutions for the energy sector , and bilateral cooperation projects .  
At the domestic level , the national Government , owing to radical economic reforms , has made progress in the far-reaching process of bilateral cooperation with countries committed to the peaceful use of nuclear energy .  
This commitment is reflected in the vital and multifaceted relations that we have with African Governments both at the bilateral level and through a range of multilateral agencies , and which take the form of the continuing engagement of Canadian non-governmental organizations throughout the continent , and growing number of partnerships in the private sector . 
The Helms-Burton Act also calls for an annual report that would describe all bilateral assistance provided to Cuba by other countries , including humanitarian assistance ; Cuban debt to third countries , as well as the amount exchanged , forgiven or reduced ; identification of Cuban trading partners ; and a description of the joint ventures completed or under consideration by foreign nationals and business firms .  
Despite the importance of bilateral relations and successful regional organizations , the United Nations remains the principal mechanism capable of ensuring the transition from a bipolar and confrontational world to a multipolar and democratic one . 
Thanks in part to General Assembly support for the universal principles enshrined in the Charter and in part to the intervention of United Nations peacekeeping forces , the countries which emerged following the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia are now increasingly heading towards the objective of peacefully resolving mutual problems on a bilateral basis and through regular multilateral contacts , thereby lessening the need for international involvement and mediation .  
The successful expansion of bilateral neighbourly relations based on internationally accepted principles can not be replaced by the imposition of superfluous and ambitious regional associations .  
We support the conclusion contained in this report that new and additional financial resources from all potential funding sources , especially at the bilateral and regional levels , are necessary to address a variety of persisting economic problems of the affected States , in particular the long-term effects of sanctions on their economies .  
The General Assembly also called on developed countries to refrain from threats to impose commercial and financial restrictions , blockades , embargoes , and other economic sanctions on developing countries , because such practices violate the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and international bilateral and multilateral commitments .  
Recalling the paramount importance of the bilateral talks mediated by some powers with legitimate interests in facilitating a comprehensive solution to the situation in the Middle East , the Brazilian delegation also pays tribute to the indisputable role the United Nations has been playing over the years in this field , not only by means of peacekeeping , but also through economic , social and humanitarian assistance .  
The machinery of the process took the form of numerous negotiating tracks , from a bilateral track to negotiate a withdrawal from the occupied territories , to a multilateral track to negotiate regional questions , such as disarmament , water , Palestinian refugees and the establishment of regional economic cooperation , which , from the outset , was believed to be the next logical step once peace had been secured through a just and comprehensive political settlement .  
The worsening of the external , bilateral and multilateral debt crisis of developing countries ; the erosion and unpredictable nature of resources from export earnings ; restrictions on access to markets ; the lack of fairness in international trade ; one-sided views which affect cooperation ; and the unilateral nature of the world decision-making process : all these highlight in different ways the various obstacles which remain on the path to development .  
The most prominent of these is the elimination or consolidation of redundant paragraphs and the adoption of new language for operative paragraph 10 of last year 's resolution , namely resolution 50 / 69 , which has become operative paragraph 8 in the current draft , so as to urge all States taking interest in conducting activities in outer space to keep the Conference on Disarmament informed of the progress of bilateral or multilateral negotiations relating to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , if any such negotiations take place outside the Conference on Disarmament . 
It further emphasizes the paramount importance of strict compliance with existing arms limitations and disarmament agreements relevant to outer space , including bilateral agreements , and with the existing legal regime concerning the use of outer space , including wide participation in such a legal regime .  
The remaining operative part calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to the objectives and to relevant existing treaties , and urges them to keep the Conference on Disarmament informed of the progress of any bilateral or multilateral negotiations relating to the prevention of such arms races so as to facilitate its work .  
Our previous bilateral efforts have demonstrated that nuclear disarmament is an extremely intricate process involving careful trade-offs , specialized and highly tailored verification , and very sensitive security calculations .  
Requests improved annual reporting on financial flows , including allocations / expenditures , based on consistent criteria and related to the costed elements of the Programme of Action , including a clear account of levels and trends of funding by source ( bilateral , multilateral ( both core and non-core ) and private funds , domestic allocations and the like ) ;  
Calls upon the international community to seek to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including , as mutually agreed , on concessional and grant terms ;  
Also calls upon the international community to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including ( , as mutually agreed , ) on concessional and grant terms ;  
In resolution 45 / 209 , the Assembly stressed the need for comprehensive national , bilateral and multilateral measures to accelerate the exploration and development of energy resources in developing countries , and the need to take into consideration environmental and developmental concerns as they applied to all countries in accordance with their respective capabilities and their responsibilities for global environmental degradation .  
Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;  
In this respect , we regard as encouraging the agreement reached between the Government and UNITA to establish a new timetable in order to move the peace process forward , as well as the resumption of bilateral negotiations to complete the establishment of joint armed forces .  The recent conclusion of an agreement to this end between the two parties is a positive step , which , in spite of certain difficulties which emerged , deserves to be encouraged and supported .  
That principle created a presumption in favour of national jurisdiction for the reasons contained in the report of the Ad Hoc Committee , namely that the parties concerned would work within existing bilateral and multilateral arrangements , applicable law would be more certain , criminal actions would be less costly and the penalties involved would be clearly defined and easy to enforce .  
Donor Governments should consider increasing their financial support to the initiatives undertaken by developing countries and countries with economies in transition , through bilateral and multilateral channels , for national , regional ( including support to regional organizations ) and global programmes .  
Requests the Secretary-General to facilitate , as appropriate , the creation of joint initiatives , including bilateral activities , and the joint formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects benefiting developing countries and countries in transition , involving interested donor countries and funding agencies , particularly the United Nations Development Programme and the World Bank , with a view to establishing and maintaining efficient criminal justice systems on a country-by-country basis as an essential component of developmental efforts ;  
We commit ourselves to strengthening existing financial mechanisms and , where appropriate , developing new mechanisms for financing the implementation of the Habitat Agenda , which will mobilize increased sources of finance - public , private , multilateral , and bilateral - at the international , regional , national and local levels , and will promote the efficient , effective and accountable allocation and management of resources .

Multilateral and bilateral donors , Governments and the private sector should increase support to non-governmental organizations , particularly to women 's organizations , in playing an active role in advocacy for the implementation of Agenda 21 at the international and national levels , particularly in supporting national policies and programmes for sustainable development in the developing countries .  
Notes that the prevention of mass exoduses requires lasting and effective solutions and requires bilateral and multilateral efforts with specific commitments and effective contributions to developing countries in order to promote the realization of all human rights , in particular the right to development , and welcomes in this regard the holistic approach to promotion and protection of human rights adopted by the High Commissioner .

The Boards of IMF and the Bank decide whether Naples stock terms , together with at least comparable relief by other bilateral and commercial creditors , are sufficient to bring the country to a sustainable debt-service position , based on a sustainability analysis agreed with the country 's authorities .  This is called the decision point .

International negotiations were central to bilateral and multilateral cooperation between States , to the management of international relations , the peaceful settlement of disputes and the creation of new international norms of conduct , yet the conduct of negotiations was the one type of diplomatic activity that had not been touched by regulation , codification and harmonization .  
The new climate of broadening and deepening international cooperation , both bilateral and multilateral , was the antithesis of the cold-war , zero-sum-game mentality , which , driven by the realities of an increasingly interdependent world , was giving way to more positive and constructive trends and attitudes .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .

Developed countries , in the mutual interests of donors and recipients , must sustain existing levels of bilateral and multilateral ODA and other official finance to developing countries and improve their quality in order to better meet the growing demand for modern economic infrastructure , health and education , environmental protection and policy reforms .  
In that context , the initiative of the IMF Interim Committee and the IMF Development Committee , which at their April 1996 meeting proposed a new framework of action to resolve the debt problems of poor heavily indebted countries , is a real breakthrough , because that initiative is based on a comprehensive approach to the solution of the debt problem that recognizes that all the main creditors ( bilateral and multilateral ) of a particular country should cooperate and coordinate their contributions to the alleviation of the recipient 's debt burden .

For example , financial contributions to relevant multilateral institutions and programmes were often not reported , many national communications provided limited detail on bilateral programmes related to the implementation of the Convention , and there was little discussion of transfer of technology through the private sector . 
One major initiative , of which UNDP was one of the main supporters , was the Micro-credit Summit held in Washington , D.C . , in February 1997 , which brought together 2,500 participants from more than 100 countries , including beneficiaries of micro-finance programmes , organizers of micro-credit projects , commercial and development banks , non-governmental organizations , multilateral and bilateral donors , as well as heads of Government and senior officials who were heads of small business promotional institutions . 
In illustration of a " top-down " method for estimating the impact of coercive economic measures , the expert group referred itself to a recent study that attempts to empirically measure the impact of sanctions on bilateral trade flows , particularly on exports by the United States which is the most frequent sender of unilateral sanctions . 36 But the method used , a common one in economics known as the " gravity model " , also captures the impact on the trade of the target country .

Moreover , the growth of TCDC can be measured not only through the number and range of TCDC-related projects completed or ongoing but also by the spread of new TCDC configurations , including a sharp increase in country-to-country bilateral TCDC projects , the recent phenomenon of donor country involvement in triangular funding schemes , and the proliferation of partnerships among intergovernmental organizations , non-governmental organizations and other players within the multilateral system .  
In the case of TCDC activities outside the system - i.e . , projects that are initiated , funded and executed in a spontaneous manner between bilateral partners - a parallel increase in the number of participating or beneficiary countries appears to reflect directly the steady improvement of the technical capabilities and funding resources of a growing number of developing countries willing to share their experiences with others .
