All state representatives at the Tunis Summit claimed that this plan proved the countries ' commitment to pursue and strengthen political , economic , social , and educational reforms .  However , these reforms had to be carried out according to the national conditions , cultural backgrounds , religious beliefs , and the possible extent of change of individual states to silently resist the U.S . intention of forcing the Arab states into carrying out political and economic reforms by means foreign to the Arabs .  
Speaking about the two main themes of " unity and democracy , " Li Ruihuan said being the most extensive patriotic united front organization , the CPPCC should hold high the banner of unity , and pull together people of different parties , different social strata , different ethnic groups and different religious beliefs through seeking common ground while reserving differences , understanding , magnanimity , coordinating relations , and resolving contradictions .  
disseminated , in a vivid way , the materialist ideological concept of respecting science and opposing superstition among the vast number of the visitors ; helped people see more clearly the true nature and the harms of such religious cults as the " Falungong " ; and will thus prove a great help to enhancing the spiritual civilization and the scientific attainment of our people .  
it is necessary to do a good job of effectively carrying out nationality , religious , national defense , diplomatic , and Taiwan affairs work , to resolutely fight sabotage activities carried out by hostile forces at home and abroad , and to combat various law-violating and criminal activities , so as to maintain social and political stability , the unity of the motherland , and national security and to create a good international and domestic environment for reform and development .  
Tanzania , Rwanda , and some other African countries have recently expressed one after another that they would never allow the religious groups that " affect social stability or engage in reactionary deeds " to launch activities within their territories , and they would take resolute actions against the cults that " seek private gains , publicize heretical beliefs , and collect money and property to get rich " in order to " prevent the recurrence of the Uganda Tragedy . "  
Meanwhile , some national and religious conflicts and some problems left over by history have yet been solved ; the conflicts over territorial land , territorial seas , and natural resources have risen one after another ; and some countries have even attempted to bring in foreign forces to take a hand in the interference in others ' internal affairs .  
Defense ministers of the five countries exchanged views on the issues of implementing the consensus reached by heads of the five countries , summarizing the situation in executing the agreements on confidence-building in the military sphere and on the mutual reduction of the armed forces in the border areas , strengthening the trustful cooperation in military , political , and security spheres among the five countries , and opposing the national separatism , the religious extremism , and the international terrorism .  After reaching a broad agreement on these issues , they issued a joint communique .  
The Chinese government practices a policy of respecting and protecting freedom of religious belief , pursuing the principle of keeping religion , political power and education separate .  The country protects normal religious activities , as well as the legal rights and interests of religious organizations .  The different religions have equal standing and live together harmoniously , and there is mutual respect and unified harmony between the citizens who practice religion and those who do not believe in any religion .  
Jiang Zemin said : The Chinese government implements the policy of respecting and protecting the freedom of religious beliefs , and follows the principle of separating religion from political power and education .  The country protects normal religious activities and the legitimate rights of religious groups .  Different religions in China share equal status , and co-exist in perfect harmony ; and religious believers and non-believers respect each other , and live together in unity and harmony .  
Not long ago , with a deep feeling of grief we bade farewell to our revered Comrade Zhao Puchu , who was a noted social activist , a great patriot , an outstanding patriotic religious leader , a well-known writer , poet , and calligrapher enjoying great prestige at home and abroad , and a caring philanthropist . 
On 16 August the delegation convened in Beijing a " seminar of Chinese religious circles on world peace issues " , at which speeches were made by the principal responsible persons of China 's five main nationwide religions , namely Buddhism , Taoism , Islamism , Catholicism , and Protestantism , who are members of the delegation .  These speeches fully expressed the stance , views , and ideas of Chinese religious circles on preserving world peace and creating a beautiful living space for mankind .  
We urge the mass media workers to feel proud of their lofty mission of safeguarding world peace , sow the seed of tolerance and friendliness among the people by means of their hard work every day , and make impartial and objective reports , especially reports on the religious situation in various countries , in order to promote mutual understanding among the people .  Exaggerating differences and inciting antagonism can only deceive the people for some time and can not deceive them forever .  
However , the Vatican has turned black into white by " canonizing " these sinners , who had a notorious record , in an attempt to reverse the historical fact of the imperialist aggression against China . This act has severely hurt the feelings of the Chinese people and is intolerable to every religious believer who loves his country .  
People present at a meeting also indicated : No doubt the recent " canonization " is a bad thing , yet it also serves to sound the alarm for us .  It has helped to sober us ; and has enabled us to see more clearly the true features of the Vatican which interferes in China 's internal affairs by using a religious issue , and see more clearly the political plot of western hostile forces to stage an infiltration against China on the pretext of religion .  
The leaders of these five countries signed the Dushanbe Declaration proclaiming their joint opposition to ethnic separatism , international terrorism , and religious extremism , and reached a major consensus on building an edifice of neighborly , friendly , and peaceful cooperation that is oriented toward the 21st century .  
In order to attain their unspeakable aims , cults always take advantage of loopholes in state laws and social management policies ; to the outside world they are cloaked in religious practice and working to improve people 's health , while internally they draw up strict regulations and prohibitions , and establish a strictly graded illegal organizational structure in a vain attempt to form a " secret kingdom " backed by " religious " beliefs outside the framework of a society with a legal system .  
In order to deceive people , he disguised himself as a religious leader who had suffered persecution , and accused the Chinese Government of violating human rights .  He took credit and sought rewards from his master in the West by acting against the Chinese Government . He openly served as a shameful tool and a pawn of anti-China forces in the West in an attempt to play a role in helping anti-China forces in the West promote " Westernization " in China and " split " China .  
We must hold aloft the banner of ethnic solidarity and progress , vigorously propagate the party 's ethnic and religious policies , and do more practical and good things for the minority-nationality masses , to consolidate the excellent situation of people of all nationalities breathing the same air , sharing the same destiny , and being linked heart to heart .  
How can they allow their constantly improving livelihood be jeopardized by the Dalai . In the questionnaires , the residents in the Chengguan District of Lhasa City have given a resounding answer .  They , as well as the people of all ethnic groups in Tibet , are deeply aware that the blind religious worship people have for the Dalai Lama , who has ulterior motives , has not only stifled their ideas but also shackled their hands and feet ;  
Nevertheless , all orthodox religions have , during the process of their missionary work , gradually blended man 's rationality with his common sense ; and by blending the two , these religions have been able to make their religious propositions more rational and more humane , and have thus played an increasingly important role in man 's this life and even become the source of cultures and moral principles of certain nations .  
In a country which originally does not have a strong religious awareness , while reaffirming man 's right to freedom of faith , we must also let our kindhearted people know how high a cost the Western world has paid in blood and how protracted and arduous a struggle it has gone through in its pursuit of a peaceful coexistence between religion and rationality and in its effort to gradually bury the various extremist religions and political propositions .  
The delegation also held special report sessions on " opposing evil cult , guaranteeing human rights " for Chinese students studying in France and for overseas Chinese living and working in France . During its visit , the delegation also met with leaders of the French official and non-governmental anti-cult organizations and leaders of the French religious circles .  Both sides expressed their willingness to increase exchanges on the experience of investigating and fighting evil cults in the future .  
Take its handling of the Tibet question for example , after taking office in 1993 , former US President Bill Clinton again highlighted the values of human rights by following in Jimmy Carter 's footsteps .  Clinton declared : If China refuses to make improvement on human rights , the United States will not grant MFN status to China . Clinton also listed protecting Tibet 's unique religious or cultural heritage in his wish list on human rights and even arranged an unscheduled meeting between himself and Dalai in the White House .  
Based on the principle of making active strikes against crimes and of cracking down on crimes whenever they occur , Xinjiang has maintained high pressure on national splittists , violent terrorist groups , and religious extremists and has thwarted their splittist activities several times , thereby realizing political and social stability for Xinjiang .  
The entire process of the incident was connected to historical , legal , cultural , language , and religious issues , and the only thing that was conspicuously absent was its military aspect .  US Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld did not even appear in public during the development of the incident .  It was not until 13 April that he held a news conference at which he complained that it was only the Chinese Communist plane 's provocative act that was the underlying cause of the collision .  
Hence , in the drive to " strike hard " and put things in order , it is necessary to make full preparations to consistently regard as the most important thing the crackdown on organized crime , especially organized crime of all kinds committed by backbone ethnic separatist elements , elements who commit bombing and terrorism , and extremist religious elements ; we must take the initiative to attack them , and hit them as soon as they show themselves .  
Wang Zhaoguo said : Guangxi is an area inhabited by minority ethnic groups .  Because the regional party committee and the regional government attach great importance to the ethnic and religious work and exercise correct leadership , good results have been achieved in the building of new-type socialist ethnic relations of being equal , united , and mutually assistant .  
Within the scope of the laws and policies and in accordance with the Islamic scriptures , the committee will make accurate and authoritative interpretations of the Islamic doctrine and canon which meet the need of the development of times , compile model books for sermons , and standardize contents of sermons , and enhance the level of work for the personnel in charge of Islamic religious affairs .  In addition , the committee will actively lead the religion to adapt to the socialist society by opposing religious extremist activities which make use of Islam .  
Fu Tieshan , president of the China Patriotic Catholic Association and vice president of the Chinese Catholic Bishops College , pointed out : The annual report issued by the US International Religious Freedom Commission cooked up something out of nothing , confused right and wrong , mixed up black and white , violated the norms of international relations , and grossly interfered in China 's internal affairs .  This is unacceptable to people of China 's religious circles .  
When the splittists wantonly injured and killed ordinary people , did they have the least bit of national feelings and religious piety ?  Since betraying the motherland and the Tibetan people in 1959 , Dalai as the representative of the backward feudal serfdom , has been engaging in splittist activities outside the borders .  
The Dalai 's destruction of Tibetan-sect Buddhism also finds conspicuous expression in the fact that he has openly violated the established historical practice and religious rules and obstructed and undermined the work of locating and deciding on the reincarnated soul boy of the 10th Panchen by presumptuously announcing from abroad the ceincarnated soul boy of the Panchen , ?  
Therefore , correctly understanding and mastering the relationship between common characters and individual characters , fully understanding the protracted nature , complexity , and importance of the ethnic and religious issues , upholding the ideological line of seeking truth from facts , and proceeding from the actual conditions in Tibet in doing everything are important principles which must be mastered in doing work well .  
During an interview by the press , Tang Yinlong said the Dalai is not just a religious figure , but also the general representative of the serf system in Tibet and a political refugee in the garb of religion who , over a long time , has engaged himself abroad in criminal activities of trying to split up the country and undermining unity among ethnic groups .  
After Tibet 's peaceful liberation , the central government and the Tibet Autonomous Regional Government began to list famous religious activity sites including the Johkang , Thaxi Lhunbo , Drepung , Sagya , and Sera Monasteries as key cultural heritages under national or autonomous regional protection .  
Recent scholarly discussions have rejected the easily confused and controversial phrase , " heretical cul " t , and changed to such neutral descriptions as " religious sect " , " minority religious sect " , or " rising religious sect " , etc . , in order to avoid using provocative terms .  
When looking at it from the point of view of the historical development of various " religious sects " , new and developing religious sects become discontented with the rigidity of the organizational system and break off from the mother religion .  Their leaders put forward the enlightenment of a special divinity and call on the minority of the followers .  This early developmental stage is inevitably looked upon by the mainstream as " heretical " .  
Hong Kong serves as a diverse cultural capital , the development of religious sects has its freedom , there is sound social differentiation of " religious sects " developed by the people 's knowledge , and illegal behavior by " religious sects " is already regulated by Hong Kong law .  The day that the government of the SAR , ignorant of religion , enacts the " Anti-Heretical Cult Law " , all legitimate " religious sects " will be affected .  
In the " Alma Ata Declaration " , leaders of the five countries explicitly expressed their common position of opposing the national separatist force and the religious extremist forces , jointly cracking down on international terrorists , organized crimes , drug-trafficking , smuggling , and other transnational criminal activities .  They all agreed that they would not allow any people to use their own territories to carry out activities detrimental to the state sovereignty , security , and social order of another country .  
He said : To safeguard regional security , the countries of the " Shanghai Five " should take joint actions in dealing blows at religious extremism , international terrorism , organized crime , drug trafficking , and arms smuggling .  At the same time , they should also expand cooperation in the economic , cultural , educational , scientific , and technological fields .  
Meanwhile , they are also deeply perplexed by numerous problems like the foundation of state regimes being fragile , the religious forces being powerful which gives rise to political and social disunity and complicated peripheral environments , the three evil forces running wild , the phenomena of smuggling , drug trafficking , arms trade , and so on being serious , and so on .  
The Common Program solemnly announced the abolition of the feudal system , which had shackled women .  Women were to enjoy the same political , economic , cultural , educational , and other social rights as men .  It cut the four ropes that had bound Chinese women , namely , the political system , clan power , religious authority , and the authority of their husbands , and ushered in a new era in the liberation of Chinese women . "  
After the former Soviet Union collapsed , long existing potential regional problems , such as ethnic and religious issues , have become the real problems of the political and economic life in the newly independent Russia , and each Central Asian country in the region .  
The Summit attendees unanimously proposed " zero tolerance of separatism , ethnic separatism and religious extremism , " and wrote the proposal that " each member state should adopt measures to combat the international terrorism , organized crimes , arm smuggling , drug trafficking and other transnational criminal activities " in the first joint charter .  It centered the " Shanghai Five " cooperation on the experiment of establishing an effective security cooperation framework instead of its initial goal of accomplishing border military trust and disarmament .  
At the fifth " Shanghai Five " summit held in July 2000 in Dushanbe , leaders of the member states reiterated their determination to " jointly combat such international criminal activities that contribute the most threats to the region 's security , stability and development such as ethnic separatism , religious extremism , international terrorism , illegal arms smuggling , drug trafficking and illegal migration . "  It also proposed to sign treaties and pacts on multilateral cooperation among the member states .  
It should strive to safeguard social and political stability , firmly oppose national separatist and religious extremist forces , actively coordinate relations between different strata , different social groups , different parties , different ethnic groups , and different religions inside the united front , take timely actions to remove various negative factors that may affect our social and political stability , and create a concerted , stable , and harmonious social environment for reform , opening-up , and modernization .  
There are differences between countries in their social systems , ideological thinking , perceptions of values , and religious beliefs ; therefore , in international relations , we should strictly observe the basic principles of mutually respecting each other 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , mutual non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , equality , mutual benefits , and peaceful coexistence .  
After giving a briefing on the main problems that affect social stability for the time being , Luo Gan listed the efforts to be made in the next step : First , strictly guard against and severely crack down on the criminal activities of the ethnic separatist forces , the religious extremist forces , and the violent terrorist forces , deal harsh blows at the sabotage activities of the hostile forces , and resolutely safeguard national security and unity .  
An official of the Ministry of Public Security has revealed that the current main factors for instability in China are : " the activities of hostile forces abroad , of ethnic separatist organizations , and of ' Falungong ' " ; criminal terrorist activities involving ethnic separatist organizations and related religious extremist forces have the greatest impact on social tranquillity , while there have recently been " new trends " in the activities of " Falungong . "  
third , persist in comprehensively carrying out the party 's national and religious policies , making constant efforts to consolidate and develop socialist national relations marked by equality , unity , and mutual aid among the masses of every nationality in Tibet , and persist in developing a strong and patriotic united front ;  
responsible persons of central committees of democratic parties , the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce , and mass bodies concerned ; and figures from various united front circles who are in Beijing , including non-party figures , representatives of intellectuals outside the CPC , representatives of ethnic and religious circles , and representatives of Hong Kong , Macao , and Taiwan compatriots and overseas Chinese compatriots .  
The third liberation was cultural and ideological liberation .  This liberation released the people of Tibet , long-enslaved under the binding ties of a unitary religious and political system and the corruption of feudal serfdom , from the remnants of backward thought .  
completely get rid of the soil on which the " Falungong " cult and various decadent ideologies and cultures breed ; strive to give rise to a sound general trend of opposing religious cults and upholding civilization in society ; and make positive contribution to improving the ideological and moral quality as well as the scientific and cultural quality of the entire nation , and to promoting the country 's undertaking of reform , opening up , and modernization building .  
In the field of regional issues , the two sides emphasized the adoption of active and effective measures to crack down on national splittist , international terrorist , religious extremist , and transnational criminal activities .  
exemplarily carrying out the party 's ethnic and religious policies ; actively assisting local authorities in vigorously developing science and technological , educational , cultural , and health work ; serving as a vanguard , fighting on the forefront , heroically protecting the people 's lives and property in various missions to deal with emergencies and relieve disaster victims , writing heroic songs of victory one after another and fully demonstrating a good image of being a mighty and civilized army and an army of triumph .  
The democratization of international relations is far from being realized , the unjust and unfair world political and economic order remains unchanged , the gaps between the South and the North in development levels and between the rich and the poor are widening , and conflicts caused by racial , religious , and other issues are continuing .  
It is necessary to keep to and improve the system of regional ethnic autonomy , fully and correctly implement the party 's ethnic policy and religious policy , unite all forces that can be united , resolutely foil all separatist plans and sabotage attempts by a small number of separatists and the international hostile forces , and strive for a lasting peace and political stability in Tibet .  
The US believes that , in the aftermath of the Cold War , and particularly since entering the new century , there are still the following eight destabilizing factors in Asia : Border conflicts , religious contradictions , unstable domestic political situations , social and regional turmoil , territorial and sovereignty disputes , ethnic separatism , terrorist operations , and population problems .  
The after-effects of the financial crisis still exist in certain countries in varying degrees , resulting in political turmoil and conspicuous ethnic , religious , and other social contradictions , seriously affecting the confidence of domestic and foreign investors .  
Recently , at an interview by a Hong Kong reporters ' delegation , Raidi , executive deputy secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee and chairman of the Standing Committee of the autonomous regional people 's congress said : After the passing of the 14th Dalai Lama , we will find the reincarnated child , according to historical conventions and religious rituals that were formed hundreds of years ago .  
Raidi said : Successive Dalai Lamas first searched for a few candidates for a relevant reincarnated child , according to historical conventions and religious rituals , before selecting one of them according to the ceremony of drawing lots from a golden urn and confirming the child after the approval of the central government .  Any act that runs counter to historical conventions and religious rituals would be regarded as invalid .  
Wang Lequan said that due to the daily convolution of the international situation , as we entered the 1990s , the international Islamic fundamentalist forces began to rear their ugly face , and they ran rampant in their activities .  Under the influence of international forces , within our borders , minority separatists and religious radicals harboring political schemes have been incited and encouraged , and they have created a definite unfavorable influence on Xinjiang 's social and political stability .  However , Xinjiang correctly implemented national minority and religious policies ;  
while in Japan , the three-party ruling coalition is divided in opinion , 21 mass organizations have staged demonstrations in protest , and another 14 religious bodies have issued objection statements .  However Koizumi turned a deaf ear to all this , and was bent on having his own way on the issue of paying homage to the Yasukuni Shrine ; and his thickheaded performance has made him excel all his predecessors .  
It was learned that while carrying out the " face-to-face " propaganda activity , the propaganda team members mainly explained the party 's and state 's nationality policies , rural policies , and religious policies and publicized the tremendous changes that had taken place in the local areas since reform and opening up .  Each year , they would revise the themes and key topics of the propaganda activity in light of outstanding problems during different periods .  
In addition , with the continuous improvement of democracy and the construction of the legal system , they have made prominent progress in democratic supervision , participation in and deliberation of state affairs , religious beliefs , and other political rights .  So long as China continues to follow the road of development that is in line with its national situation , China will achieve major progress in its social and economic development and the Chinese people will enjoy an even higher level of human rights .  
When asked about the current state of the boy designated by the Dalai as the " reincarnated soul boy " of the Panchen , Raidi said : The " reincarnated soul boy " of the Panchen proclaimed without authorization by the Dalai in 1995 is against religious rules and is illegal .  The boy is living a very happy life , is receiving education , and is growing up in a healthy manner .  He is now a primary school student .  
Besides , regional conflicts triggered by racial , religious , and territorial problems have never cease to break out , rising one after another ; many transnational problems , such as international crime and environmental deterioration , are far from being solved ; and the international community is still faced with many challenges .  
It was reported that in meeting with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel in Ankara , President Jiang Zemin expressed that both China and Turkey are faced with the task of protecting national unity and territorial integrity and both oppose all kinds of international terrorism , national separatism and religious extremism .

Li Tieying stressed : The development of the western regions is a massive and systematic project involving ecological environmental protection , infrastructure construction , industrial restructuring , scientific and technological education , reform and opening up , and ethnic and religious issues .  
Countries differ in many ways , in their social systems , historical backgrounds , cultural heritage , economic development , standard of living , religious beliefs , and values .  Therefore , it is not possible to expect all countries to develop after a single model or system .  
Any person , so long as he lives in this world , should enjoy the rights to subsistence , personal security , and all kinds of freedom .  People should treat each other equally despite their races , white , yellow , or black , and religious beliefs .  Any discrimination , hostility , killing in revenge , or ethnic cleansing is considered illegal .  
Li Peng said : China similarly respects the general principle of the international community on human rights .  However , we feel that as countries have different social systems , economic conditions , historical backgrounds , cultural traditions , and religious beliefs , they do not share an identical understanding of human rights .  This is very natural .  
By integrating basic Marxist theory on ethnic and religious issues with the specific reality of China , our party has formed a complete set of correct ethnic and religious policies , and we must uphold these for a long time .  
repeatedly talked nonsense at international occasions ; made malicious and entirely groundless accusations against the policy of the Chinese Government towards Tibet ; and wantonly spread such rumors as that " the human rights situation in Tibet is deteriorating , " " the Tibetan culture has become extinct , " and " there is no religious freedom in Tibet , " thus turning himself into a " master of wild lies . "  
the effective protection and the active use of cultural relics and historical records ; the respect and protection that has been showed and extended to customs and folkways as well as to the freedom of religious belief ; an all-round inheritance and development of culture and arts ; a comprehensive engagement in Tibetan studies ; and by the rejuvenation of the Tibetan medicine .  All these have attested to the full that the Tibetan culture has undergone an unprecedented development , and this is a fact that allows of no doubt .  
Second , continuous efforts should be made to crack down on religious extremist forces , ethnic secessionist forces , international terrorism and other transnational crimes that endanger regional stability and security .  
The foreign ministers of the five countries express their deep worry over the increasingly rampant activities of the forces of national separatism , international terrorism , and religious extremism .  They hold that those forces are the main threat to regional security and stability and it is necessary to tackle the situation through strengthening bilateral and multilateral cooperation , including the signing of related treaties and agreements by the " five countries . "  
5 .  All sides reaffirm their determination to jointly crack down on national splittism , international terrorism , and religious extremism that constitute major threats to regional peace , stability , and development and on such criminal activities as illicit trafficking in weapons and narcotics and illegal migration .  To this end , the five countries will draw up relevant multilateral outlines as early as possible ;  
As the social systems , historical backgrounds , cultural traditions , economic levels , living quality , religious beliefs , senses of value , and so on of all countries in the world differ in thousands of ways and it is impossible to ask every country to indiscriminately copy one model and one system .  
The top leaders of five nations : China , Russia , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , and Tajikistan , met in Dushanbe not long ago and issued a statement , reiterating their joint efforts to strike blows at national splittism , international terrorism , and religious extremism . ( referred to as three forces hereunder for short ) .  They also decided to set up an antiterrorism organ in Bishkek , Kyrgyzstand capital .  
Since the end of the Cold War , the nationality , racial , and religious contradictions which were covered during the war , have become more and more evident ; in particular , the splittist activity has gained headway in theory and practice , while the relevant countries and the international community were not ready for this , nor did they adopt effective countermeasures .  
Seven principal responsible persons of China 's five main religions announced in Beijing today the formation of a delegation of Chinese religious leaders to take part in the " Millennium World Peace Assembly " to be held at the United Nations in late August , attended by religious leaders from around the world .  
With the " Millennium World Peace Assembly " as the main topic , the seminar discussed questions of defusing conflicts , preserving peace , working at dialogue , promoting exchanges , eliminating poverty , protecting the environment , treasuring peace , and incorporating things of diverse nature ; they fully expressed the stance , views , and ideas of China 's religious and scholastic circles for preserving peace and creating a beautiful living space for mankind .  
Jamyang stated : " Only by developing the economy in the areas inhabited by the Tibetan nationality and improving the livelihood of the people of the Tibetan nationality will we be able to better maintain the cultural heritage of the Tibetan nationality or protect the freedom of religious belief or otherwise the culture or traditional religion of the Tibetan nationality would become exhibits only to be ' admired ' by others and would gradually wane . " 
Fu Tieshan said : " Facts tell us : As the status of religion in China has been rising , we have discovered that a certain number of people have misused the name of religion , attained their personal gains under the pretext of religion , and misled and misguided a large number of disciples without correct religious guidance .  We feel very sad about this . "  
He said : Further efforts to expand and strengthen friendly cooperation between the two countries and their militaries in all fields , and joint efforts to strike at ethnic splittism that seriously threaten the stability of relevant nations and regional security , international terrorism , religious extremist forces , and transnational criminal activities , conform to the basic interests of the two countries and their peoples , and are of great significance to safeguarding peace , stability , and development in this region .  
A Fu Tieshan-led delegation of Chinese religious leaders held a roundtable meeting in Washington today with a group of American religious people headed by ( Arthur Schneier ) , chairman of a US intuitive knowledge foundation , to exchange views on such issues as religious freedom and increasing bilateral religious cooperation and exchange in a friendly , candid manner .  
Among the religious figures , scholars , overseas Chinese , and Chinese in the United States , many people have objectively and fairly affirmed the fact that Chinese citizens enjoy freedom of religious belief .  They held : The visiting Chinese delegation of religious leaders has enhanced the American people 's understanding of freedom of religious belief in China . It has been helpful in reducing misunderstandings and has laid a new foundation for further increasing exchanges and cooperation between American and Chinese religious circles .  
After leaving the hall , Buddhist Master Shenghui , member of the Chinese religious and spiritual leaders delegation and vice president of the Buddhist Association of China , told Chinese and foreign reporters : " It was unwise for the Dalai Lama to dispatch a representative to read his letter to the Millennium World Peace Summit , though he was clever not to attend the summit .  As a result , the move has disrupted the normal process of the summit , which is not in harmony with the general atmosphere of the meeting . "  
The broad masses of national and religious people must fully understand the hypocritical and reactionary nature of the Dalai separatist clique , uphold and carry forward the fine tradition of patriotism , and firmly resist the penetration and sabotage activities carried out by hostile forces from outside the borders .  Cadres and people of all nationalities must extremely cherish and safeguard stability with a high level of political consciousness ; respect and support one another in their work and life ;  
it gained the understanding and respect of many people with a sense of justice .  He expressed the hope that the religious bodies will as always act in accordance with the principle of running their religions in an independent fashion and making their own decisions , as laid down by the constitution , strengthen their own building , cultivate talented people for international religious exchanges who love the country and their religion , actively unfold friendly exchanges with foreign countries , and further advance on the world .  
At the turn of the century , the international situation is going through profound changes .  The world is not peaceful , and various factors that threaten world peace and security have continued to exist .  Regional conflicts arising from racial , religious , and territorial disputes are on the rise , and there are complex conflicts and problems hampering the common development of countries .  
Jiang Zemin 's speech at the lunch was his only public speech to nongovernmental bodies during his trip to attend the UN Millennium Summit . The contents dealt with various aspects of Sino-US relations , including the most crucial problem , that of Taiwan ; he also dwelt at length on China 's social system , cultural background , national spirit , and social state , and elaborated on the Chinese Government 's policies on press freedom , religious freedom , strengthening the rule of law , and ethnic policy .  
After the five countries in the region gained independence in the early 1990 ' s , they banned extremist religious and nationalist political bodies and openly cracked down on extremists threatening social stability .  
This responsible person noted that ever since the true features the " Falungong " as a religious cult were revealed , over 98 percent of the " Falungong " practitioners have seen the error of their ways and are determined to make a clean break with their past .  Today , they have successfully extricated themselves from Li Hongzhi 's spiritual control , and are leading a normal life .  
In order to realize their ulterior political motives and ambitions , cults often make use of loopholes in state laws and social administration policies .  Under the cloak of religious cultivation or physical exercise , they set up very strict internal interdictions and taboos and establish among their followers illegal and rigidly stratified organizational structures in an attempt to form " secret kingdoms " based on " religious belief " outside the framework of a legal society .  
Shoko Asahara proclaimed himself to be " the sacred religious Emperor " and under him there are 21 " ministries and agencies " organized into east followers agency , west followers agency , intelligence ministry , defense agency , foreign affairs ministry , and so on .  He also drafted a so-called " the first draft basic law of the supreme truth country " and made himself the supreme ruler of the " supreme truth . "  
He expressed the hope that the youth of religious circles will carry forward and promote the fine traditions of religious personages of the older generation in loving their country and religion ; unswervingly uphold the principle of independent , autonomous , and self-run churches ; conscientiously resist the political and ideological infiltration of foreign forces through religion ; establish a good image of religious practitioners ; unite the youth of religious circles ; inspire greater enthusiasm for building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Jia Chunwang also emphatically pointed out : Chinese public security organs should resolutely crack down on sabotages schemed by Western hostile forces and elements ; resolutely crack down on illegal and criminal activities schemed by national separatists , violent terrorists , and religious forces ; and resolutely ban " Falungong " and other illegal cults and harshly crack down on their illegal and criminal activities according to law .  
Especially during the past 20 and more years since the introduction of reform and opening up , the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association and the Chinese Catholic Bishops College have cooperated with each other closely , forged ahead in unity , assisted the party and government in implementing the policy of religious freedom , pushed forward the development of patriotic organizations , vigorously nurtured middle-aged and young patriotic clerics , actively promoted democratic management of churches , striven to adapt to socialist society , and brought about progress and development in various church undertakings by leaps and bounds .  
Hong Kong Religious Organization Producing ' The Story of Jesus Christ ' CD 's [ subhead ] According to an informed customs official on the Chinese Mainland , on the eve of the coming Christmas , Chinese authorities recently notified customs offices in Guangzhou , Shenzhen and Zhuhai to watch out for the luggage of incoming motor vehicles and passengers so as to stop all CD 's with religious themes and other harmful propaganda materials from flowing into the Mainland .  
They sedulously arranged for the " Falun Gong " elements to spread the fantastic rumor about the Chinese Government 's persecution of the " Falun Gong " followers at the hearing on the so-called " human rights issues in China and Tibet , " held by the US Congress Foreign Relations Committee , and invited Li Hongzhi 's right-hand assistants and " pro-democracy " and " Tibetan independence " elements to attend the hearing on the so-called " issues of religious freedom in China , " to prepare public opinion for the anti-China proposal .  
In this struggle , the party and government have , adhering to their main objectives of defending the vital interests of the masses , protecting citizens ' freedom of religious belief and personal dignity from infringement , and maintaining social stability , banned and cracked down on the Falungong cult and their illegal activities in accordance with law and punished the handful of key Falungong elements who broke the law .  
Also attending the meeting were leaders of the central committees of all democratic parties , federations of industry and commerce , leading cadres and personages without party affiliation , personages of ethnic and religious circles living in Beijing , and responsible persons of the units under the united front system .  A total of 300 people attended the party .  
Regional conflicts sparked by ethnic , religious , territorial , resource , and other factors have continued to break out ; all kinds of splittist forces , terrorist forces , and extremist forces have continued to compromise the international community ; environmental , drug , refugee , and other global problems have become increasingly prominent .  
In view of this , we , the vast numbers of Chinese living in overseas areas , strongly demand that based on China 's relevant laws as well as the international consensus on fighting against religious cults , and for the sake of the fundamental interests of the greatest majority the Chinese people and Chinese living in overseas areas , the Chinese Government should crack down harder on the handful of ' Falungong ' members who refuse to repent and mend their way .  
The incident of people trying to burn themselves to death not only undermined the peaceful and harmonious atmosphere of the festive occasion , but also made people suddenly realize that the scourge of " Falungong " cult is no longer gesticulations with hands and feet and the muttering of incantations , but has developed into a frenzied stage of destroying oneself and others and of affecting public order and challenging the rule of law with the extreme behavior of " sacrificing one 's life for a religious cause . "  
Upon learning the collective suicidal action of some obsessed practitioners of " Falungong " at Tiananmen square , people in the religious circles were strongly shocked .  The exposed and criticized the malicious nature of " Falungong " in various forms .  
In February , 2000 , the French Government 's Interministerial Committee on Opposing Evil Cults published its annual report , explicitly defining for the first time an " evil cult " as : " An organization formed in an arbitrary way , which follows a certain religious goal ( no matter whether or not such a goal is made public ) and carries out activities harmful to human rights or social equilibrium . "  
By appropriating religious terminology in their attempts to disrupt public order , undermine social stability , defy state law , and endanger people 's lives , Li Hongzhi and the " Falungong " organization under his control have become a highly influential evil force that poses a grave danger to people and society .  Their organizational activities and roles in society are despised by all normal religious organizations that preach good deeds to people .  
China 's five major religious organizations also held a discussion meeting on 31 January to strongly condemn the heinous act of " Falungong " in killing lives .  They expressed resolute support for the Chinese Government 's severe crackdown on " Falungong " diehards in accordance with the law .  
The serious social fact that evil cults appear in the late 20th century , to a certain degree , was caused by the frequent abuse of the concept of " religious freedom " by some people with ulterior motives .  " Freedom of religious belief " has been used by some evil forces as a shield and " protective talisman " as a way to spread their influence and get away with it .  
He said , since the use of the term " religious freedom " may provide certain conducive social ideological and legal room for the development of evil cults to a certain degree , then why ca n't the international cooperation mechanisms against evil cults find a substitute term to reduce such misunderstanding and distortion ?  
It has been proven by facts in the entire process , chief executive Tung Chee-hwa , the SAR government , central institutions stationed in Hong Kong , and people from all circles have never doubted and criticized the nature and activities of other religions .  On the contrary , they have recommended upright religious activities as positive forces for stabilizing the society and guiding people toward benevolence .  
In the past five years , the 11th Panchen Lama has been accorded great kindness by high priests of Tibetan Buddhism and the worship and support of the vast number of believers .  He has received numerous local and foreign living Buddhas and high priests , held many religious meetings for the monks , and touched the heads of followers to bless them .  
Ismail Amat said : China is a country with multiple nationalities and religions .  The party and government always take the nationality and religious work seriously and have practiced a series of correct policies to handle the nationality and religious issues , so that all kinds of interests of the minority nationalities and religious followers have been safeguarded , the socialist national relationship of equality , unity , and mutual assistance has been consolidated and developed with each passing day , and various nationalities have made unceasing development and progress in the big family of the motherland .  
Now , the broad masses of people of various nationalities have clearly seen the reactionary nature of those extremist religious forces and national separatist forces , are greatly resentful against those forces , and consciously and resolutely resist those forces .  As a result , national separatist activities have been effectively restrained .  
People of religious circles expressed one after another their positive response and pledged to firmly support activities of " fighting against heretical cults by religious circles , " eradicating evil things , discarding the false and retaining the true , and making contributions to cutting out the tumor of the " Falungong cult and creating an auspicious , peaceful and happy society .  
Through visiting the United States and west Europe and receiving a number of European and US parliamentary delegations visiting China , we have continued to hold friendly and frank dialogue on the Taiwan issue , human rights , religious issues , and China 's WTO accession , thus further promoting mutual understanding and expanding consensus .  
In order to maintain the total number of general holidays ( other than Sundays ) at the present level of 17 days a year , a consultation exercise was held earlier this year , when employers ' and employees ' organisations , the financial services sector and religious bodies were asked to advise which existing general but not statutory holidays should be used to offset the new general holidays for Labour Day and the Buddha 's Birthday .  
( a ) According to the records of the Buildings Department , 864 existing privately owned buildings were completed before the Second World War , of which 11 are protected under the Antiquities and Monuments Ordinance , 144 are commercial , religious or community buildings , and 709 are residential or composite buildings .  
It was reported that the Liaison Office of the Central People 's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ( " the Liaison Office " ) asked leaders of the local Catholic diocese to adopt a low key approach in handling activities in celebration of the Vatican 's canonisation on October 1 of 120 Catholic missionaries and their followers who had been killed in China a hundred years ago .  The diocese later disclosed also that some scheduled religious exchange activities with its Mainland counterparts had been put on hold , probably due to the said canonisation .  
The quiet , elegant and exquisite court dance with her tranquil beauty reveals the royal dignity and prays for national peace .  The folk dance is naturally generated and developed from people 's religious and daily life .  It tends to be emotional and expressive , showing the joy and ecstasy of people .  
Under current policy , the normal term of newly granted land leases for educational , religious and institutional / community facilities is 50 years .  For recreational / sports facilities and private independent schools , the normal terms of new land leases are 21 years and 10 years respectively .  
Those who submitted views to us include individuals , organisations , local residents and people living outside Hong Kong . The submissions came from a wide range of sectors and strata , including district organisations , professional and business bodies , local and foreign chambers of commerce , clansmen 's groups , religious sector , businessmen , women 's groups , students , staff and faculty members of tertiary institutes , cultural and arts sector , legal sector and publication sector .  
Pastor Chou pointed out that the free translation , adoption of special literary styles such as parallelism , and the elimination of conjunctions as far as possible , have allowed the true meaning of the Bible 's religious terminology and idioms to be preserved . The manipulation of punctuation marks , verbs and direct and indirect quotations , have also helped to make the modern Chinese Bible more colloquial , simple , graceful and beautiful .  
If mental illness is involved , Lifeline can call on a panel of professional volunteers . Expert help is also available for people with social , psychological , educational , legal , nursing , medical , or religious problems .  
Offering Incense , " " Procession , " and " Watching the Show " were all taken in 1935 during a religious festival in Teng 's hometown of Peipu . In the layered effect of the pilgrims in " Offering Incense , " the smoky haze of " Procession , " and the angled viewpoint of " Watching the Show , " Teng takes a participatory yet objective approach , creating expressive , realistic works close to pure documentary .  
In fact , flowers or " sacrifices , " aside from differences in religious connotation , both contain a single heartfelt meaning . And using animals as offerings has been known in both east and west ; in China , they also carry thousands of years of unbroken tradition and symbolic meaning .  
It was only in the nineteenth century that foreign influence became so strong that things actually changed . The English and Europeans broke China open not for religious reasons but more for commercial and political reasons .  
The painstaking process of raising them , in which expense is no object , would be inconceivable in ordinary hog raising , which is aimed at economic efficiency , but religious or spiritual values can never be measured in terms of economic efficiency .  
Community cultural activities will be held regularly during weekends or vacations . A spirit of good neighborliness is sure to prevail , and mutual assistance within an interdependent entity will become common . In collaboration with religious and civic bodies , the government will endeavor to foster and encourage ethical norms which are in conformity with our present-day society , itself a product of popular customs and mores blended with traditional rites and ceremonies .  
In traditional China there was a strong emphasis on the here and now , and among the upper classes ancestor worship tended to be functional rather than religious in nature . The same naturally held true among the lower classes , where for ordinary people with little familiarity with classical writings ancestor worship was seen in terms of personal gain .  
Among the traditional yi-chen , some which have particularly compelling singing , genuine religious significance , or functions of bonding people orbuilding healthier bodies , have been promoted in primary and middle schools . For example , the Sung Chiang chen , which stresses unity , and the Cart Drum chen , with its athletic movements , are both being passed on in a number of schools .  
The amount and scale of temple festivals today and the number of believers taking part is very unlike what happened during the " modern scientism " of the 1960s and ' 70s , when people expected there to be no trace of them in the metropolis and hardly anything in the countryside . On the contrary , pilgrimages , foundation services , festivals and religious activities to ward off disasters have all been encouraged by officials and public alike , so that there is now a flourishing in both cities and villages .  
Wu is the executive director of the foundation and its painful opening announcement was like a short summary of his work : " The Chinese Communists established the reform-through-labor brigades some 40 years ago . Their inmates still include so-called counter-revolutionaries , class enemies , those deemed to be against the party and socialism , religious figures , " historical " counter-revolutionaries and members of the Tienanmen democracy movement .  
Besides the merely religious activities of praying for good fortune , the temple has celebrations linked to the season . From Chinese New Year 's to the Sea Goddess ' birthday in March , there is a continuous stream of activities , including classical dances to welcome the God of Happiness and ceremonies welcoming Matsu as well as such traditional farming and fishing activities as the dying of fish nets , chanting to count fish fry , walking the water wheel , grabbing chickens and floating on bamboo rafts to grab ducks .  
At present 25% of the national budget goes for defense and the military ; 20% goes toward economic development ; routine government administrative costs account for 10% ; 15% is applied to education . . . . The remaining few percent is up for grabs among public health , agriculture , social welfare , religious , and other interests , naturally leading to the " squeezing out " effect .  
The Han dynasty ( 206 BC - 220 AD ) had an official charged with rearing the emperor 's hunting dogs , and in the Tang dynasty ( 618-9O7 ) there was even a special imperial kennels which raised hunting dogs for the emperor . Long ago , primitive men had dances imitating animals . The " dance of the hundred beasts " was not a performance using real animals as in a circus , but a religious ritual dance similar to the annual nuowu dances to drive out evil .  
For 30 years , Sanyi sold its products for export , but later Taiwan 's withdrawal from the United Nations and the international energy crisis brought a decline . Over the last decade , with a booming stock market and economic development , there has been an excellent market within Taiwan , especially for carvings of religious figures such as Maitreya Buddha , which are seen as symbols of prosperity by local people .  
For instance , some factories only carve all kinds of Bodhidarma figures , while others specialize in human figures , or birds and animals , and so on . " Collective creation on a production line " is also a widespread method . To take a religious statue as an example , after the rough wooden blank has been cut out , the carving of its face , hands , curves and background , the application of gold leaf and other operations are all the responsibility of different specialists .  
They tore down the Matsu Temple , which was the center of religious life in Taipei , and built Kodama Goto Memorial Hall ( honoring the fourth Governor-General Kodama Gentaro and Senior Minister Goto Shinpei ) . Western classical music was played on the hall 's open-air stage all day long . All sorts of celebrations were also held here , as was the incomparably famous World Expo .  
Although not distinguished for their size , Taiwan 's rivers did at least once run with water that was clear , and like major rivers elsewhere they played a central part in daily life . People rose with the dawn and retired at dusk , relying on rivers to supply drinking water , facilitate transport and answer religious needs , and so there was a bond that tied society to the river .  
Such " objective methods " may make hypnosis more acceptable to the general public , but they also limit it to shallower depths . Wang Wu-shih pays special attention to the depth to which Eastern religious devotees delve " to awaken to the truth " : " When people repeatedly enter the subconscious to explore , their quest goes beyond the level of treating emotional problems and disease to probing at the very nature of life . "  
He viewed his patient 's emotional and physical state sparked by painful past experiences as a kind of " unusual mental power . " Wang is the first to employ the powers of mental projection , determination and imagination as used by Eastern religious devotees to deal with these " negative energies . "  
Europeans had been fascinated with the legendary beauty of the Orient ever since Marco Polo 's diaries of the 13th century and the spread of stories about the splendor of Japan 's golden temples and religious statuary . Intrepid explorers and businessmen took their crews across the vast oceans to the mythical " golden isles " of the Far East .  
Chiang Kuan-feng feels that on this occasion the issuing of invitations was " broad and deep . " Equal attention was given to the central government and the localities ; professional , religious , and social groups were all included ; and even overseas Chinese were given as fair a distribution of RSVPs as possible . As for how many people could or would come , it was hard to say . The only thing to do was keep calling the contact people for each group and ask , " What will your attendance rate be ? "  
To attract followers , such groups employ methods of " intensive instruction , therapy and guidance , an isolated environment , and worship of the religious leader , " which are akin to brainwashing techniques . These cause people to identify with the doctrine and ceremonies of the religion , so that believers fully believe themselves to be acting of their own free will . Yet outsiders find their behavior inexplicable . The end result is tragedy , with society paying enormous costs .  
Against this background , Huang advises that it is inappropriate for students , lacking experience in society and with immature minds , to be allowed to participate in long-termed , closed activities like the summer camp . Moreover , he suggests , the government should regulate all religious activities that do not follow general practice or common sense . Otherwise , it is not impossible that similar crises of family and social ethics will again occur .  
Minister of Justice Liao , fully engaged in the campaign to crack down on illegal behavior in all areas of life , suggests that the Sung case shows the serious extent of the penetration of religious groups by criminal gangs ; this has already become part of his professional territory . Taipei City Mayor Chen Shui-bian also announced a crackdown on criminally connected shrines to begin on October 15 .  
He observes that according to statistics , nearly 13% of people in the US have some sort of mental disorder . This clearly illustrates the famous words of Jesus Christ : " Man does not live by bread alone . " The ancient religious practices of meditation and contemplating the impermanence of life can positively help modern people , who are undergoing immense changes in social relations and also witnessing rapid transformations both at work and their private lives .  
Many people set themselves up as great religious masters , but their actions are quite at odds with their own teachings , " Sogyal Rinpoche says . He says a real master must be of a certain " lineage " through which teachings are transmitted to him . He must have a flawless character , and most importantly , has to be " selfless , " " compassionate " and " wise . " If people observe carefully , they should be able to tell the difference .  
He compares how in both Mayan culture ( or the New World generally ) and Chinese culture ( or the Old World generally ) , the newly arising class societies were based on religious ritual . Their highly developed writing systems and beautiful sacrificial objects were used in the service of religion and politics , whereas the tools they used for material production had not advanced beyond the stone implements used in prehistoric times .  
After a trip abroad , he discovered that Chinese Muslims had little understanding of their own religion 's doctrines , and were in dire need of an accurate Qur'an and other materials for interpreting it . He thus spent more than 20 years translating three Chinese texts altogether : one in classical Chinese , one in jingtangwen ( an old form with specific religious terms left in their original form , that is , not translated into a common equivalent ) , and one in the vernacular .  
The problem is that we label aboriginal traditions as " ecologically wise " based on modern concepts of resource management developed in the industrialized world . But aboriginal culture is not some theory , but a practical way of life . It is a community culture produced through countless generations coexisting with nature , and includes a full complement of religious , ethical and social beliefs and values .  
For the mass of ordinary people , who are impatient and full of worldly desires , the idea of heaven as an essentially illusory mental state achieved by self-cultivation is abstruse and complex , and the continuous , unrelenting effort required to enter such a state is both hard to understand and hard to achieve . Thus it is understandable that a " heaven " in which religious concepts are simplified and popularized is preferred by proselytizers .  
From Laozi it borrows the concepts of non-action , clear understanding , and acting in harmony with nature . From Zhuangzi come the concepts of total freedom and life-for-the-fun-of-it . Combining these concepts , religious Daoism holds that in order to become an immortal , one must be free of joy and anger , eliminate desire , live in quietude and non-action , maintain primitive simplicity , and act in harmony with the natural laws of the universe .  
Chao Ko-shih has seen an even more ridiculous example . One powerful and wealthy old man died from cancer , but because his children had different religious beliefs and each wanted to put on impressive and stately funerals , he ended up with five different ceremonies . The Protestants , Catholics , Buddhists and Taoists each had at least one go at it . When a ceremony ended , they would give him a shot of embalming fluid , put him back in the freezer and wait for the next time !  
In addition to the towering bronze statue , the two burial pits also contained 57 bronze heads . Sharp lines delineate big , protruding eyes and tightly closed lips . While each of these figures was used in religious rites , the air of religious intensity in each face is hidden behind a mask .  
Says Mei : " This is where the Jesuits established the first Western-type university in the Far East , while Chinese scholars such as Hong Xiuquan , Lin Zexu , Liang Qichao , Kang Youwei and Cheng Guanying spent time here absorbing Western learning . " Macau emerged unscathed from WWII , and many of its original Portuguese-language documents have been preserved intact , providing an invaluable resource for research into cultural and religious exchanges between East and West .  
Huang Ming-chuan , who studied law before he began making movies , has come to be seen as the standard-bearer for independent films in Taiwan . Flat Tire , which he completed two years ago , tells the story of a pair of documentary makers traveling around Taiwan to film the island 's religious and political statuary . ( photo by Pu Hua-chih )  
Santa Claus and the department stores team up to hoodwink innocent , trusting little children , and the original religious meaning of Christmas has been replaced by a superficial " eat , drink , and be merry " approach to the holidays . This has happened because industrialized society is pulling away from its agrarian roots .  
Relations with the mainland at the highest political level have reached impasse after impasse , and dark war clouds gather over the Taiwan Strait ; yet at the grassroots level , what with trade links , fishing links and intermarriage , the people are inseparably intermingled , and the same is true on the academic , cultural and religious fronts and even in the entertainment and travel industries .  
" Perhaps the more innovative , secular forms of music are not best for inspiring profound religious sentiments . But as a means of entertainment , music can at least soften the forbidding impression that many people have of Buddhism . It is a convenient way of guiding people towards salvation . "  
Scripture includes an account of Buddha telling a nearby monk to stop reciting his texts in a singsong fashion . Sutras had to be intoned , not sung , and there was none of the melodic , rhythmic type of incantation that is heard in temples today . Members of the clergy were not allowed to take part in the music that worshippers presented by way of devotional offering , and the religious code prohibited monks and nuns from watching musical performances .  
According to Chang Sung-jen , an art critic who acts as Ju Ming 's agent , " Tai ji quan involves a force that is from beyond the realm of ordinary human experience , and art that focuses on this subject could very nearly be categorized as religious art . The people motif , on the other hand , is about the commonplace . " To deal with the subject of tai ji quan takes boldness and vigor , while sculpting people requires great attention to detail and very good technical skill .  
This visit , which has been called " soft diplomacy , " breaks the previous mold of focusing on political and economic power . Instead , the vice president 's delegation included members of the cultural , religious , and scientific communities , and elected officials as well .  
Fourth , they established organized systems of religious practice . Examples are clerics such as Hui Neng , sixth patriarch of Chan Buddhism , Master Xian Shou , who founded the Huayan Sect in the Tang dynasty , and Master Zhi Zhe , who enabled the Tiantai Sect to spread far and wide . A final characteristic of the most distinctive figures in Buddhism is that their stories were avidly related by later generations .  
For example Master Hui Neng , despite being illiterate , was known for his skill at literary discussion and the composition of religious verse . It was Hui Neng who left his cassock on a rock atop Dayu Ridge , from where the monk who was following him was unable to move it . The external actions of those who had attained enlightenment often strayed into the realm of what for normal people would be " miracles . "  
It 's fortunate , then , that the instructors at the leadership education camps put on in Taiwan this past year included figures beyond the usual line-up of political leaders featured at events sponsored by political parties . Some instructors at the camps were religious leaders and others were people making their marks in such areas as social welfare , community education or environmental protection .  
The growing number of leadership training activities sponsored by Taiwan NGOs mix personal development with professional skills enhancement , religious training , volunteerism and political reform . These programs can help charismatic leaders who are both politically involved and morally upstanding to become greater forces for good . Amid growing cultural diversity , only a new kind of leader with broader , more holistic values will be able to create frameworks suitable to the new era .  
Sadly , development is causing the diversity of Taiwan 's wetlands to decline rapidly . Since the banks of the small lake in the Tatun Nature Park in Yangmingshan National Park , formerly overgrown with lush aquatic plants , were tidied up , and visitors released turtles and koi carp there , in a short time the number of dragonfly species in the area has fallen from over 20 to only five or six . Taiwan 's beautiful mountain lakes have also become places where religious believers set animals " free . " Island ecologies are fragile .  
9-11 has left us at the brink of war , but the possibility of military conflict as a result of US retaliation is not the only worry . A fluke incident and a single leader 's misjudgment in many other flashpoints worldwide could push us beyond the point of no return . The historic enmity between Israel and Palestine comes to mind , as do the ethnic and religious killing in Eastern Europe . North and South Korea are another cause for concern .  
Only 11 and a half years old at the time , Yu-ju had a unique experience one twilight evening while participating in a white-robe meditation session . With everyone swaying to the rhythm of religious music , she saw many points of silver light hovering in the air above the seat where Osho 's founder used to sit when he was alive .  
The contents of the exhibit can be divided into four categories . First are the splendid and ornate gold and silver pieces of the Tang dynasty royal family , followed by the tricolor glaze pottery and ceramic pieces that were used by the ordinary folk of that time . Then there are the Buddhist and Taoist statues that evoke the Tang 's flourishing and diverse religious environment .  
The Ministry of the Interior 's issuance of permanent residency certificates to religious and medical personnel such as Bjarne Gislefoss is a courtesy extended in recognition of the Taiwanese public 's gratitude to them , for they have long since made Taiwan their second homeland . The relaxation of the conditions for permanent residency for long-term foreign residents is based on humanitarian considerations , and may make them more willing to choose to " keep their roots in Taiwan . "  
Of course , now that these religious rituals have become tourist attractions , they have lost a lot of their awe-inspiring and intimidating nature . Indeed , with the many performance troupes that now participate , the night inspection has taken on a festive spirit similar to ordinary temple parades . Nonetheless , the ancient rituals and the chilling legends surrounding them still live on in people 's thoughts as they watch .  
Ciqing paper is dyed with indigo to the same deep blue as appears on blue-and-white porcelain . In ancient times in China this paper was used for copying Buddhist scriptures with gold paste ink . It expressed the solemn dignity of the religious texts especially well .  
They include the medical teams of the International Cooperation and Development Fund , young men doing " overseas duty " as a substitute for military service , religious organizations , and individual doctors . They are performing a wide range of medical assistance activities not just limited to simple humanitarian aid , including donation of medical supplies , technical exchange in the field of public health , education and training , promotion of preventive medicine against epidemic illnesses , and " matchmaking " between people with certain medical needs and those who can provide what is needed .  
Why is it that the WHO , which emphasizes pursuing human health across all racial , religious , economic , and social boundaries , is unable to bring Taiwan within its international network ?  
For example , they categorized the Aborigines into groups based on criteria like mutual intelligibility of language , physical characteristics , social structure ( for example , the Puyuma and Amis had matriarchal societies , the Rukai and Paiwan had aristocratic classes ) , and religious beliefs ( e.g . ancestral worship , the belief in pygmy spirits ) . It was only at this point that the division of Taiwan 's Aboriginal peoples into nine tribes appeared .  
The Estate is not the only structure closely connected to the history of Wufeng to be in this condition . The Wan Fo Temple , a busy religious center that was located in the mountains behind the provincial assembly building , was once the largest Buddhist monastery and temple complex in the entire rural township . Its most distinctive feature was a 20-meter tall golden statue of Baisajyagurvaiduryaprabhasa in a seated position . Though the statue itself is still intact , the remainder of the structure was eradicated by the earthquake .  
The Cultural Bureau of Taichung County last year organized the teachers ' pilgrimage group so as to disseminate understanding of the religious meaning of the pilgrimage and its transforming spiritual power . This year it added groups of volunteers who explained the cultural and historical significance of the festival and recounted their personal experiences with the majesty and power of the tradition .  
These instruments are not only the main characters in Indian music and dance but are also a principal medium for honoring the gods and entertaining people . And the erotic paintings that cause people to blush at the museum are not only expressions of human carnal desires . They are even better illustrations of the many-layered Indian religious philosophy , which holds that gods rose out of the common human world .  
The graves show that the Shihsanhang people buried their dead lying on their side , knees bent . The body was usually positioned with the head to the southwest , perhaps for cultural or religious reasons . Pottery , pearl ornaments , and gold objects accompanied the body in the grave .  
Apart from the medicinal herb exhibition and the free clinics ( Paosheng is , after all , the god of medicine ) , there was also a photo exhibition ( " The Beauty of Paoan Temple " ) by master photographer Ko Hsi-chieh , as well as seminars on religious ceremonies , a guided tour to the art of altars , and folk arts and crafts workshops designed for the 3-day chingcheng jiao that began on June 13th . These varied activities were aimed at giving people deeper understanding into the inner meaning of religious culture .  
" But when they reached middle age , and their material dreams were satisfied , they felt spiritual emptiness , as a result of which many turned to dissipated lifestyles , extramarital affairs , and religious escapism , " says Wang Chung-kwei , chairman of the Department of Psychology at Soochow University , who is a long-time student of generational differences in Taiwan . This is one reason why spiritual and religious topics have garnered so much attention in Taiwan in recent years .  
Asked what areas of personal concern they feel they most need to address , respondents answered , in order of priority : job skills or professional abilities and knowledge ( 30.1% ) ; personal economic or financial situation ( 21.5% ) ; foreign language ability ( 11.2% ) ; level of academic achievement ( 9.6% ) ; quality of life or place of residence ( 5.2% ) ; and religious or spiritual growth ( 2.6% ) .  
The erudite Buddhist master Yin-Shun , said to be " the most eminent Buddhist since Xuan Zang , " celebrated his 100th birthday in late April , on the 20th day of the third lunar month . A huge conference was held jointly by Buddhist religious and academic communities on both sides of the Taiwan Strait . It was a memorable event , as many Buddhist groups in Taiwan have been inspired by Yin-Shun 's teaching , and were in attendance to mark his birthday .  
Built to last " This project has struck a balance between using modern preservation techniques and traditional crafts . The utmost effort has been made to restore the original historical appearance of the site , and the careful attention to detail is highly significant in both religious and architectural terms . "  
He was born in 1968 in Shanhua Township , Tainan County . In middle school he began to attend the local Holy Church , where Rev . Wang Tung-ho filled him with inspiration and guided his religious development . In his 30s , Wang had given up a bright future in the city and moved to the countryside to minister to the ordinary folk of the township .  
The preparation , completion and implementation of the NPA often involves a broad selection of institutions , governmental and non-governmental , religious and secular , public and private , national , regional and local .  
We are determined to carry out democratic transformations in our country and to acknowledge and respect philosophical , religious , ideological and political choice as an inalienable right of the individual .  
Deeply concerned about the disturbing situation that has developed over a substantial part of the territory of the former USSR as a result of armed conflicts with national , religious and political causes ,  
Respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms can in no way be reconciled with biased criteria which divide countries into big and small , developed and underdeveloped , majority and minority groups , or along ethnic , racial and religious lines .  
The primary threat to humankind is now posed not by the possibility of the eruption of a nuclear conflict between the major Powers , but by regional crises of a national , ethnic or religious nature .  
It is true that some of them have been successfully resolved , but many others , of an ethnic , racial and religious nature , are arising in various parts of the world and are raging unabated , rendering the world situation fragile and precarious .  
The presence of foreign troops within the territories of sovereign States , in the name of protecting the social , cultural , ethnic , linguistic or religious rights of minorities , can not justify any effort to promote human rights .  
He also stresses that we wish to build a society in which people would enjoy a decent standard of living and their civil , political , social , economic , cultural and religious rights would be safeguarded .  
In some regions of Europe , Africa and Asia , religious , ethnic , tribal and border conflicts , often of tragic proportions , are still raging , thus making the international situation unstable and fragile .  
National divisions , interethnic hatred or religious diversity are encouraged and artificially provoked , and they are converted into major national and international policy issues in an attempt to disguise historically unfounded territorial claims .  
A Member of the United Nations family has fallen victim to a blatant and cruel war of conquest , accompanied by genocide , rape , religious " cleansing " and mass expulsions , the consequence of which is a horrible new kind of Serboapartheid .  
The traditional concept of security , focused primarily on the security of States and based mainly on military components , should be replaced by a broader concept that includes social , economic , environmental , cultural , religious and ethical aspects .  
Nongovernmental organizations are established through the voluntary association and decision of private individuals or groups for a variety of purposes , which may be political , humanitarian , religious , professional or simply associative .  
We pledge that human rights shall be promoted and protected with due regard for the varying historical , political , economic , social , religious and cultural realities of all peoples .  
Promoting the socioeconomic status of disadvantaged ethnic , cultural , occupational or religious groups is also difficult owing to a lack of effective and acceptable means of intervention .  
The Governments concerned should therefore set goals for the reversal of that tendency by educating the public to accept cultural , ethnic and religious diversity with a view to promoting communal harmony and understanding .  
However , most countries were composed of distinct ethnic , linguistic , religious and cultural minorities , and it was necessary to balance respect for the rights of minorities and preservation of national unity and territorial integrity .  
Organized crime , drug trafficking , ethnic and religious conflict , civil war , politically motivated killing and even genocide present fundamental threats to societies and the global social order .  
While no one disputed the universal nature of human rights , it was necessary to take account of the historical , cultural , religious and social situations of each country in order to ensure the effective implementation of such rights .  
The root causes of global conflicts had been aggravated by ethnic , religious and intercommunal divisions , which required a just and lasting radical solution in order to ensure that desperation and insecurity did not lead to insurmountable social crises .  
Hungary strongly condemned the violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Iraq , where the Government was implicated in summary executions , political killings , systematic torture and the repression of ethnic and religious minorities .  
Hungary remained extremely concerned about continuing human rights violations , including extrajudicial and summary executions , widespread detention , torture , forced labour and discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities .  
There is no doubt that humanitarian law has been violated and that cultural monuments have been destroyed by all three parties in the tragic civil , ethnic and religious war in the former Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
Urges the High Commissioner to undertake initiatives for refugee women in the areas of leadership and skills training , legal awareness and education , and in particular in the area of reproductive health , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of the refugees , in conformity with universally recognized international human rights and the UNHCR Guidelines on the Protection of Refugee Women ;  
Considers that an international tribunal with general jurisdiction should be established urgently to prosecute genocide , crimes against humanity , including murder , extermination , enslavement , deportation , imprisonment , torture , rape , persecutions on political , racial and religious grounds and other inhumane acts directed against any civilian population , and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the Additional Protocols of 1977 thereto ;  
But this sharing of experience and this programme of cooperation , as pointed out in the Managua Declaration and the Plan of Action , must transcend the sphere of conceptual criteria and value judgements on the democratic system and freedom , as opposed to totalitarian and authoritarian regimes , of the left or of the right , fundamentalist or religious , or merely the result of military or populist ambitions . 
At the end of the twentieth century and the dawn of a new millennium , in a world characterized by a globalization of the economy and the dynamics of international relations , our reality is conditioned by factors such as the substantial progress of science , the transcendence of the technological revolution , the decisive influence of communications and information , the expansion of trade and the consequences of cultural and religious interaction .  
The United Nations has the power to say no to those States and peoples who do not respect the religious , political , moral and artistic convictions of others ; no to those States and peoples who do not respect minorities , be they national or of any other kind , and their languages , which are an essential element of cultural transmission ; no , above all , when repression is accompanied by the use of force and by cruelty , torture and other unspeakable acts .  
Such developments have been accompanied by a natural yearning for the achievement of development in both its economic and social domains , while developments on the negative side have generated a wider cycle of racial , national and religious disputes in some regions of the world that have led to a noticeable retreat from respect for human rights and basic freedoms of the human individual , as well as regression of development both in the economic and social spheres .  
The entire civilized world , with great concern and indeed with growing alarm about what will happen to future generations , has been observing increasing incidents of international terrorism , religious fanaticism and ultra-nationalism .  
At the same time , though , there is a growing danger of armed conflicts breaking out because of continuing economic , political , territorial , ethnic , religious and other imbalances in relations between States .  
The affirmation of human dignity and the universal rights of the individual upheld by the Charter of the United Nations can be achieved only through respect for different ethnic , religious , cultural and political identities , through an efficient system of collective security , and through respect for a law-governed State and international law .  
International conflicts have been replaced by internal ones , characterized by political , economic , ethnic and religious tensions that often imply grave humanitarian crises and human rights violations .  
However , the threats of a world cataclysm have grown over decades of regional and local conflicts , stirred up by a wide range of motives involving geopolitical , economic and trading disputes as well as ethnic and religious conflicts .  
They point the way to mobilizing all the creativity and energy of youth to build a new community of nations based on mutual understanding , respect for cultural , religious and racial differences , equal rights for men and women , and social and economic well-being for all .  
The Programme focuses on providing new opportunities for young people , integrating youth-related concerns and national development policies and plans , protecting young people from harmful drugs and addictive substances , fostering racial and religious tolerance , mutual respect and understanding among young people and , most important of all , dealing with the question of employment opportunities for young people .  
We recognize the values and the capital that adults have left to us , and we are proud that they have forged a social existence which allows no room for intolerance based on racial , religious or cultural considerations .  
Such a fact underscores the need to respect and to take into consideration the historic religious and cultural characteristics of the peoples of every region when drafting any international document , so that the door may not be left ajar for the introduction of controversial issues after international compromises had been reached on such issues in previous conferences .  
The delegation of Egypt would like to avail itself of this opportunity to stress that whatever the linguistic formulas may be , its concept of the operative content of the paragraphs relating to reproductive and sexual health , especially paragraphs 56 , 57 and 58 , is that their implementation will take place in accordance with the legal system and the cultural and religious heritage of each society .  
None the less , reality has shown that these aspirations have not been met and that , on the contrary , changes in the international system created conditions that have unleashed forces that had long been held in check , giving rise to new conflicts and rivalries , not only as a result of resurgent nationalism but also as a cause of serious ethnic , religious , social and cultural differences which have jeopardized peace and international security . 
The main topics were intolerance in all its aspects , such as racism , xenophobia , anti-semitism , religious fundamentalism and aggressive nationalism ; the role of civic society ; the impact of public opinion ; the importance of early warning ; and actions at the national and international levels .  
At the social level it is indisputable that intolerance of racial , religious , ethnic , language and gender differences is exploited by groups which seek to attain or maintain economic and political power over others .  
No sooner had bloc confrontation and tension decreased than the international community started to face a dramatic increase of tension and conflict based on ethnic , racial , religious or national prejudice - tension which thrived on rekindling or reviving animosities that had been extinguished or dormant for many , many years . 
Since prejudice denotes an irrational , unfavourable or hostile attitude towards members of other racial , religious or ethnic groups , we must , if we truly desire its defeat , engage ourselves in promoting , enhancing and defending the universal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
While tensions that have arisen in historic moments , happily behind us , have given us a world more free and open to achieving the ultimate objectives of the Charter to practice tolerance and peaceful coexistence , maintain international peace and security and save succeeding generations from the scourge of war today 's peace is still a peace of little wars , local and regional conflicts fanned by drastic differences of an ethnic , economic or religious nature .  
Emphasizing the importance of the integration of documented migrants into the host society , with due respect for their religious and cultural background , and the need to extend to them the same social , economic and legal rights as are enjoyed by citizens , in accordance with national legislation and universally recognized human rights ,  
Recognizing that the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development [ 4 ] / is the sovereign right of every country , in accordance with its national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its peoples and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights ,  
Conditions must be created for the holding of free , fair and direct elections , in accordance with the highest democratic standards and respect for the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and for the rights of all ethnic and religious groups .  
The United States urged China to take further steps to improve the human rights situation in its territory by observing international norms , preserving Tibet 's unique cultural , linguistic and religious heritage and releasing persons jailed solely for expressing political beliefs .  
Such violations and obstacles include , as well as torture and cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment , summary and arbitrary executions , disappearances , arbitrary detentions , all forms of racism , racial discrimination and apartheid , foreign occupation and alien domination , xenophobia , poverty , hunger and other denials of economic , social and cultural rights , religious intolerance , terrorism , discrimination against women and lack of the rule of law .  
Her Office 's assessment of the situation was that it was easier to work to have rape classified as a public crime than to try to reverse the burden of proof requirement , which involved going against the entrenched judicial , religious , social and cultural prejudices which came into play whenever such a debate arose in Bolivia .  
Among these are chronic hunger , malnutrition , illicit drug problems , organized crime , corruption , foreign occupation , armed conflicts , illicit arms trafficking , terrorism , intolerance and incitement to racial , ethnic , religious and other hatreds , xenophobia , and endemic , communicable and chronic diseases .  
We , Heads of State and Government , are committed to a political , economic , ethical and spiritual vision for social development based on human dignity , human rights , equality , respect , peace , democracy , mutual responsibility and cooperation , and full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of people .  
On the basis of our common pursuit of social development , which aims at social justice , solidarity , harmony and equality within and among countries , in full respect for national sovereignty [ and territorial integrity ] , as well as policy objectives , development priorities and religious and cultural diversity , and full respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , we launch a global drive for social progress and development embodied in the following commitments :  
Recognize and respect cultural , ethnic and religious diversity , and promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities ; and take measures to facilitate their full participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and social development in their country ;  
The implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action is the sovereign right of each country , consistent with national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its people , and in conformity with all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Such an inclusive society must be based upon respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , cultural and religious diversity , social justice and special needs of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , democratic participation and the rule of law .  
Organized crime , illegal drugs , illicit arms trade , trafficking in women and children , ethnic and religious conflict , civil war , terrorism , and all forms of extremist violence , xenophobia , politically motivated killing and even genocide present fundamental threats to societies and the global social order .  
Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
Persons of all categories and walks of life and all ages - peasant farmers executives and militant members of political parties , government agents , medical and paramedical personnel , and lay and religious persons - were killed in atrocious ways in the bloodthirsty madness which caused the people of Burundi enormous suffering and which can not in any way be justified . 
Recognizing also that there is no single political system or single model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples , and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to increase their involvement in formal and non-formal education in human rights and to cooperate with the Centre for Human Rights in implementing the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education ;  
Expresses its grave concern at attacks upon religious places , sites and shrines , and calls upon all States , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to exert utmost efforts to ensure that such places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected ;  
Also requests the Special Rapporteur to continue , in his next report , to pay special attention to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions of children and women and to allegations concerning violations of the right to life in the context of violence against participants in demonstrations and other peaceful public manifestations or against persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities ;  
Affirming that effective measures and the creation of favourable conditions for the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , ensuring effective non-discrimination and equality for all , contribute to the prevention and peaceful solution of human rights problems and situations involving minorities ,  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole of the States in which such persons live ,  
Gravely concerned also at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , in particular summary and arbitrary executions , torture , forced labour and forced relocations , abuse of women , politically motivated arrests and detentions , restrictions on fundamental freedoms , including the freedom of expression and assembly , and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
In many countries , the values of society are still strongly influenced by customary or religious practices and regulations that are sometimes in direct conflict with international human rights standards , as well as with national statutory laws where civil law differs from the customary or religious practices .  
The reasons for this vary and include a lack of political commitment ; an unresponsive legal system ; attitudinal obstacles to the incorporation of international standards when these are believed to be in conflict with religious , cultural or customary practices ; the absence of effective domestic groups that can lobby for change effectively and without fear of intimidation ; and an absence of effective enforcement mechanisms even where legislation exists .  
Preparation of the entire population for the later stages of life should be an integral part of social policies and encompass physical , psychological , cultural , religious , spiritual , economic , health and other factors " ( International Plan of Action on Ageing , para . 25 ( i ) ) .  
A society for all is seen as an inclusive society which must be based upon respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , cultural and religious diversity , social justice , democratic participation and the rule of law .  
Among these are chronic hunger , malnutrition , illicit drug problems , organized crime , corruption , foreign occupation , armed conflicts , illicit arms trafficking , terrorism , intolerance and incitement to racial , ethnic , religious and other hatred , xenophobia , and endemic , communicable and chronic diseases .  
In particular , the United States indicated that it understands that the term " intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnic , racial or religious group as such " , as used in the Convention , means the " specific intent to destroy , in whole or substantial part , a national , ethnic , racial or religious group as such " by the acts prohibited in the Convention .  
The Bulgarian Government proposes that in article 21 the expression " persecution on social , political , racial , religious or cultural grounds " be supplemented by the expression " including inhuman and degrading treatment based on such grounds " .  
To this end , Governments , the international community and civil society , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , are called upon to take strategic action in the following critical areas of concern [ with full respect for religious and ethical values , cultural backgrounds and philosophical convictions in conformity with all human rights and fundamental freedoms ] : [ - The persistent and increasing burden of poverty on women ;  
Both the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Bosnian Serb authorities must exercise the maximum restraint and must realize once and for all that there can be no military solution to the conflict , only a comprehensive political solution such as will restore the peaceful coexistence of the various ethnic , cultural and religious components that have lived together in Bosnia and Herzegovina for centuries .  
Systematic violation of human rights and freedoms : mass arrests , abductions and murders , pent-up political trials , forcible mobilizations , evictions and ethnic cleansing , plunder , disrespect of religious freedoms , not acknowledging of national and religious institutions of the Bosniac-Moslems .  
The symposium , held in April and attended by more than 300 scholars , diplomats , NGO representatives , religious leaders , and journalists , addressed issues of peace and security , development , environment , and shared universal human values and norms that go beyond the concept of international cooperation in the " global neighbourhood " .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
Those who not only advocate but brutally carry out the policy of ethnic cleansing , national and religious superiority and the physical elimination of a people combined with the destruction of the traces of their centuries-old existence and the expropriation of their land and all other belongings , must not be treated in the same way as those who fight for religious equality , tolerance , coexistence , human rights and freedom .  
These include the acute crisis in the Balkans , the smouldering Cypriot problem , unresolved differences between Turkey and Greece , the periodic flare-up of tension in the Middle East , the uncertain situation regarding the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , illegal migration , the growth of religious violence , which feeds on the alarming disparities between rich and poor in individual countries , and on lagging economic development in various States .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Ensure that the rights of national minorities are protected , and that such groups are able to pursue economic and social development and live in circumstances of full respect for their identity , traditions , forms of social organization and cultural and religious values .  17 .  The Charter of the United Nations has provided a durable framework for the promotion and development of international law .  
The mandate included the following : all violations of human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , and in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ; all forms of sexual harassment , exploitation and trafficking in women ; the elimination of gender bias in the administration of justice ; and the eradication of harmful effects of certain traditional or customary practices , cultural prejudice and religious extremism . 
" [ All forms of gender-based violence , including those resulting from all forms of sexual harassment , prostitution , pornography , sexual slavery and exploitation , including those violations resulting from cultural prejudice , racism and racial discrimination , xenophobia , ethnic cleansing , religious and anti-religious extremism and international trafficking in women and children , are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person and must be eliminated . ] "  Fifth sentence .  
At the same time , national legislation must be very harsh on State services such as intelligence or security services , or authorities with repressive proclivities , or private totalitarian-minded associations which , resorting to markets where mercenaries are available , recruit individuals for the purpose of establishing praetorian guards , death squads or operational groups devoted to political repression or to the assassination of political , religious or other adversaries .

The active support and participation of a broad and diverse range of other institutional actors should be encouraged , including legislative bodies , academic and research institutions , professional associations , trade unions , cooperatives , local community groups , non-governmental organizations , including women 's organizations and feminist groups , the media , religious groups , youth organizations and cultural groups , as well as financial and non-profit organizations .  
To this end , Governments , the international community and civil society , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , are called upon to take strategic action in the following critical areas of concern [ with full respect for religious and ethical values , cultural backgrounds and philosophical convictions and in conformity with all human rights and fundamental freedoms ] :  
Such violations and obstacles include , as well as torture and cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment or summary and arbitrary detention , all forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia , denial of economic , social and cultural rights and religious intolerance .  
The Government of Iraq stresses that the coercive economic measures taken by some developed countries against developing countries constitute a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations , the principles of international law , the principles of human rights and the divine prescriptions of religious law .  
The only way to make progress in promoting religious freedom is to avoid categorical , inflexible attitudes , impulsive and ineffectual initiatives , ill-considered behaviours , blind obstinacy , gratuitous accusations , inconsistent judgements and grandiose but futile gestures .  
The origin of social exclusion is often to be found in racism and racial discrimination , phenomena which many Governments believe should be written off as things of the past , denying their persistence or describing as " natural " the economic and social conditions of ethnic , racial and religious minorities and indigenous populations .  
The origin of social exclusion is often to be found in racism and racial discrimination , phenomena which many Governments believe should be written off as things of the past , denying their persistence or describing as " natural " the economic and social conditions of ethnic , racial and religious minorities and indigenous populations .  
We must assume the historic commitment to accept the challenge and to devote ourselves with enthusiasm to the shaping of a new world , which will do away with political , religious and racial intolerance , which will eliminate inequality and social backwardness , which will establish human fraternity and solidarity , a new world in which the beacon of freedom and democracy will light its path . 
NULLThe Governments of Cyprus , the Czech Republic , Dominica , Mauritius , Morocco , the Russian Federation and Ukraine recognized the existence of national , ethnic , religious and linguistic minority groups on their respective territories , and mentioned the relevant constitutional and legislative provisions protecting them .  
In addition , the Commission decided to authorize the request of the Subcommission , contained in resolution 1994 / 4 , to establish , initially for a three-year period , an intersessional working group consisting of five of its members to meet each year for five working days in order to promote the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , and in particular to :  
In this multidimensional context , the question of the protection and promotion of the human rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities is of overriding importance for the respect of human rights generally and central to the promotion of understanding , tolerance and solidarity between and among communities and Governments .  
The Centre for Human Rights , in close cooperation with other bodies and organs of the United Nations , is available for developing activities aimed at facilitating the full participation of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of their societies and in the economic progress and development of their countries .  
NULLIn a number of cases , special rapporteurs appointed by United Nations human rights organs to investigate human rights situations in specific regions and countries and on thematic issues have addressed the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities within their mandates or have been confronted with violations of the rights of persons belonging to minorities .  
NULLThe Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , Mr . Bacre Waly Ndiaye , in his report ( E / CN . 4 / 1995 / 61 ) mentioned that in a number of cases that had come before him in 1994 , it was alleged that the victims subjected to death threats or extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions belonged to national , ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities .  
The study enjoys the guidance and advice of a group of eminent persons made up of individuals of international repute and integrity drawn from every geographic region and representing a wide diversity of political , religious and cultural backgrounds ; this group also acts as a public advocate .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of racial violence , continue to persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
NULLWhile the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the universal nature of which is beyond question .  
Ensure that the rights of persons belonging to national , ethnic and other minorities are protected , and that such persons are able to pursue economic and social development and live in circumstances of full respect for their identity , traditions , forms of social organization and cultural and religious values .  
By confiscating the property of expelled Serbs in Krajina , the Government of the Republic of Croatia has violated the universal and sacred right of the inviolability of private property .  Considering that it has carried out this act guided exclusively by national criteria , this represents a glaring example of national , racial and religious discrimination and hatred .  
The effective elimination of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia , " ethnic cleansing " and religious and other forms of intolerance requires concerted efforts by the entire international community : Governments , United Nations programmes and agencies , and regional and non-governmental organizations .  
Unsolved problems relating to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities are widely recognized as a major source of international and internal conflicts involving widespread human rights violations .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of racial violence , continue to persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,

pointed out that the resolution mentioned above had been adopted on an initiative of the Sudan , motivated by its concern for the situation of more than 20,000 children who had been sequestered by the insurgent movement in the south of the country , which used them as explosives carriers , human shields in minefields and as a military reserve , a situation which was intolerable since it violated religious and humane principles .

Expresses its grave concern at any attack upon religious places , sites and shrines , and calls upon all States , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to exert utmost efforts to ensure that such places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected ;  
Strongly urges the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) to take appropriate measures to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms and to take urgent action to ensure the rule of law in order to prevent arbitrary evictions and dismissals and discrimination against any ethnic or national , religious and linguistic group , including in the fields of education and information ;  
gravely concerned , however , at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including killings of civilians , arbitrary arrest and detention , restrictions on freedoms of expression and association , torture , forced labour , forced portering , human rights abuses in border areas in the course of military operations , forced relocations and development projects , abuse of women and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
with deep concern reports of grave human rights violations in the Sudan , particularly summary executions , detentions without trial and forced displacement of persons and torture , as described in reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , and the Special Rapporteur on the question of religious intolerance ,  
the past year , there had been increasing reports of slavery and forced labour of women and children belonging to racial , ethnic and religious minorities ; of atrocities against indigenous peoples ; of indiscriminate aerial bombardments against civilian targets , and of unaccompanied minors being conscripted into military service .  
Government looked to the Chinese Government to take specific steps to conform to international human rights norms , including releasing persons detained solely for the peaceful expression of their opinions and preserving the unique cultural , linguistic and religious heritage of Tibet .  
Despite the end of the cold war , regional , religious and ethnic disputes are being further aggravated in various parts of our planet , and consequently world peace and security are gravely disturbed and peoples are suffering from untold misfortunes resulting from them .  
Any government , institution or individual seeking to promote human rights should bear in mind the significance of national and regional peculiarities as well as historical , cultural and religious backgrounds and the stage of economic development .  
National chauvinism ; ethnic intolerance ; racial , economic and religious discrimination ; ethnic cleansing ; and acts of violence and repression against an entire population characteristic features of Serb policy were demonstrated for the first time in Kosovo .  
In this setting of globalization and interdependence , the United Nations with its universal composition , its agglutinative structure that brings together countries at the most varied levels of human development and ethnic or religious composition , its institutional capacity to act as a point of articulation or a sounding board for all concerns or aspirations that extend beyond the local , national or regional level would be in an ideal position to play a leading and decisive role .  
Even though misunderstandings and aggressions appear on one continent or another , based on deep-seated racial , religious or political hatred , and leading to genocide or local wars , we can not speak of a conflagration , especially when the will of the people of all regions rises above these wars , committed to the restoration of peace .  
Latin America , born unaware of racial hatred , religious conflicts and territorial greed , with an indivisible spirit made up of a combination of influences that move in the same direction on the freest and broadest of stages , is hurt by the fact that its real problems today are social ones , brought on by the error of political regimes that ignored the discipline of education or doubted its undeniable primacy . 
Society must be firmly rooted in the rule of law , democratic participation , gender equality , the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by all , social justice , tolerance , respect for ethnic , religious and cultural diversity , and meeting the requirements of groups with specific needs , such as young and older people , as well as people with disabilities .  
It is therefore with great apprehension that we note a proliferation of regional conflicts , social and economic collapse in some of our countries , environmental decay , and the coming of new scourges such as transnational crime , drug trafficking , a rising wave of criminality , racial disturbances , xenophobia , and religious and cultural intolerance . 
We need to close ranks to meet the major challenges that can face democracy , such as poverty and all it entails , the spectre of ethnic conflict , illicit drug trafficking , international terrorism , religious fanaticism , the spread of the AIDS pandemic , the ravages of malaria , and so forth .  
Thus the Government of Jordan , in order to maintain the Holy City 's special religious , cultural and historic character , has taken a strong interest in continuing its custodianship of the holy places so as to protect them from all dangers until the desired final status is achieved .  
Any new concept needs to be accompanied by an information , education and communication ( IEC ) strategy to make people aware of its content and implications - all the more so if this new concept involves , as does the concept of reproductive rights and reproductive health , many aspects , ranging from sociocultural factors - cultural beliefs and practices , status of women , overall health and well-being , religious convictions and ethical values - to economic conditions .  
For the concepts of reproductive rights and reproductive health to be implemented at the local level , they need be integrated into existing social , political and religious structures and thus become part of the complex fabric of society .  
The proper way to respond to attitudes of reservation regarding religious freedom was through patient and resolute dialogue , based on facts and the participation of all parties concerned , operating in the framework of internationally established norms and seeking to determine possible action and to plan for the longer term .  
The training programme for trainers in civic and human rights education begun by MICIVIH would be expanded substantially to involve non-governmental organizations working in adult education , elected government officials at all levels , popular and peasant organizations , women 's associations , religious institutions and the formal education sector .  
If all those conditions , which were currently unacceptable and flouted the dignity of the human being , were to be eradicated , it was essential to create a framework for social development founded on a spirit of cooperation and participation which would take into account the cultural , historical , religious and economic characteristics and the priorities for social development of each country . 
The representative of Norway had said that one of the most difficult challenges facing the international community was the question of ensuring respect for the rights of persons belonging to ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities , while guaranteeing the territorial integrity and political independence of States .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of racial violence , persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Aware of the importance of a human rights culture and of the need to strengthen the democratic process , her Government had implemented a series of legislative , administrative and educational measures recommended by the advisory committee on human rights , a national body established in 1990 , which was composed of representatives of the entire political , social and religious spectrum of Moroccan society .  
The draft resolution failed to take account of the fact that no single political system or electoral process was suited to all nations and peoples and that political systems were subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors .  
Resolutions of those organs have drawn the attention of Governments , the United Nations system and the general public to those problems and have called for action with regard to extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , impunity , racism and xenophobia , discrimination against women , ethnic and religious intolerance , mass exoduses and refugee flows , armed conflicts and terrorism , and lack of the rule of law as major obstacles to human rights .  
The effective elimination of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia , " ethnic cleansing " and religious and other forms of intolerance requires concerted efforts by the entire international community : Governments , United Nations programmes and agencies , and regional and non-governmental organizations .  
Unsolved problems relating to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities are widely recognized as a major source of international and internal conflicts involving widespread human rights violations .  
In the light of the definition contained in article 1 , the United Kingdom 's ratification is subject to the understanding that none of its obligations under the Convention shall be treated as extending to the succession to , or possession and enjoyment of , the Throne , the peerage , titles of honour , social precedence or armorial bearings , or as extending to the affairs of religious denominations or orders or to the admission into or service in the Armed Forces of the Crown .  
[ Civil , ethnic and religious strife , nuclear armament , armed conflicts , alien and colonial domination , foreign occupation , international economic imbalance , coercive economic measures , poverty , organized crime , and terrorism in all its forms are destructive to sustainable human settlements development and should therefore be renounced by all States . ]  
In addition , such human settlements provide equal opportunity for a productive and freely chosen livelihood ; equal access to economic resources , including the right to inheritance , the ownership of land and other property , credit , natural resources and appropriate technologies ; for personal , spiritual , religious , cultural and social development ; for participation in public decision-making ; for equal rights and obligations with regard to the conservation and use of natural and cultural resources ; and equal access to mechanisms to ensure that rights are not violated .  
Objectives of this endeavour include protecting public health , providing for safety and security conditions , education , and social integration , promoting equality , respect for diversity and cultural identities , increased accessibility for persons with disabilities , and preservation of historic , spiritual , religious and culturally significant buildings and districts , respecting local landscapes and treating the local environment with respect and care .  
The sustainability of the global environment and human life will not be achieved unless , among other things , human settlements in both urban and rural areas are made economically buoyant , socially vibrant and environmentally sound , with full respect for cultural , religious and natural heritage and diversity .  
Recognizing that the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action is the sovereign right of every country , in accordance with its national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its peoples and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights ,  
Recognizing also that there is no single political system or single universal model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples , and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development and the environment , as well as other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to increase their involvement in formal and non-formal education in human rights and to cooperate with the High Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
Affirming that effective measures and the creation of favourable conditions for the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , ensuring effective non-discrimination and equality for all , contribute to the prevention and peaceful solution of human rights problems and situations involving minorities ,  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole of the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , including through the facilitation of their full participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development in their country ;  
Deeply concerned that , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , the rights violated on religious grounds include the right to life , the right to physical integrity and to liberty and security of person , the right to freedom of expression , the right not to be subjected to torture or other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , and the right not to be arbitrarily arrested or detained ,  
Expresses its grave concern at any attack upon religious places , sites and shrines , and calls upon all States , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to exert utmost efforts to ensure that such places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected ;  
Strongly urges the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) to take appropriate measures to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms and to take urgent action to ensure the rule of law in order to prevent arbitrary evictions and dismissals and discrimination against any ethnic or national , religious and linguistic group , including in the fields of education and information ;  
Also gravely concerned , however , at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including killings of civilians , arbitrary arrest and detention , restrictions on freedom of expression and association , torture , forced labour , forced portering , human rights abuses in border areas in the course of military operations , forced relocations and development projects , abuse of women and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Noting with deep concern reports of grave human rights violations in the Sudan , particularly summary executions , detentions without trial , forced displacement of persons and torture , as described in reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on the question of religious intolerance ,  
There were also concerns , however , that the new technologies would lead to growing social and economic gaps and injustice , and would threaten cultural diversity , religious values and even individual freedom ; there was therefore a need to study ways to make the new technologies widely accessible and supportive of sustainable development .  
Full account had to be taken of economic conditions ; social , ethnic , cultural , religious or legal situations ; conjugal circumstances ; the nature and type of relations characterized by violence ; and conditions of political persecution , social oppression , racial discrimination and unequal economic development , as well as violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
Perceived potential costs of illicit drug use include the possible health effects of acute or chronic toxicity ; the risk of arrest and punishment ; the effect on academic or career performance ; the danger , if caught , of being expelled from school or losing a job ; the risk of resultant stigma attached to the label of illicit drug user ; and individual feelings of guilt about defying parents , the law or a religious code .  
In the face of these serious challenges to the peace process , we call upon the Security Council to take effective and practical measures that would ensure the realization of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people ; the cessation of the policy of aggression , settlement and Judaization of Jerusalem ; the preservation of its cultural , religious and material heritage , and demographic composition ; and the lifting of the siege against the Palestinian villages and cities .  
The two sides are in favour of the continued promotion of friendly exchanges among the people of various countries so as to enhance mutual understanding and confidence , and are against stirring up national , ethnic and religious conflicts .  
The Acting Director commented that translating complex concepts which were condensed in one word , as in the case of " gender " or " empowerment " , required adequate understanding of the cultural , economic , religious , social and political circumstances of different countries . 
We declare that we shall support any steps undertaken by leaders at all levels , politicians , and representatives of parties , movements and diverse religious denominations with a view to strengthening international accord and peace in the Caucasus by increasing cultural , scientific , humanitarian and other contacts and promoting the ideas of democracy and social progress .  
With regard to the religious and ethnic violence prompted by the failure of the Indonesian Government to resolve the social , political and economic issues that lay at the heart of the human rights problems , three major riots had taken place in 1995 .  The first and last had been sparked by deliberate acts of incitement against Catholicism , the dominant religion in East Timor .  
Ethnic and religious tensions between Timorese and Indonesians had increased ; mass immigration of Indonesians into the territory of East Timor was continuing ; cases of torture , arbitrary detention , attacks , summary executions , disappearances and killings were becoming increasingly common ; the numbers and violence of the military and police forces were increasing , and many Timorese , especially young people , had become strangers in their own land and had been forced to seek asylum . 
The third conclusion was that the underlying causes of the eruption of violent incidents and episodes had not been removed : political rights and fundamental freedoms continued to be suppressed and religious tensions and the immigration of Indonesians into the Territory were putting in jeopardy the cultural , religious and social identity of East Timor .  
The Islamic State of Afghanistan has expressed many times through official notes , declarations and in the course of official contacts its sincere desire to broaden its ties of friendship based on religious , linguistic , historical , cultural and good-neighbourly relations between our two brotherly countries .  
This reflects varying economic , environmental , social , cultural and religious values and needs , which operate within legal and policy frameworks usually specific to individual countries .  
This includes the right to maintain , protect and develop the past , present and future manifestations of their cultures , such as archaeological and historical sites , artifacts , designs , ceremonies , technologies and visual and performing arts and literature , as well as the right to the restitution of cultural , intellectual , religious and spiritual property taken without their free and informed consent or in violation of their traditions and customs , as well as the law of the State concerned .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the universal nature of which is beyond question .  
Massive or persistent violations of human rights , often the result of ethnic , racial or religious tensions or unequal access to power and basic necessities of life will continue to endanger international peace and security and to hamper economic and social development .  
Second , it accepted the principle that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes were in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that might be invoked to justify them . 
Communal violence , understood as acts of violence committed by one ethnic , religious , linguistic , national or social group against another group , was reported in Bangladesh , Burundi , Cameroon , Chad , Djibouti , Mali , Nigeria and Somalia . Government forces are often said to support one side in the conflict or even instigate hostilities , rather than intervene to stop violence between different groups .  
One of the most prevalent targets of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions continues to be persons involved in struggles , such as those to secure rights to land or to prevent or combat racial , ethnic or religious discrimination and ensure respect for social , cultural , economic , civil and political rights . 
Violations of human rights remain extremely serious , including , in particular , the practice of torture , summary and arbitrary executions , forced labour , including forced portering for the military , abuse of women , politically motivated arrests and detention , forced displacement , serious restrictions on the freedoms of expression and association , and the imposition of oppressive measures directed , in particular , at ethnic and religious minority groups ;  
The latter convention calls for the immediate and complete abolition of forced labour in the following five forms : as a measure of coercion or political education ; as a measure of mobilization for purposes of economic development ; as a sanction for having participated in strikes ; and as a measure of racial , social , national or religious discrimination .  
In accordance with article 1 of the Code , these include industrial , trade and agricultural establishments and their dependencies , of whatever nature , whether public or private , religious or secular , even if they are of a professional or charitable nature ; liberal professions , craft establishments , cooperatives , civil law partnerships , unions , associations and groupings of any kind .  
While the State bears the cost of wages and supplementary social charges for no fewer than 14 days when work is suspended ( decree No . 1447 of 31 December 1987 ) , to enable public officials to celebrate a variety of religious , political and social holidays , private enterprises would find it difficult to support such charges , which place a substantial burden on production costs .  
This means that the State , the guardian of children 's right to education , must establish the necessary legal structures and instruments to ensure the comprehensive realization of the objectives and principles assigned to education and provide effective guarantees of the protection of children against the various covert or open practices by which some people uncover in children extremely fertile ground for ideological or religious indoctrination . 
A renewed commitment by all involved in organized society , political parties , religious groups , communal groups , law enforcement agencies , to eschew resort to criminal violence in pursuit of their objectives needs to be declared and implemented .  
The Government of Mauritius stated that the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities were guaranteed through a combination of constitutional provisions , which were fully compatible with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , statutory legislation and common law .  
It was emphasized that the establishment and maintenance of unimpeded contacts among persons belonging to a national minority , as well as contacts across frontiers by persons belonging to a national minority with persons with whom they share a common ethnic or national origin , cultural heritage or religious belief , contributes to mutual understanding and promotes good neighbourly relations .  
The Armed Forces High Command was urged to take concrete measures aimed at protecting and promoting the rights of persons belonging to minorities by eliminating discrimination against the members of minority groups and taking positive administrative steps to ensure that the armed forces were genuinely representative of the national community in their ethnic , linguistic , religious , regional and national composition .  
Those included activities using the education for development approach in the areas of advocacy and training ; research studies by the International Child Development Centre in Florence , Italy ; workshops that addressed issues of religious , ethnic and cultural discrimination ; and dissemination of the Convention on the Rights of the Child to the public in numerous local languages .  
In a number of cases , Special Rapporteurs , appointed by United Nations human rights organs to investigate human rights situations in specific regions and countries , and on thematic issues , have addressed the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities within their mandates or have been confronted with violations of the rights of persons belonging to minorities .  
He stated that none of the criteria used to define ethnic groups or national minorities were applicable to Burundi , since for centuries Hutus and Tutsis had occupied the same geographical area , shared the same religious beliefs and spoken the same language .  
On the matter of internal deportations and forced relocations , the Special Rapporteur concluded that government policies violated the freedoms of movement and residence and , in some cases , constitute discriminatory practices based on ethnic or religious affiliations .  
The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , Mr . Bacre Waly Ndiaye , in his report ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 4 ) referred to a number of cases that had come before him in 1995 , in which it was alleged that the victims subjected to death threats or extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions belonged to national , ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities .  
The Greek Ministry of Justice reported that the Greek Constitution and legislation fully safeguard both equality in the enjoyment of fundamental individual and social rights and freedoms for all citizens irrespective of race , colour , religion and ethnic or national origin ( art . 5 ) , and freedom of religious conscience .  
A penal component , prohibiting any racial , ethnic or religious discrimination against an individual or community and strengthening the penalties to be handed down on conviction for racist offences by adding deprivation of civil rights for 5 to 10 years ;  
Since many questions and misunderstandings surround the definitions and content of the terminologies of sects , new religious movements and even formal religion and since in international practice confusion reigns and States may have diametrically opposed attitudes to the same group , raising it to formal religious status or pejoratively classifying it as a sect , the Special Rapporteur feels that an international high-level governmental conference should be held to study and decide upon a common approach to sects and religions that respects human rights . 
On a different level , it is of fundamental importance that places of worship should be reserved for religious , non-political uses , that the legal system governing political parties should be defined in such a way as to avoid political variables impinging on religious constants , and that schools should be protected from all ideological , political or partisan indoctrination .  
The outcome of the Fourth World Conference on Women had met the desire of the international community for a comprehensive programme of collective international action to change the prevailing situation of women in many parts of the world while taking account of the religious concepts and principles and the spiritual values that played a major role in the lives of peoples and in ensuring their stability .  
Mr . BAALI ( Algeria ) said that the origin of the dramatic events currently taking place in the world lay , even more than in colonialism and the disintegration of communism , in the resurgence of violence provoked by the exacerbation of nationalistic , ethnic , religious and tribal sentiments and fed by foreign intervention . 
Any church or place for religious assembly built and operated without authorization is liable to be closed and put under seal and those responsible for the " illegal " installation may be prosecuted , imprisoned and required to pay a substantial fine .  
According to the governmental delegates , the State and its legislation , while recognizing the dominant , but not overwhelming , role of the Orthodox Church , which represents the religion of the majority of the population for historical , national and traditional reasons , are said to provide a climate of religious freedom , notwithstanding isolated cases of intolerance or discrimination , in particular in the administration .  
This singling out of the Jehovah 's Witnesses is almost certainly due to their religious militancy , which is expressed through proselytism , conscientious objection to military service and a variety of public demonstrations which call into question the interests of the dominant Church and the legislative and political system of the State .  
Overall , the Special Rapporteur urges all parties concerned , official and otherwise , national and foreign , to calm rather than exacerbate religious problems , thereby ensuring that religion is not subject to political intrusion and exploitation and that constants are not affected by political variables .  
While underlining that the law was applied without religious discrimination and with respect for the rights of non-Muslims , Mr . Turabi explained that consumption of alcohol was not a crime in the southern states , while in the north it was authorized for non-Muslims in private and forbidden in public .  
According to unofficial reports , non-Muslims outside the southern states have been found guilty of and punished for religious offences based on Islam ( hudud ) , especially for failing to observe the Islamic dress code and the prohibition of the sale or consumption of alcohol .  
According to numerous non-governmental observers , the authorities had usurped the religious sphere , claiming that they alone were in possession of divine truth , and had perverted religion by politically exploiting Islam in order to secure their grip on power and enforce their authority through religious and political persecution and totalitarian methods , in complete contrast to the historically tolerant Muslim heritage of the Sudan .  
The attacks are alleged to result from the central Government 's official policy imposing " its truth regarding Islam on an erroneous local version of Islam " and therefore to have religious legitimacy , as demonstrated by , inter alia , the fatwa of April 1992 ( see para .  122 ) .  
On the subject of protection of the individual , the Special Rapporteur earnestly hopes that restrictions on the freedom of movement of religious officials will be lifted and that the campaigns of harassment and intimidation directed against them , which are also prejudicial to their followers , will cease , thus enabling the Muslim brotherhoods to realize their full potential without fear , constraint or self-censorship , subject , of course , to respect for public order and the law and the avoidance of violence , extremism and obscurantism .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , continue to persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
The Contracting States shall ensure that their national laws recognize that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are under any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them .  
Resurgent nationalism and the rejection of religious , cultural , ethnic and ideological diversity were being expressed in ethnic conflict , growing violence and the proliferation of racist and xenophobic practices in various parts of the world .  
He was satisfied with the definition of crimes against humanity , which was based on the notion that there was no nexus between that category of crimes and a state of war , and was especially pleased that institutionalized discrimination on racial , ethnic or religious grounds was included in that category . 
Please provide information on the measures adopted , including at the legislative , administrative , educational , budgetary and social levels , to ensure that a child belonging to an ethnic , religious or linguistic minority or who is indigenous is not denied the right , in community with other members of his or her group :  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
Expresses its grave concern at any attack upon religious places , sites and shrines , and calls upon all States , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to exert utmost efforts to ensure that such places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected ;  
The rich diversity of nations ' historical , cultural , religious , social and economic backgrounds must be respected and their different priorities recognized .  
Noting with deep concern reports of grave human rights violations in the Sudan , in particular summary executions , detentions without trial , forced displacement of persons and torture , as described in reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , and the Special Rapporteur on the question of religious intolerance ,  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education ;  
The main principles of his Government 's policy in that area were to ensure equality of constitutional rights and freedoms to all citizens , to strengthen legal safeguards against discrimination , extremism and intolerance , to promote mutual trust among ethnic groups and respect for their language and cultures , and to create conditions that would enable all citizens to express their ethnic , cultural and religious identities freely . 
The overwhelming peaceful demands of the Kashmiris for self-determination in the disputed territory , which had never been a part of India , were not a matter of religious extremism , terrorism or secession , as India maintained , but could be satisfied only by the holding of the plebiscite advocated by the international community , for which the universally denounced sham elections recently held by India were no substitute .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;

Noting with deep concern reports of grave human rights violations in the Sudan , in particular summary executions , detentions without trial , forced displacement of persons and torture , as described in reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , and the Special Rapporteur on the question of religious intolerance ,  
Gravely concerned at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , killings of civilians , torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , deaths in custody , absence of due process of law , severe restrictions on freedoms of opinion , expression , assembly and association , violations of freedom of movement , forced relocation , forced labour and portering and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Calls upon the Government of Myanmar and other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully the obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , [ 117 ] to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population and to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law , and to avail itself of such services as may be offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;

Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
The main victims of this trend are racial , ethnic , national , linguistic and religious minorities , migrant workers , foreigners and indigenous populations .  
These should fully recognize the ecological , social , cultural and [ religious ] [ spiritual ] values of forests [ and pay particular attention to global dimensions of climate change and the sustainable use , conservation and equitable sharing of the benefits of biological diversity . ]  
The General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights both called upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to increase their involvement in formal and non-formal education in human rights and to cooperate with the Centre for Human Rights in carrying out the activities of the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education .  
Appropriate institutions of civil society , including non-governmental organizations , workers ' and employers ' organizations , labour unions , the mass media , religious organizations , community organizations , the family , independent information , resource and training centres and others , for the purpose of incorporating human rights education into non-formal programmes , should be encouraged and assisted in developing and delivering such non-formal programmes , with the help of Governments and international donors and programmes .  
With the support of national focal points and national resource and training centres , local and community-based organizations should be prepared to deliver popular human rights education , through vocational and adult education , literacy training , local non-governmental organizations , family outreach and religious education .  
These actors include international and regional intergovernmental organizations ; individual States ; parliamentarians ; non-governmental organizations from the local to the global levels ; and private actors such as legal professionals , the media , academics , private institutions and civic associations , including ethnic , cultural and religious groups .  
Non-democratic States over time tend to generate conditions inimical to development : politicized military rule ; a weak middle class ; a population constrained to silence ; prohibitions on travel ; censorship ; restrictions on the practice of religion or imposition of religious obligations ; and pervasive and often institutionalized corruption .  
Unfortunately , in our world there remain conflicts , violence , ethnic strife , religious intolerance , terrorism , drug trafficking , corruption , poverty , unjust international economic relations and a heavy external debt that continues to prove overwhelming .  
In the spirit of Olympic ethics , any form of discrimination racial , religious , political , linguistic or otherwise is totally excluded , and the fundamental principle of equality prevails .  During the last three millenniums the Greek people have remained wholeheartedly and deeply committed to the Olympic Ideal , founded on the noble principles of understanding , tolerance , solidarity and dignity .  
We also urge them to institute national projects and programmes to meet the demand of international public opinion for promotion of the spirit of brotherhood , tolerance and love ; rejection of violence ; collective responsibility for guaranteeing fundamental human rights for all , regardless of nationality , race , or religious or ethnic affiliation ; and allowing peoples to live in peace and stability .  
Taking full advantage of historical affinities , cultural ties and religious bonds and sparing no effort to utilize in an efficient and coordinated manner the human and natural potential and resources of the region constitute the single best long-term guarantee of security and tranquillity .  
For all those reasons , and with a view to preserving the religious , cultural and historical character of Jerusalem , the Government of Jordan continues to maintain , restore and protect the Holy Places , now under the yoke of occupation , and to provide the necessary support for the relevant officials , with a view to protecting those places from all dangers pending the final solution to which we look forward .  
They include poverty and growing economic imbalances in and between countries ; rising unemployment and underemployment in many parts of the world ; environmental degradation ; war and civil strife ; intensified domestic and international conflicts for political , religious or ethnic reasons ; disparities in economic development and income levels ; globalization ; labour market demands ; and increased international trade and investment .  
UNHCR notes that involvement of local rather than international non-governmental organizations is likely to provide a closer link with the private sector at the country level and with institutions of civil society , such as voluntary agencies , human rights groups , cultural and academic associations , churches and other religious bodies , and refugee community groups .  
The Government of Poland stated that in public elementary and secondary schools , religious instruction shall be organized for pupils whose parents or legal guardians express a wish that their children should attend such instruction or classes and in secondary schools such instruction shall be organized for pupils whose parents or who themselves express such a wish .  
They also expressed their concern that technological developments in the field of communication , including computer networks such as Internet , can potentially be used for the dissemination of racist , anti-Semitic and xenophobic propaganda , the main victims of which are , inter alia , racial , ethnic , national , linguistic and religious minorities .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , States have the duty , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all universally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms , in accordance with international human rights standards .  
Provisional Order No . 4 / 1994 ( Miscellaneous Amendment of the Organization of Voluntary Work _ Societies Registration Act of 1957 and the Organization of Foreign Non _ Governmental Voluntary Work in the Sudan Act of 1988 ) , signed by the President of the Republic , defines a society as a voluntary organization of thirty or more persons established to carry out voluntary work of [ a ] social , scientific , educational , research , cultural and religious purpose ( art .  2.1 . a . 2 ) .  
According to article 2.2.2 , a voluntary organization means any foreign voluntary organization whose purpose is to carry out work the nature of which is social , scientific , educational , research based , cultural , technical or religious and which is registered under this Act .  
In this respect , the Special Rapporteur recalls Commission resolutions 1994 / 79 , 1995 / 77 and 1996 / 73 , in which , inter alia , it called upon the Government to comply with applicable international human rights instruments and to bring its national legislation into accordance with the instruments to which the Sudan is a party , and to ensure that all individuals in its territory and subject to its jurisdiction , including members of all religious and ethnic groups , enjoyed fully the rights recognized in those instruments ;  
Furthermore , the Assembly called upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action .  
In its continuous search for new channels for promoting and protecting human rights , the National Commission had initiated contacts with religious bodies , and had become deeply involved in investigating inter _ ethnic land conflicts which had assumed alarming dimensions .  
The basic mandate established by the Commission for the Sub _ Commission is ( a ) to undertake studies , particularly in the light of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights concerning the prevention of discrimination of any kind relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms and the protection of racial , national , religious and linguistic minorities , ( b ) to perform any other functions which may be entrusted to it by the Economic and Social Council or the Commission on Human Rights .  
Disturbed by the widespread occurrence in many parts of the world of violent conflicts engendering ethnic or religious hostility , and convinced that the implementation of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , together with other relevant instruments , is the best approach for resolving such conflicts peacefully , the Sub _ Commission in its resolution 1996 / 17 expressed its deep appreciation to the Working Group and called on the Commission to extend its mandate for another two years .  
In this connection , the Parsi minority is one of the most active and prosperous in India , both in the economic field as well as in terms of private school establishments , and also one of those that attaches the greatest importance to maintaining itself as a specific and distinct ethnic and religious community .  
According to official and non _ government observers , the destruction of Babri Masjid was an incident , an aberration , the result of the political exploitation of religion by ultra _ nationalist political parties , and can not be interpreted as evidence of an official policy of religious intolerance directed against Muslims .  
On the basis of all the information received and a detailed study of the documentation it appears that the situation of the Sikhs in the religious field is satisfactory , but that difficulties are arising in the political ( foreign interference , terrorism , etc . ) , economic ( in particular with regard to sharing of water supplies ) and even occupational fields .  
However , the economic and cultural poverty of the most disadvantaged is a fertile breeding _ ground for the development of religious extremism and , more generally , for the political exploitation of religion ; this is evidenced by the conflicts in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab , the destruction of Babri Masjid and the intercommunal riots in Bombay .  
As regards Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab , the Special Rapporteur urges all the parties concerned _ official and non _ official , national and foreign _ to act calmly and refrain from exacerbating religious problems to ensure that immutable religious principles are not affected by political considerations at the expense of the religious rights of the communities and , more generally , of tolerance and non _ discrimination based on religion or belief .  
As cholera is now thought to be endemic in Somalia , agencies , having learned from four years of experience , have designed specific prevention and control plans with the local communities to ensure water chlorination and to prevent the spread of the disease through social mobilization campaigns on country-wide radio broadcasts , local billboards , flyers and messages delivered through religious leaders .  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
Expresses its grave concern at any attack upon religious places , sites and shrines , and calls upon all States , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to exert utmost efforts to ensure that such places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected ;  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
Such efforts should be pursued in close cooperation with community and religious leaders and non-governmental organizations , at all levels of the State , i.e . national , regional , zonal and woreda levels , and special emphasis should be placed on the need to coordinate the policies designed to implement the Convention between central and local authorities .  
With regard to the full implementation of the principles laid down by articles 2 , 3 , 6 and 12 in the Convention , the Committee suggests that the State party fully integrate them in all its policies , laws , actions and programmes affecting children at all levels , including on the administrative and judicial levels , especially with regard to children belonging to ethnic and religious minority groups , the girl child , disabled children and children living in rural and remote areas .  
It becomes more sensitive and complicated when it relates to the city of Al-Quds Al-Sharif Jerusalem which has a unique political status and represents the spiritual patrimony of three religions and is closely linked to deep religious feelings in the Islamic world .  
The Israeli Government decision to establish new Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem runs counter to the spirit of peace that now prevails in the region , and constitutes an additional obstacle to the creation of a climate of understanding , reconciliation and religious tolerance in that age-old holy city held so dear by the world 's three great monotheistic religions .  
Gravely concerned at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , killings of civilians , torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , deaths in custody , absence of due process of law , severe restrictions on freedoms of opinion , expression , assembly and association , violations of freedom of movement , forced relocation , forced labour and portering and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Also strongly urges the Government of Myanmar to ensure full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , including freedom of expression and assembly , the right to fair trial and the protection of the rights of persons belonging to ethnic and religious minorities , and to put an end to violations of the right to life and integrity of the human being , to the practices of torture , abuse of women , forced labour and forced relocations and to enforced disappearances and summary executions ;  
Calls upon the Government of Myanmar and other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully the obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , [ 8 ] to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law and to avail itself of such services as may be offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
Deeply concerned that , despite the fall of apartheid and despite continuing efforts to combat these phenomena , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of racially motivated violence , persist and are even growing in magnitude , adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination , inter alia against Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , negrophobia , anti _ Semitism and related intolerance continue to persist and even to grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Request the Chairman of the Commission , when appointing special rapporteurs , to continue to consult closely with regional groups and ensure that the appointee is of recognized standing in the field of human rights , has an overall knowledge of political , social and legal systems , is sensitive to different cultural , religious and ethnic particularities , and will accordingly implement his mandate independently , impartially and objectively ;  
As on previous occasions , the Polish delegation expresses its strong belief that only genuine national reconciliation and respect for the interests of all ethnic and religious population groups in Afghanistan , as well as the long-standing tradition of Afghan statehood , can provide a true basis for a peaceful settlement of the conflict .  
Much of the populace has accepted Taliban rule not , I would say , because they want a severe judicial regime or social and religious restrictions imposed on all , but because they are desperate for peace and a semblance of normal life .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination , inter alia , against Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , negrophobia , anti _ Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Emphasizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated ; the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis ; while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
Also concerned about reports of ideological indoctrination or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , especially but not exclusively affecting displaced families and women and children belonging to racial , ethnic and religious minorities , Gravely concerned about reports that these practices have frequently been carried out by agents under government authority or have taken place with the knowledge of the Government of the Sudan ,  
Calls upon the Government of the Sudan to comply with applicable international human rights instruments and to bring its national legislation into accordance with those instruments to which the Sudan is a party , and to ensure that all individuals in its territory and subject to its jurisdiction , including members of all religious and ethnic groups , enjoy fully the rights recognized in those instruments ;  
Regarding crimes against humanity , article 3 of the statute of the International Tribunal for Rwanda stresses the prosecution of persons responsible for crimes " when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population on national , political , ethnic , racial or religious grounds " , that is , it does not associate those crimes primarily with armed conflicts .  
Consequently , there must exist a clear objective - to destroy and to remove an undesirable national , ethnical , racial , or religious group from the population of the State or region either by wholesale physical extermination as such or by the physical extermination of part of the group and forcible expulsion of the others from the defined district , region or State as a whole .  
The unbridled power struggle is thus nourished by rivalries among the leaders of various clans and by their unquenchable thirst for political power commensurate with their moral and religious domination of the members of their respective communities .  
Collective expulsions or population transfers usually target national , ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities and thus , prima facie , violate individual as well as collective rights contained in several important international human rights instruments , in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention on the Rights of the Child .  
An extensive debate encompassing a wide range of secular and religious views was in fact under way concerning assisted reproduction ; the current restrictions had been introduced by the previous Government .  
I would point out that the Turkish occupied area of Cyprus contains a large part of the island 's archaeological and historic sites , as well as religious monuments , which are subject to severe and extensive destruction , of which Turkey , as the occupying Power , is fully responsible and accountable .  
These are the latest in a long series of grave and recurrent cases of systematic pillaging and obliteration of the island 's archaeological , historic and religious monuments for which Turkey , as the occupying Power , must be held fully and exclusively accountable .  
Emphasizes its opposition to all instances of arbitrary deprivation of nationality , especially those based on racial , national , ethnic or religious grounds , as a violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms and an impediment to the right to return to one 's country ;  
Judge Murphy proposed that any organization which purported to be religious and whose belief and practices were reminiscent of or reflected ancient forms of worship could claim to believe in one or more supernatural beings , a god or an abstract entity and would be regarded as a religion . religious schools were contrary to article 116 of the Constitution , since such public funding was granted without distinction between the various religions and was therefore not tantamount to the establishment of a religion .  
With regard to legislation , while noting with satisfaction the legal and legislative arrangements developed and implemented for the protection of land and sacred sites , including religious objects , and for the return of the religious and cultural heritage , the Special Rapporteur recommends ensuring uniformity of such legislation at the Federal and State levels , as well as its effectiveness in relation to its assigned objective , particularly by identifying and remedying shortcomings and loopholes .  
It will reach out to different groups : the voluntary sector , social and health-care practitioners , professional and academic bodies , central and local government , industry and commerce , professionals , interested individuals , womens , youth and older peoples organizations , religious bodies , schools and colleges , cross-cultural and ethnic minority groups and many others .  
A public sector that is either too weak or too large can lead to serious ethnic , religious , political and economic conflicts , undermining sound governance and efforts to promote human development .  
According to the report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ( A / 51 / 301 ) , such manifestations had profound and complex historical , political , social , economic and even religious causes which should be removed by taking measures to achieve genuine equality , human rights and fundamental freedoms among all racial or ethnic groups .  
The international community was currently facing different , although not unfamiliar , problems , namely , the break-up of political entities , conflicts based on religious ideology , the repercussions of the apartheid policies applied in the past and human rights violations engendered by racial and ethnic hatred .  
This view includes situations of extreme poverty and economic and social under-development , human rights violations , massive flows of refugees , civil wars resulting from ethnic conflicts , extreme degradation of the environment , terrorism , and even certain socio-political phenomena such as corruption , drug trafficking and international crime ; it also includes religious fundamentalism , which in recent years has aggressively invaded several regions of the world . 
Essentially a product of deep social and economic underdevelopment , crises in that part of the world are aggravated by ethnic , cultural and religious factors , all deeply rooted in history .  
Equal attention was being paid to the renaissance and free development of the Ukrainian nation and to the promotion and protection of the spiritual and cultural heritage of other ethnic , linguistic and religious groups living in Ukraine .  
Further , the Assembly called upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action .  
Deeply concerned that despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , continue to persist and even grown in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
While the proportion of the national budget allocated to basic social sectors was still to be optimized , advances had been made in the political arena , such as the agreement by the National Assembly to convene a biennial children 's parliament , the creation of strategic alliances for children 's rights among mayors and religious leaders and the review of Senegalese legislation in the light of the Convention on the Rights of the Child .  
While significance of national and regional characteristics and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Genocide can be committed irrespective of any armed conflict and comprises certain crimes ( such as killing or causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of a particular group ) committed with the intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group , as such .  
Crimes against humanity require that certain capital crimes ( such as murder , extermination , imprisonment , torture , rape or persecution on political , racial and religious grounds ) are committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack against any civilian population on national , political , ethnical , racial or religious grounds .  
The Team has directly raised awareness about Pacific island Constitutions , laws , human rights , gender and the application of United Nations Conventions among rural and urban women , youth groups , civil society activists , social welfare officers , police officers , religious seminarians , magistrates , justices , senior court judges and other providers of the justice system in the Cook Islands , Fiji , the Federated States of Micronesia , Kiribati , the Marshall Islands , Nauru , Niue , Samoa , the Solomon Islands , Tonga , Tuvalu and Vanuatu .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the Office of the High Commissioner , in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
Calls upon the Government of Myanmar and other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully the obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , [ 8 ] to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law and to avail itself of such services as may be offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
Social , religious and cultural networks can help to represent the specific economic interests of all the different groups in the community , particularly excluded groups ; to ensure that policies reflect the needs and interest of communities ; to ensure that policies do not lead to disintegration of communities ; to collect relevant data and information on the impact of economic policies ; to carry out participatory monitoring of policies ; and to ensure local representation in government structures .  
Other social groups that can be identified include ethnic and religious minorities ; indigenous people ; refugees and displaced persons ; migrants and migrant workers , both legal and illegal , as well as family members left behind ; prisoners and ex-offenders ; addicts and former addicts ; squatters ; street children ; people living in extreme poverty ; and landless rural workers .  
Limitations governing the use of the media are defined in article 5 , which prohibits , inter alia , its use to call for usurpation of power , the change by force of the constitutional order , breach of the territorial integrity of the Republic , incitement to national , social , racial and religious intolerance or dissension , to propagate war and aggression , to diffuse pornography , to encroach on the morality , honour and dignity of citizens or to publish materials relating to inquiries that have not been completed .  
The world is currently passing through highly interwoven and complicated circumstances , where progress and its horizons mingle with backwardness and its dangers while humanity takes pride in such achievements as economic progress and the development of technology and informatics , it is still suffering from the practices of terrorism , drug trafficking , organized crime , the spread of corruption , the overflow of refugees , the challenges posed by war criminals , crimes of genocide and mass murder , and the negative effects of racism and religious discrimination . 
Peace , security and disarmament are vital to a safe and secure planet , and the countless individuals who live daily in constant fear whether because of terrorists , hatred between ethnic groups , internecine warfare or religious persecution gives us much concern . 
Now we are practically the only country of the Commonwealth of Independent States that had a stable economic growth of about 16 per cent during the first half of this year ; we have arrested the decrease in volumes of industrial production and we are a country free from religious , ethnic or civil strife . 
We note that , unfortunately , our neighbour , Turkey , is indulging in dangerous policies that run counter to the deep historical , religious and human relations between Iraq and Turkey . Turkey has repeatedly continued to violate our sovereignty , interfere in our internal affairs and invade our territory , on the basis of flimsy pretexts .  
And yet in my country , which today is in the grip of civil war , almost everything has been done since the sovereign national conference to spare our young democracy from the tragic upheavals inherent in any sudden social change , which in this case consisted of the move from a single-party political regime banning any organized opposition to a veritable explosion of freedoms individual , political and religious .  
The Summit \ x { e5b8 } future-oriented outlook , as reflected in the Declaration \ x { e5b8 } principles and goals , was a commitment to a political , economic , ethical and spiritual vision for social development , which , in addition to the principles I have just referred to , called for full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of people .  
We hope that the international community of States , non-governmental organizations , civil society , religious groups and local bodies will , together , work vigorously to promote education and awareness so that peace and tolerance may prevail throughout the world , together with a diversity of opinions and ideas and respect for basic human rights , including the right to physical and moral integrity .  
Ethnic and religious intolerance , the policy of ethnic cleansing and the acts of barbarity that accompanied events in the former Yugoslavia are a deeply tragic and very relevant warning about the quality and solidity of our civilization on the cusp of the twenty-first century .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
In East Timor , a wide range of human rights violations continued to take place during the last year , compounded by increasing incidents of political , religious and ethnic violence .  
It should be noted that while ethnic and religious identities have not played a significant role in the conflict , there has been a feeling in the northern and central parts of the country that their economic and cultural interests have been neglected by the Government .  
Extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , impunity , racism and xenophobia , discrimination against women , ethnic and religious intolerance , mass exoduses and refugee flows , armed conflicts and terrorism , and lack of the rule of law are highlighted by the resolutions of United Nations organs as being major obstacles to the full realization of human rights .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , continue to persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
We are concerned to see the Israeli authorities continuing to commit certain acts that are intended to change the Holy City 's demographic and institutional character in order to Judaize Arab Jerusalem and alter its legal , historical , religious and cultural reality .  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , including through the facilitation of their full participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of the country ;  
Takes into account the Bangkok Declaration wherein it is recognized that while human rights are universal in nature , they must be considered in the context of a dynamic and evolving process of international norm _ setting , bearing in mind the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds ;  
Also concerned about reports of ideological indoctrination or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , especially but not exclusively affecting displaced families and women and children belonging to racial , ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , continue to persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
The democratic process in the Syrian Arab Republic was moving ahead steadily , in keeping with international instruments and standards and the historical , cultural , economic and religious background of the country .  
The report of the Special Rapporteur on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance and of discrimination based on religion or belief detailed egregious violations of the right to freedom of religion or belief and demonstrated the degree to which that most fundamental human right continued to be breached .  
With regard to the National Reconciliation Conference , a preparatory committee was established on 17 October 1997 , composed of 40 members representing the public authorities ( the Presidency of the Republic , the Government , the National Assembly and the judicial authorities ) , the parties of the four major political groups , trade unions , employers , the various professions ( lawyers , doctors , pharmacists , architects , notaries ) , religious denominations and women .  
Recognizing also that there is no single political system or single universal model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples , and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
Expresses its grave concern at any attack upon religious places , sites and shrines , and calls upon all States , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to exert utmost efforts to ensure that such places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected ;  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;

Takes into account the Bangkok Declaration wherein it is recognized that while human rights are universal in nature , they must be considered in the context of a dynamic and evolving process of international norm _ setting , bearing in mind the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds ;  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination , inter alia against Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , negrophobia , anti _ Semitism and related intolerance continue to persist and even to grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,

The refugee issue was not new , but it was compounded by the complexity of the situation in the countries and regions involved , with communities often divided by religious and ethnic hatreds , governance and public security lacking , and poverty widespread .

The recent surge in these activities by Pakistan , however , is a mere supplement to its widespread presence in Afghanistan , as Pakistan maintains thousands of military personnel , non-commissioned officers , armed nationals belonging to numerous Pakistan-based extremist organizations and volunteers from religious schools called the Madrassa , fighting alongside the Taliban mercenaries .

The General Assembly of the United Nations has done important and indispensable work in recent years to build a consensus on the basic principle that terrorist acts , wherever and by whomever they are committed , are criminal and unjustifiable by any political , religious or philosophical considerations .  
It is an act that flagrantly violated a basic , fundamental right on which is based the functioning and entire legal , political , moral and religious structure of our societies and of human coexistence : respect for the right to life of every human being .

All state representatives at the Tunis Summit claimed that this plan proved the countries ' commitment to pursue and strengthen political , economic , social , and educational reforms .  However , these reforms had to be carried out according to the national conditions , cultural backgrounds , religious beliefs , and the possible extent of change of individual states to silently resist the U.S . intention of forcing the Arab states into carrying out political and economic reforms by means foreign to the Arabs .  
Speaking about the two main themes of " unity and democracy , " Li Ruihuan said being the most extensive patriotic united front organization , the CPPCC should hold high the banner of unity , and pull together people of different parties , different social strata , different ethnic groups and different religious beliefs through seeking common ground while reserving differences , understanding , magnanimity , coordinating relations , and resolving contradictions .  
disseminated , in a vivid way , the materialist ideological concept of respecting science and opposing superstition among the vast number of the visitors ; helped people see more clearly the true nature and the harms of such religious cults as the " Falungong " ; and will thus prove a great help to enhancing the spiritual civilization and the scientific attainment of our people .  
it is necessary to do a good job of effectively carrying out nationality , religious , national defense , diplomatic , and Taiwan affairs work , to resolutely fight sabotage activities carried out by hostile forces at home and abroad , and to combat various law-violating and criminal activities , so as to maintain social and political stability , the unity of the motherland , and national security and to create a good international and domestic environment for reform and development .  
Tanzania , Rwanda , and some other African countries have recently expressed one after another that they would never allow the religious groups that " affect social stability or engage in reactionary deeds " to launch activities within their territories , and they would take resolute actions against the cults that " seek private gains , publicize heretical beliefs , and collect money and property to get rich " in order to " prevent the recurrence of the Uganda Tragedy . "  
Meanwhile , some national and religious conflicts and some problems left over by history have yet been solved ; the conflicts over territorial land , territorial seas , and natural resources have risen one after another ; and some countries have even attempted to bring in foreign forces to take a hand in the interference in others ' internal affairs .  
Defense ministers of the five countries exchanged views on the issues of implementing the consensus reached by heads of the five countries , summarizing the situation in executing the agreements on confidence-building in the military sphere and on the mutual reduction of the armed forces in the border areas , strengthening the trustful cooperation in military , political , and security spheres among the five countries , and opposing the national separatism , the religious extremism , and the international terrorism .  After reaching a broad agreement on these issues , they issued a joint communique .  
The Chinese government practices a policy of respecting and protecting freedom of religious belief , pursuing the principle of keeping religion , political power and education separate .  The country protects normal religious activities , as well as the legal rights and interests of religious organizations .  The different religions have equal standing and live together harmoniously , and there is mutual respect and unified harmony between the citizens who practice religion and those who do not believe in any religion .  
Jiang Zemin said : The Chinese government implements the policy of respecting and protecting the freedom of religious beliefs , and follows the principle of separating religion from political power and education .  The country protects normal religious activities and the legitimate rights of religious groups .  Different religions in China share equal status , and co-exist in perfect harmony ; and religious believers and non-believers respect each other , and live together in unity and harmony .  
Not long ago , with a deep feeling of grief we bade farewell to our revered Comrade Zhao Puchu , who was a noted social activist , a great patriot , an outstanding patriotic religious leader , a well-known writer , poet , and calligrapher enjoying great prestige at home and abroad , and a caring philanthropist . 
On 16 August the delegation convened in Beijing a " seminar of Chinese religious circles on world peace issues " , at which speeches were made by the principal responsible persons of China 's five main nationwide religions , namely Buddhism , Taoism , Islamism , Catholicism , and Protestantism , who are members of the delegation .  These speeches fully expressed the stance , views , and ideas of Chinese religious circles on preserving world peace and creating a beautiful living space for mankind .  
We urge the mass media workers to feel proud of their lofty mission of safeguarding world peace , sow the seed of tolerance and friendliness among the people by means of their hard work every day , and make impartial and objective reports , especially reports on the religious situation in various countries , in order to promote mutual understanding among the people .  Exaggerating differences and inciting antagonism can only deceive the people for some time and can not deceive them forever .  
However , the Vatican has turned black into white by " canonizing " these sinners , who had a notorious record , in an attempt to reverse the historical fact of the imperialist aggression against China . This act has severely hurt the feelings of the Chinese people and is intolerable to every religious believer who loves his country .  
People present at a meeting also indicated : No doubt the recent " canonization " is a bad thing , yet it also serves to sound the alarm for us .  It has helped to sober us ; and has enabled us to see more clearly the true features of the Vatican which interferes in China 's internal affairs by using a religious issue , and see more clearly the political plot of western hostile forces to stage an infiltration against China on the pretext of religion .  
The leaders of these five countries signed the Dushanbe Declaration proclaiming their joint opposition to ethnic separatism , international terrorism , and religious extremism , and reached a major consensus on building an edifice of neighborly , friendly , and peaceful cooperation that is oriented toward the 21st century .  
In order to attain their unspeakable aims , cults always take advantage of loopholes in state laws and social management policies ; to the outside world they are cloaked in religious practice and working to improve people 's health , while internally they draw up strict regulations and prohibitions , and establish a strictly graded illegal organizational structure in a vain attempt to form a " secret kingdom " backed by " religious " beliefs outside the framework of a society with a legal system .  
In order to deceive people , he disguised himself as a religious leader who had suffered persecution , and accused the Chinese Government of violating human rights .  He took credit and sought rewards from his master in the West by acting against the Chinese Government . He openly served as a shameful tool and a pawn of anti-China forces in the West in an attempt to play a role in helping anti-China forces in the West promote " Westernization " in China and " split " China .  
We must hold aloft the banner of ethnic solidarity and progress , vigorously propagate the party 's ethnic and religious policies , and do more practical and good things for the minority-nationality masses , to consolidate the excellent situation of people of all nationalities breathing the same air , sharing the same destiny , and being linked heart to heart .  
How can they allow their constantly improving livelihood be jeopardized by the Dalai . In the questionnaires , the residents in the Chengguan District of Lhasa City have given a resounding answer .  They , as well as the people of all ethnic groups in Tibet , are deeply aware that the blind religious worship people have for the Dalai Lama , who has ulterior motives , has not only stifled their ideas but also shackled their hands and feet ;  
Nevertheless , all orthodox religions have , during the process of their missionary work , gradually blended man 's rationality with his common sense ; and by blending the two , these religions have been able to make their religious propositions more rational and more humane , and have thus played an increasingly important role in man 's this life and even become the source of cultures and moral principles of certain nations .  
In a country which originally does not have a strong religious awareness , while reaffirming man 's right to freedom of faith , we must also let our kindhearted people know how high a cost the Western world has paid in blood and how protracted and arduous a struggle it has gone through in its pursuit of a peaceful coexistence between religion and rationality and in its effort to gradually bury the various extremist religions and political propositions .  
The delegation also held special report sessions on " opposing evil cult , guaranteeing human rights " for Chinese students studying in France and for overseas Chinese living and working in France . During its visit , the delegation also met with leaders of the French official and non-governmental anti-cult organizations and leaders of the French religious circles .  Both sides expressed their willingness to increase exchanges on the experience of investigating and fighting evil cults in the future .  
Take its handling of the Tibet question for example , after taking office in 1993 , former US President Bill Clinton again highlighted the values of human rights by following in Jimmy Carter 's footsteps .  Clinton declared : If China refuses to make improvement on human rights , the United States will not grant MFN status to China . Clinton also listed protecting Tibet 's unique religious or cultural heritage in his wish list on human rights and even arranged an unscheduled meeting between himself and Dalai in the White House .  
Based on the principle of making active strikes against crimes and of cracking down on crimes whenever they occur , Xinjiang has maintained high pressure on national splittists , violent terrorist groups , and religious extremists and has thwarted their splittist activities several times , thereby realizing political and social stability for Xinjiang .  
The entire process of the incident was connected to historical , legal , cultural , language , and religious issues , and the only thing that was conspicuously absent was its military aspect .  US Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld did not even appear in public during the development of the incident .  It was not until 13 April that he held a news conference at which he complained that it was only the Chinese Communist plane 's provocative act that was the underlying cause of the collision .  
Hence , in the drive to " strike hard " and put things in order , it is necessary to make full preparations to consistently regard as the most important thing the crackdown on organized crime , especially organized crime of all kinds committed by backbone ethnic separatist elements , elements who commit bombing and terrorism , and extremist religious elements ; we must take the initiative to attack them , and hit them as soon as they show themselves .  
Wang Zhaoguo said : Guangxi is an area inhabited by minority ethnic groups .  Because the regional party committee and the regional government attach great importance to the ethnic and religious work and exercise correct leadership , good results have been achieved in the building of new-type socialist ethnic relations of being equal , united , and mutually assistant .  
Within the scope of the laws and policies and in accordance with the Islamic scriptures , the committee will make accurate and authoritative interpretations of the Islamic doctrine and canon which meet the need of the development of times , compile model books for sermons , and standardize contents of sermons , and enhance the level of work for the personnel in charge of Islamic religious affairs .  In addition , the committee will actively lead the religion to adapt to the socialist society by opposing religious extremist activities which make use of Islam .  
Fu Tieshan , president of the China Patriotic Catholic Association and vice president of the Chinese Catholic Bishops College , pointed out : The annual report issued by the US International Religious Freedom Commission cooked up something out of nothing , confused right and wrong , mixed up black and white , violated the norms of international relations , and grossly interfered in China 's internal affairs .  This is unacceptable to people of China 's religious circles .  
When the splittists wantonly injured and killed ordinary people , did they have the least bit of national feelings and religious piety ?  Since betraying the motherland and the Tibetan people in 1959 , Dalai as the representative of the backward feudal serfdom , has been engaging in splittist activities outside the borders .  
The Dalai 's destruction of Tibetan-sect Buddhism also finds conspicuous expression in the fact that he has openly violated the established historical practice and religious rules and obstructed and undermined the work of locating and deciding on the reincarnated soul boy of the 10th Panchen by presumptuously announcing from abroad the ceincarnated soul boy of the Panchen , ?  
Therefore , correctly understanding and mastering the relationship between common characters and individual characters , fully understanding the protracted nature , complexity , and importance of the ethnic and religious issues , upholding the ideological line of seeking truth from facts , and proceeding from the actual conditions in Tibet in doing everything are important principles which must be mastered in doing work well .  
During an interview by the press , Tang Yinlong said the Dalai is not just a religious figure , but also the general representative of the serf system in Tibet and a political refugee in the garb of religion who , over a long time , has engaged himself abroad in criminal activities of trying to split up the country and undermining unity among ethnic groups .  
After Tibet 's peaceful liberation , the central government and the Tibet Autonomous Regional Government began to list famous religious activity sites including the Johkang , Thaxi Lhunbo , Drepung , Sagya , and Sera Monasteries as key cultural heritages under national or autonomous regional protection .  
Recent scholarly discussions have rejected the easily confused and controversial phrase , " heretical cul " t , and changed to such neutral descriptions as " religious sect " , " minority religious sect " , or " rising religious sect " , etc . , in order to avoid using provocative terms .  
When looking at it from the point of view of the historical development of various " religious sects " , new and developing religious sects become discontented with the rigidity of the organizational system and break off from the mother religion .  Their leaders put forward the enlightenment of a special divinity and call on the minority of the followers .  This early developmental stage is inevitably looked upon by the mainstream as " heretical " .  
Hong Kong serves as a diverse cultural capital , the development of religious sects has its freedom , there is sound social differentiation of " religious sects " developed by the people 's knowledge , and illegal behavior by " religious sects " is already regulated by Hong Kong law .  The day that the government of the SAR , ignorant of religion , enacts the " Anti-Heretical Cult Law " , all legitimate " religious sects " will be affected .  
In the " Alma Ata Declaration " , leaders of the five countries explicitly expressed their common position of opposing the national separatist force and the religious extremist forces , jointly cracking down on international terrorists , organized crimes , drug-trafficking , smuggling , and other transnational criminal activities .  They all agreed that they would not allow any people to use their own territories to carry out activities detrimental to the state sovereignty , security , and social order of another country .  
He said : To safeguard regional security , the countries of the " Shanghai Five " should take joint actions in dealing blows at religious extremism , international terrorism , organized crime , drug trafficking , and arms smuggling .  At the same time , they should also expand cooperation in the economic , cultural , educational , scientific , and technological fields .  
Meanwhile , they are also deeply perplexed by numerous problems like the foundation of state regimes being fragile , the religious forces being powerful which gives rise to political and social disunity and complicated peripheral environments , the three evil forces running wild , the phenomena of smuggling , drug trafficking , arms trade , and so on being serious , and so on .  
The Common Program solemnly announced the abolition of the feudal system , which had shackled women .  Women were to enjoy the same political , economic , cultural , educational , and other social rights as men .  It cut the four ropes that had bound Chinese women , namely , the political system , clan power , religious authority , and the authority of their husbands , and ushered in a new era in the liberation of Chinese women . "  
After the former Soviet Union collapsed , long existing potential regional problems , such as ethnic and religious issues , have become the real problems of the political and economic life in the newly independent Russia , and each Central Asian country in the region .  
The Summit attendees unanimously proposed " zero tolerance of separatism , ethnic separatism and religious extremism , " and wrote the proposal that " each member state should adopt measures to combat the international terrorism , organized crimes , arm smuggling , drug trafficking and other transnational criminal activities " in the first joint charter .  It centered the " Shanghai Five " cooperation on the experiment of establishing an effective security cooperation framework instead of its initial goal of accomplishing border military trust and disarmament .  
At the fifth " Shanghai Five " summit held in July 2000 in Dushanbe , leaders of the member states reiterated their determination to " jointly combat such international criminal activities that contribute the most threats to the region 's security , stability and development such as ethnic separatism , religious extremism , international terrorism , illegal arms smuggling , drug trafficking and illegal migration . "  It also proposed to sign treaties and pacts on multilateral cooperation among the member states .  
It should strive to safeguard social and political stability , firmly oppose national separatist and religious extremist forces , actively coordinate relations between different strata , different social groups , different parties , different ethnic groups , and different religions inside the united front , take timely actions to remove various negative factors that may affect our social and political stability , and create a concerted , stable , and harmonious social environment for reform , opening-up , and modernization .  
There are differences between countries in their social systems , ideological thinking , perceptions of values , and religious beliefs ; therefore , in international relations , we should strictly observe the basic principles of mutually respecting each other 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , mutual non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , equality , mutual benefits , and peaceful coexistence .  
After giving a briefing on the main problems that affect social stability for the time being , Luo Gan listed the efforts to be made in the next step : First , strictly guard against and severely crack down on the criminal activities of the ethnic separatist forces , the religious extremist forces , and the violent terrorist forces , deal harsh blows at the sabotage activities of the hostile forces , and resolutely safeguard national security and unity .  
An official of the Ministry of Public Security has revealed that the current main factors for instability in China are : " the activities of hostile forces abroad , of ethnic separatist organizations , and of ' Falungong ' " ; criminal terrorist activities involving ethnic separatist organizations and related religious extremist forces have the greatest impact on social tranquillity , while there have recently been " new trends " in the activities of " Falungong . "  
third , persist in comprehensively carrying out the party 's national and religious policies , making constant efforts to consolidate and develop socialist national relations marked by equality , unity , and mutual aid among the masses of every nationality in Tibet , and persist in developing a strong and patriotic united front ;  
responsible persons of central committees of democratic parties , the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce , and mass bodies concerned ; and figures from various united front circles who are in Beijing , including non-party figures , representatives of intellectuals outside the CPC , representatives of ethnic and religious circles , and representatives of Hong Kong , Macao , and Taiwan compatriots and overseas Chinese compatriots .  
The third liberation was cultural and ideological liberation .  This liberation released the people of Tibet , long-enslaved under the binding ties of a unitary religious and political system and the corruption of feudal serfdom , from the remnants of backward thought .  
completely get rid of the soil on which the " Falungong " cult and various decadent ideologies and cultures breed ; strive to give rise to a sound general trend of opposing religious cults and upholding civilization in society ; and make positive contribution to improving the ideological and moral quality as well as the scientific and cultural quality of the entire nation , and to promoting the country 's undertaking of reform , opening up , and modernization building .  
In the field of regional issues , the two sides emphasized the adoption of active and effective measures to crack down on national splittist , international terrorist , religious extremist , and transnational criminal activities .  
exemplarily carrying out the party 's ethnic and religious policies ; actively assisting local authorities in vigorously developing science and technological , educational , cultural , and health work ; serving as a vanguard , fighting on the forefront , heroically protecting the people 's lives and property in various missions to deal with emergencies and relieve disaster victims , writing heroic songs of victory one after another and fully demonstrating a good image of being a mighty and civilized army and an army of triumph .  
The democratization of international relations is far from being realized , the unjust and unfair world political and economic order remains unchanged , the gaps between the South and the North in development levels and between the rich and the poor are widening , and conflicts caused by racial , religious , and other issues are continuing .  
It is necessary to keep to and improve the system of regional ethnic autonomy , fully and correctly implement the party 's ethnic policy and religious policy , unite all forces that can be united , resolutely foil all separatist plans and sabotage attempts by a small number of separatists and the international hostile forces , and strive for a lasting peace and political stability in Tibet .  
The US believes that , in the aftermath of the Cold War , and particularly since entering the new century , there are still the following eight destabilizing factors in Asia : Border conflicts , religious contradictions , unstable domestic political situations , social and regional turmoil , territorial and sovereignty disputes , ethnic separatism , terrorist operations , and population problems .  
The after-effects of the financial crisis still exist in certain countries in varying degrees , resulting in political turmoil and conspicuous ethnic , religious , and other social contradictions , seriously affecting the confidence of domestic and foreign investors .  
Recently , at an interview by a Hong Kong reporters ' delegation , Raidi , executive deputy secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee and chairman of the Standing Committee of the autonomous regional people 's congress said : After the passing of the 14th Dalai Lama , we will find the reincarnated child , according to historical conventions and religious rituals that were formed hundreds of years ago .  
Raidi said : Successive Dalai Lamas first searched for a few candidates for a relevant reincarnated child , according to historical conventions and religious rituals , before selecting one of them according to the ceremony of drawing lots from a golden urn and confirming the child after the approval of the central government .  Any act that runs counter to historical conventions and religious rituals would be regarded as invalid .  
Wang Lequan said that due to the daily convolution of the international situation , as we entered the 1990s , the international Islamic fundamentalist forces began to rear their ugly face , and they ran rampant in their activities .  Under the influence of international forces , within our borders , minority separatists and religious radicals harboring political schemes have been incited and encouraged , and they have created a definite unfavorable influence on Xinjiang 's social and political stability .  However , Xinjiang correctly implemented national minority and religious policies ;  
while in Japan , the three-party ruling coalition is divided in opinion , 21 mass organizations have staged demonstrations in protest , and another 14 religious bodies have issued objection statements .  However Koizumi turned a deaf ear to all this , and was bent on having his own way on the issue of paying homage to the Yasukuni Shrine ; and his thickheaded performance has made him excel all his predecessors .  
It was learned that while carrying out the " face-to-face " propaganda activity , the propaganda team members mainly explained the party 's and state 's nationality policies , rural policies , and religious policies and publicized the tremendous changes that had taken place in the local areas since reform and opening up .  Each year , they would revise the themes and key topics of the propaganda activity in light of outstanding problems during different periods .  
In addition , with the continuous improvement of democracy and the construction of the legal system , they have made prominent progress in democratic supervision , participation in and deliberation of state affairs , religious beliefs , and other political rights .  So long as China continues to follow the road of development that is in line with its national situation , China will achieve major progress in its social and economic development and the Chinese people will enjoy an even higher level of human rights .  
When asked about the current state of the boy designated by the Dalai as the " reincarnated soul boy " of the Panchen , Raidi said : The " reincarnated soul boy " of the Panchen proclaimed without authorization by the Dalai in 1995 is against religious rules and is illegal .  The boy is living a very happy life , is receiving education , and is growing up in a healthy manner .  He is now a primary school student .  
Besides , regional conflicts triggered by racial , religious , and territorial problems have never cease to break out , rising one after another ; many transnational problems , such as international crime and environmental deterioration , are far from being solved ; and the international community is still faced with many challenges .  
It was reported that in meeting with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel in Ankara , President Jiang Zemin expressed that both China and Turkey are faced with the task of protecting national unity and territorial integrity and both oppose all kinds of international terrorism , national separatism and religious extremism .

Li Tieying stressed : The development of the western regions is a massive and systematic project involving ecological environmental protection , infrastructure construction , industrial restructuring , scientific and technological education , reform and opening up , and ethnic and religious issues .  
Countries differ in many ways , in their social systems , historical backgrounds , cultural heritage , economic development , standard of living , religious beliefs , and values .  Therefore , it is not possible to expect all countries to develop after a single model or system .  
Any person , so long as he lives in this world , should enjoy the rights to subsistence , personal security , and all kinds of freedom .  People should treat each other equally despite their races , white , yellow , or black , and religious beliefs .  Any discrimination , hostility , killing in revenge , or ethnic cleansing is considered illegal .  
Li Peng said : China similarly respects the general principle of the international community on human rights .  However , we feel that as countries have different social systems , economic conditions , historical backgrounds , cultural traditions , and religious beliefs , they do not share an identical understanding of human rights .  This is very natural .  
By integrating basic Marxist theory on ethnic and religious issues with the specific reality of China , our party has formed a complete set of correct ethnic and religious policies , and we must uphold these for a long time .  
repeatedly talked nonsense at international occasions ; made malicious and entirely groundless accusations against the policy of the Chinese Government towards Tibet ; and wantonly spread such rumors as that " the human rights situation in Tibet is deteriorating , " " the Tibetan culture has become extinct , " and " there is no religious freedom in Tibet , " thus turning himself into a " master of wild lies . "  
the effective protection and the active use of cultural relics and historical records ; the respect and protection that has been showed and extended to customs and folkways as well as to the freedom of religious belief ; an all-round inheritance and development of culture and arts ; a comprehensive engagement in Tibetan studies ; and by the rejuvenation of the Tibetan medicine .  All these have attested to the full that the Tibetan culture has undergone an unprecedented development , and this is a fact that allows of no doubt .  
Second , continuous efforts should be made to crack down on religious extremist forces , ethnic secessionist forces , international terrorism and other transnational crimes that endanger regional stability and security .  
The foreign ministers of the five countries express their deep worry over the increasingly rampant activities of the forces of national separatism , international terrorism , and religious extremism .  They hold that those forces are the main threat to regional security and stability and it is necessary to tackle the situation through strengthening bilateral and multilateral cooperation , including the signing of related treaties and agreements by the " five countries . "  
5 .  All sides reaffirm their determination to jointly crack down on national splittism , international terrorism , and religious extremism that constitute major threats to regional peace , stability , and development and on such criminal activities as illicit trafficking in weapons and narcotics and illegal migration .  To this end , the five countries will draw up relevant multilateral outlines as early as possible ;  
As the social systems , historical backgrounds , cultural traditions , economic levels , living quality , religious beliefs , senses of value , and so on of all countries in the world differ in thousands of ways and it is impossible to ask every country to indiscriminately copy one model and one system .  
The top leaders of five nations : China , Russia , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , and Tajikistan , met in Dushanbe not long ago and issued a statement , reiterating their joint efforts to strike blows at national splittism , international terrorism , and religious extremism . ( referred to as three forces hereunder for short ) .  They also decided to set up an antiterrorism organ in Bishkek , Kyrgyzstand capital .  
Since the end of the Cold War , the nationality , racial , and religious contradictions which were covered during the war , have become more and more evident ; in particular , the splittist activity has gained headway in theory and practice , while the relevant countries and the international community were not ready for this , nor did they adopt effective countermeasures .  
Seven principal responsible persons of China 's five main religions announced in Beijing today the formation of a delegation of Chinese religious leaders to take part in the " Millennium World Peace Assembly " to be held at the United Nations in late August , attended by religious leaders from around the world .  
With the " Millennium World Peace Assembly " as the main topic , the seminar discussed questions of defusing conflicts , preserving peace , working at dialogue , promoting exchanges , eliminating poverty , protecting the environment , treasuring peace , and incorporating things of diverse nature ; they fully expressed the stance , views , and ideas of China 's religious and scholastic circles for preserving peace and creating a beautiful living space for mankind .  
Jamyang stated : " Only by developing the economy in the areas inhabited by the Tibetan nationality and improving the livelihood of the people of the Tibetan nationality will we be able to better maintain the cultural heritage of the Tibetan nationality or protect the freedom of religious belief or otherwise the culture or traditional religion of the Tibetan nationality would become exhibits only to be ' admired ' by others and would gradually wane . " 
Fu Tieshan said : " Facts tell us : As the status of religion in China has been rising , we have discovered that a certain number of people have misused the name of religion , attained their personal gains under the pretext of religion , and misled and misguided a large number of disciples without correct religious guidance .  We feel very sad about this . "  
He said : Further efforts to expand and strengthen friendly cooperation between the two countries and their militaries in all fields , and joint efforts to strike at ethnic splittism that seriously threaten the stability of relevant nations and regional security , international terrorism , religious extremist forces , and transnational criminal activities , conform to the basic interests of the two countries and their peoples , and are of great significance to safeguarding peace , stability , and development in this region .  
A Fu Tieshan-led delegation of Chinese religious leaders held a roundtable meeting in Washington today with a group of American religious people headed by ( Arthur Schneier ) , chairman of a US intuitive knowledge foundation , to exchange views on such issues as religious freedom and increasing bilateral religious cooperation and exchange in a friendly , candid manner .  
Among the religious figures , scholars , overseas Chinese , and Chinese in the United States , many people have objectively and fairly affirmed the fact that Chinese citizens enjoy freedom of religious belief .  They held : The visiting Chinese delegation of religious leaders has enhanced the American people 's understanding of freedom of religious belief in China . It has been helpful in reducing misunderstandings and has laid a new foundation for further increasing exchanges and cooperation between American and Chinese religious circles .  
After leaving the hall , Buddhist Master Shenghui , member of the Chinese religious and spiritual leaders delegation and vice president of the Buddhist Association of China , told Chinese and foreign reporters : " It was unwise for the Dalai Lama to dispatch a representative to read his letter to the Millennium World Peace Summit , though he was clever not to attend the summit .  As a result , the move has disrupted the normal process of the summit , which is not in harmony with the general atmosphere of the meeting . "  
The broad masses of national and religious people must fully understand the hypocritical and reactionary nature of the Dalai separatist clique , uphold and carry forward the fine tradition of patriotism , and firmly resist the penetration and sabotage activities carried out by hostile forces from outside the borders .  Cadres and people of all nationalities must extremely cherish and safeguard stability with a high level of political consciousness ; respect and support one another in their work and life ;  
it gained the understanding and respect of many people with a sense of justice .  He expressed the hope that the religious bodies will as always act in accordance with the principle of running their religions in an independent fashion and making their own decisions , as laid down by the constitution , strengthen their own building , cultivate talented people for international religious exchanges who love the country and their religion , actively unfold friendly exchanges with foreign countries , and further advance on the world .  
At the turn of the century , the international situation is going through profound changes .  The world is not peaceful , and various factors that threaten world peace and security have continued to exist .  Regional conflicts arising from racial , religious , and territorial disputes are on the rise , and there are complex conflicts and problems hampering the common development of countries .  
Jiang Zemin 's speech at the lunch was his only public speech to nongovernmental bodies during his trip to attend the UN Millennium Summit . The contents dealt with various aspects of Sino-US relations , including the most crucial problem , that of Taiwan ; he also dwelt at length on China 's social system , cultural background , national spirit , and social state , and elaborated on the Chinese Government 's policies on press freedom , religious freedom , strengthening the rule of law , and ethnic policy .  
After the five countries in the region gained independence in the early 1990 ' s , they banned extremist religious and nationalist political bodies and openly cracked down on extremists threatening social stability .  
This responsible person noted that ever since the true features the " Falungong " as a religious cult were revealed , over 98 percent of the " Falungong " practitioners have seen the error of their ways and are determined to make a clean break with their past .  Today , they have successfully extricated themselves from Li Hongzhi 's spiritual control , and are leading a normal life .  
In order to realize their ulterior political motives and ambitions , cults often make use of loopholes in state laws and social administration policies .  Under the cloak of religious cultivation or physical exercise , they set up very strict internal interdictions and taboos and establish among their followers illegal and rigidly stratified organizational structures in an attempt to form " secret kingdoms " based on " religious belief " outside the framework of a legal society .  
Shoko Asahara proclaimed himself to be " the sacred religious Emperor " and under him there are 21 " ministries and agencies " organized into east followers agency , west followers agency , intelligence ministry , defense agency , foreign affairs ministry , and so on .  He also drafted a so-called " the first draft basic law of the supreme truth country " and made himself the supreme ruler of the " supreme truth . "  
He expressed the hope that the youth of religious circles will carry forward and promote the fine traditions of religious personages of the older generation in loving their country and religion ; unswervingly uphold the principle of independent , autonomous , and self-run churches ; conscientiously resist the political and ideological infiltration of foreign forces through religion ; establish a good image of religious practitioners ; unite the youth of religious circles ; inspire greater enthusiasm for building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Jia Chunwang also emphatically pointed out : Chinese public security organs should resolutely crack down on sabotages schemed by Western hostile forces and elements ; resolutely crack down on illegal and criminal activities schemed by national separatists , violent terrorists , and religious forces ; and resolutely ban " Falungong " and other illegal cults and harshly crack down on their illegal and criminal activities according to law .  
Especially during the past 20 and more years since the introduction of reform and opening up , the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association and the Chinese Catholic Bishops College have cooperated with each other closely , forged ahead in unity , assisted the party and government in implementing the policy of religious freedom , pushed forward the development of patriotic organizations , vigorously nurtured middle-aged and young patriotic clerics , actively promoted democratic management of churches , striven to adapt to socialist society , and brought about progress and development in various church undertakings by leaps and bounds .  
Hong Kong Religious Organization Producing ' The Story of Jesus Christ ' CD 's [ subhead ] According to an informed customs official on the Chinese Mainland , on the eve of the coming Christmas , Chinese authorities recently notified customs offices in Guangzhou , Shenzhen and Zhuhai to watch out for the luggage of incoming motor vehicles and passengers so as to stop all CD 's with religious themes and other harmful propaganda materials from flowing into the Mainland .  
They sedulously arranged for the " Falun Gong " elements to spread the fantastic rumor about the Chinese Government 's persecution of the " Falun Gong " followers at the hearing on the so-called " human rights issues in China and Tibet , " held by the US Congress Foreign Relations Committee , and invited Li Hongzhi 's right-hand assistants and " pro-democracy " and " Tibetan independence " elements to attend the hearing on the so-called " issues of religious freedom in China , " to prepare public opinion for the anti-China proposal .  
In this struggle , the party and government have , adhering to their main objectives of defending the vital interests of the masses , protecting citizens ' freedom of religious belief and personal dignity from infringement , and maintaining social stability , banned and cracked down on the Falungong cult and their illegal activities in accordance with law and punished the handful of key Falungong elements who broke the law .  
Also attending the meeting were leaders of the central committees of all democratic parties , federations of industry and commerce , leading cadres and personages without party affiliation , personages of ethnic and religious circles living in Beijing , and responsible persons of the units under the united front system .  A total of 300 people attended the party .  
Regional conflicts sparked by ethnic , religious , territorial , resource , and other factors have continued to break out ; all kinds of splittist forces , terrorist forces , and extremist forces have continued to compromise the international community ; environmental , drug , refugee , and other global problems have become increasingly prominent .  
In view of this , we , the vast numbers of Chinese living in overseas areas , strongly demand that based on China 's relevant laws as well as the international consensus on fighting against religious cults , and for the sake of the fundamental interests of the greatest majority the Chinese people and Chinese living in overseas areas , the Chinese Government should crack down harder on the handful of ' Falungong ' members who refuse to repent and mend their way .  
The incident of people trying to burn themselves to death not only undermined the peaceful and harmonious atmosphere of the festive occasion , but also made people suddenly realize that the scourge of " Falungong " cult is no longer gesticulations with hands and feet and the muttering of incantations , but has developed into a frenzied stage of destroying oneself and others and of affecting public order and challenging the rule of law with the extreme behavior of " sacrificing one 's life for a religious cause . "  
Upon learning the collective suicidal action of some obsessed practitioners of " Falungong " at Tiananmen square , people in the religious circles were strongly shocked .  The exposed and criticized the malicious nature of " Falungong " in various forms .  
In February , 2000 , the French Government 's Interministerial Committee on Opposing Evil Cults published its annual report , explicitly defining for the first time an " evil cult " as : " An organization formed in an arbitrary way , which follows a certain religious goal ( no matter whether or not such a goal is made public ) and carries out activities harmful to human rights or social equilibrium . "  
By appropriating religious terminology in their attempts to disrupt public order , undermine social stability , defy state law , and endanger people 's lives , Li Hongzhi and the " Falungong " organization under his control have become a highly influential evil force that poses a grave danger to people and society .  Their organizational activities and roles in society are despised by all normal religious organizations that preach good deeds to people .  
China 's five major religious organizations also held a discussion meeting on 31 January to strongly condemn the heinous act of " Falungong " in killing lives .  They expressed resolute support for the Chinese Government 's severe crackdown on " Falungong " diehards in accordance with the law .  
The serious social fact that evil cults appear in the late 20th century , to a certain degree , was caused by the frequent abuse of the concept of " religious freedom " by some people with ulterior motives .  " Freedom of religious belief " has been used by some evil forces as a shield and " protective talisman " as a way to spread their influence and get away with it .  
He said , since the use of the term " religious freedom " may provide certain conducive social ideological and legal room for the development of evil cults to a certain degree , then why ca n't the international cooperation mechanisms against evil cults find a substitute term to reduce such misunderstanding and distortion ?  
It has been proven by facts in the entire process , chief executive Tung Chee-hwa , the SAR government , central institutions stationed in Hong Kong , and people from all circles have never doubted and criticized the nature and activities of other religions .  On the contrary , they have recommended upright religious activities as positive forces for stabilizing the society and guiding people toward benevolence .  
In the past five years , the 11th Panchen Lama has been accorded great kindness by high priests of Tibetan Buddhism and the worship and support of the vast number of believers .  He has received numerous local and foreign living Buddhas and high priests , held many religious meetings for the monks , and touched the heads of followers to bless them .  
Ismail Amat said : China is a country with multiple nationalities and religions .  The party and government always take the nationality and religious work seriously and have practiced a series of correct policies to handle the nationality and religious issues , so that all kinds of interests of the minority nationalities and religious followers have been safeguarded , the socialist national relationship of equality , unity , and mutual assistance has been consolidated and developed with each passing day , and various nationalities have made unceasing development and progress in the big family of the motherland .  
Now , the broad masses of people of various nationalities have clearly seen the reactionary nature of those extremist religious forces and national separatist forces , are greatly resentful against those forces , and consciously and resolutely resist those forces .  As a result , national separatist activities have been effectively restrained .  
People of religious circles expressed one after another their positive response and pledged to firmly support activities of " fighting against heretical cults by religious circles , " eradicating evil things , discarding the false and retaining the true , and making contributions to cutting out the tumor of the " Falungong cult and creating an auspicious , peaceful and happy society .  
Through visiting the United States and west Europe and receiving a number of European and US parliamentary delegations visiting China , we have continued to hold friendly and frank dialogue on the Taiwan issue , human rights , religious issues , and China 's WTO accession , thus further promoting mutual understanding and expanding consensus .  
In order to maintain the total number of general holidays ( other than Sundays ) at the present level of 17 days a year , a consultation exercise was held earlier this year , when employers ' and employees ' organisations , the financial services sector and religious bodies were asked to advise which existing general but not statutory holidays should be used to offset the new general holidays for Labour Day and the Buddha 's Birthday .  
( a ) According to the records of the Buildings Department , 864 existing privately owned buildings were completed before the Second World War , of which 11 are protected under the Antiquities and Monuments Ordinance , 144 are commercial , religious or community buildings , and 709 are residential or composite buildings .  
It was reported that the Liaison Office of the Central People 's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ( " the Liaison Office " ) asked leaders of the local Catholic diocese to adopt a low key approach in handling activities in celebration of the Vatican 's canonisation on October 1 of 120 Catholic missionaries and their followers who had been killed in China a hundred years ago .  The diocese later disclosed also that some scheduled religious exchange activities with its Mainland counterparts had been put on hold , probably due to the said canonisation .  
The quiet , elegant and exquisite court dance with her tranquil beauty reveals the royal dignity and prays for national peace .  The folk dance is naturally generated and developed from people 's religious and daily life .  It tends to be emotional and expressive , showing the joy and ecstasy of people .  
Under current policy , the normal term of newly granted land leases for educational , religious and institutional / community facilities is 50 years .  For recreational / sports facilities and private independent schools , the normal terms of new land leases are 21 years and 10 years respectively .  
Those who submitted views to us include individuals , organisations , local residents and people living outside Hong Kong . The submissions came from a wide range of sectors and strata , including district organisations , professional and business bodies , local and foreign chambers of commerce , clansmen 's groups , religious sector , businessmen , women 's groups , students , staff and faculty members of tertiary institutes , cultural and arts sector , legal sector and publication sector .  
Pastor Chou pointed out that the free translation , adoption of special literary styles such as parallelism , and the elimination of conjunctions as far as possible , have allowed the true meaning of the Bible 's religious terminology and idioms to be preserved . The manipulation of punctuation marks , verbs and direct and indirect quotations , have also helped to make the modern Chinese Bible more colloquial , simple , graceful and beautiful .  
If mental illness is involved , Lifeline can call on a panel of professional volunteers . Expert help is also available for people with social , psychological , educational , legal , nursing , medical , or religious problems .  
Offering Incense , " " Procession , " and " Watching the Show " were all taken in 1935 during a religious festival in Teng 's hometown of Peipu . In the layered effect of the pilgrims in " Offering Incense , " the smoky haze of " Procession , " and the angled viewpoint of " Watching the Show , " Teng takes a participatory yet objective approach , creating expressive , realistic works close to pure documentary .  
In fact , flowers or " sacrifices , " aside from differences in religious connotation , both contain a single heartfelt meaning . And using animals as offerings has been known in both east and west ; in China , they also carry thousands of years of unbroken tradition and symbolic meaning .  
It was only in the nineteenth century that foreign influence became so strong that things actually changed . The English and Europeans broke China open not for religious reasons but more for commercial and political reasons .  
The painstaking process of raising them , in which expense is no object , would be inconceivable in ordinary hog raising , which is aimed at economic efficiency , but religious or spiritual values can never be measured in terms of economic efficiency .  
Community cultural activities will be held regularly during weekends or vacations . A spirit of good neighborliness is sure to prevail , and mutual assistance within an interdependent entity will become common . In collaboration with religious and civic bodies , the government will endeavor to foster and encourage ethical norms which are in conformity with our present-day society , itself a product of popular customs and mores blended with traditional rites and ceremonies .  
In traditional China there was a strong emphasis on the here and now , and among the upper classes ancestor worship tended to be functional rather than religious in nature . The same naturally held true among the lower classes , where for ordinary people with little familiarity with classical writings ancestor worship was seen in terms of personal gain .  
Among the traditional yi-chen , some which have particularly compelling singing , genuine religious significance , or functions of bonding people orbuilding healthier bodies , have been promoted in primary and middle schools . For example , the Sung Chiang chen , which stresses unity , and the Cart Drum chen , with its athletic movements , are both being passed on in a number of schools .  
The amount and scale of temple festivals today and the number of believers taking part is very unlike what happened during the " modern scientism " of the 1960s and ' 70s , when people expected there to be no trace of them in the metropolis and hardly anything in the countryside . On the contrary , pilgrimages , foundation services , festivals and religious activities to ward off disasters have all been encouraged by officials and public alike , so that there is now a flourishing in both cities and villages .  
Wu is the executive director of the foundation and its painful opening announcement was like a short summary of his work : " The Chinese Communists established the reform-through-labor brigades some 40 years ago . Their inmates still include so-called counter-revolutionaries , class enemies , those deemed to be against the party and socialism , religious figures , " historical " counter-revolutionaries and members of the Tienanmen democracy movement .  
Besides the merely religious activities of praying for good fortune , the temple has celebrations linked to the season . From Chinese New Year 's to the Sea Goddess ' birthday in March , there is a continuous stream of activities , including classical dances to welcome the God of Happiness and ceremonies welcoming Matsu as well as such traditional farming and fishing activities as the dying of fish nets , chanting to count fish fry , walking the water wheel , grabbing chickens and floating on bamboo rafts to grab ducks .  
At present 25% of the national budget goes for defense and the military ; 20% goes toward economic development ; routine government administrative costs account for 10% ; 15% is applied to education . . . . The remaining few percent is up for grabs among public health , agriculture , social welfare , religious , and other interests , naturally leading to the " squeezing out " effect .  
The Han dynasty ( 206 BC - 220 AD ) had an official charged with rearing the emperor 's hunting dogs , and in the Tang dynasty ( 618-9O7 ) there was even a special imperial kennels which raised hunting dogs for the emperor . Long ago , primitive men had dances imitating animals . The " dance of the hundred beasts " was not a performance using real animals as in a circus , but a religious ritual dance similar to the annual nuowu dances to drive out evil .  
For 30 years , Sanyi sold its products for export , but later Taiwan 's withdrawal from the United Nations and the international energy crisis brought a decline . Over the last decade , with a booming stock market and economic development , there has been an excellent market within Taiwan , especially for carvings of religious figures such as Maitreya Buddha , which are seen as symbols of prosperity by local people .  
For instance , some factories only carve all kinds of Bodhidarma figures , while others specialize in human figures , or birds and animals , and so on . " Collective creation on a production line " is also a widespread method . To take a religious statue as an example , after the rough wooden blank has been cut out , the carving of its face , hands , curves and background , the application of gold leaf and other operations are all the responsibility of different specialists .  
They tore down the Matsu Temple , which was the center of religious life in Taipei , and built Kodama Goto Memorial Hall ( honoring the fourth Governor-General Kodama Gentaro and Senior Minister Goto Shinpei ) . Western classical music was played on the hall 's open-air stage all day long . All sorts of celebrations were also held here , as was the incomparably famous World Expo .  
Although not distinguished for their size , Taiwan 's rivers did at least once run with water that was clear , and like major rivers elsewhere they played a central part in daily life . People rose with the dawn and retired at dusk , relying on rivers to supply drinking water , facilitate transport and answer religious needs , and so there was a bond that tied society to the river .  
Such " objective methods " may make hypnosis more acceptable to the general public , but they also limit it to shallower depths . Wang Wu-shih pays special attention to the depth to which Eastern religious devotees delve " to awaken to the truth " : " When people repeatedly enter the subconscious to explore , their quest goes beyond the level of treating emotional problems and disease to probing at the very nature of life . "  
He viewed his patient 's emotional and physical state sparked by painful past experiences as a kind of " unusual mental power . " Wang is the first to employ the powers of mental projection , determination and imagination as used by Eastern religious devotees to deal with these " negative energies . "  
Europeans had been fascinated with the legendary beauty of the Orient ever since Marco Polo 's diaries of the 13th century and the spread of stories about the splendor of Japan 's golden temples and religious statuary . Intrepid explorers and businessmen took their crews across the vast oceans to the mythical " golden isles " of the Far East .  
Chiang Kuan-feng feels that on this occasion the issuing of invitations was " broad and deep . " Equal attention was given to the central government and the localities ; professional , religious , and social groups were all included ; and even overseas Chinese were given as fair a distribution of RSVPs as possible . As for how many people could or would come , it was hard to say . The only thing to do was keep calling the contact people for each group and ask , " What will your attendance rate be ? "  
To attract followers , such groups employ methods of " intensive instruction , therapy and guidance , an isolated environment , and worship of the religious leader , " which are akin to brainwashing techniques . These cause people to identify with the doctrine and ceremonies of the religion , so that believers fully believe themselves to be acting of their own free will . Yet outsiders find their behavior inexplicable . The end result is tragedy , with society paying enormous costs .  
Against this background , Huang advises that it is inappropriate for students , lacking experience in society and with immature minds , to be allowed to participate in long-termed , closed activities like the summer camp . Moreover , he suggests , the government should regulate all religious activities that do not follow general practice or common sense . Otherwise , it is not impossible that similar crises of family and social ethics will again occur .  
Minister of Justice Liao , fully engaged in the campaign to crack down on illegal behavior in all areas of life , suggests that the Sung case shows the serious extent of the penetration of religious groups by criminal gangs ; this has already become part of his professional territory . Taipei City Mayor Chen Shui-bian also announced a crackdown on criminally connected shrines to begin on October 15 .  
He observes that according to statistics , nearly 13% of people in the US have some sort of mental disorder . This clearly illustrates the famous words of Jesus Christ : " Man does not live by bread alone . " The ancient religious practices of meditation and contemplating the impermanence of life can positively help modern people , who are undergoing immense changes in social relations and also witnessing rapid transformations both at work and their private lives .  
Many people set themselves up as great religious masters , but their actions are quite at odds with their own teachings , " Sogyal Rinpoche says . He says a real master must be of a certain " lineage " through which teachings are transmitted to him . He must have a flawless character , and most importantly , has to be " selfless , " " compassionate " and " wise . " If people observe carefully , they should be able to tell the difference .  
He compares how in both Mayan culture ( or the New World generally ) and Chinese culture ( or the Old World generally ) , the newly arising class societies were based on religious ritual . Their highly developed writing systems and beautiful sacrificial objects were used in the service of religion and politics , whereas the tools they used for material production had not advanced beyond the stone implements used in prehistoric times .  
After a trip abroad , he discovered that Chinese Muslims had little understanding of their own religion 's doctrines , and were in dire need of an accurate Qur'an and other materials for interpreting it . He thus spent more than 20 years translating three Chinese texts altogether : one in classical Chinese , one in jingtangwen ( an old form with specific religious terms left in their original form , that is , not translated into a common equivalent ) , and one in the vernacular .  
The problem is that we label aboriginal traditions as " ecologically wise " based on modern concepts of resource management developed in the industrialized world . But aboriginal culture is not some theory , but a practical way of life . It is a community culture produced through countless generations coexisting with nature , and includes a full complement of religious , ethical and social beliefs and values .  
For the mass of ordinary people , who are impatient and full of worldly desires , the idea of heaven as an essentially illusory mental state achieved by self-cultivation is abstruse and complex , and the continuous , unrelenting effort required to enter such a state is both hard to understand and hard to achieve . Thus it is understandable that a " heaven " in which religious concepts are simplified and popularized is preferred by proselytizers .  
From Laozi it borrows the concepts of non-action , clear understanding , and acting in harmony with nature . From Zhuangzi come the concepts of total freedom and life-for-the-fun-of-it . Combining these concepts , religious Daoism holds that in order to become an immortal , one must be free of joy and anger , eliminate desire , live in quietude and non-action , maintain primitive simplicity , and act in harmony with the natural laws of the universe .  
Chao Ko-shih has seen an even more ridiculous example . One powerful and wealthy old man died from cancer , but because his children had different religious beliefs and each wanted to put on impressive and stately funerals , he ended up with five different ceremonies . The Protestants , Catholics , Buddhists and Taoists each had at least one go at it . When a ceremony ended , they would give him a shot of embalming fluid , put him back in the freezer and wait for the next time !  
In addition to the towering bronze statue , the two burial pits also contained 57 bronze heads . Sharp lines delineate big , protruding eyes and tightly closed lips . While each of these figures was used in religious rites , the air of religious intensity in each face is hidden behind a mask .  
Says Mei : " This is where the Jesuits established the first Western-type university in the Far East , while Chinese scholars such as Hong Xiuquan , Lin Zexu , Liang Qichao , Kang Youwei and Cheng Guanying spent time here absorbing Western learning . " Macau emerged unscathed from WWII , and many of its original Portuguese-language documents have been preserved intact , providing an invaluable resource for research into cultural and religious exchanges between East and West .  
Huang Ming-chuan , who studied law before he began making movies , has come to be seen as the standard-bearer for independent films in Taiwan . Flat Tire , which he completed two years ago , tells the story of a pair of documentary makers traveling around Taiwan to film the island 's religious and political statuary . ( photo by Pu Hua-chih )  
Santa Claus and the department stores team up to hoodwink innocent , trusting little children , and the original religious meaning of Christmas has been replaced by a superficial " eat , drink , and be merry " approach to the holidays . This has happened because industrialized society is pulling away from its agrarian roots .  
Relations with the mainland at the highest political level have reached impasse after impasse , and dark war clouds gather over the Taiwan Strait ; yet at the grassroots level , what with trade links , fishing links and intermarriage , the people are inseparably intermingled , and the same is true on the academic , cultural and religious fronts and even in the entertainment and travel industries .  
" Perhaps the more innovative , secular forms of music are not best for inspiring profound religious sentiments . But as a means of entertainment , music can at least soften the forbidding impression that many people have of Buddhism . It is a convenient way of guiding people towards salvation . "  
Scripture includes an account of Buddha telling a nearby monk to stop reciting his texts in a singsong fashion . Sutras had to be intoned , not sung , and there was none of the melodic , rhythmic type of incantation that is heard in temples today . Members of the clergy were not allowed to take part in the music that worshippers presented by way of devotional offering , and the religious code prohibited monks and nuns from watching musical performances .  
According to Chang Sung-jen , an art critic who acts as Ju Ming 's agent , " Tai ji quan involves a force that is from beyond the realm of ordinary human experience , and art that focuses on this subject could very nearly be categorized as religious art . The people motif , on the other hand , is about the commonplace . " To deal with the subject of tai ji quan takes boldness and vigor , while sculpting people requires great attention to detail and very good technical skill .  
This visit , which has been called " soft diplomacy , " breaks the previous mold of focusing on political and economic power . Instead , the vice president 's delegation included members of the cultural , religious , and scientific communities , and elected officials as well .  
Fourth , they established organized systems of religious practice . Examples are clerics such as Hui Neng , sixth patriarch of Chan Buddhism , Master Xian Shou , who founded the Huayan Sect in the Tang dynasty , and Master Zhi Zhe , who enabled the Tiantai Sect to spread far and wide . A final characteristic of the most distinctive figures in Buddhism is that their stories were avidly related by later generations .  
For example Master Hui Neng , despite being illiterate , was known for his skill at literary discussion and the composition of religious verse . It was Hui Neng who left his cassock on a rock atop Dayu Ridge , from where the monk who was following him was unable to move it . The external actions of those who had attained enlightenment often strayed into the realm of what for normal people would be " miracles . "  
It 's fortunate , then , that the instructors at the leadership education camps put on in Taiwan this past year included figures beyond the usual line-up of political leaders featured at events sponsored by political parties . Some instructors at the camps were religious leaders and others were people making their marks in such areas as social welfare , community education or environmental protection .  
The growing number of leadership training activities sponsored by Taiwan NGOs mix personal development with professional skills enhancement , religious training , volunteerism and political reform . These programs can help charismatic leaders who are both politically involved and morally upstanding to become greater forces for good . Amid growing cultural diversity , only a new kind of leader with broader , more holistic values will be able to create frameworks suitable to the new era .  
Sadly , development is causing the diversity of Taiwan 's wetlands to decline rapidly .

Persons of all categories and walks of life and all ages - peasant farmers executives and militant members of political parties , government agents , medical and paramedical personnel , and lay and religious persons - were killed in atrocious ways in the bloodthirsty madness which caused the people of Burundi enormous suffering and which can not in any way be justified .

The effective elimination of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia , " ethnic cleansing " and religious and other forms of intolerance requires concerted efforts by the entire international community : Governments , United Nations programmes and agencies , and regional and non-governmental organizations .  
Unsolved problems relating to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities are widely recognized as a major source of international and internal conflicts involving widespread human rights violations .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of racial violence , continue to persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Reaffirms that the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action is the sovereign right of every country , in accordance with its national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its peoples and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights ;  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the universal nature of which is beyond question .  
Ensure that the rights of persons belonging to national , ethnic and other minorities are protected , and that such persons are able to pursue economic and social development and live in circumstances of full respect for their identity , traditions , forms of social organization and cultural and religious values .  
The Working Group considers that participation should be extended to indigenous peoples and to ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , youth and children and that the elderly should also be considered as active agents in all the processes of formulation , implementation and monitoring of development programmes .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the universal nature of which is beyond question .  
Ensure that the rights of persons belonging to national , ethnic and other minorities are protected , and that such persons are able to pursue economic and social development and live in circumstances of full respect for their identity , traditions , forms of social organization and cultural and religious values .

Strongly urges the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) to take appropriate measures to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms and to take urgent action to ensure the rule of law in order to prevent arbitrary evictions and dismissals and discrimination against any ethnic or national , religious , and linguistic group , including in the fields of education and information ;

that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole of the States in which such persons live ,  
concerned that , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , the rights violated on religious grounds include the right to life , the right to physical integrity and to liberty and security of person , the right to freedom of expression , the right not to be subjected to torture or other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , and the right not to be arbitrarily arrested or detained ,  
Expresses its grave concern at any attack upon religious places , sites and shrines , and calls upon all States , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to exert utmost efforts to ensure that such places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected ;  
with deep concern reports of grave human rights violations in the Sudan , particularly summary executions , detentions without trial , forced displacement of persons and torture , as described in reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , and the Special Rapporteur on the question of religious intolerance ,  
pointed out that the resolution mentioned above had been adopted on an initiative of the Sudan , motivated by its concern for the situation of more than 20,000 children who had been sequestered by the insurgent movement in the south of the country , which used them as explosives carriers , human shields in minefields and as a military reserve , a situation which was intolerable since it violated religious and humane principles .

Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development and the environment , as well as other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to increase their involvement in formal and non-formal education in human rights and to cooperate with the High Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights in implementing the Plan of Action ;

Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , including through the facilitation of their full participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development in their country ;  
concerned that , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , the rights violated on religious grounds include the right to life , the right to physical integrity and to liberty and security of person , the right to freedom of expression , the right not to be subjected to torture or other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , and the right not to be arbitrarily arrested or detained ,  
Expresses its grave concern at any attack upon religious places , sites and shrines , and calls upon all States , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to exert utmost efforts to ensure that such places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected ;  
Strongly urges the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) to take appropriate measures to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms and to take urgent action to ensure the rule of law in order to prevent arbitrary evictions and dismissals and discrimination against any ethnic or national , religious and linguistic group , including in the fields of education and information ;  
gravely concerned , however , at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including killings of civilians , arbitrary arrest and detention , restrictions on freedoms of expression and association , torture , forced labour , forced portering , human rights abuses in border areas in the course of military operations , forced relocations and development projects , abuse of women and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
with deep concern reports of grave human rights violations in the Sudan , particularly summary executions , detentions without trial and forced displacement of persons and torture , as described in reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , and the Special Rapporteur on the question of religious intolerance ,  
the past year , there had been increasing reports of slavery and forced labour of women and children belonging to racial , ethnic and religious minorities ; of atrocities against indigenous peoples ; of indiscriminate aerial bombardments against civilian targets , and of unaccompanied minors being conscripted into military service .  
Government looked to the Chinese Government to take specific steps to conform to international human rights norms , including releasing persons detained solely for the peaceful expression of their opinions and preserving the unique cultural , linguistic and religious heritage of Tibet .  
Despite the end of the cold war , regional , religious and ethnic disputes are being further aggravated in various parts of our planet , and consequently world peace and security are gravely disturbed and peoples are suffering from untold misfortunes resulting from them .  
Any government , institution or individual seeking to promote human rights should bear in mind the significance of national and regional peculiarities as well as historical , cultural and religious backgrounds and the stage of economic development .  
National chauvinism ; ethnic intolerance ; racial , economic and religious discrimination ; ethnic cleansing ; and acts of violence and repression against an entire population characteristic features of Serb policy were demonstrated for the first time in Kosovo .  
In this setting of globalization and interdependence , the United Nations with its universal composition , its agglutinative structure that brings together countries at the most varied levels of human development and ethnic or religious composition , its institutional capacity to act as a point of articulation or a sounding board for all concerns or aspirations that extend beyond the local , national or regional level would be in an ideal position to play a leading and decisive role .  
Even though misunderstandings and aggressions appear on one continent or another , based on deep-seated racial , religious or political hatred , and leading to genocide or local wars , we can not speak of a conflagration , especially when the will of the people of all regions rises above these wars , committed to the restoration of peace .  
Latin America , born unaware of racial hatred , religious conflicts and territorial greed , with an indivisible spirit made up of a combination of influences that move in the same direction on the freest and broadest of stages , is hurt by the fact that its real problems today are social ones , brought on by the error of political regimes that ignored the discipline of education or doubted its undeniable primacy . 
Society must be firmly rooted in the rule of law , democratic participation , gender equality , the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by all , social justice , tolerance , respect for ethnic , religious and cultural diversity , and meeting the requirements of groups with specific needs , such as young and older people , as well as people with disabilities .  
It is therefore with great apprehension that we note a proliferation of regional conflicts , social and economic collapse in some of our countries , environmental decay , and the coming of new scourges such as transnational crime , drug trafficking , a rising wave of criminality , racial disturbances , xenophobia , and religious and cultural intolerance . 
We need to close ranks to meet the major challenges that can face democracy , such as poverty and all it entails , the spectre of ethnic conflict , illicit drug trafficking , international terrorism , religious fanaticism , the spread of the AIDS pandemic , the ravages of malaria , and so forth .  
Thus the Government of Jordan , in order to maintain the Holy City 's special religious , cultural and historic character , has taken a strong interest in continuing its custodianship of the holy places so as to protect them from all dangers until the desired final status is achieved .  
Any new concept needs to be accompanied by an information , education and communication ( IEC ) strategy to make people aware of its content and implications - all the more so if this new concept involves , as does the concept of reproductive rights and reproductive health , many aspects , ranging from sociocultural factors - cultural beliefs and practices , status of women , overall health and well-being , religious convictions and ethical values - to economic conditions .  
For the concepts of reproductive rights and reproductive health to be implemented at the local level , they need be integrated into existing social , political and religious structures and thus become part of the complex fabric of society .  
The proper way to respond to attitudes of reservation regarding religious freedom was through patient and resolute dialogue , based on facts and the participation of all parties concerned , operating in the framework of internationally established norms and seeking to determine possible action and to plan for the longer term .  
The training programme for trainers in civic and human rights education begun by MICIVIH would be expanded substantially to involve non-governmental organizations working in adult education , elected government officials at all levels , popular and peasant organizations , women 's associations , religious institutions and the formal education sector .  
If all those conditions , which were currently unacceptable and flouted the dignity of the human being , were to be eradicated , it was essential to create a framework for social development founded on a spirit of cooperation and participation which would take into account the cultural , historical , religious and economic characteristics and the priorities for social development of each country . 
The representative of Norway had said that one of the most difficult challenges facing the international community was the question of ensuring respect for the rights of persons belonging to ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities , while guaranteeing the territorial integrity and political independence of States .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of racial violence , persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Aware of the importance of a human rights culture and of the need to strengthen the democratic process , her Government had implemented a series of legislative , administrative and educational measures recommended by the advisory committee on human rights , a national body established in 1990 , which was composed of representatives of the entire political , social and religious spectrum of Moroccan society .  
The draft resolution failed to take account of the fact that no single political system or electoral process was suited to all nations and peoples and that political systems were subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors .  
Resolutions of those organs have drawn the attention of Governments , the United Nations system and the general public to those problems and have called for action with regard to extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , impunity , racism and xenophobia , discrimination against women , ethnic and religious intolerance , mass exoduses and refugee flows , armed conflicts and terrorism , and lack of the rule of law as major obstacles to human rights .  
The effective elimination of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia , " ethnic cleansing " and religious and other forms of intolerance requires concerted efforts by the entire international community : Governments , United Nations programmes and agencies , and regional and non-governmental organizations .  
Unsolved problems relating to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities are widely recognized as a major source of international and internal conflicts involving widespread human rights violations .  
In the light of the definition contained in article 1 , the United Kingdom 's ratification is subject to the understanding that none of its obligations under the Convention shall be treated as extending to the succession to , or possession and enjoyment of , the Throne , the peerage , titles of honour , social precedence or armorial bearings , or as extending to the affairs of religious denominations or orders or to the admission into or service in the Armed Forces of the Crown .  
[ Civil , ethnic and religious strife , nuclear armament , armed conflicts , alien and colonial domination , foreign occupation , international economic imbalance , coercive economic measures , poverty , organized crime , and terrorism in all its forms are destructive to sustainable human settlements development and should therefore be renounced by all States . ]  
In addition , such human settlements provide equal opportunity for a productive and freely chosen livelihood ; equal access to economic resources , including the right to inheritance , the ownership of land and other property , credit , natural resources and appropriate technologies ; for personal , spiritual , religious , cultural and social development ; for participation in public decision-making ; for equal rights and obligations with regard to the conservation and use of natural and cultural resources ; and equal access to mechanisms to ensure that rights are not violated .  
Objectives of this endeavour include protecting public health , providing for safety and security conditions , education , and social integration , promoting equality , respect for diversity and cultural identities , increased accessibility for persons with disabilities , and preservation of historic , spiritual , religious and culturally significant buildings and districts , respecting local landscapes and treating the local environment with respect and care .  
The sustainability of the global environment and human life will not be achieved unless , among other things , human settlements in both urban and rural areas are made economically buoyant , socially vibrant and environmentally sound , with full respect for cultural , religious and natural heritage and diversity .  
Recognizing that the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action is the sovereign right of every country , in accordance with its national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its peoples and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights ,  
Recognizing also that there is no single political system or single universal model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples , and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development and the environment , as well as other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to increase their involvement in formal and non-formal education in human rights and to cooperate with the High Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
Affirming that effective measures and the creation of favourable conditions for the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , ensuring effective non-discrimination and equality for all , contribute to the prevention and peaceful solution of human rights problems and situations involving minorities ,  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole of the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , including through the facilitation of their full participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development in their country ;  
Deeply concerned that , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , the rights violated on religious grounds include the right to life , the right to physical integrity and to liberty and security of person , the right to freedom of expression , the right not to be subjected to torture or other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , and the right not to be arbitrarily arrested or detained ,  
Expresses its grave concern at any attack upon religious places , sites and shrines , and calls upon all States , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to exert utmost efforts to ensure that such places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected ;  
Strongly urges the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) to take appropriate measures to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms and to take urgent action to ensure the rule of law in order to prevent arbitrary evictions and dismissals and discrimination against any ethnic or national , religious and linguistic group , including in the fields of education and information ;  
Also gravely concerned , however , at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including killings of civilians , arbitrary arrest and detention , restrictions on freedom of expression and association , torture , forced labour , forced portering , human rights abuses in border areas in the course of military operations , forced relocations and development projects , abuse of women and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Noting with deep concern reports of grave human rights violations in the Sudan , particularly summary executions , detentions without trial , forced displacement of persons and torture , as described in reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on the question of religious intolerance ,  
There were also concerns , however , that the new technologies would lead to growing social and economic gaps and injustice , and would threaten cultural diversity , religious values and even individual freedom ; there was therefore a need to study ways to make the new technologies widely accessible and supportive of sustainable development .  
Full account had to be taken of economic conditions ; social , ethnic , cultural , religious or legal situations ; conjugal circumstances ; the nature and type of relations characterized by violence ; and conditions of political persecution , social oppression , racial discrimination and unequal economic development , as well as violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
Perceived potential costs of illicit drug use include the possible health effects of acute or chronic toxicity ; the risk of arrest and punishment ; the effect on academic or career performance ; the danger , if caught , of being expelled from school or losing a job ; the risk of resultant stigma attached to the label of illicit drug user ; and individual feelings of guilt about defying parents , the law or a religious code .  
In the face of these serious challenges to the peace process , we call upon the Security Council to take effective and practical measures that would ensure the realization of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people ; the cessation of the policy of aggression , settlement and Judaization of Jerusalem ; the preservation of its cultural , religious and material heritage , and demographic composition ; and the lifting of the siege against the Palestinian villages and cities .  
The two sides are in favour of the continued promotion of friendly exchanges among the people of various countries so as to enhance mutual understanding and confidence , and are against stirring up national , ethnic and religious conflicts .  
The Acting Director commented that translating complex concepts which were condensed in one word , as in the case of " gender " or " empowerment " , required adequate understanding of the cultural , economic , religious , social and political circumstances of different countries . 
We declare that we shall support any steps undertaken by leaders at all levels , politicians , and representatives of parties , movements and diverse religious denominations with a view to strengthening international accord and peace in the Caucasus by increasing cultural , scientific , humanitarian and other contacts and promoting the ideas of democracy and social progress .  
With regard to the religious and ethnic violence prompted by the failure of the Indonesian Government to resolve the social , political and economic issues that lay at the heart of the human rights problems , three major riots had taken place in 1995 .  The first and last had been sparked by deliberate acts of incitement against Catholicism , the dominant religion in East Timor .  
Ethnic and religious tensions between Timorese and Indonesians had increased ; mass immigration of Indonesians into the territory of East Timor was continuing ; cases of torture , arbitrary detention , attacks , summary executions , disappearances and killings were becoming increasingly common ; the numbers and violence of the military and police forces were increasing , and many Timorese , especially young people , had become strangers in their own land and had been forced to seek asylum . 
The third conclusion was that the underlying causes of the eruption of violent incidents and episodes had not been removed : political rights and fundamental freedoms continued to be suppressed and religious tensions and the immigration of Indonesians into the Territory were putting in jeopardy the cultural , religious and social identity of East Timor .  
The Islamic State of Afghanistan has expressed many times through official notes , declarations and in the course of official contacts its sincere desire to broaden its ties of friendship based on religious , linguistic , historical , cultural and good-neighbourly relations between our two brotherly countries .  
This reflects varying economic , environmental , social , cultural and religious values and needs , which operate within legal and policy frameworks usually specific to individual countries .  
This includes the right to maintain , protect and develop the past , present and future manifestations of their cultures , such as archaeological and historical sites , artifacts , designs , ceremonies , technologies and visual and performing arts and literature , as well as the right to the restitution of cultural , intellectual , religious and spiritual property taken without their free and informed consent or in violation of their traditions and customs , as well as the law of the State concerned .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the universal nature of which is beyond question .  
Massive or persistent violations of human rights , often the result of ethnic , racial or religious tensions or unequal access to power and basic necessities of life will continue to endanger international peace and security and to hamper economic and social development .  
Second , it accepted the principle that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes were in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that might be invoked to justify them . 
Communal violence , understood as acts of violence committed by one ethnic , religious , linguistic , national or social group against another group , was reported in Bangladesh , Burundi , Cameroon , Chad , Djibouti , Mali , Nigeria and Somalia . Government forces are often said to support one side in the conflict or even instigate hostilities , rather than intervene to stop violence between different groups .  
One of the most prevalent targets of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions continues to be persons involved in struggles , such as those to secure rights to land or to prevent or combat racial , ethnic or religious discrimination and ensure respect for social , cultural , economic , civil and political rights . 
Violations of human rights remain extremely serious , including , in particular , the practice of torture , summary and arbitrary executions , forced labour , including forced portering for the military , abuse of women , politically motivated arrests and detention , forced displacement , serious restrictions on the freedoms of expression and association , and the imposition of oppressive measures directed , in particular , at ethnic and religious minority groups ;  
The latter convention calls for the immediate and complete abolition of forced labour in the following five forms : as a measure of coercion or political education ; as a measure of mobilization for purposes of economic development ; as a sanction for having participated in strikes ; and as a measure of racial , social , national or religious discrimination .  
In accordance with article 1 of the Code , these include industrial , trade and agricultural establishments and their dependencies , of whatever nature , whether public or private , religious or secular , even if they are of a professional or charitable nature ; liberal professions , craft establishments , cooperatives , civil law partnerships , unions , associations and groupings of any kind .  
While the State bears the cost of wages and supplementary social charges for no fewer than 14 days when work is suspended ( decree No . 1447 of 31 December 1987 ) , to enable public officials to celebrate a variety of religious , political and social holidays , private enterprises would find it difficult to support such charges , which place a substantial burden on production costs .  
This means that the State , the guardian of children 's right to education , must establish the necessary legal structures and instruments to ensure the comprehensive realization of the objectives and principles assigned to education and provide effective guarantees of the protection of children against the various covert or open practices by which some people uncover in children extremely fertile ground for ideological or religious indoctrination . 
A renewed commitment by all involved in organized society , political parties , religious groups , communal groups , law enforcement agencies , to eschew resort to criminal violence in pursuit of their objectives needs to be declared and implemented .  
The Government of Mauritius stated that the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities were guaranteed through a combination of constitutional provisions , which were fully compatible with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , statutory legislation and common law .  
It was emphasized that the establishment and maintenance of unimpeded contacts among persons belonging to a national minority , as well as contacts across frontiers by persons belonging to a national minority with persons with whom they share a common ethnic or national origin , cultural heritage or religious belief , contributes to mutual understanding and promotes good neighbourly relations .  
The Armed Forces High Command was urged to take concrete measures aimed at protecting and promoting the rights of persons belonging to minorities by eliminating discrimination against the members of minority groups and taking positive administrative steps to ensure that the armed forces were genuinely representative of the national community in their ethnic , linguistic , religious , regional and national composition .  
Those included activities using the education for development approach in the areas of advocacy and training ; research studies by the International Child Development Centre in Florence , Italy ; workshops that addressed issues of religious , ethnic and cultural discrimination ; and dissemination of the Convention on the Rights of the Child to the public in numerous local languages .  
In a number of cases , Special Rapporteurs , appointed by United Nations human rights organs to investigate human rights situations in specific regions and countries , and on thematic issues , have addressed the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities within their mandates or have been confronted with violations of the rights of persons belonging to minorities .  
He stated that none of the criteria used to define ethnic groups or national minorities were applicable to Burundi , since for centuries Hutus and Tutsis had occupied the same geographical area , shared the same religious beliefs and spoken the same language .  
On the matter of internal deportations and forced relocations , the Special Rapporteur concluded that government policies violated the freedoms of movement and residence and , in some cases , constitute discriminatory practices based on ethnic or religious affiliations .  
The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , Mr . Bacre Waly Ndiaye , in his report ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 4 ) referred to a number of cases that had come before him in 1995 , in which it was alleged that the victims subjected to death threats or extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions belonged to national , ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities .  
The Greek Ministry of Justice reported that the Greek Constitution and legislation fully safeguard both equality in the enjoyment of fundamental individual and social rights and freedoms for all citizens irrespective of race , colour , religion and ethnic or national origin ( art . 5 ) , and freedom of religious conscience .  
A penal component , prohibiting any racial , ethnic or religious discrimination against an individual or community and strengthening the penalties to be handed down on conviction for racist offences by adding deprivation of civil rights for 5 to 10 years ;  
Since many questions and misunderstandings surround the definitions and content of the terminologies of sects , new religious movements and even formal religion and since in international practice confusion reigns and States may have diametrically opposed attitudes to the same group , raising it to formal religious status or pejoratively classifying it as a sect , the Special Rapporteur feels that an international high-level governmental conference should be held to study and decide upon a common approach to sects and religions that respects human rights . 
On a different level , it is of fundamental importance that places of worship should be reserved for religious , non-political uses , that the legal system governing political parties should be defined in such a way as to avoid political variables impinging on religious constants , and that schools should be protected from all ideological , political or partisan indoctrination .  
The outcome of the Fourth World Conference on Women had met the desire of the international community for a comprehensive programme of collective international action to change the prevailing situation of women in many parts of the world while taking account of the religious concepts and principles and the spiritual values that played a major role in the lives of peoples and in ensuring their stability .  
Mr . BAALI ( Algeria ) said that the origin of the dramatic events currently taking place in the world lay , even more than in colonialism and the disintegration of communism , in the resurgence of violence provoked by the exacerbation of nationalistic , ethnic , religious and tribal sentiments and fed by foreign intervention . 
Any church or place for religious assembly built and operated without authorization is liable to be closed and put under seal and those responsible for the " illegal " installation may be prosecuted , imprisoned and required to pay a substantial fine .  
According to the governmental delegates , the State and its legislation , while recognizing the dominant , but not overwhelming , role of the Orthodox Church , which represents the religion of the majority of the population for historical , national and traditional reasons , are said to provide a climate of religious freedom , notwithstanding isolated cases of intolerance or discrimination , in particular in the administration .  
This singling out of the Jehovah 's Witnesses is almost certainly due to their religious militancy , which is expressed through proselytism , conscientious objection to military service and a variety of public demonstrations which call into question the interests of the dominant Church and the legislative and political system of the State .  
Overall , the Special Rapporteur urges all parties concerned , official and otherwise , national and foreign , to calm rather than exacerbate religious problems , thereby ensuring that religion is not subject to political intrusion and exploitation and that constants are not affected by political variables .  
While underlining that the law was applied without religious discrimination and with respect for the rights of non-Muslims , Mr . Turabi explained that consumption of alcohol was not a crime in the southern states , while in the north it was authorized for non-Muslims in private and forbidden in public .  
According to unofficial reports , non-Muslims outside the southern states have been found guilty of and punished for religious offences based on Islam ( hudud ) , especially for failing to observe the Islamic dress code and the prohibition of the sale or consumption of alcohol .  
According to numerous non-governmental observers , the authorities had usurped the religious sphere , claiming that they alone were in possession of divine truth , and had perverted religion by politically exploiting Islam in order to secure their grip on power and enforce their authority through religious and political persecution and totalitarian methods , in complete contrast to the historically tolerant Muslim heritage of the Sudan .  
The attacks are alleged to result from the central Government 's official policy imposing " its truth regarding Islam on an erroneous local version of Islam " and therefore to have religious legitimacy , as demonstrated by , inter alia , the fatwa of April 1992 ( see para .  122 ) .  
On the subject of protection of the individual , the Special Rapporteur earnestly hopes that restrictions on the freedom of movement of religious officials will be lifted and that the campaigns of harassment and intimidation directed against them , which are also prejudicial to their followers , will cease , thus enabling the Muslim brotherhoods to realize their full potential without fear , constraint or self-censorship , subject , of course , to respect for public order and the law and the avoidance of violence , extremism and obscurantism .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , continue to persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
The Contracting States shall ensure that their national laws recognize that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are under any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them .  
Resurgent nationalism and the rejection of religious , cultural , ethnic and ideological diversity were being expressed in ethnic conflict , growing violence and the proliferation of racist and xenophobic practices in various parts of the world .  
He was satisfied with the definition of crimes against humanity , which was based on the notion that there was no nexus between that category of crimes and a state of war , and was especially pleased that institutionalized discrimination on racial , ethnic or religious grounds was included in that category . 
Please provide information on the measures adopted , including at the legislative , administrative , educational , budgetary and social levels , to ensure that a child belonging to an ethnic , religious or linguistic minority or who is indigenous is not denied the right , in community with other members of his or her group :  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
Expresses its grave concern at any attack upon religious places , sites and shrines , and calls upon all States , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to exert utmost efforts to ensure that such places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected ;  
The rich diversity of nations ' historical , cultural , religious , social and economic backgrounds must be respected and their different priorities recognized .  
Noting with deep concern reports of grave human rights violations in the Sudan , in particular summary executions , detentions without trial , forced displacement of persons and torture , as described in reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , and the Special Rapporteur on the question of religious intolerance ,  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education ;  
The main principles of his Government 's policy in that area were to ensure equality of constitutional rights and freedoms to all citizens , to strengthen legal safeguards against discrimination , extremism and intolerance , to promote mutual trust among ethnic groups and respect for their language and cultures , and to create conditions that would enable all citizens to express their ethnic , cultural and religious identities freely . 
The overwhelming peaceful demands of the Kashmiris for self-determination in the disputed territory , which had never been a part of India , were not a matter of religious extremism , terrorism or secession , as India maintained , but could be satisfied only by the holding of the plebiscite advocated by the international community , for which the universally denounced sham elections recently held by India were no substitute .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;

Gravely concerned at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , killings of civilians , torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , deaths in custody , absence of due process of law , severe restrictions on freedoms of opinion , expression , assembly and association , violations of freedom of movement , forced relocation , forced labour and portering and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Calls upon the Government of Myanmar and other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully the obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , [ 117 ] to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population and to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law , and to avail itself of such services as may be offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;

The main victims of this trend are racial , ethnic , national , linguistic and religious minorities , migrant workers , foreigners and indigenous populations .  
These should fully recognize the ecological , social , cultural and [ religious ] [ spiritual ] values of forests [ and pay particular attention to global dimensions of climate change and the sustainable use , conservation and equitable sharing of the benefits of biological diversity . ]  
The General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights both called upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to increase their involvement in formal and non-formal education in human rights and to cooperate with the Centre for Human Rights in carrying out the activities of the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education .  
Appropriate institutions of civil society , including non-governmental organizations , workers ' and employers ' organizations , labour unions , the mass media , religious organizations , community organizations , the family , independent information , resource and training centres and others , for the purpose of incorporating human rights education into non-formal programmes , should be encouraged and assisted in developing and delivering such non-formal programmes , with the help of Governments and international donors and programmes .  
With the support of national focal points and national resource and training centres , local and community-based organizations should be prepared to deliver popular human rights education , through vocational and adult education , literacy training , local non-governmental organizations , family outreach and religious education .  
These actors include international and regional intergovernmental organizations ; individual States ; parliamentarians ; non-governmental organizations from the local to the global levels ; and private actors such as legal professionals , the media , academics , private institutions and civic associations , including ethnic , cultural and religious groups .  
Non-democratic States over time tend to generate conditions inimical to development : politicized military rule ; a weak middle class ; a population constrained to silence ; prohibitions on travel ; censorship ; restrictions on the practice of religion or imposition of religious obligations ; and pervasive and often institutionalized corruption .  
Unfortunately , in our world there remain conflicts , violence , ethnic strife , religious intolerance , terrorism , drug trafficking , corruption , poverty , unjust international economic relations and a heavy external debt that continues to prove overwhelming .  
In the spirit of Olympic ethics , any form of discrimination racial , religious , political , linguistic or otherwise is totally excluded , and the fundamental principle of equality prevails .  During the last three millenniums the Greek people have remained wholeheartedly and deeply committed to the Olympic Ideal , founded on the noble principles of understanding , tolerance , solidarity and dignity .  
We also urge them to institute national projects and programmes to meet the demand of international public opinion for promotion of the spirit of brotherhood , tolerance and love ; rejection of violence ; collective responsibility for guaranteeing fundamental human rights for all , regardless of nationality , race , or religious or ethnic affiliation ; and allowing peoples to live in peace and stability .  
Taking full advantage of historical affinities , cultural ties and religious bonds and sparing no effort to utilize in an efficient and coordinated manner the human and natural potential and resources of the region constitute the single best long-term guarantee of security and tranquillity .  
For all those reasons , and with a view to preserving the religious , cultural and historical character of Jerusalem , the Government of Jordan continues to maintain , restore and protect the Holy Places , now under the yoke of occupation , and to provide the necessary support for the relevant officials , with a view to protecting those places from all dangers pending the final solution to which we look forward .  
They include poverty and growing economic imbalances in and between countries ; rising unemployment and underemployment in many parts of the world ; environmental degradation ; war and civil strife ; intensified domestic and international conflicts for political , religious or ethnic reasons ; disparities in economic development and income levels ; globalization ; labour market demands ; and increased international trade and investment .  
UNHCR notes that involvement of local rather than international non-governmental organizations is likely to provide a closer link with the private sector at the country level and with institutions of civil society , such as voluntary agencies , human rights groups , cultural and academic associations , churches and other religious bodies , and refugee community groups .  
The Government of Poland stated that in public elementary and secondary schools , religious instruction shall be organized for pupils whose parents or legal guardians express a wish that their children should attend such instruction or classes and in secondary schools such instruction shall be organized for pupils whose parents or who themselves express such a wish .  
They also expressed their concern that technological developments in the field of communication , including computer networks such as Internet , can potentially be used for the dissemination of racist , anti-Semitic and xenophobic propaganda , the main victims of which are , inter alia , racial , ethnic , national , linguistic and religious minorities .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , States have the duty , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all universally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms , in accordance with international human rights standards .  
Provisional Order No . 4 / 1994 ( Miscellaneous Amendment of the Organization of Voluntary Work _ Societies Registration Act of 1957 and the Organization of Foreign Non _ Governmental Voluntary Work in the Sudan Act of 1988 ) , signed by the President of the Republic , defines a society as a voluntary organization of thirty or more persons established to carry out voluntary work of [ a ] social , scientific , educational , research , cultural and religious purpose ( art .  2.1 . a . 2 ) .  
According to article 2.2.2 , a voluntary organization means any foreign voluntary organization whose purpose is to carry out work the nature of which is social , scientific , educational , research based , cultural , technical or religious and which is registered under this Act .  
In this respect , the Special Rapporteur recalls Commission resolutions 1994 / 79 , 1995 / 77 and 1996 / 73 , in which , inter alia , it called upon the Government to comply with applicable international human rights instruments and to bring its national legislation into accordance with the instruments to which the Sudan is a party , and to ensure that all individuals in its territory and subject to its jurisdiction , including members of all religious and ethnic groups , enjoyed fully the rights recognized in those instruments ;  
Furthermore , the Assembly called upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action .  
In its continuous search for new channels for promoting and protecting human rights , the National Commission had initiated contacts with religious bodies , and had become deeply involved in investigating inter _ ethnic land conflicts which had assumed alarming dimensions .  
The basic mandate established by the Commission for the Sub _ Commission is ( a ) to undertake studies , particularly in the light of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights concerning the prevention of discrimination of any kind relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms and the protection of racial , national , religious and linguistic minorities , ( b ) to perform any other functions which may be entrusted to it by the Economic and Social Council or the Commission on Human Rights .  
Disturbed by the widespread occurrence in many parts of the world of violent conflicts engendering ethnic or religious hostility , and convinced that the implementation of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , together with other relevant instruments , is the best approach for resolving such conflicts peacefully , the Sub _ Commission in its resolution 1996 / 17 expressed its deep appreciation to the Working Group and called on the Commission to extend its mandate for another two years .  
In this connection , the Parsi minority is one of the most active and prosperous in India , both in the economic field as well as in terms of private school establishments , and also one of those that attaches the greatest importance to maintaining itself as a specific and distinct ethnic and religious community .  
According to official and non _ government observers , the destruction of Babri Masjid was an incident , an aberration , the result of the political exploitation of religion by ultra _ nationalist political parties , and can not be interpreted as evidence of an official policy of religious intolerance directed against Muslims .  
On the basis of all the information received and a detailed study of the documentation it appears that the situation of the Sikhs in the religious field is satisfactory , but that difficulties are arising in the political ( foreign interference , terrorism , etc . ) , economic ( in particular with regard to sharing of water supplies ) and even occupational fields .  
However , the economic and cultural poverty of the most disadvantaged is a fertile breeding _ ground for the development of religious extremism and , more generally , for the political exploitation of religion ; this is evidenced by the conflicts in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab , the destruction of Babri Masjid and the intercommunal riots in Bombay .  
As regards Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab , the Special Rapporteur urges all the parties concerned _ official and non _ official , national and foreign _ to act calmly and refrain from exacerbating religious problems to ensure that immutable religious principles are not affected by political considerations at the expense of the religious rights of the communities and , more generally , of tolerance and non _ discrimination based on religion or belief .  
As cholera is now thought to be endemic in Somalia , agencies , having learned from four years of experience , have designed specific prevention and control plans with the local communities to ensure water chlorination and to prevent the spread of the disease through social mobilization campaigns on country-wide radio broadcasts , local billboards , flyers and messages delivered through religious leaders .  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
Expresses its grave concern at any attack upon religious places , sites and shrines , and calls upon all States , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to exert utmost efforts to ensure that such places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected ;  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
Such efforts should be pursued in close cooperation with community and religious leaders and non-governmental organizations , at all levels of the State , i.e . national , regional , zonal and woreda levels , and special emphasis should be placed on the need to coordinate the policies designed to implement the Convention between central and local authorities .  
With regard to the full implementation of the principles laid down by articles 2 , 3 , 6 and 12 in the Convention , the Committee suggests that the State party fully integrate them in all its policies , laws , actions and programmes affecting children at all levels , including on the administrative and judicial levels , especially with regard to children belonging to ethnic and religious minority groups , the girl child , disabled children and children living in rural and remote areas .  
It becomes more sensitive and complicated when it relates to the city of Al-Quds Al-Sharif Jerusalem which has a unique political status and represents the spiritual patrimony of three religions and is closely linked to deep religious feelings in the Islamic world .  
The Israeli Government decision to establish new Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem runs counter to the spirit of peace that now prevails in the region , and constitutes an additional obstacle to the creation of a climate of understanding , reconciliation and religious tolerance in that age-old holy city held so dear by the world 's three great monotheistic religions .  
Gravely concerned at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , killings of civilians , torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , deaths in custody , absence of due process of law , severe restrictions on freedoms of opinion , expression , assembly and association , violations of freedom of movement , forced relocation , forced labour and portering and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Also strongly urges the Government of Myanmar to ensure full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , including freedom of expression and assembly , the right to fair trial and the protection of the rights of persons belonging to ethnic and religious minorities , and to put an end to violations of the right to life and integrity of the human being , to the practices of torture , abuse of women , forced labour and forced relocations and to enforced disappearances and summary executions ;  
Calls upon the Government of Myanmar and other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully the obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , [ 8 ] to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law and to avail itself of such services as may be offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
Deeply concerned that , despite the fall of apartheid and despite continuing efforts to combat these phenomena , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of racially motivated violence , persist and are even growing in magnitude , adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination , inter alia against Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , negrophobia , anti _ Semitism and related intolerance continue to persist and even to grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Request the Chairman of the Commission , when appointing special rapporteurs , to continue to consult closely with regional groups and ensure that the appointee is of recognized standing in the field of human rights , has an overall knowledge of political , social and legal systems , is sensitive to different cultural , religious and ethnic particularities , and will accordingly implement his mandate independently , impartially and objectively ;  
As on previous occasions , the Polish delegation expresses its strong belief that only genuine national reconciliation and respect for the interests of all ethnic and religious population groups in Afghanistan , as well as the long-standing tradition of Afghan statehood , can provide a true basis for a peaceful settlement of the conflict .  
Much of the populace has accepted Taliban rule not , I would say , because they want a severe judicial regime or social and religious restrictions imposed on all , but because they are desperate for peace and a semblance of normal life .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination , inter alia , against Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , negrophobia , anti _ Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Emphasizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated ; the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis ; while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
Also concerned about reports of ideological indoctrination or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , especially but not exclusively affecting displaced families and women and children belonging to racial , ethnic and religious minorities , Gravely concerned about reports that these practices have frequently been carried out by agents under government authority or have taken place with the knowledge of the Government of the Sudan ,  
Calls upon the Government of the Sudan to comply with applicable international human rights instruments and to bring its national legislation into accordance with those instruments to which the Sudan is a party , and to ensure that all individuals in its territory and subject to its jurisdiction , including members of all religious and ethnic groups , enjoy fully the rights recognized in those instruments ;  
Regarding crimes against humanity , article 3 of the statute of the International Tribunal for Rwanda stresses the prosecution of persons responsible for crimes " when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population on national , political , ethnic , racial or religious grounds " , that is , it does not associate those crimes primarily with armed conflicts .  
Consequently , there must exist a clear objective - to destroy and to remove an undesirable national , ethnical , racial , or religious group from the population of the State or region either by wholesale physical extermination as such or by the physical extermination of part of the group and forcible expulsion of the others from the defined district , region or State as a whole .  
The unbridled power struggle is thus nourished by rivalries among the leaders of various clans and by their unquenchable thirst for political power commensurate with their moral and religious domination of the members of their respective communities .  
Collective expulsions or population transfers usually target national , ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities and thus , prima facie , violate individual as well as collective rights contained in several important international human rights instruments , in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention on the Rights of the Child .  
An extensive debate encompassing a wide range of secular and religious views was in fact under way concerning assisted reproduction ; the current restrictions had been introduced by the previous Government .  
I would point out that the Turkish occupied area of Cyprus contains a large part of the island 's archaeological and historic sites , as well as religious monuments , which are subject to severe and extensive destruction , of which Turkey , as the occupying Power , is fully responsible and accountable .  
These are the latest in a long series of grave and recurrent cases of systematic pillaging and obliteration of the island 's archaeological , historic and religious monuments for which Turkey , as the occupying Power , must be held fully and exclusively accountable .  
Emphasizes its opposition to all instances of arbitrary deprivation of nationality , especially those based on racial , national , ethnic or religious grounds , as a violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms and an impediment to the right to return to one 's country ;  
Judge Murphy proposed that any organization which purported to be religious and whose belief and practices were reminiscent of or reflected ancient forms of worship could claim to believe in one or more supernatural beings , a god or an abstract entity and would be regarded as a religion . religious schools were contrary to article 116 of the Constitution , since such public funding was granted without distinction between the various religions and was therefore not tantamount to the establishment of a religion .  
With regard to legislation , while noting with satisfaction the legal and legislative arrangements developed and implemented for the protection of land and sacred sites , including religious objects , and for the return of the religious and cultural heritage , the Special Rapporteur recommends ensuring uniformity of such legislation at the Federal and State levels , as well as its effectiveness in relation to its assigned objective , particularly by identifying and remedying shortcomings and loopholes .  
It will reach out to different groups : the voluntary sector , social and health-care practitioners , professional and academic bodies , central and local government , industry and commerce , professionals , interested individuals , womens , youth and older peoples organizations , religious bodies , schools and colleges , cross-cultural and ethnic minority groups and many others .  
A public sector that is either too weak or too large can lead to serious ethnic , religious , political and economic conflicts , undermining sound governance and efforts to promote human development .  
According to the report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ( A / 51 / 301 ) , such manifestations had profound and complex historical , political , social , economic and even religious causes which should be removed by taking measures to achieve genuine equality , human rights and fundamental freedoms among all racial or ethnic groups .  
The international community was currently facing different , although not unfamiliar , problems , namely , the break-up of political entities , conflicts based on religious ideology , the repercussions of the apartheid policies applied in the past and human rights violations engendered by racial and ethnic hatred .  
This view includes situations of extreme poverty and economic and social under-development , human rights violations , massive flows of refugees , civil wars resulting from ethnic conflicts , extreme degradation of the environment , terrorism , and even certain socio-political phenomena such as corruption , drug trafficking and international crime ; it also includes religious fundamentalism , which in recent years has aggressively invaded several regions of the world . 
Essentially a product of deep social and economic underdevelopment , crises in that part of the world are aggravated by ethnic , cultural and religious factors , all deeply rooted in history .  
Equal attention was being paid to the renaissance and free development of the Ukrainian nation and to the promotion and protection of the spiritual and cultural heritage of other ethnic , linguistic and religious groups living in Ukraine .  
Further , the Assembly called upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action .  
Deeply concerned that despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , continue to persist and even grown in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
While the proportion of the national budget allocated to basic social sectors was still to be optimized , advances had been made in the political arena , such as the agreement by the National Assembly to convene a biennial children 's parliament , the creation of strategic alliances for children 's rights among mayors and religious leaders and the review of Senegalese legislation in the light of the Convention on the Rights of the Child .  
While significance of national and regional characteristics and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Genocide can be committed irrespective of any armed conflict and comprises certain crimes ( such as killing or causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of a particular group ) committed with the intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group , as such .  
Crimes against humanity require that certain capital crimes ( such as murder , extermination , imprisonment , torture , rape or persecution on political , racial and religious grounds ) are committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack against any civilian population on national , political , ethnical , racial or religious grounds .  
The Team has directly raised awareness about Pacific island Constitutions , laws , human rights , gender and the application of United Nations Conventions among rural and urban women , youth groups , civil society activists , social welfare officers , police officers , religious seminarians , magistrates , justices , senior court judges and other providers of the justice system in the Cook Islands , Fiji , the Federated States of Micronesia , Kiribati , the Marshall Islands , Nauru , Niue , Samoa , the Solomon Islands , Tonga , Tuvalu and Vanuatu .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the Office of the High Commissioner , in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
Calls upon the Government of Myanmar and other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully the obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , [ 8 ] to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law and to avail itself of such services as may be offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
Social , religious and cultural networks can help to represent the specific economic interests of all the different groups in the community , particularly excluded groups ; to ensure that policies reflect the needs and interest of communities ; to ensure that policies do not lead to disintegration of communities ; to collect relevant data and information on the impact of economic policies ; to carry out participatory monitoring of policies ; and to ensure local representation in government structures .  
Other social groups that can be identified include ethnic and religious minorities ; indigenous people ; refugees and displaced persons ; migrants and migrant workers , both legal and illegal , as well as family members left behind ; prisoners and ex-offenders ; addicts and former addicts ; squatters ; street children ; people living in extreme poverty ; and landless rural workers .  
Limitations governing the use of the media are defined in article 5 , which prohibits , inter alia , its use to call for usurpation of power , the change by force of the constitutional order , breach of the territorial integrity of the Republic , incitement to national , social , racial and religious intolerance or dissension , to propagate war and aggression , to diffuse pornography , to encroach on the morality , honour and dignity of citizens or to publish materials relating to inquiries that have not been completed .  
The world is currently passing through highly interwoven and complicated circumstances , where progress and its horizons mingle with backwardness and its dangers while humanity takes pride in such achievements as economic progress and the development of technology and informatics , it is still suffering from the practices of terrorism , drug trafficking , organized crime , the spread of corruption , the overflow of refugees , the challenges posed by war criminals , crimes of genocide and mass murder , and the negative effects of racism and religious discrimination . 
Peace , security and disarmament are vital to a safe and secure planet , and the countless individuals who live daily in constant fear whether because of terrorists , hatred between ethnic groups , internecine warfare or religious persecution gives us much concern . 
Now we are practically the only country of the Commonwealth of Independent States that had a stable economic growth of about 16 per cent during the first half of this year ; we have arrested the decrease in volumes of industrial production and we are a country free from religious , ethnic or civil strife .

WFDY is a broad international non-governmental youth organization which brings together national youth organizations with diverse cultural , religious and social , economic and political systems .
