They tore down the Matsu Temple , which was the center of religious life in Taipei , and built Kodama Goto Memorial Hall ( honoring the fourth Governor-General Kodama Gentaro and Senior Minister Goto Shinpei ) . Western classical music was played on the hall 's open-air stage all day long . All sorts of celebrations were also held here , as was the incomparably famous World Expo .  
The broad idea for this was floated two years ago . The hope is that Taiwan can take advantage of its geographic location , orthodox Chinese culture , business connections with overseas Chinese , and solid industrial base to become the regional center for foreign firms coming to the Asian region ( and especially for those firms investing in the PRC ) .  
On March 26 , 1988 , more than 200 brook masu salmon fry , each of them tagged for identification , prepared to leave the propagation center built for them by human beings and set out to return " home " - - to the Chichiawan Stream at Lishan in central Taiwan .  
At any rate , the investment required to open a computer center is not nearly as monumental as a factory or an overseas branch operation . With the use of satellite communications it really was n't that difficult . As far as Hong Kong and Shanghai is concerned , we were simply turning circumstances to our advantage . " Lo reveals that several dozen employees have returned by this method .  
" A lot of people in society have something to say , " affirms Liu Ta-chwan , network director for Chiao Tung University 's computer center . What gives the Net a superior edge over the conventional broadcast media is that radio talk shows have inherent time limitations , and they can cut callers off if they do n't like what is being said . The BBS is different . " It is basically very fair , because the capacity is unlimited . "  
Thus although the center has been running for over a year , the number attending has always stayed around 20 to 30 . Birds of passageThe old people who are most in need of daycare are those with restricted mobility or in poor health . But the shortage of medical and nursing staff in Taiwan , the high cost of providing such care and the fact that it is not covered by the National Health Insurance scheme mean that hospitals around the country have little inclination to set up daycare centers or residential nursing homes .  
Jade articles from the Liangzhu culture of Zhe-jiang Province include jade cong ( rectangular blocks with a circular hole through the middle ) carved with patterns ; huan ( discs with a large hole ) incised with images thought to depict Chi You , the eastern tribe leader slain by Huangdi ; jade bi ( ritual discs with a hole in the center ) incised with magical images , and so on .  
I was searching for some way to make myself happy . " " Eventually , I went to . . . " Cut to a new scene , bright and colorful , and we watch the young woman-her smiling face filled with hope-pushing open the door to a health and beauty center . " Here I become beautiful , and when I go home I can face them [ she is holding the two children ] with a refreshed outlook .  
Income and independenceMany people think of taxi driving as an excellent " reception center for the unemployed and waystation for those changing jobs . " One just has to pass the test to get a commercial driver 's license and sign up with a cab company , and one can immediately get on the road and start earning money .  
Many young people , unable to find work immediately after completing their military service , see driving a taxi as a job which offers independence and an apparently reasonable income , so they enter this " reception center for the unemployed and waystation for those changing jobs . "  
The tiles of the emperor 's palace in Peking shone " like gold " under the sun . The Bao En Temple in Nanking was particularly impressive , being constructed from a number of attractive buildings in the center of which was a porcelain pagoda of nine storeys , roofed with yellow and red tiles with hints of green . At its eaves were bells which rang continuously in the breeze .  
But because traffic is a more thorny problem in that part of the city , the site currently most favored by the city government is in the vicinity of the Sungshan tobacco factory in Nankang , a suburban area of northeast Taipei . This is further from the city center , a highway already goes by there , and a mass transit system station will soon be completed there . The city government argues that these will be of some help in moving large numbers of people .  
" The best situation would of course be cross-strait reconciliation , so that Taiwan could enter the middle phase of its national unification plan , and establish trade , transport and financial links on the basis of equal and friendly relations , " says C . J . Lee . At that point Taiwanese firms could base decisions as to whether to set up a center of operations directly in , say , Shanghai , or to go through Hong Kong , purely on commercial considerations , and would not have to shoulder an additional political burden .  
Under these circumstances , the government 's offshore shipping center may well have opened up a crack in the door for cross-strait shipping . Ships flying a foreign flag that have received government permission can sail straight from Kaohsiung Harbor to the mainland . What has not changed is that vessels flying the ROC flag , as always , can not cross the strait , and crafts flying the five-starred PRC flag are not allowed into Taiwan .  
After the plan for the offshore shipping center was brought before the public , the PRC government , which up until then had been constantly calling for direct cross-strait shipping to be established , based on the definition of a " domestic shipping line , " reversed its attitude 180 degrees . Since the regulation was passed over one year ago , not even one commercial ship has succeeded in crossing the strait .  
When Hsiu Ping-shan " retired " from politics , he drew inspiration from the recently popular " all-you-can-eat " restaurants to establish his own " all-you-can-write " center . The store is replete with brushes , ink , paper and ink stone , as well as exemplary calligraphy from all the great masters . Air conditioning and tea are provided , and a teacher even gives free instruction . Customers can arrive empty-handed and write to their hearts ' content .  
Lien Te-sen became famous for his work " MRT , " in which he rendered the character xing ( �� ) , meaning " motion , " in several disconnected pieces , and in the center drew the character gui ( �t ) , meaning " turtle , " in ancient seal script , thus mocking the progress of Taipei 's traffic and mass rapid transit system .  
In other words , even though the production base moves overseas , the " headquarters " and " logistical support center " remain in Taiwan . Operations items stay in Taiwan , along with capital sourcing , legal , tax , and financial planning , and training of internationalized personnel . All these could service the production bases located in surrounding countries .  
Before they even landed in Taiwan , Weidenhofer and Payne , who work for Artlab Australia , Down Under 's biggest restoration center , had already conducted tests on fragments Pottman had brought them , determining the composition of the paints used in the mural and finding suitable detergents . Still , they were very careful here , spending two weeks to repair just one wall of murals . In comparison to the water and soap that temples in Taiwan frequently use to clean their murals , this sort of slow and painstaking approach is extraordinary .  
One evening at about eight o'clock , after most people 's busy workdays have drawn to a close and they are peacefully settling down to watch the TV dramas about family love and crisis that prevail in this time slot , Hsieh Chiao-an , a volunteer at a psychological counseling center , is listening to true life stories about how a woman is physically abused by her philandering husband .  
My main work at the center has involved taking on psychological counseling cases , and serving as a group leader of empathy and self-affirmation groups , and emotional management groups for single-parent elementary school students . Accompanying people through their low times and sharing life experiences with them is a hard-to-come-by opportunity in this age when people lack ties to others .  
The judicial training center has lately increased the training it provides to prepare the judges in these areas , for example , taking the students abroad and having them tour legal gambling establishments ( all gambling is illegal in Taiwan ) and sex operations . In order to competently handle the traffic accidents which are more and more prevalent , the students must all learn to drive ; in order to combat the new styles of economic crimes , the aspiring judges must also make visits to securities exchanges .  
As far as Hong Kong residents are concerned , the pragmatic approach typical of businessmen suits the colony 's long-established role as a commercial center . As for Taiwan , Tung 's family has long had connections with high-level political figures in the ROC , giving rise to some optimism about what will happen after he takes over the reins of officialdom in Hong Kong . It is believed that Tung understands Taiwan relatively well , a fact which should be helpful in future communication and compromise .  
In the center of the long hanging scroll stand a mountain and trees . They have an imposing grandeur , yet are upright and balanced about a vertical central axis , unmoved by any wind . So although there are mountain pines on myriad peaks , where is the soughing wind ?  
At its most severe , cases of serious crime or crimes causing major damage or injury usually find the perpetrators given a sentence in a juvenile detention center . Other offenders might be placed in a juvenile reformatory and training school as in cases of theft or robbery . Youths charged in connection with altercations or fights might be sentenced to probation or weekend guidance . Those whose offenses are judged to be the lightest , such as runaways , truants , or those picked up wandering the streets , are usually let off with a stern warning .  
Originally the Defense Ministry planned to use the land for residential housing . But the local governments , elected officials at all levels , and scholars and experts , all lobbied for different proposals . There were people calling for the land to be used for commercial real estate , for a trade center , for a new city government office complex , for a university . . . . The argument raged for years .  
But it was n't until 1860 , when Britain annexed Kowloon and took possession of the now famous Victoria Harbour , that Hong Kong took its place as a vital center of global trade . At that time , colonial business capital swarmed into Hong Kong 's harbor and urban areas , quickly developing them into an international trading center with British companies at its core . Nineteenth-century Western businesses , offices , residences , and warehouses sprang up , instantly transforming the face of this traditional Chinese fishing village .  
It began with the late-Yuan Emperor Shun , who favored the south and moved the empire 's political center there . By the Ming dynasty , the scenic southern banks of the Yangtze River were also home to booming trade and a flowering of the arts which saw frequent performances of music and dance .  
The southern Taiwan sun beats down on the low , densely packed buildings of Er-kung New Village , a military dependents ' community in Tainan County . In the morning market , the crowds seem to boil . In contrast , the expansive grounds of Our Lady of the Assumption Church , located in the center of the village , seem particularly cool and serene .  
Venice , that romantic city on the water filled with historic architecture , was the wellspring of European capitalism and the Renaissance , and in recent years has developed into an important international exhibition center for movies , music and architecture . The celebrated film festival and this biennial art exhibition are two of the city 's great achievements .  
In the Palace Museum in Beijing , there is a painting entitled Listening to the Qin , by Emperor Huizong of the Song dynasty . In it , a brown-robed Daoist sits playing a qin under a pine tree . To left and right are " Two quietly musing guests , one with head raised , one with head bowed / To hear that stringless playing . " In the center of the picture , on a strangely shaped stone which serves as a pedestal , stands an elegant potted plant .  
Looking back over his life , the first half was spent at the center of momentous events while , in the second half , history has continued to move inexorably forward without his participation . Has he really just these few lines as his testimony ? Before his oral history is published in 2002 we can only understand him from the books that have been written about him .  
Cleveland was originally a center of machinery and steel . When the city fell on hard times , 30 local entrepreneurs formed a " roundtable " to find a way out of the mess . After four years of extensive discussions , they designed a strategic plan for the direction of future city development .  
" In the 1970s , scientists began to realize that synchrotron radiation was the greatest light source humanity had ever yet harnessed for scientific research , " says Keng S . Liang , deputy director of the center . " And accelerators designed to produce maximum synchrotron radiation were built one after another . " These represented the second generation of synchrotron accelerators .  
On this point , Chen Chien-te argues that considering the level of funding and the size of the center 's staff , the light beams have been coming on line pretty fast . Still , to meet researchers ' needs , apart from doing all they can to make the light beams more powerful , they are also negotiating with the Japanese synchrotron center to co-fund three hard X-ray beams at the Japanese center that would be specially designated for use by Taiwan researchers .  
In later years , although Taiwan had made tremendous progress relative to its situation 25 years before , the difficulties it faced in raising funds overseas were proportional to those it faced in surviving internationally , and this created more problems for the center . Moreover , domestically , the island was entering the democratic era . Most citizens , including the legislators who held the purse-strings , did n't understand the importance of the center and its contribution to the world . Consequently , the budget was cut repeatedly .  
In the late 1980s , the biggest crisis faced by the center was that some figures in the international agricultural community began to suggest that it would be best to establish an additional center elsewhere , to gradually supersede the Taiwan center , because of worries over the center 's future in a country that was widely barred from most other international organizations .  
Because the results of research over the previous decade gradually received international affirmation , in 1989 the World Bank approved the center 's five-year plan and provided substantial funding . The number of research projects increased substantially and regional cooperation projects were successively begun .  
In addition to improving the quality and quantity of vegetable production , its efforts allowed young soybeans to become a major agricultural export for Taiwan , which improved farmers ' incomes and earned foreign exchange for the country . Chou says that the center has also , over the years , nurtured a large pool of skilled personnel from both overseas and Taiwan .  
The center has increased its range of research substantially since its establishment , and the external environment has also become more complex . However , its objectives remain as unchanged as the simple exterior of its building-improving the lives of people in difficult environments and offering them a better future .  
The Overseas Affairs Commission established the Chinese Culture Center on two acres of land , and it is the most expansive such center in the world . Apart from five classrooms , it also has separate rooms for badminton and ping-pong and a dance room of more than 3500 square feet . The mere sight of it fills new and prospective members with great expectations , making them eager to give the seniors ' association activities a try .  
What university ? Beijing was the capital , and had a very conservative atmosphere . In the five-and-a-half years during which Tsai Yuan-pei was in charge of Beida , he changed it from a place reeking of bureaucratism to a center of lively , progressive thinking .  
In that time of controversy , " Tsai Yuan-pei could be said to have been the least controversial personality , " says Ambrose King in the book Daxue de Linian ( The Idea of the University ) . In his hands , Beida became a real university , a center for new culture and modern thinking in China . But Tsai did not belong only to Beida ; he also belonged to a larger academic and cultural community .  
Also , from the Eastern Han ( 25-220 ) onward , the political center gradually moved from north China to south of the Yangtze . This geographical shift brought with it a gradual change in spatial attitudes . The limestone geology of southern China has endowed it with many deep and mysterious caves which nature has fashioned into remarkable shapes , and these constantly fired human imaginations .  
Taiwan 's " plum rains " were particularly heavy this year . The storms brought by the stationary front that creates the plum rains in June quickly raised water levels in the island 's reservoirs to dangerous levels . In the center and south of the island , from the mountains to the coastal plains , there were almost daily reports of flooding and landslides .  
Two years ago , the special education center at National Taiwan Normal University conducted a survey of Taiwanese firms which made the above bias all too clear . The results indicated that bosses were most willing to hire handicapped persons whose disability involved their arms or legs . The next most " popular " were the hearing impaired , followed by the mentally retarded . Visually-impaired persons did not make a single boss ' list .  
As for the current surplus of NT $ 40 billion that NHI has on its books , Chuang Yi-chou , director of the administrative center at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and a national policy advisor to the president , says that it was created by overestimates of the average number of dependents per family and by excess contributions from employers .  
After winning first prize for Young Designer at the second annual awards , Paul Shen went on to carry off the gold medal at the inaugural Fashion Design Competition for Young Designer of Asia , held in Taiwan the following year . This led to an invitation from one of the judges , Pierre Cardin , to take up a post as assistant designer at Pierre Cardin 's design center in France .  
Market numbers tell the story . The privately-operated CGMH , which is the largest health-care organization in Taiwan , opened its first TCM department , fully staffed by doctors with dual backgrounds in both TCM and Western medicine , at its Linkou medical center two years ago . The number of patients seen by its out-patient clinic has grown explosively to its current level of around 25,000 per month , an average of approximately 1,000 per day .  
There have been several attempts to get around the problem of insufficient objectivity in the diagnostic methods . Dr . Julia Tsuei and Chung Chieh , the former head of the traditional medical center at Veteran 's Memorial Hospital , developed the " Qin Value Detector " based on the principles of acupuncture and the meridian system .  
Public facilities in the village are first-rate , including three primary schools , a junior high school , a senior high school , an employee day care center , an employee discount store , traditional fruit and vegetable markets , restaurants , athletic fields , a golf driving range , a public swimming pool , a library , a cinema , a hospital , and even a funeral home .  
After the repeal of martial law , the provincial authority in charge of public security turned Green Island into a " reeducation center " for reforming criminals whose thinking needed changing or whose political views were problematic .  
In restaurants in Tungkang , center of Taiwan 's tuna industry , the eyes of the big-eyed tuna , formerly discarded as useless , are now deemed big attractions . These eyes , each nearly 10 cm in diameter , cooked up with some sour cabbage , are promoted by restaurant owners as being rich in DHA , which they say " makes your head healthy and strong ! "  
Although the political center of China in ancient times was in cities far from the sea such as Chang'an ( modern Xi'an ) and Luoyang , those who lived close to rivers ate food from the rivers , and those who lived close to lakes ate food from the lakes . The Yellow River basin-the cradle of Chinese culture-provided a rich harvest of freshwater fish and crustaceans , and thus gave birth to Chinese people 's taste for eating all kinds of aquatic produce fresh from the " three rivers , four seas and five lakes . "  
Two important pieces of legislation were passed in regard to educating the populace . The " Citizens ' Education Law " was modified to encourage private individuals to engage in private education . The principle of " nine years of continuous compulsory education " was revised to state that " curricula shall center around students ' all-round mental and physical development and emphasize continuity . "  
This center covers over 10,000 square meters . It is spacious and transport is convenient . It is said that during Tseng Kuang-shun 's time as director of Taiwan 's Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee the property was acquired through the efforts of two center directors . Cheng Hsin-pen made initial arrangements and Liang Po-chien signed the contract to complete the deal .  
The lower end of the neck on each of the heads ends in a pointed diamond shape , suggesting that the heads were all mounted on bodies made of some other material , and that they were arranged in solemn majesty around an altar , with the big bronze statue standing in the center . After the sacred rite was completed , the beautifully crafted statues and ceremonial implements were burnt , broken , and placed in the pit . Why would anyone have done this ?  
However , to date the exchange center has not been able to balance demand with supply . Lin Chih-sen , a division chief at the IDB , comments that many raw materials derived from waste do not have the same level of purity as original feedstocks , and so do not meet manufacturers ' requirements . Hence the proportion of waste materials offered through the exchange center which are actually sold is very low-less than 10% .  
The center of Hsinchu City has recently had a makeover . The old moat , which lay neglected for many years , crosses the city like a blue sash , lined with grassy levees and neatly laid footpaths . As you stroll in the shade of the trees , the leaves overhead stir in the summer breeze , and the sunshine dapples the ground with flecks of dancing light like little imps frisking at your feet .  
In addition to the snacks sold at the little stalls crowded around the entrance to the temple of the city god , there are plenty of other traditional foods to be found in the tight web of streets and historic sites of Hsinchu 's city center . These include round meat dumplings , meat broth , duck noodles and Hakka-style broad rice noodles .  
The rushing waters , small boats , astonishing mountains , dazzling cliffs , sparkling waterfalls , and colorful and rapidly changing skies have been a source of wonder and inspiration for literati and artists since ancient times . The area has been a major center of civilization in China , and was the birthplace of renowned patriot-poet Qu Yuan and the statesman Zhuge Liang , among many others . Above all , it has been the home of countless generations of ordinary Chinese who have made their living around the river .  
When Tiway Sayion retired from his position as principal of Hualien 's Tafalong Primary School after a teaching career that spanned 45 years , his first act was to realize a long-cherished dream-he returned to the tribal community where he was born and built a cabin in which to live . Tiway Sayion 's simple 20-ping cabin is laid out with the kitchen and bathroom on the right and the bedroom on the left . The center is his living room , furnished with only a sofa and bookshelves .  
Last year the Buddha 's Light International Association organized New Year 's Eve dinners in the north , center and south of Taiwan , which were attended by more than 5,000 old folk who live alone . This year they are repeating the exercise , and are including a special event in Nantou County to bring some warmth and love to elderly survivors of the 9 / 21 earthquake there .  
It must also be remembered that DPP party members are the chief executives in the large majority of Taiwan 's cities and counties . Now that the DPP also controls executive power at the central level , the political map will have a green line running from localities to the center .  
In the center of one of the exhibition rooms , the NPM has laid out a realistic picture of the life of the literati , based on a portrayal in an anonymous Song painting . The main character sits alone in front of a painted screen depicting wild and domestic fowl . To one side , a servant pours tea from a white porcelain pot ; on a table are two or three dishes of fruit and snacks . In front of the scholar stands a basket of classically arranged flowers .  
Years before Copernicus advanced the theory that the sun was at the center of the universe , da Vinci surmised that the earth revolved around the sun ; before Galileo improved the telescope , da Vinci had drawn designs for telescopes ; long before the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , he invented a lathe , a lifting jack , a water pump , a lift , and geared machinery ; he was also the first to use the modern plus and minus signs in mathematics .  
As the first Taiwanese president , Lee Teng-hui 's success did a lot to assuage the anger of the Taiwanese people about the discrimination they had experienced . This won him a lot of support . On top of that , once in power he implemented a policy of shifting the island 's cultural center of gravity away from mainland China and more toward Taiwan itself , and he criticized the KMT as being " a regime of outsiders . " These positions won him 54% of the vote in the first direct presidential election .  
Chen Ding-nan , the new minister of justice , plans to establish an " independent commission against corruption " and a " black gold activities investigation center , " with offices in the north , center , and south of Taiwan . Plans are also afoot to produce legislation that will prevent " black gold " activities from taking on a legal veneer that protect them from punishment .  
In addition to being an important cultural center in ancient India , the Gandhara region of northwest India ( straddling the modern-day border between Pakistan and Afghanistan ) , had also been a part of the Greek empire for a time , and was deeply influenced by Hellenic culture . In Buddhist sculpture from Gandhara , the figures have the deeply set eyes , aquiline noses , and curly hair so typical of Greek statues .  
At a symposium on Buddhist music held earlier this year at Fokuangshan , a center for Buddhist studies and worship , several Buddhist academics voiced concern about the popularization and commercialization of the form , and its loss of sacramental character . As they pointed out : take away the title and the chanting , and you 're left with pure pop .  
Lo says that the main countries that will be at the center of future diplomatic work , besides the ROC 's existing diplomatic partners , will be the nations of North America and Europe . " The academic community is a major source of staff people for the executive branch , while congressmen set the direction of legislation and executive officials determine how it is implemented . In the future more emphasis will be placed on contacts at these three levels with European and North American countries , " he says .  
When the Dutch took over Tainan , they encouraged the cultivation and export of cane sugar , a crop that grew exceptionally well on the Chianan Plain stretching out from Tainan in almost every direction . On the strength of this economic base , Tainan naturally became the political center of Taiwan . Although southern Taiwan is dominated today by Kaohsiung , back then the latter was just one of Tainan 's satellite ports , with development limited by heavy silting and shallow berths .  
However , explains Huang Wu-ta , director of the Taiwan Institute of Urban History , the conditions did not yet exist that would have allowed Jiaozaitu to serve as the capital . The overland transportation network during the late Qing dynasty was extremely poor , and people traveled north-south in Taiwan mainly via the sea . This factor marginalized Jiaozaitu , which had no port . Central Taiwan 's key population center was farther south in the coastal city of Lukang .  
In the early days , most of the micro-organisms held by the center were types widely used internationally such as yeasts and red yeasts . But in recent years , in the interests of preserving biodiversity and protecting native resources , the center has reorganized and is directing the major part of its efforts towards developing native fungi . " Native and marine micro-organisms will be the main focus of our future work , " declares the center 's mission statement .  
The patient at the center of the story , Chou Chin-yao , eventually published an account of the incident entitled A Skin Graft with Love ( 1984 ) . " Each time I recall the extraordinary grace that Dr . and Mrs . Landsborough bestowed on one so sick , it brings me to tears , even though half a century has passed since then . Words can not describe the intensity of my gratitude .  
Twenty years ago theorists proposed that the magnetic field extended down below the sun 's surface to a depth of 0.7 solar radii from the center of the sun surface , but signals from the magnetic field are very weak , and could not be detected by the methods and instruments then available . But today acoustic imaging has enabled Chou Dean-yi to find much stronger evidence in support of the 20-year-old theory , and this is highly significant for solar astronomy .  
Leaving behind peaceful , picturesque Tsaotun , we come to Puli Township , which is a center of art , culture and scenic beauty . Downtown Puli is bustling and appears completely restored , but in the surrounding boroughs and villages many problems still hamper both physical reconstruction and economic recovery .  
The average age of this group of granddads and grandmas was over 60 . With their dark , weathered complexions and cheery smiles , they vigorously set to work in the Huanshan and Lishan Roads area of Neihu , helping local residents clean out the deep layer of mud from their homes . In the evening , they bedded down on the floor in the activity center of a local middle school .  
It aims to bring together leading political and other figures who place Taiwan at the center of their thinking . It also claims to be a third force outside the conventional political structure that has established a partnership with the current administration , which shares similar ideals , and to be a " do tank " that gives equal emphasis to planning and to practice .  
This July , planning will be completed for the first free port in Taiwan , which should increase the efficiency of the movement of goods significantly . This will be helpful to Taiwan 's becoming a regional operations center for both local businesses and multinational companies .  
To date , the DCB has acquired four new technologies with medical applications , including a platform to generate human monoclonal antibodies against entrovirus type 71 , and drugs with the potential to treat complications resulting from chronic heart failure and diabetes . The center is also beginning to get its hands on very promising technologies used to modify genes and proteins . It 's who you know  
" The approach adopted now at chinatimes.com is to integrate a number of e-papers and mail these out to members . Although no fees are collected from members , the profit lies in the hidden vertical-depth e-commerce represented by each member , " says Michael Chang , chief operations officer . By working with businesses , treating the e-paper platform as a giant shopping center , and using integrated operations , not only can a news-oriented e-paper survive , its professional reputation can be a guarantee of reliability to consumers .  
AVRDC director Samson C.S . Tsou points out that in nearly 30 years in Taiwan , the center 's accomplishments include raising both the quality and yields of a wide variety of tropical vegetables , including tropical tomatoes , vegetable soybeans , and crucifers . Its staff have also worked to improve the nutritional status and incomes of people in developing countries around Asia . Taiwan has been the primary source of financial support , accounting for nearly 60% of the center 's US $ 10 million budget .  
Its personnel and programs have made an outstanding contribution , earning the title " the quiet achievers . " The low-profile AVDRC specially organized the open day to express gratitude for the tremendous support that the host nation has provided . In addition , the center also hopes to use media coverage to demonstrate to Taiwan 's citizens their nation 's critical contribution to bettering the lives of people throughout Asia .  
Therefore , in the first decade of the FFTC 's existence , its programs were focused on soil and fertilizer management , the nutrient requirements of rice plants , and control of major rice pests . It was the first international center to specialize in control of rice brown plant hopper , which became much more destructive after the introduction of short-term high-yielding rice varieties and chemical pesticides .  
When you enter the building , the fragrance of java wafts across from the coffee shop on the first floor . The four levels downstairs constitute the digital learning center , which was opened for use only in September . The architect Lin Chou-min , who designed the immensely successful Eslite bookstore chain , was brought in to lay out the learning center . The more than 1000 square meter space includes a wireless Internet zone , a multimedia production area , small audiovisual conference rooms , and a corner theater .  
It will still take a long time to establish just what specific curative effects alternative therapies have . But since the former Office of Alternative Medicine at the US National Institutes of Health was expanded into a " national center " in 1998 , its annual research budget has grown hugely , from US $ 2 million then to US $ 150 million today .  
The Estate is not the only structure closely connected to the history of Wufeng to be in this condition . The Wan Fo Temple , a busy religious center that was located in the mountains behind the provincial assembly building , was once the largest Buddhist monastery and temple complex in the entire rural township . Its most distinctive feature was a 20-meter tall golden statue of Baisajyagurvaiduryaprabhasa in a seated position . Though the statue itself is still intact , the remainder of the structure was eradicated by the earthquake .  
Perhaps the SARS outbreak can remind humankind that regardless of ethnic differences , of how powerful a nation may be , and of whether it stands at the center or on the periphery of world affairs , in the face of a tiny virus the divisions and conflicts of the human world are nothing more than a farce . In the face of the disease , ideological and ethnic differences that are often seen as insurmountable , come to appear insignificant .  
A doctor from a health center located in a southern county , who wishes to remain anonymous , says that when SARS hit , because the center had been converted into a treatment center , more than half their time was spent in examining patients rather than doing general epidemic prevention work . Indeed , even now the government lacks a clear focus for future tasks such as promoting cervical examinations , encouraging neighborhood environmental hygiene , or taking preventive measures against chronic diseases .  
When dengue fever was attacking southern Taiwan , the average health center in a rural township had only five employees . But communities there are spread widely and it required a great deal of time and personnel to visit each and every community and inspect outdoor containers of standing water , destroy carrier mosquitoes , and spray disinfectant .  
The soft-spoken Lee studied sociology at university , and for more than 20 years has built his career around social work . In the 1990s , while running an Ilan halfway house , he also began training as a counselor to better help people deal with psychological disorders . Lee then returned to his hometown of Tungshan in 1997 and established a counseling center . In 1999 , Tungshan attempted to hold an election for the position of executive director , but no one wanted to run .  
Sister Therese says women spend varying amounts of time in the Good Shepherd center . During an average two-week to three-month stay of an urgent case , the social workers first try to get an understanding of the new bride 's background and situation .

From reading the classics , she discovered that the Chinese character for cancer ( ) has no particular etymology of meaning but rather is just a frightening pictograph . " The character itself terrifies people . Its center is composed of a standing on the top of a mountain ( ) . . . it makes one think of white bones on a desolate mountain top .  
Whether the scene be quiet and sparse or busy and crowded , the photo of the deceased hung in the center of the funeral hall seemed incredibly isolated ; they both seemed to be " supporting actors . "  
For someone who has never before been in con tact with drug addicts , the stereotype is closely connected to that of criminal society , with large dark eyebrows over brooding , threatening eyes leading into a violent , powder keg personality . Little did we expect that when we got to the rehabilitation center we would find that the patients were no different from the run-of-the-mill .  
The Tourism Bureau has been developing a recreational area in the woodland coastal area in Tungshih rural township in Chiayi County . They built a huge service center and parking lot in the area . Perhaps by the time they 're ready to open , the woodland will have withered because of destruction of the living environment . "  
Compared to these sites , Chengziya is much larger , and many more large artifacts have been discovered . " In fact , it already transcends the traditional ' fortress ' type compound , which was mainly for defense , and is a ' city ' in the sense of a political , economic , and cultural center .  
In recent years , land speculation , a dramatic rise in the price of housing , stock speculation , and a string of scandals involving major public works pro-jects and purchasing have sullied the R . O . C . ' s political and economic environment . Political factions and financial consortiums have pushed their interests close to the center of power in the ruling party . These have laid the seeds of the people 's discontent . Everywhere one sees petitions for reform .  
Situated in the southern part of Yunnan Province , Pu'er Township ( in ancient times known as Pu'er Prefecture ) from early in the Tang Dynasty onward , was Yunnan 's commercial tea center . The Tibetans , Mongolians and other ethnic minorities from the northwest , brought horses for barter . They traded horses for tea , forming the famous " tea-horse trade . " Other teas , sold in Thailand and Burma to the south or shipped to the northern capitals , all would pass through Pu'er .  
Actually , public and private schools have a deep connection . A few of the schools were established by retired members of the military dog training center . Also , when the police canine division was first formed , they trained both the people and the dogs by relying on the long experience of private dog schools .  
In the past , prehistoric civilization " . . . generally revolved around Lungshan and Yangshao , " says Wang Mingda , research assistant at the Archaeological Institute of Zhejiang Province . Most people believe that the origin and center of civilization was in North China . After the excavation of huge numbers of artifacts of the Liangzhu , it was established that the Yangtze river valley , like the Yellow river valley , also held " a very glorious and splendid culture . "  
For those cities and counties with less developed economies , or with severe population outflow , the redistribution of funds is of course the best possible plan . But the money is not there just for the asking . Often expenses that are considered vital at the local level are not seen as such by the center . Sometimes the funds are given with so many restrictions as to how they might be spent that it is hard for the local government to put them to use .  
Some people have questioned whether this position , exposed on all sides , does not have unfavorable fengshui . But Chen Cheng-shen , an advisor in the office of the presidential spokes man who is well versed in the principles of geomancy , explains that as the center of national power , the Presidential Palace can repulse any evil influence which may approach along the road , while the four streets around the building express its communication with all parts of the land .  
And so in 1901 , when the Governor-General 's Residence was completed ( now the Taipei Guest House ) , it was luxuriously expansive and well appointed . The Japanese craftsmen designed the space imitating the baroque style in order to show their noble authority . Widening Tungmen Street , which originally led through the East Gate , they left the Gate as the center of a traffic circle , so as to make it convenient for military parades as well as every-day horses and carriages . Full of traffic , the road was very impressive .  
They tore down the Matsu Temple , which was the center of religious life in Taipei , and built Kodama Goto Memorial Hall ( honoring the fourth Governor-General Kodama Gentaro and Senior Minister Goto Shinpei ) . Western classical music was played on the hall 's open-air stage all day long . All sorts of celebrations were also held here , as was the incomparably famous World Expo .  
The broad idea for this was floated two years ago . The hope is that Taiwan can take advantage of its geographic location , orthodox Chinese culture , business connections with overseas Chinese , and solid industrial base to become the regional center for foreign firms coming to the Asian region ( and especially for those firms investing in the PRC ) .  
On March 26 , 1988 , more than 200 brook masu salmon fry , each of them tagged for identification , prepared to leave the propagation center built for them by human beings and set out to return " home " - - to the Chichiawan Stream at Lishan in central Taiwan .  
At any rate , the investment required to open a computer center is not nearly as monumental as a factory or an overseas branch operation . With the use of satellite communications it really was n't that difficult . As far as Hong Kong and Shanghai is concerned , we were simply turning circumstances to our advantage . " Lo reveals that several dozen employees have returned by this method .  
" A lot of people in society have something to say , " affirms Liu Ta-chwan , network director for Chiao Tung University 's computer center . What gives the Net a superior edge over the conventional broadcast media is that radio talk shows have inherent time limitations , and they can cut callers off if they do n't like what is being said . The BBS is different . " It is basically very fair , because the capacity is unlimited . "  
Thus although the center has been running for over a year , the number attending has always stayed around 20 to 30 . Birds of passageThe old people who are most in need of daycare are those with restricted mobility or in poor health . But the shortage of medical and nursing staff in Taiwan , the high cost of providing such care and the fact that it is not covered by the National Health Insurance scheme mean that hospitals around the country have little inclination to set up daycare centers or residential nursing homes .  
Jade articles from the Liangzhu culture of Zhe-jiang Province include jade cong ( rectangular blocks with a circular hole through the middle ) carved with patterns ; huan ( discs with a large hole ) incised with images thought to depict Chi You , the eastern tribe leader slain by Huangdi ; jade bi ( ritual discs with a hole in the center ) incised with magical images , and so on .  
I was searching for some way to make myself happy . " " Eventually , I went to . . . " Cut to a new scene , bright and colorful , and we watch the young woman-her smiling face filled with hope-pushing open the door to a health and beauty center . " Here I become beautiful , and when I go home I can face them [ she is holding the two children ] with a refreshed outlook .  
Income and independenceMany people think of taxi driving as an excellent " reception center for the unemployed and waystation for those changing jobs . " One just has to pass the test to get a commercial driver 's license and sign up with a cab company , and one can immediately get on the road and start earning money .  
Many young people , unable to find work immediately after completing their military service , see driving a taxi as a job which offers independence and an apparently reasonable income , so they enter this " reception center for the unemployed and waystation for those changing jobs . "  
The tiles of the emperor 's palace in Peking shone " like gold " under the sun . The Bao En Temple in Nanking was particularly impressive , being constructed from a number of attractive buildings in the center of which was a porcelain pagoda of nine storeys , roofed with yellow and red tiles with hints of green . At its eaves were bells which rang continuously in the breeze .  
But because traffic is a more thorny problem in that part of the city , the site currently most favored by the city government is in the vicinity of the Sungshan tobacco factory in Nankang , a suburban area of northeast Taipei . This is further from the city center , a highway already goes by there , and a mass transit system station will soon be completed there . The city government argues that these will be of some help in moving large numbers of people .  
" The best situation would of course be cross-strait reconciliation , so that Taiwan could enter the middle phase of its national unification plan , and establish trade , transport and financial links on the basis of equal and friendly relations , " says C . J . Lee . At that point Taiwanese firms could base decisions as to whether to set up a center of operations directly in , say , Shanghai , or to go through Hong Kong , purely on commercial considerations , and would not have to shoulder an additional political burden .  
Under these circumstances , the government 's offshore shipping center may well have opened up a crack in the door for cross-strait shipping . Ships flying a foreign flag that have received government permission can sail straight from Kaohsiung Harbor to the mainland . What has not changed is that vessels flying the ROC flag , as always , can not cross the strait , and crafts flying the five-starred PRC flag are not allowed into Taiwan .  
After the plan for the offshore shipping center was brought before the public , the PRC government , which up until then had been constantly calling for direct cross-strait shipping to be established , based on the definition of a " domestic shipping line , " reversed its attitude 180 degrees . Since the regulation was passed over one year ago , not even one commercial ship has succeeded in crossing the strait .  
When Hsiu Ping-shan " retired " from politics , he drew inspiration from the recently popular " all-you-can-eat " restaurants to establish his own " all-you-can-write " center . The store is replete with brushes , ink , paper and ink stone , as well as exemplary calligraphy from all the great masters . Air conditioning and tea are provided , and a teacher even gives free instruction . Customers can arrive empty-handed and write to their hearts ' content .  
Lien Te-sen became famous for his work " MRT , " in which he rendered the character xing ( �� ) , meaning " motion , " in several disconnected pieces , and in the center drew the character gui ( �t ) , meaning " turtle , " in ancient seal script , thus mocking the progress of Taipei 's traffic and mass rapid transit system .  
In other words , even though the production base moves overseas , the " headquarters " and " logistical support center " remain in Taiwan . Operations items stay in Taiwan , along with capital sourcing , legal , tax , and financial planning , and training of internationalized personnel . All these could service the production bases located in surrounding countries .  
Before they even landed in Taiwan , Weidenhofer and Payne , who work for Artlab Australia , Down Under 's biggest restoration center , had already conducted tests on fragments Pottman had brought them , determining the composition of the paints used in the mural and finding suitable detergents . Still , they were very careful here , spending two weeks to repair just one wall of murals . In comparison to the water and soap that temples in Taiwan frequently use to clean their murals , this sort of slow and painstaking approach is extraordinary .  
One evening at about eight o'clock , after most people 's busy workdays have drawn to a close and they are peacefully settling down to watch the TV dramas about family love and crisis that prevail in this time slot , Hsieh Chiao-an , a volunteer at a psychological counseling center , is listening to true life stories about how a woman is physically abused by her philandering husband .  
My main work at the center has involved taking on psychological counseling cases , and serving as a group leader of empathy and self-affirmation groups , and emotional management groups for single-parent elementary school students . Accompanying people through their low times and sharing life experiences with them is a hard-to-come-by opportunity in this age when people lack ties to others .  
The judicial training center has lately increased the training it provides to prepare the judges in these areas , for example , taking the students abroad and having them tour legal gambling establishments ( all gambling is illegal in Taiwan ) and sex operations . In order to competently handle the traffic accidents which are more and more prevalent , the students must all learn to drive ; in order to combat the new styles of economic crimes , the aspiring judges must also make visits to securities exchanges .  
As far as Hong Kong residents are concerned , the pragmatic approach typical of businessmen suits the colony 's long-established role as a commercial center . As for Taiwan , Tung 's family has long had connections with high-level political figures in the ROC , giving rise to some optimism about what will happen after he takes over the reins of officialdom in Hong Kong . It is believed that Tung understands Taiwan relatively well , a fact which should be helpful in future communication and compromise .  
In the center of the long hanging scroll stand a mountain and trees . They have an imposing grandeur , yet are upright and balanced about a vertical central axis , unmoved by any wind . So although there are mountain pines on myriad peaks , where is the soughing wind ?  
At its most severe , cases of serious crime or crimes causing major damage or injury usually find the perpetrators given a sentence in a juvenile detention center . Other offenders might be placed in a juvenile reformatory and training school as in cases of theft or robbery . Youths charged in connection with altercations or fights might be sentenced to probation or weekend guidance . Those whose offenses are judged to be the lightest , such as runaways , truants , or those picked up wandering the streets , are usually let off with a stern warning .  
Originally the Defense Ministry planned to use the land for residential housing . But the local governments , elected officials at all levels , and scholars and experts , all lobbied for different proposals . There were people calling for the land to be used for commercial real estate , for a trade center , for a new city government office complex , for a university . . . . The argument raged for years .  
But it was n't until 1860 , when Britain annexed Kowloon and took possession of the now famous Victoria Harbour , that Hong Kong took its place as a vital center of global trade . At that time , colonial business capital swarmed into Hong Kong 's harbor and urban areas , quickly developing them into an international trading center with British companies at its core . Nineteenth-century Western businesses , offices , residences , and warehouses sprang up , instantly transforming the face of this traditional Chinese fishing village .  
It began with the late-Yuan Emperor Shun , who favored the south and moved the empire 's political center there . By the Ming dynasty , the scenic southern banks of the Yangtze River were also home to booming trade and a flowering of the arts which saw frequent performances of music and dance .  
The southern Taiwan sun beats down on the low , densely packed buildings of Er-kung New Village , a military dependents ' community in Tainan County . In the morning market , the crowds seem to boil . In contrast , the expansive grounds of Our Lady of the Assumption Church , located in the center of the village , seem particularly cool and serene .  
Venice , that romantic city on the water filled with historic architecture , was the wellspring of European capitalism and the Renaissance , and in recent years has developed into an important international exhibition center for movies , music and architecture . The celebrated film festival and this biennial art exhibition are two of the city 's great achievements .  
In the Palace Museum in Beijing , there is a painting entitled Listening to the Qin , by Emperor Huizong of the Song dynasty . In it , a brown-robed Daoist sits playing a qin under a pine tree . To left and right are " Two quietly musing guests , one with head raised , one with head bowed / To hear that stringless playing . " In the center of the picture , on a strangely shaped stone which serves as a pedestal , stands an elegant potted plant .  
Looking back over his life , the first half was spent at the center of momentous events while , in the second half , history has continued to move inexorably forward without his participation . Has he really just these few lines as his testimony ? Before his oral history is published in 2002 we can only understand him from the books that have been written about him .  
Cleveland was originally a center of machinery and steel . When the city fell on hard times , 30 local entrepreneurs formed a " roundtable " to find a way out of the mess . After four years of extensive discussions , they designed a strategic plan for the direction of future city development .  
" In the 1970s , scientists began to realize that synchrotron radiation was the greatest light source humanity had ever yet harnessed for scientific research , " says Keng S . Liang , deputy director of the center . " And accelerators designed to produce maximum synchrotron radiation were built one after another . " These represented the second generation of synchrotron accelerators .  
On this point , Chen Chien-te argues that considering the level of funding and the size of the center 's staff , the light beams have been coming on line pretty fast . Still , to meet researchers ' needs , apart from doing all they can to make the light beams more powerful , they are also negotiating with the Japanese synchrotron center to co-fund three hard X-ray beams at the Japanese center that would be specially designated for use by Taiwan researchers .  
In later years , although Taiwan had made tremendous progress relative to its situation 25 years before , the difficulties it faced in raising funds overseas were proportional to those it faced in surviving internationally , and this created more problems for the center . Moreover , domestically , the island was entering the democratic era . Most citizens , including the legislators who held the purse-strings , did n't understand the importance of the center and its contribution to the world . Consequently , the budget was cut repeatedly .  
In the late 1980s , the biggest crisis faced by the center was that some figures in the international agricultural community began to suggest that it would be best to establish an additional center elsewhere , to gradually supersede the Taiwan center , because of worries over the center 's future in a country that was widely barred from most other international organizations .  
Because the results of research over the previous decade gradually received international affirmation , in 1989 the World Bank approved the center 's five-year plan and provided substantial funding . The number of research projects increased substantially and regional cooperation projects were successively begun .  
In addition to improving the quality and quantity of vegetable production , its efforts allowed young soybeans to become a major agricultural export for Taiwan , which improved farmers ' incomes and earned foreign exchange for the country . Chou says that the center has also , over the years , nurtured a large pool of skilled personnel from both overseas and Taiwan .  
The center has increased its range of research substantially since its establishment , and the external environment has also become more complex . However , its objectives remain as unchanged as the simple exterior of its building-improving the lives of people in difficult environments and offering them a better future .  
The Overseas Affairs Commission established the Chinese Culture Center on two acres of land , and it is the most expansive such center in the world . Apart from five classrooms , it also has separate rooms for badminton and ping-pong and a dance room of more than 3500 square feet . The mere sight of it fills new and prospective members with great expectations , making them eager to give the seniors ' association activities a try .  
What university ? Beijing was the capital , and had a very conservative atmosphere . In the five-and-a-half years during which Tsai Yuan-pei was in charge of Beida , he changed it from a place reeking of bureaucratism to a center of lively , progressive thinking .  
In that time of controversy , " Tsai Yuan-pei could be said to have been the least controversial personality , " says Ambrose King in the book Daxue de Linian ( The Idea of the University ) . In his hands , Beida became a real university , a center for new culture and modern thinking in China . But Tsai did not belong only to Beida ; he also belonged to a larger academic and cultural community .  
Also , from the Eastern Han ( 25-220 ) onward , the political center gradually moved from north China to south of the Yangtze . This geographical shift brought with it a gradual change in spatial attitudes . The limestone geology of southern China has endowed it with many deep and mysterious caves which nature has fashioned into remarkable shapes , and these constantly fired human imaginations .  
Taiwan 's " plum rains " were particularly heavy this year . The storms brought by the stationary front that creates the plum rains in June quickly raised water levels in the island 's reservoirs to dangerous levels . In the center and south of the island , from the mountains to the coastal plains , there were almost daily reports of flooding and landslides .  
Two years ago , the special education center at National Taiwan Normal University conducted a survey of Taiwanese firms which made the above bias all too clear . The results indicated that bosses were most willing to hire handicapped persons whose disability involved their arms or legs . The next most " popular " were the hearing impaired , followed by the mentally retarded . Visually-impaired persons did not make a single boss ' list .  
As for the current surplus of NT $ 40 billion that NHI has on its books , Chuang Yi-chou , director of the administrative center at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and a national policy advisor to the president , says that it was created by overestimates of the average number of dependents per family and by excess contributions from employers .  
After winning first prize for Young Designer at the second annual awards , Paul Shen went on to carry off the gold medal at the inaugural Fashion Design Competition for Young Designer of Asia , held in Taiwan the following year . This led to an invitation from one of the judges , Pierre Cardin , to take up a post as assistant designer at Pierre Cardin 's design center in France .  
Market numbers tell the story . The privately-operated CGMH , which is the largest health-care organization in Taiwan , opened its first TCM department , fully staffed by doctors with dual backgrounds in both TCM and Western medicine , at its Linkou medical center two years ago . The number of patients seen by its out-patient clinic has grown explosively to its current level of around 25,000 per month , an average of approximately 1,000 per day .  
There have been several attempts to get around the problem of insufficient objectivity in the diagnostic methods . Dr . Julia Tsuei and Chung Chieh , the former head of the traditional medical center at Veteran 's Memorial Hospital , developed the " Qin Value Detector " based on the principles of acupuncture and the meridian system .  
Public facilities in the village are first-rate , including three primary schools , a junior high school , a senior high school , an employee day care center , an employee discount store , traditional fruit and vegetable markets , restaurants , athletic fields , a golf driving range , a public swimming pool , a library , a cinema , a hospital , and even a funeral home .  
After the repeal of martial law , the provincial authority in charge of public security turned Green Island into a " reeducation center " for reforming criminals whose thinking needed changing or whose political views were problematic .  
In restaurants in Tungkang , center of Taiwan 's tuna industry , the eyes of the big-eyed tuna , formerly discarded as useless , are now deemed big attractions . These eyes , each nearly 10 cm in diameter , cooked up with some sour cabbage , are promoted by restaurant owners as being rich in DHA , which they say " makes your head healthy and strong ! "  
Although the political center of China in ancient times was in cities far from the sea such as Chang'an ( modern Xi'an ) and Luoyang , those who lived close to rivers ate food from the rivers , and those who lived close to lakes ate food from the lakes . The Yellow River basin-the cradle of Chinese culture-provided a rich harvest of freshwater fish and crustaceans , and thus gave birth to Chinese people 's taste for eating all kinds of aquatic produce fresh from the " three rivers , four seas and five lakes . "  
Two important pieces of legislation were passed in regard to educating the populace . The " Citizens ' Education Law " was modified to encourage private individuals to engage in private education . The principle of " nine years of continuous compulsory education " was revised to state that " curricula shall center around students ' all-round mental and physical development and emphasize continuity . "  
This center covers over 10,000 square meters . It is spacious and transport is convenient . It is said that during Tseng Kuang-shun 's time as director of Taiwan 's Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee the property was acquired through the efforts of two center directors . Cheng Hsin-pen made initial arrangements and Liang Po-chien signed the contract to complete the deal .  
The lower end of the neck on each of the heads ends in a pointed diamond shape , suggesting that the heads were all mounted on bodies made of some other material , and that they were arranged in solemn majesty around an altar , with the big bronze statue standing in the center . After the sacred rite was completed , the beautifully crafted statues and ceremonial implements were burnt , broken , and placed in the pit . Why would anyone have done this ?  
However , to date the exchange center has not been able to balance demand with supply . Lin Chih-sen , a division chief at the IDB , comments that many raw materials derived from waste do not have the same level of purity as original feedstocks , and so do not meet manufacturers ' requirements . Hence the proportion of waste materials offered through the exchange center which are actually sold is very low-less than 10% .  
The center of Hsinchu City has recently had a makeover . The old moat , which lay neglected for many years , crosses the city like a blue sash , lined with grassy levees and neatly laid footpaths . As you stroll in the shade of the trees , the leaves overhead stir in the summer breeze , and the sunshine dapples the ground with flecks of dancing light like little imps frisking at your feet .  
In addition to the snacks sold at the little stalls crowded around the entrance to the temple of the city god , there are plenty of other traditional foods to be found in the tight web of streets and historic sites of Hsinchu 's city center . These include round meat dumplings , meat broth , duck noodles and Hakka-style broad rice noodles .  
The rushing waters , small boats , astonishing mountains , dazzling cliffs , sparkling waterfalls , and colorful and rapidly changing skies have been a source of wonder and inspiration for literati and artists since ancient times . The area has been a major center of civilization in China , and was the birthplace of renowned patriot-poet Qu Yuan and the statesman Zhuge Liang , among many others . Above all , it has been the home of countless generations of ordinary Chinese who have made their living around the river .  
When Tiway Sayion retired from his position as principal of Hualien 's Tafalong Primary School after a teaching career that spanned 45 years , his first act was to realize a long-cherished dream-he returned to the tribal community where he was born and built a cabin in which to live . Tiway Sayion 's simple 20-ping cabin is laid out with the kitchen and bathroom on the right and the bedroom on the left . The center is his living room , furnished with only a sofa and bookshelves .  
Last year the Buddha 's Light International Association organized New Year 's Eve dinners in the north , center and south of Taiwan , which were attended by more than 5,000 old folk who live alone . This year they are repeating the exercise , and are including a special event in Nantou County to bring some warmth and love to elderly survivors of the 9 / 21 earthquake there .  
It must also be remembered that DPP party members are the chief executives in the large majority of Taiwan 's cities and counties . Now that the DPP also controls executive power at the central level , the political map will have a green line running from localities to the center .  
In the center of one of the exhibition rooms , the NPM has laid out a realistic picture of the life of the literati , based on a portrayal in an anonymous Song painting . The main character sits alone in front of a painted screen depicting wild and domestic fowl . To one side , a servant pours tea from a white porcelain pot ; on a table are two or three dishes of fruit and snacks . In front of the scholar stands a basket of classically arranged flowers .  
Years before Copernicus advanced the theory that the sun was at the center of the universe , da Vinci surmised that the earth revolved around the sun ; before Galileo improved the telescope , da Vinci had drawn designs for telescopes ; long before the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , he invented a lathe , a lifting jack , a water pump , a lift , and geared machinery ; he was also the first to use the modern plus and minus signs in mathematics .  
As the first Taiwanese president , Lee Teng-hui 's success did a lot to assuage the anger of the Taiwanese people about the discrimination they had experienced . This won him a lot of support . On top of that , once in power he implemented a policy of shifting the island 's cultural center of gravity away from mainland China and more toward Taiwan itself , and he criticized the KMT as being " a regime of outsiders . " These positions won him 54% of the vote in the first direct presidential election .  
Chen Ding-nan , the new minister of justice , plans to establish an " independent commission against corruption " and a " black gold activities investigation center , " with offices in the north , center , and south of Taiwan . Plans are also afoot to produce legislation that will prevent " black gold " activities from taking on a legal veneer that protect them from punishment .  
In addition to being an important cultural center in ancient India , the Gandhara region of northwest India ( straddling the modern-day border between Pakistan and Afghanistan ) , had also been a part of the Greek empire for a time , and was deeply influenced by Hellenic culture . In Buddhist sculpture from Gandhara , the figures have the deeply set eyes , aquiline noses , and curly hair so typical of Greek statues .  
At a symposium on Buddhist music held earlier this year at Fokuangshan , a center for Buddhist studies and worship , several Buddhist academics voiced concern about the popularization and commercialization of the form , and its loss of sacramental character . As they pointed out : take away the title and the chanting , and you 're left with pure pop .  
Lo says that the main countries that will be at the center of future diplomatic work , besides the ROC 's existing diplomatic partners , will be the nations of North America and Europe . " The academic community is a major source of staff people for the executive branch , while congressmen set the direction of legislation and executive officials determine how it is implemented . In the future more emphasis will be placed on contacts at these three levels with European and North American countries , " he says .  
When the Dutch took over Tainan , they encouraged the cultivation and export of cane sugar , a crop that grew exceptionally well on the Chianan Plain stretching out from Tainan in almost every direction . On the strength of this economic base , Tainan naturally became the political center of Taiwan . Although southern Taiwan is dominated today by Kaohsiung , back then the latter was just one of Tainan 's satellite ports , with development limited by heavy silting and shallow berths .  
However , explains Huang Wu-ta , director of the Taiwan Institute of Urban History , the conditions did not yet exist that would have allowed Jiaozaitu to serve as the capital . The overland transportation network during the late Qing dynasty was extremely poor , and people traveled north-south in Taiwan mainly via the sea . This factor marginalized Jiaozaitu , which had no port . Central Taiwan 's key population center was farther south in the coastal city of Lukang .  
In the early days , most of the micro-organisms held by the center were types widely used internationally such as yeasts and red yeasts . But in recent years , in the interests of preserving biodiversity and protecting native resources , the center has reorganized and is directing the major part of its efforts towards developing native fungi . " Native and marine micro-organisms will be the main focus of our future work , " declares the center 's mission statement .  
The patient at the center of the story , Chou Chin-yao , eventually published an account of the incident entitled A Skin Graft with Love ( 1984 ) . " Each time I recall the extraordinary grace that Dr . and Mrs . Landsborough bestowed on one so sick , it brings me to tears , even though half a century has passed since then . Words can not describe the intensity of my gratitude .  
Twenty years ago theorists proposed that the magnetic field extended down below the sun 's surface to a depth of 0.7 solar radii from the center of the sun surface , but signals from the magnetic field are very weak , and could not be detected by the methods and instruments then available . But today acoustic imaging has enabled Chou Dean-yi to find much stronger evidence in support of the 20-year-old theory , and this is highly significant for solar astronomy .  
Leaving behind peaceful , picturesque Tsaotun , we come to Puli Township , which is a center of art , culture and scenic beauty . Downtown Puli is bustling and appears completely restored , but in the surrounding boroughs and villages many problems still hamper both physical reconstruction and economic recovery .  
The average age of this group of granddads and grandmas was over 60 . With their dark , weathered complexions and cheery smiles , they vigorously set to work in the Huanshan and Lishan Roads area of Neihu , helping local residents clean out the deep layer of mud from their homes . In the evening , they bedded down on the floor in the activity center of a local middle school .  
It aims to bring together leading political and other figures who place Taiwan at the center of their thinking . It also claims to be a third force outside the conventional political structure that has established a partnership with the current administration , which shares similar ideals , and to be a " do tank " that gives equal emphasis to planning and to practice .  
This July , planning will be completed for the first free port in Taiwan , which should increase the efficiency of the movement of goods significantly . This will be helpful to Taiwan 's becoming a regional operations center for both local businesses and multinational companies .  
To date , the DCB has acquired four new technologies with medical applications , including a platform to generate human monoclonal antibodies against entrovirus type 71 , and drugs with the potential to treat complications resulting from chronic heart failure and diabetes .

" The approach adopted now at chinatimes.com is to integrate a number of e-papers and mail these out to members . Although no fees are collected from members , the profit lies in the hidden vertical-depth e-commerce represented by each member , " says Michael Chang , chief operations officer . By working with businesses , treating the e-paper platform as a giant shopping center , and using integrated operations , not only can a news-oriented e-paper survive , its professional reputation can be a guarantee of reliability to consumers .  
AVRDC director Samson C.S . Tsou points out that in nearly 30 years in Taiwan , the center 's accomplishments include raising both the quality and yields of a wide variety of tropical vegetables , including tropical tomatoes , vegetable soybeans , and crucifers . Its staff have also worked to improve the nutritional status and incomes of people in developing countries around Asia . Taiwan has been the primary source of financial support , accounting for nearly 60% of the center 's US $ 10 million budget .  
Its personnel and programs have made an outstanding contribution , earning the title " the quiet achievers . " The low-profile AVDRC specially organized the open day to express gratitude for the tremendous support that the host nation has provided . In addition , the center also hopes to use media coverage to demonstrate to Taiwan 's citizens their nation 's critical contribution to bettering the lives of people throughout Asia .  
Therefore , in the first decade of the FFTC 's existence , its programs were focused on soil and fertilizer management , the nutrient requirements of rice plants , and control of major rice pests . It was the first international center to specialize in control of rice brown plant hopper , which became much more destructive after the introduction of short-term high-yielding rice varieties and chemical pesticides .  
When you enter the building , the fragrance of java wafts across from the coffee shop on the first floor . The four levels downstairs constitute the digital learning center , which was opened for use only in September . The architect Lin Chou-min , who designed the immensely successful Eslite bookstore chain , was brought in to lay out the learning center . The more than 1000 square meter space includes a wireless Internet zone , a multimedia production area , small audiovisual conference rooms , and a corner theater .  
It will still take a long time to establish just what specific curative effects alternative therapies have . But since the former Office of Alternative Medicine at the US National Institutes of Health was expanded into a " national center " in 1998 , its annual research budget has grown hugely , from US $ 2 million then to US $ 150 million today .  
The Estate is not the only structure closely connected to the history of Wufeng to be in this condition . The Wan Fo Temple , a busy religious center that was located in the mountains behind the provincial assembly building , was once the largest Buddhist monastery and temple complex in the entire rural township . Its most distinctive feature was a 20-meter tall golden statue of Baisajyagurvaiduryaprabhasa in a seated position . Though the statue itself is still intact , the remainder of the structure was eradicated by the earthquake .  
Perhaps the SARS outbreak can remind humankind that regardless of ethnic differences , of how powerful a nation may be , and of whether it stands at the center or on the periphery of world affairs , in the face of a tiny virus the divisions and conflicts of the human world are nothing more than a farce . In the face of the disease , ideological and ethnic differences that are often seen as insurmountable , come to appear insignificant .  
A doctor from a health center located in a southern county , who wishes to remain anonymous , says that when SARS hit , because the center had been converted into a treatment center , more than half their time was spent in examining patients rather than doing general epidemic prevention work . Indeed , even now the government lacks a clear focus for future tasks such as promoting cervical examinations , encouraging neighborhood environmental hygiene , or taking preventive measures against chronic diseases .  
When dengue fever was attacking southern Taiwan , the average health center in a rural township had only five employees . But communities there are spread widely and it required a great deal of time and personnel to visit each and every community and inspect outdoor containers of standing water , destroy carrier mosquitoes , and spray disinfectant .  
The soft-spoken Lee studied sociology at university , and for more than 20 years has built his career around social work . In the 1990s , while running an Ilan halfway house , he also began training as a counselor to better help people deal with psychological disorders . Lee then returned to his hometown of Tungshan in 1997 and established a counseling center . In 1999 , Tungshan attempted to hold an election for the position of executive director , but no one wanted to run .  
Sister Therese says women spend varying amounts of time in the Good Shepherd center . During an average two-week to three-month stay of an urgent case , the social workers first try to get an understanding of the new bride 's background and situation . They then give some " emotional first-aid " to put the women at ease . Finally they focus on the particularities of each individual case and offer assistance .  
Take for example the laws on domestic violence . Every locality has established a commission and a center for prevention of domestic violence , but these typically lack adequate staffing . For example , there are only two social workers assigned to handling domestic violence cases for all the married women in Hsinchu County , so you can guess what the quality of services there is like .  
Li by this time had achieved considerable recognition in Taiwan for his skills , but he was n't satisfied , and so in 1991 he went to Yixing , a famous pottery center in China 's Jiangsu Province , to learn the secret of how the teapots from there got to be so perfect for the function of brewing fine teas . Studying under master potter Qin Youtao , Li learned to make Yixing-style teapots . His aim was to combine artistic sense and utilitarian excellence in his works .  
To this end , in October 2003 the center established the Suicide Prevention Center . It also appointed " informers " in police bureaus , fire brigades , and neighborhood hospitals to build a protection net . As soon as the center receives an attempted suicide report from an emergency ward , it tries to conduct a thoroughgoing follow-up and to provide psychological counseling to the patient to prevent another suicide attempt .  
Perhaps because Yushan is located in the most remote part of Taiwan 's mountainous regions , and access is difficult , it has largely escaped deforestation , with the exception of the cypress forests of the Nantsaihsien River , which were completely logged out , and outlying areas such as Tungpu and Tataka . The core areas in the center of the national park still boast virgin forests and a vibrant ecology .  
Eventually the detention center called for Wang Chang-li 's assistance . Wang 's kindly , smiling face and sympathetic ear washed away their hostility , and after hearing them plead their case , he encouraged them not to give up on life and to carry on appealing their sentences , to fight for their chance to live .  
Besides conducting , Lee also mingled with the musicians , playing some percussion here and there . His obvious delight showed not in the least that this is a very ill man who has been long under medical care . Once absorbed in the music , Lee Tai-hsiang even moved to center stage and in a playful voice sang a medley of some of his songs that are by now familiar to everyone , such as " Sunlit Highway , " " A Beautiful Mistake , " and " Let Me Sing You One of Our Songs . "  
Li sets her stories in her hometown of Lukang , here appearing as the city of Lu , about which vengeful female spirits have entrenched themselves , one each to the north , south , east , and west , and another in its center . Their implacability has put them outside of the cycle of life and death-unable to be reborn , they tarry in the human world as ghosts . Over the course of time , these ghosts have participated in and even helped to forge the island 's history .  
Because of strong support from parents and schools , not only has there been a quantitative increase in the number of players , but a clear qualitative increase as well . Since the first breakthrough in 1999 when Chen Chin-feng signed a contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers of the US , over the past several years international talent hunters have scouted more than 15 of Taiwan 's top players , and Taiwan has become a main center for the development of talent for global baseball .  
The area was once central Taiwan 's main aquacultural center , with all kinds of fish being raised there . Traders would come from around the island to strike deals with the local farmers , who did double duty as their own wholesalers . For a while , trade was brisk , but over recent decades the industry has been on the decline , and is now of little real note . Already it seems like people are forgetting this important part of Taiwan 's history .  
" Hong Kong now enjoys social stability , and the situation is encouraging , " the spokesman said , noting that over the past century the people of Hong Kong have built their home with hard work and wisdom , which is typical of the Chinese nation as a whole , into an important international trade , financial and shipping center  
yongnian county is located in the center of the north china plain , with rich land and convenient transportation farmers living here have the tradition of planting vegetables at present the county 's vegetable planting area is nearly 9,000 ha , with an annual production volume of about 400-million kg
