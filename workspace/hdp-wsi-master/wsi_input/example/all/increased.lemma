Chongming is China 's third largest island .  It possesses excellent geographical qualifications and a long history .  Since reform and opening up , Chongming county 's development in economic construction and opening up to the outside has been swift and vigorous , enterprises with foreign investment have been continuously increasing in number , import and export commodities have increased greatly in quantity , and it is one of the hundred strong counties that constitute China 's actual strength .  
At the same time , China imported technology and complete sets of equipment from more than thirty countries and regions , and the total amount of contract funds has increased by nearly 50% over that of the " seventh five-year plan " period .  It also exported its technology to more than 50 countries and regions of the world , with contracting funds reaching more than 8 billion US dollars , increasing 2.7 times over that of the " seventh five-year plan " period .  
Guangdong 's electronic industry has realized the strategic shift " from a domestic sales focus to an overseas sales focus " , and product exports increased swiftly .  In 1995 , 7.325-million telephones , 3.19-million TV sets , 10.65-million radio tape recorders , and nearly 3-million sets of hi-fi equipment were exported .  The export volume accounted for 50% - 90% of the total output respectively and the export deliveries have ranked first in China for many years running .  
According to presentations , because foreign funded enterprises increased equipment imports as investments , and additionally , China , for the first time opened its foreign trade area to foreign capital in Pudong and established three joint venture trade companies , with imports and exports of foreign funded enterprises in Pudong this year increasing 37.4% compared with the same period last year , and reaching 3.86-billion US dollars while accounting for 45% of Pudong 's total imports and exports .  
It is estimated that industries of the entire province at the township level and above will have accumulated completed sales values of 23-billion yuan , increasing by 16% over last year .  The overall benefit of the industrial economy has bounced back , and the industrial enterprises with independent business accounts have increased profits .  
Bangguo Wu pointed out that China 's land-based petroleum industry achieved great success last year , and oil and gas production volume increased by 1.81-million tons and 730-million cubic meters respectively compared with the previous year ; with nearly 1-million tons of shared oil from overseas , its growth rate was the highest since the " seventh five-year plan " period ( 1986-1990 ) ; its economic benefits were considerable , turning over 25.8-billion yuan of taxes , achieving profits of 10-billion yuan ; making great achievements in scientific and technological progress .  
The analysis of the State Statistical Bureau shows , last year , there were still certain problems during the industrial economy operation , for instance , capital defaults increased , deficits were still serious , fundamental products such as energy resources , raw materials , etc . grew at low rates , the transfer of industrial structure was considerably slow , and all these are restraining factors assailing the further healthy development of an industrial economy .  
According to presentations , the dependency of China 's exported products on the Japanese market has been increasing annually , but the proportion of imported products in the total import volume from Japan has fluctuated irregularly ; the development of various trade methods was not balanced , general trade has decreased , processing trade has increased ; while the growth of primary product trade was considerably fast .  
Insufficient domestic funds have been made up by utilizing foreign capital ; this has increased the state tax revenue and foreign exchange earnings , promoted economic restructuring and the optimization of the industrial structure , accelerated the blending of China 's economy with the world economy , and created a large number of job opportunities .  Products turned out by foreign-funded enterprises have greatly enriched the material lives of our people .  
The utilization of foreign capital has made up the deficiency of funds needed for construction projects at home .  It has increased the state 's revenues and gains on foreign exchange , promoted the adjustment of economic structure , optimized industrial structure , accelerated integration of China 's economy with the world 's economy , and created a large amount of employment opportunities.In addition , products manufactured by foreign-funded enterprises have greatly enriched people 's material life .  
During the five years , the political , economic , social and other achievements made by our country have attracted worldwide attention .  We have deepened our reform , increased our strength , raised our international standing , expanded our influence and improved our living standard .  
In view of the drop in people 's income expectations and the rise in their expenditure expectations , and their insufficient consumption capacity , we raised the standard of the basic living needs of workers laid off from state enterprises , the unemployed , those urban residents eligible for the lowest basic living needs , and others on low incomes , and increased the wages of workers of organs , undertakings , and units , and the pensions of retired personnel .  
Take our Jian area as an example : After reform and opening up , it practiced the household contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output and the cooperative shares system and adopted multiple operational forms in the state-owned enterprises , so that the economic strength repeatedly increased , the people 's living standards were continuously enhanced , and the peasants ' per capita income grew from 130 yuan in 1978 to more than 2,000 yuan last year .  
9.8 billion yuan for the establishment of science and technology development fund , a knowledge innovation project , and increased investment in basic science research and key scientific and technological projects , increasing by 14.6 percent as compared with the previous year ;  
Practice over the past 21 years has proved that the policy of " the whole society engaging in afforestation and the whole nation committed to turning the country green " has brought into play the superiority of the socialist system and suits the actual condition of our country , which is faced with an arduous task of ecological building but lacks capital .  It has also significantly increased people 's awareness of the need to keep the country green .  
Deputy Doje Cering , commissioner of the Ngari Prefectural Administrative Office in Tibet , said : Thanks to its national unity and social stability , Ngari Prefecture has attracted more and more people from the interior of the country to do business or set up enterprises in the prefecture .  The prefecture 's annual tax revenue from the individual and private economic sectors increased from less than 100,000 yuan in 1997 to more than 1-million yuan in 1999 .  
With the approval of the Ninth NPC Standing Committee , the central budget was adjusted ; discount interests on state treasury bonds for increasing investment in infrastructure construction and enterprises ' technological transformation were increased ; extra budgetary revenues were used to increase wages of staff members and workers of administrative units and institutions and to increase social insurance revenues ;  
In light of the situation in Yunnan , indeed , only by maintaining relatively rapid economic growth under the precondition of enhancing effectiveness can the enterprises ' difficulty in production and operation be mitigated , the pressure of employment be lessened , and the structural adjustment and in-depth reformed be promoted , so that financial revenue can be increased , financial risks be prevented , and social stability be maintained .  
The deputies and committee members were of the view : Although currently the overall situation is marked by social stability and sustained economic growth , we have been facing in-depth contradictions and problems accumulated over the years and new challenges arising from phased changes in economic development , such as effective demand in the domestic market has been insufficient , contradictions resulting from the unreasonable economic structure have become increasingly prominent , the employment pressure has increased , and increase in peasants ' incomes have slowed down .  
Since the beginning of reform and opening up , the egalitarian system of eating from the same big pot in rural areas has been broken , households have become the main entities for economic operation and investment , and peasants have continuously increased their initiative in participating in the social , political , and economic lives .  
In the face of the new situation of insufficient effective demand in the last two years , the central government put forward the fundamental policy of expanding demand and implemented a proactive fiscal policy and other supporting macroeconomic policies .  It issued additional treasury bonds and increased investment in infrastructure construction and technological transformation to bring along bank lending and nongovernmental investment and expand investment demand .  
After Tibet 's peaceful liberation , especially since the Democratic Reform , the people of all ethnic groups on this snow plateau have been living in harmony and sharing weal and woe with one another .  They have gradually formed a socialist ethnic relationship marked by equality , unity , and mutual assistance .  Reform and opening-up have increased economic and technological exchanges between the Tibetans and the people of other ethnic groups , thereby enhancing their solidarity .  
It is necessary to adhere to the principle of doing ideological and political work and doing economic and vocational work at the same time .  Ideological and educational work should permeate practical work , and the actual results in ideological and political work should be increased .  
According to the " 2000 report on China 's national economic and social development " published recently by the State Planning Commission , in 1999 , the total employment of China 's primary industry reduced by 1.96-million and that of the secondary industry increased by only 2.54-million , while the tertiary industry not only absorbed the great majority of the year 's new labor force but also accepted some of the labor force transferred from primary and secondary industry . 
But over the years , Lee Teng-hui [ Li Denghui ] has repeatedly provoked the " one China " principle , kept trying to solicit foreigners ' support , and hugely increased military spending for armament development .  Since the 1990 ' s , the national defense spending has grown by an average of 6.94 percent , with over $ 12-billion actual budget per year .  Over $ 40-billion has also been invested in purchasing weaponry , in a vain bid to " resist reunification with force " , which is , in reality , an idle dream .  
According to the latest statistics made by the People 's Bank of China , in the first quarter of this year , China 's banking and financial operations were normal and stable and showed a trend of positive development .  Continual increases in money supply and total credit met the need in expanding domestic demand , promoting production and the growth of consumption , and conformed in the main to the economic development .  The deposits of enterprises increased by a great extent , loans extended by financial institutions were expedited , and foreign exchange reserves increased steadily .  
Analyzing the distribution of increased loans , we can see that those loans have not only satisfied the need of state key construction projects , infrastructure construction and the reasonable funds requirement of large and medium sized enterprises , but also supported the development of medium and small enterprises and non-public sectors of the economy as well as the personal consumption needs .  Those loans have played an important role in expanding domestic consumption and promoting economic development .  
China 's economy has maintained a favorable momentum of sustained , rapid and sound development , ranking the seventh in the world in terms of economic aggregates .  Its overall national strength has increased markedly and the texture of life of its people improved notably .  
As in-depth changes in the military fields in the world are caused by the development of modern science and technology , especially high technology , the scientific and technological content of army building and modern warfare has been increased to an unprecedentedly high level .  This has put ever higher demands on the scientific and cultural qualities of our officers and men .  
However , since the goals were not clear and the standards were not clear , the understanding of " computerization and informationization " led to an emphasis on hardware , while taking software lightly ; an emphasis on single units , while taking networking lightly ; and an emphasis on development and redundant construction projects .  Shortcomings occurred where systems construction was not complete ; technical systems were not compatible ; and non unified standards increased daily .  
After the new technologies and new methods of operation produced through the academy and troops ' joint effort in tackling key problems were popularized and applied in the various relevant units , the scientific and technological content of army training have greatly increased .  As a result , troop training through science and technology , in which the troops under training strike extreme low-altitude , high-speed targets with air defense missiles , has gotten over its " bottleneck " and is developing in the direction of high quality and greater depth .  
Starting last year , we implemented drastic reforms in such overall areas of the enterprises as management models , mechanisms for motion , and management scope .  We greatly increased overall planning and policy , liquidation and investment , capital management , organized marketing , science and technology research and development for customer service and handling of public relations , and basically realized transformation from a State administered company to large size enterprise group .  
It was reported that the north and the south of the peninsula have continually stepped up all sorts of exchanges with each other in order to create a favorable atmosphere for the forthcoming north-south summit .  The news media of both the north and the south have cut down on their recriminations against each other to a considerable extent and have increased their propaganda reports calling for strengthening dialogue and cooperation instead .  
First , the final document avoids a grim aspect of the current international security situation in order to achieve unanimity in consultations .  In recent years , military factors have increased in international relations , with some military groups being expanded and strengthened .  
They also pointed out : Economic globalization has impacted the industries and domestic markets of developing countries that are in a " vulnerable positions " on differing degrees , and have greatly increased the risks of economic fluctuations and of triggering a financial crisis in a country .  Economic globalization has continuously widened the gap between the rich and the poor around the globe , and the economic sovereignty and independence of many countries have been tested .  
He said : Over the last few years , although the home electrical appliance industry , including the color television industry , has faced fierce competitions and experienced many price wars and price cuttings , and the price signal has indicated that supply of home electrical appliance has seriously outstripped market demand , the production capacity of home electrical appliance has not shrunk - - as a matter of fact , it has increased to some degree .  Moreover , not many enterprises have been eliminated .  The market competition mechanism has not played a noticeable role .  
After the beginning of reform and opening-up , our country 's gross economic quantity continued to expand .  GDP increased from 362.4-billion yuan to over 8,000-billion yuan , ranking seventh place in the world and ranking first among all developing countries .  The output of major farm produce and industrial products also ranks in an advanced position in the world .  
Statistical data from a battlefield showed that , after a tank crew have stayed in a small and closed space for a long time where it is filled with various kinds of radiation , waste gases , electromagnetic waves , heat , and noises , tank speed reduced by 19 percent , time to complete shooting increased by 35 percent , miss-hitting increased by 4 percent , and , in real-combat exercises , their fighting capacity declined by 7 to 10 percent everyday .  
The lightning pace of the advance of modern technology is right now influencing the earth on which we live with its mysterious power .  It is creating an unprecedented productive force , but at the same time , it also brings a host of problems like energy crises , environmental pollution , filth from the Internet , and increased polarization on a global scale .  Humanity even has the " nuclear threat " , with which it can destroy itself many times over .  
Compared to the same period last year , among the 14 key industries , metallurgical , petrochemical , machinery , electronics , light industry , textile , pharmaceutical , tobacco , and gold industries saw their profits increased and the power industry maintained a relatively high level of profitability .  
Besides , the armored units , the missile units , and other heavy equipment formed organic units to take part in the training for the first time in places over 5,000 m above the sea level on an average in the hinterland of the Kalakunlun Shan . The troops were tempered and their combat capability on plateaus under conditions similar to those of an actual combat was increased .  
The ice slabs , ice tunnels , and ice trenches in a certain defensive zone were natural obstacles that delayed our tactical movements in the past .  This time , our infantry detachments , which followed the armored cars , were imbued with heroism and forged straight ahead .  Their combat capability has obviously increased .  
As compared with the same period last year , among 14 major trades , metallurgical , petrochemical , machinery , electronic , light , textile , pharmaceutical , tobacco , and gold industries experienced increased profits .  Power industry continuously maintained a fairly high level of profit .  
In consumption , last year 84-million medium and low-wage townsfolk increased their income , bank interest was reduced , tax on interest was levied , and the system of true names for deposits was put into effect , festival holidays were extended , and other policies for stimulating consumption were put into effect ; all this played a role in encouraging people , with the result that social consumption changed out of the slackness of the previous two years .  
Through making efforts over the last 20 years or so , we have eventually opened up a most lively , active , and creative ideological and political situation in the history of our party and country and the ideological level and understanding capability of the masses of people have been greatly increased .  
The input into the construction of ecological construction has been noticeably increased .  The engineering projects of returning grain plots to forestry and protecting natural forests and the projects of harnessing " three rivers " ( Huaihe River , Liaohe River , and Haihe River ) and " three lakes " ( Taihu Lake , Dianchi Lake , and Chaohu Lake ) have obtained phased achievements .  The environmental quality in urban areas has improved and the sense of environmental protection among the whole people has noticeably enhanced .  
And the scientific and technological elements in these direct investments of foreign businessmen have increased , more transnational corporations have come to invest in China , and the scale of independent investments has expanded .  
In the face of the new situation , new state of affairs , and new issues , we have timely readjusted those moderately tight financial policies and monetary policies into actively financial policies and steady and safe monetary policies and coordinately applied various means to regulate and control economic operations .  We have both increased investment in infrastructure construction and supported the technical renovation of enterprises .  
Judging from the implementation of the five-year plan in the first four years , a sustained and steady growth was attained in agricultural production , the conditions of the supply and demand of agricultural products were fundamentally improved , the agricultural structural adjustment made a new advance , agriculture and the non-agricultural sector developed unceasingly , the peasants ' incomes increased to some extent , quality of life was further enhanced , and the rural economy obtained comprehensive development .  
With the acceleration of the establishment of the modern enterprise system , the strategic readjustment of the national economy , and the successive introduction of major reform measures , such as changing debts into equity , mergers and reorganization , the vitality of state-owned enterprises increased significantly and the goal of getting enterprises out of their plight was basically attained .  
The state has increased the intensity of investment in the ecological construction , carried out the natural forest protection project in a comprehensive way , activated the experimental project of returning land unfit for cultivation to forestry , prevented and controlled desertification , engaged in the work of soil and water conservation vigorously , controlled the water pollution in some major rivers to reach the targets within the time limit , and took the perpetual use of natural resources and the coordinated development of economy and environment more seriously than ever before .  
Besides , it has taken into consideration that providing long distance logistic support is prone to air raids by the enemy and has used abandoned vehicles to set up fake car parks , fake oil refueling stations , fake rear commanding posts , fake medical centers , and used camouflage in the air to hide the real and show the fake .  It has developed , through exploration , various means and methods to " guard against precision attacks , electronic attacks , reconnaissance and monitoring so that the overall logistic protection capability has been remarkably increased " .  
This requires the maintenance of the democratic centralist system and the effective implementation of the collective leadership system and the regulations for making decisions through collective discussion .  The internal supervision and the check-and-balance capacity inside leading bodies must be increased .  
In the exercise of " continuous attacks by submarines against an enemy frigate formation " organized by the base in early November , commanders of the " Red " and the " Blue " sides carried out confrontations without giving advance notice on their operational intentions .  Strong winds and heavy storms happened to be ragging at the sea area where the drill was conducted .  Large sea waves and low visibility increased the difficulty of spotting the targets .  
Fourth , the mutual visits and reunion of separated families of both sides and the fluttering of " flags of both sides on the Korean peninsula " during the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games increased understanding between the north and the south , and expressed their wishes of realizing peaceful reunification through self-reliance .  
After the reversion , the government of the special administrative region made the solution of social security the primary job under the strong support of the central government and increased the force to hit all crime activities , and had a distinct affect .  
China sustained , rapid , healthy development during the period of the Ninth Five-Year Plan must first be attributed to the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the center .  Their outstanding leadership skill in economic control and in flexible economic adjustment brought about the success , as did the incisive reforms by the macroeconomic adjustment departments .  The increased pace of the change of functions provided the beneficial conditions .  
Under the impetus of economic globalization , humanity has expanded its interaction , its contacts , and its understanding , and increased friendship , cooperation , and support .  Various converging and intermingling cultural torrents have smashed the " iron curtain " between countries with different social systems and ideologies , marking a new era in the ways countries compete and test their strength against one another .  
In order to meet the needs of future combined operations , the US military emphasized that more joint or combined exercises should be organized in future , and in particular the proportion of political military exercises should be increased .  
In recent years , following its sustained economic growth , India has become more eager to have its position as a big country recognized .  Therefore , it has continuously increased its national defense budget ( The 2000-2001 national defense budget increased by as much as 28.2 percent . ) and strengthened its military strength in quantity and quality .  
A destroyer squadron of the East China Sea Fleet has concentrated their efforts on solving problems at the " bottleneck " that restricts the increase of its combat capacity , carried out technical innovation and research , and successfully developed an automatic missile checking device , a missile loader checking device , and a missile full start checking system .  This has turned something sophisticated , unwieldy and backward into something simple , ingenious and advanced and has greatly increased the quick response capacity of the squadron .  
To increase the quick response capacity and the capacity to gain the initiative by striking first by the destroyers , the technical personnel of the squadron have boldly reformed the traditional methods for checking missiles before they are launched .  They have invented a way to check missiles quickly and to optimize the checking procedures without changing the technical performance of missiles .  This has greatly increased the response capacity of the system of multi-series vessel missiles and has ensured " launching missiles before the enemy . "  
Since atat present and for a certain present and in a given period of the future , our country will continuously focus on the economic construction , it is impossible for our country to substantially increase its investment in the military spending while the military faces complex and arduous tasks in the military modernization construction which does require an increased of the investment in the military spending .  The contradiction between the affordable practicality of and the need for demanded mmilitary spending will exist for a long time .

In recent years , Communist China has rapidly promoted military modernization and its national strength has continued to grow , while economic and trade relations between the two sides of the strait have become increasingly closer .  Besides , the succession of Communist China 's leading power will also take place in the near future .  All those factors have increased the attention of people at home and abroad to the question of arms sales to Taiwan by the United States .  
After our entry into the WTO , we must take advantage of the restrictions of increased production costs and insufficient resources for agricultural products in certain developed countries and regions and seek favorable opportunities to invest and build production bases abroad , further expand our force in attracting foreign agricultural business and capital , actively improve the agricultural investment environment and draw up agricultural policy in line with local conditions to attract investment by foreign business , and attract foreign business to invest in and operate agricultural enterprises as well as participate in comprehensive agricultural development in China .  
Russia has also merged some of its higher command schools with some of its engineering technology schools and increased courses on engineering technology for its postgraduate students studying in the command specialty by a large margin with an eye on training qualified high-level military personnel who are well-versed in scientific and cultural knowledge and proficient in various military specialties .  
In particular , since the two countries established diplomatic relations , the two sides have maintained frequent high-level exchanges , enhanced economic and trade cooperation , markedly increased contacts in scientific and cultural fields , and maintained sound cooperation in international affairs . "  
US allies generally connected this incident with the United States ' diplomatic tradition and the new Bush administration 's foreign policy .

The committee members held that the economic situation in the first quarter of this year was rather stable , and the gross domestic product increased by 8.1 percent according to comparable prices over the same period of the previous year .  The growth rate was kept at the same level as that of the same period last year .  A good tendency to grow steadily was maintained .  
Investment in the western areas increased obviously faster than that in the central and eastern parts of the country .  The high growth rate of investment was a result of the state 's policy to increase investment projects funded by national debt , and was also related to the fact that the base figure in the same period of last year was comparatively low and the construction periods this year moved ahead of schedule .  
In recent years , China and Austria increasingly enhanced their exchanges and cooperation in the political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , cultural , and environmental protection fields and also increased friendly exchanges at the provincial and city level .  
Some of the right wing figures in the moderate group even believed that , based on this , trade contact is helping to increase China 's overall national power and leading to an increased military threat of Taiwan by the mainland , and that the risk of the United States being involved in a regional conflict is even greater .  
Ding Jiye : This reform stresses improving the method and procedure in drawing up the budget .  The main special features are : The reform itself does not require increased input , while the regulation and control function of the military budget is markedly strengthened , the economic returns on military funds will be markedly enhanced , and funds can be concentrated on ensuring preparedness for military struggle ;  
While seizing the historical opportunities and concentrating strength on advancing modernization , we must also be soberly aware that the contemporary world is still not peaceful though the situation is easing on the whole , and the parity of international strength is seriously imbalanced .  Hegemonism and power politics still exist and make new developments in the fields of international politics , economy , and security .  Military interventionism has further increased .

This means each 100,000 yuan increase in capital only increased employment by 1 person .  This equipment level is comparable to the Chinese industries ' current average equipment level , and the trend is for the level to rise year after year .  The private economy 's labor-intensive characteristic is fast eroding .  
With the full support of Internet technology , the website has adopted an advanced databank structure and developed the function of multiple search , thus ensuring on-line audiovisual broadcast of an increased amount of pictures and precious historical materials , whose pictures and texts look excellent .

These are vivid embodiments of the central authorities applying the ideology of development to direct the work in Tibet .  
Qian Qichen pointed out that Asia and Europe have different ideologies and policies , but the two sides have steadily enhanced their mutual understanding and trust and increased cooperation through equal and frank dialog and consultation at a high level on a regular basis . 
General knowledge of the law has been widespread , and education in the legal system has been combined closely with the practice of law .  As a result , citizens ' awareness of the law has noticeably increased , and various social undertakings are vigorously managed according to law .  All this has played an important role in implementing the basic plan for governing the country according to law and building a country under the rule of the socialist legal system and played a guaranteeing role in maintaining the overall situation in reform , development , and stability .  
This partnership is aimed at pursuing common development through increased bilateral cooperation , proceeding from the reality that both China and Venezuela are developing nations faced with the task of expediting economic development to raise the living standards of the people .  
In military affairs , he has advocated a " decisive battle offshore " , increased military spending , intensified the purchase of advanced offensive weapons , and advocated that the United States should " coordinate in the defense of Taiwan " and help Taiwan to resist an " attack " by the mainland .  
Although water conservation work has been constantly strengthened , flood prevention capacities of major rivers in our country have been increased , and the flood prevention standards for these rivers have been raised in recent years , no fundamental change has been made in the weak foundation of flood prevention projects across the country , and risky sections of dikes and dams as well as risky reservoirs remain to be serious potential dangers in flood prevention .  
Under the banner of " self defense " , they broke through the " restricted zone " set by the constitution and relevant ordinances .  They have kept engaging in arms expansion .  They have increased their military spending year by year , ignoring long ago the regulation that Japan 's military expenditure is not allowed to exceed 1 percent of its gross national product .  
However , such suppression has also increased the national sentiment on the mainland , thus preventing its internal moderate forces from gaining ground , and isolation may even lead to dangerous rash actions .  Taiwan may become the victim of the international power struggle .  This is the most pressing crisis to Taiwan at present .  
As a result of implementation in the past six years of this guiding principle for the work in Tibet in the new period , the whole region 's social situation has stabilized , rate of economic growth has increased remarkably , efforts in reform and opening up have gradually picked up , construction of infrastructure facilities including that of energy , transportation and communication has developed fairly fast , local financial revenues have registered a relatively greater increase , and the people 's livelihood has clearly improved .

Chen Yusu said : In May 2000 and January 2001 , General Secretary Kim Jong-il twice visited China at the important historical moments at the turn of the century , and held cordial meetings and important talks with General Secretary Jiang Zemin . This further increased the mutual understanding , trust , friendship , and cooperation between the two parties and the two countries , won warm support from the Chinese and Korean peoples , and also produced a positive impact on the international situation .  
The article expresses the belief that China will join the WTO before the end of the year , the openness of the domestic market will be increased , and the traditional means used to control import growth will be reduced , so there may be a rather significant growth in imports , while net exports will decline further , perhaps to the point where the trade surplus becomes a trade deficit , which would have a fairly serious adverse effect on macroeconomic stability .  
The mainland resident journalists have reported in objective fashion on Taiwan 's political , economic , and social situation and its natural conditions and social customs .  Their reports have been welcomed by compatriots on both sides of the strait , increased mainland people 's understanding of the state of affairs in Taiwan , and played a positive role in strengthening cross-strait understanding and contact .

They want to banish the stereotyped image which family-run beef noodle houses have acquired as dark , dirty places , and copy the bright and hygienic style of the fast food chains with their standardized products and decor ; and they have even taken beef noodle soup into international grade hotels .  
Over a thirty year period Taipower steadily developed new power plants until by 1986 , it had accumulated a margin reserve of 50% ( well above the normal level of 20% ) . Taipower was constantly running deficits , and at that point was criticized by the MOEA for wasteful investment . The margin reserve then began to decline as demand increased , until it reached only 4.7% during peak-demand hours last summer .  
" Starting from late 1994 , as the global economy recovered , demand increased greatly , and this brought sharp rises in the international prices of some agricultural and industrial raw materials , including petrochemical feedstocks , textile fibers , paper pulp , grains , basic metals and so on . Price rises in Taiwan are part of a global chain reaction , " says Liu Fang-jung , a specialist researching prices at the Council for Economic Planning and Development .  
But there are plenty of negative examples which can serve as a warning : in the late 1970s under the Carter administration , the United States ' budget deficit increased massively and inflation went into double figures for several years running . Unemployment rose sharply and economic growth stagnated , creating the dreadful problem of " stagflation . "  
Given the current intense anti-drug efforts and heavy sentences , it is difficult to move drugs within Taiwan , and the price of heroin has increased as supply has been unable to keep up with demand . Depending upon how much major suppliers have in stock , one kilo can be sold for NT $ 15 million .  
The judicial training center has lately increased the training it provides to prepare the judges in these areas , for example , taking the students abroad and having them tour legal gambling establishments ( all gambling is illegal in Taiwan ) and sex operations . In order to competently handle the traffic accidents which are more and more prevalent , the students must all learn to drive ; in order to combat the new styles of economic crimes , the aspiring judges must also make visits to securities exchanges .  
Following the economic development of Taiwan 's diplomatic partners , the number of cooperative programs the new Agricultural Technology Missions are involved in has steadily increased . In addition to growing grain and vegetables , the scope of the missions has also come to include animal husbandry work-raising pigs and chickens ; marine technology-fishing techniques and the breeding and raising of marine animals ; handicraft work-bamboo weaving , wood carving ; and such areas of work as flood prevention and water conservation projects among others .  
In past cases where private property has been set aside for public use , the owner generally has n't received reasonable compensation and has also lost the chance to benefit from increased land prices . No wonder that people in Taiwan say : " Being the owner of a historic building is just too painful . "  
Because the results of research over the previous decade gradually received international affirmation , in 1989 the World Bank approved the center 's five-year plan and provided substantial funding . The number of research projects increased substantially and regional cooperation projects were successively begun .  
The center has increased its range of research substantially since its establishment , and the external environment has also become more complex . However , its objectives remain as unchanged as the simple exterior of its building-improving the lives of people in difficult environments and offering them a better future .  
If employees feel this is not enough , they will be free to negotiate increased amounts with their employers , " says Anita Liu . For example , if the boss and workers each pay an additional 2% , then the workers will be doing a bit of " enforced saving " for their pensions . The most important reform envisaged under the new system is the change from a collective retirement fund account opened by the firm , to an individual account for each worker .  
Although investigation of the relationship between climate and infectious diseases is still at a preliminary stage , excessive human development of jungles and rainforests has increased people 's chances of coming into contact with the microorganisms which live there , and with their natural hosts .  
The park was originally approved to release a maximum of 28,200 kiloliters of treated effluent per day . But in October and November of last year , the electronics industry was booming and the volume of effluent increased rapidly . Treated waste water from the park hit a record high of over 72,000 kiloliters . And recently average daily discharge has been running at around 53,000 kiloliters .  
Vincent Siew particularly emphasizes that educational reform is a firm policy of the Executive Yuan . It has already approved the " Educational Reform Stimulus Package " drafted by the Ministry of Education . Starting from 1999 , more than NT $ 150 billion will be spent over a five-year period to advance 12 educational reform projects , including " promoting education for the entire citizenry " and " encouraging diversification and increased quality in vocational education . "  
Two-spotted lymantriid moth caterpillars ' bodies are covered with fine , spiny hairs , and although the insecticide quickly killed the grubs , their death throes released the hairs from their bodies . The number of poisonous spines drifting in the air increased dramatically , and with the help of Hsinchu 's strong winds they got into the children 's respiratory tracts ; the children also came out in an unbearably itchy red rash . Over half the school 's staff and pupils had to seek medical attention .  
Commenting on the results of this most recent meeting of APEC , Sung Chen-chao , a professor in the graduate institute of political economy at National Cheng Kung University , states that APEC has difficulty reaching decisions because it acts by consensus rather than by majority vote . The increase in the number of participating nations means that differences in economic level have also increased . Some of the organization 's less developed members are facing pressures which make it difficult for them to embrace the liberalization of economics and trade .  
After Taiwan 's economic development shifted to industry and commerce and cities were constructed rapidly , problems of water resource management became more complex , demand for water increased , underground water sources were excessively tapped , hillside development was allowed where soil conservation should have been exercised , and industrial pollution increased steadily . The government 's attention to the subject of water resources never kept pace with the rate at which these problems developed .  
In addition , the domestic cable television market has increased its openness to foreign investment , and foreigners can directly or indirectly own up to 50% of the stock . The central government has also authorized local governments to manage local cable television operations , stipulating that operators grade their programs and sign formal contracts with subscribers to ensure the rights of consumers .  
Due to the increased tension across the Taiwan Strait and incessant rumors of elevating levels of military alert , within five days Taiwan 's stock market shed more than a thousand points . On July 16 alone it plummeted 506 points , with total market value shrinking by more than NT $ 1.5 trillion . To prop up the market , the Ministry of Finance forced four major government-related funds-the postal savings fund , labor pension fund , labor insurance fund and civil service pension fund-to buy stock .  
The standard work week when President Chen took office was 48 hours . After the new government proposed to shorten this to 44 hours , the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan one-upped the administration by passing legislation that further reduced standard working time to 84 hours over two weeks . This measure saddled businesses with an extra burden , and manufacturing operations began migrating offshore at an accelerated rate , thus contributing to increased unemployment .  
For instance , 40 years ago , after Chinese-American scientists Yang Chen-ning and Lee Tsung-dao received a Nobel physics prize , there was a boom in the popularity of physics courses . For the last five or six years law departments have consistently topped the rankings in Category 1 , but although the demand for legally qualified personnel has grown thanks to Taiwan 's progress towards the rule of law , the number of universities with law departments has increased too , making competition between law graduates more intense than before .  
In the 1980s , she spent five years trekking around the coral rocks of Kenting , observing a local troupe of macaques . During that time their numbers gradually increased , but then suddenly almost the entire troupe was killed by hunters , and the population growth accumulated over many years was wiped out overnight . By the time Wu had finished writing up her thesis , the few survivors had disappeared among the windswept coral .  
COA chairman Chen Hsi-huang , who earned his degree in agricultural economics at National Taiwan University ( NTU ) notes that Taiwan 's agricultural policies used to stress increased production-producing as much as possible on the limited land available . Consequently , Taiwan-produced canned champignon mushrooms and asparagus commanded 65% of the international market . Coupled with the export of massive amounts of sugar , rice , and bananas , this stimulated the formation of capitalistic agriculture which , in turn , helped prepare the way for the subsequent take off of industry .  
In the same way , the demand for seafood increased when Taiwan 's economy took off . Taking advantage of this favorable situation , aquaculture began sprouting up on the west coast . At one point , coastal counties were waterlogged with fully 58,000 hectares of fish farms , causing massive erosion problems . With the widespread smuggling of seafood from the PRC in recent years , aquacultural land in Taiwan has dropped to 40,000 hectares as fisheries have shifted operations to mainland China .  
A study of weather data from the last 100 years that the National Science Council commissioned from a number of local universities revealed that Taiwan 's average temperature has increased by 1-1.4 �X C over the last century . While this increase was greater than the 0.6 �X C increase in average global temperature , it was in line with the increase in the average surface temperature on land . However , Taiwan 's summer temperatures have risen more than its winter temperatures , indicating a trend towards the hot getting hotter .  
If the Ma amendments had gone through , although funding to localities would have increased , the deep cuts to the central government 's coffers would have meant that numerous previously approved ( or even partially built ) local projects such as sewers and rapid transit would not have been able to go forward . The impact would have been enormous .  
Eight million years ago , the east coast of Taiwan was at the very edge of where the Philippine Sea Plate was crashing into the Asian mainland . As compression along the edge of the Eurasian Plate increased , fracturing of the crust in the Taiwan Strait came to an end . Channels for magma to reach the surface were sealed , and volcanic activity was locked out . All that remains is the basalt that the sea has been continuing to erode for tens of millions of years .  
The mid-1990s saw a crisis in the local paint industry as production costs increased in Taiwan . Most traditional paint factories closed or moved overseas , while those that remained were forced to make layoffs or cut back salaries .  
The risk of not having a place in the global disease warning network is reflected in Resolution 107 passed by the WHO Executive Board in 2001 , which reads in part : " The need for international cooperation on epidemic alert and response is greater today than ever before due to increased population movements , growth in international trade and biological products , changes in methods of food processing , and social and environmental changes . "  
One area of particular difficulty has been the decision to promote the simultaneous learning of local and international languages , intended both to strengthen local consciousness and as a response to global trends . This approach has dramatically increased the pressure on children , leaving many unsure about the relative importance of different languages .  
In recent years the daily customer traffic in the larger bookstores of major centers like Beijing and Shanghai has often hit the tens of thousands , and several have already been given " must-see " status in travel guides sold in Taiwan . To deal with the stream of visitors , the stores have expanded , improved their air-conditioning systems , taken on huge numbers of staff , and increased the width of the aisles between bookshelves ; the luxuriousness and sheer size of the stores is nothing short of amazing .  
When word got around about the teachers , Overseas Chinese rushed to sign up , so that the number of enrollments increased sharply to a figure far above that anticipated . Liu Shu-hui , principal of the Frankfurt Chinese School , who was in charge of organizing the event , began to worry that there would be too many students , so it would be impossible to give each the care and attention desired , thereby affecting the quality of the camp , and she began to refuse people .  
Suo points out that in recent years , the proportion of reported TB cases that have been changed from " suspected " to " confirmed negative " has increased from 10% to 20% . Some patients are blindly given medication even though it is unclear whether they in fact have contracted tuberculosis . Other patients , unable to obtain specialized medical care , spread M . tuberculosis while wandering from one regular health care institution to another .  
Whereas their predecessors ' values were shaped most by great economic opportunity and the experience of collective action for political and social change , many different elements have affected the values of these generations . Besides larger structural factors , educational reform has also been important . The reforms introduced by the government in the late 1990s increased the number of universities and graduate programs significantly , so that many more young people have access to higher education than did their predecessors .  
Before the 1960s , one third of Taiwan families were classified as " patriarchal families . " These were " extended families " consisting of both direct and co-lateral family members living together . After the 1980s the proportion of " blended families " ( a " stem " family composed of three directly related generations ) increased . Today it is the " nuclear family " of husband , wife and children that has become the norm .  
Another and most troubling phenomenon for researchers is that as a self-supporting economic unit caring for the elderly and looking after children , the number of economically disadvantaged families has increased in recent years , and the gap between rich and poor households has widened .  
Leaving aside families " in name only , " whether it 's the " single-parent family , " the " second family " ( after remarriage , bringing children from a previous marriage ) , the " geographically divided family , " or the " pseudo-single-parent family " ( one spouse absent for extended periods ) , they all have increased with surprising speed . Showing a slight increase in number are families where , because of the absence of both parents , Grandma and Grandpop are raising the children in their place " across generations . "  
However , kitchen waste is the main source of the foul odors and disease vector proliferation in garbage . When kitchen wastes are mixed with other garbage for processing , landfills are inundated with noxious gases , polluting the air . If taken instead to incinerators , due to their high water content , much energy will be wasted in the burning process , and the lifespan of the incinerator will also be reduced . At the same time , concentrations of the toxin dioxin will be increased .  
After eight years of hard work laying the foundation for the company , artkey executive vice-president Ivan Fan surveys the current scene and gives her analysis . After mainland China joined the World Trade Organization , intellectual property on both sides of the strait benefited from increased international protection . At the same time , another " East Asia fever " is set to grip the world as we come up to the 2008 Olympics in Beijing .  
The mountain Karen still make a living through such traditional methods as swidden farming , fishing , hunting and gathering , working hard to eke out an existence each and every day . However , as their numbers have increased , the limited availability of agricultural land and the impact of modernization and natural disasters have meant that they now lack adequate resources to meet their daily subsistence needs , and have been reduced to penury and perpetual shortage .  
After prices had risen , the number of fish farmers raising tilapia increased . And with a continual stream of orders from abroad , the tilapia industry entered a boom period . Fish fillets were sterilized with ozone and then frozen with liquid nitrogen to preserve freshness and texture , then shipped overseas . " That was the golden age for tilapia , " reminisces Yang Shu-fen , a Chiayi resident whose family has run fish processing plants for two generations .  
In 2000 , the Yushan Weather Station expansion project was finally completed , with the original 100-square-meter wooden hut expanded into a 160-square-meter steel frame structure with a sheet-metal roof . At the same time , new equipment , such as a live video feed system , was added . The number of photovoltaic panels and power storage batteries was also increased , as a result of which the power supply was improved .  
In 1988 , Hungary relaxed its immigration laws and concluded a bilateral visa exemption treaty with the PRC . In one fell swoop , thousands of Chinese people poured into Hungary . In a few years , their numbers increased more than tenfold , and when the Hungarian authorities realized that the situation was getting out of hand , they quickly imposed restrictions .  
The quality of building materials , the increased use of metal , cement , and plastic , and the uninspired colors , all make for a disorderly urban environment . No attempt is made to achieve a harmonious unity . Even on the drawing board , every building competes with every other building for attention .  
Chen Chung believes that the small cultivated plots of traditional farming make it difficult to use efficient , labor-saving technologies and thus hinder competitiveness in international markets . The usual remedy for this has been even further exploitation of the land , and as Chen Chung points out with a pained expression , " the result was heavy use of pesticides and fertilizers , increased soil depletion , and environmental pollution . "  
After base areas are set up at Meifeng , vegetable crops suitable for cool , high elevations can be planted by machine instead of by hand ; fruit trees too are planted in rain-sheltered systems and managed for increased yields . The wooded areas that separate cultivated fields from the original land provide staged filtration of contaminants from rainwater runoff . Meifeng 's soil management methods have proven effective enough to preserve its resources over an eight-year period that has seen numerous typhoons and the 921 earthquake .  
The chief executive of the LBMA said that the main cause of the increase in silver business was a high level of physical demand and increased activity in the forward market

Social disintegration has increased , the vertical development of nuclear weapons has continued and civil wars and regional conflicts have broken out in most regions in a manner that has given the impression that the globe we live on has suddenly exploded .  
On the international level , it must be acknowledged that , despite the modest progress achieved in the control of nuclear , chemical and conventional weapons , these weapons have unfortunately increased qualitatively and quantitatively to an alarming degree .  
The countries of Latin America and the Caribbean certainly want such technical cooperation to be increased and more intensified and would like to see the United Nations double or even triple its human and financial efforts in order to fulfil this obligation , which is inscribed in the Charter and in countless resolutions of the General Assembly and other United Nations bodies .  
The issue has acquired added importance over the past few years due to the fact that the illegal transfer of ownership of cultural property , in particular of archaeological artifacts , has increased dramatically as a result of the unfavourable economic situation in developing countries , and the fall in the exchange rate of the national currencies of those countries against those of a small group of developed , industrialized countries .  
However , factors of history and constraints imposed by the external economic environment in particular , reduced official development assistance , the heavy debt burden , worsening terms of trade and increased barriers hindering access to markets in the developed countries have prevented any fundamental improvement in their economic situation .

Long-term consequences of unsafe abortion may include chronic pelvic pain , pelvic inflammatory disease , tubal occlusion , secondary infertility and increased risk of spontaneous abortion in subsequent pregnancies .  
Thus , whereas the annual growth rate of the international migrant stock in the developed countries increased only moderately , passing from 2 per cent per annum during 1965-1975 to 2.2 per cent during 1975-1985 , that of migrants in the developing countries increased nearly sixfold , rising from 0.4 per cent during 1965-1975 to 2.2 per cent during 1975-1985 .  
As a result , the number of households that do not have sufficient income to satisfy basic needs for food and other goods and services that depend on current income levels has substantially increased , although the number of households that do not have access to adequate housing , potable water and other basic services that do not depend so much on income in the short term has not changed much .  
Either of these modalities , together with strong political support for operational activities , could provide a better system with more assured , predictable and increased levels of resources to meet the needs of developing countries .

Implementation of the Platform for Action by national , subregional / regional and international institutions , both public and private , would be facilitated by transparency , by increased linkages between networks and organizations and by a consistent flow of information among all concerned .  
The free and orderly development of financial markets should also be promoted and mechanisms developed to bring about a more stable international financial system which would ensure that increased resources are available to its institutions and that the latter would be capable of detecting , in time , potential exchange-rate and financial crises , which negate the considerable efforts being made by our countries to achieve economic reform , liberalization and stability .

The FS initiated partnerships with international , Federal , State , and private organizations for ecosystem assessment , leading to greater use of satellite data and increased understanding of global ecological processes .  
Those areas included ensuring the continuity of remote sensing data from satellite operators , technical assistance in the implementation and operation of ground stations , price reductions and easier access to data , provision of training and education for efficient and timely data processing and analysis , and increased efforts in the coordination of programmes and projects between national , regional and international aid agencies .  
In that connection , activities that could improve the operational use of space technology were the establishment of local receiving stations , increased accessibility to environmental data and the stimulation of data sharing between international , regional and national organizations and agencies .  
The estimated measurable loss on the basis of the unrealized social product , as well as of the unrealized net inflow of invisible transactions with foreign countries , and on the basis of the additional costs of the increased number of unemployed persons and refugees is US $ 147.3-billion for the entire 1991-2011 period - US $ 45.1-billion for the period 1991-1994 and US $ 102.2-billion for the period 1995-2011 .

The worsening of socio-economic conditions in many LDCs in the 1990s has increasingly been translated into a marked deterioration in human welfare as reflected in reduced caloric intakes , increased mortality and morbidity , the re-emergence and spread of diseases , lower school enrolment , further marginalization of the weakest members of society , and other signals of acute social distress , as further reviewed below in chapter V .  
Donors need to expeditiously implement the agreed menu of aid targets and / or commitments as set out in paragraph 23 of the Programme of Action and fulfil their commitments to provide a significant and substantial increase in the aggregate level of external support to LDCs , keeping in mind the increased needs of these countries , as well as the requirements of the new countries included in the list of LDCs following the Paris Conference .  
Forum countries had increased their active participation in recent international and regional forums , in which they had emphasized the importance of maintaining sound environmental management practices and sustainable development .  
Very often the economic model on which structural adjustment programmes are based has made it impossible to overcome the particularly serious social problems of the countries concerned , especially poverty , and in some cases has increased the concentration of wealth , exclusion and marginalization .  
That volume , which was fixed by the international community in the 1970s at 0.7 per cent of the GNP of the developed countries , has so far been attained by only four countries .  It should nevertheless be noted that appeals for official development assistance have become more and more pressing and numerous as needs - especially those of the least developed countries , which have steadily increased in number - have grown .  
In the interests of increased savings and the successful implementation of the operational activities of the United Nations system , and given the fact that the outcome thus far had fallen short of expectations , his delegation attached great importance to the ongoing efforts of resident coordinators to ensure closer involvement of the Bretton Woods institutions in operational activities , in particular at the field level .

Emphasizes the serious debt problems of the least developed countries , which necessitate strengthened efforts to formulate an international debt strategy that should include concrete measures to alleviate the debt burden and increased concessional financing in support of appropriate economic policy measures , which will be critical to the revitalization of the growth and development of the least developed countries , and encourages the Bretton Woods institutions to expedite the ongoing consideration of ways to address the issue of multilateral debt , including those concerning the least developed countries ;  
demographic trends would be compounded by the economic crisis facing the developing countries : even if global wealth increased , the gap between rich and poor , between and within countries , was likely to widen further and foster social unrest , drug abuse and crime .  
would therefore be advisable to allocate increased resources to basic educational and vocational training , which were essential elements in promoting the economic development of the least developed countries .  
Social trust can be increased , however difficult it may be to achieve consensus among those who have been combatants , through a predictable legal system , based on the rule of law , in which everyone can engage in social and economic activities knowing that a fair , impartial and predictable system of adjudication awaits any disputes .

It is nevertheless regrettable that historical factors and the constraints imposed by the external economic environment , including a reduction in official development assistance , the heavy debt burden , deteriorating terms of trade , and increased barriers impeding access to developed country markets have prevented any fundamental improvement in the economic situation .  
We have developed , in close cooperation with the countries of the Caribbean region , a strategy based on three main priorities : support for the process of economic transition ; promotion of sustainable development of the Caribbean region with particular emphasis on human resource development , the protection of natural resources and combating socio-economic threats , including the fight against drugs ; and the promotion of increased economic cooperation leading to fuller integration in the world market .

The resources available for applied climate science are already far from adequate and the increased involvement of the socio-economic research community in developing and understanding human influences on atmospheric processes is expected to call for substantial increase in funding over the next decade .  
The negative impacts of imports barriers by developed countries on the pace of forest-based industrialization in developing countries are not expected to lead to increased export of raw wood because of the many restrictions on raw wood exports imposed by most tropical timber exporting countries .  
Human activities that can contribute to forest decline include pollutant depositions , overgrazing when woodlands are used for pastoral purposes , insensitive harvesting operations , the use of plantations with low genetic diversity , the accidental introduction of pest species , fire , the alteration of hydrology and , finally , the anticipated climate change associated with the burning of fossil fuels and increased concentration of greenhouse gases .  
Reaffirms that the effective implementation of the Programme of Action will require an increased commitment of financial resources , both domestically and externally , and , in this context , calls upon the developed countries to complement the national financial efforts of developing countries on population and development and to intensify their efforts to transfer new and additional resources to the developing countries , in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Programme of Action , in order to ensure that population and development objectives and goals are met ;

The Andean Presidents take note of the sustained and financially sound growth of the Andean Development Corporation in the international sphere , to the point where it has become the primary source of financing for the Andean countries , supporting physical integration projects , private-sector development , increased trade and the procurement of resources in capital markets .  
Fundamental to this expanded inflow has been the increased confidence generated within the private sector , including the banking and insurance sectors , as a result of the willingness of country administrations to demonstrate a continued responsiveness to private investor concerns in the area of policy development , in the development and enhancement of stable and transparent mining and investment codes , and in the development of supportive administrative frameworks .  
The private sector is slowly responding through increased financial investment , the development of primary and ancillary industries and businesses around mining , the implementation of education and training programmes for local workforces , the transfer of technology and the deepening of institutions required to sustain growth .  
Reforms are slowly taking hold , and in the countries where the reforms are most advanced , perceptible improvements in the business environments are noticeable , and the private sector is responding through increased direct investment in the minerals sector with a corresponding multiplier effect into the economy , i.e . with job creation , the development of local small - and medium-sized enterprises and capacity building in physical , social and economic infrastructure .  
38 Discussions about action against organized transnational crime often assume , sometimes implicitly , that if only Governments devoted more efforts and resources at the national level and increased cooperation at the bilateral level , they could make considerable inroads against organized transnational crime .

It explains why the Tunisia of the new era has opted for a national scientific development policy targeted on the needs of Tunisian society and guaranteeing increased protection of human rights conceived as an essential condition of economic , social and cultural progress .  
Where funding is concerned , the State has made a major effort to provide researchers with sufficient resources to enable them to carry out the research freely chosen by them in the scientific councils of the establishment or those to which they belong ( national mobilization programmes ) ; the resources are decided upon by scientific commissions and approved by the administrative authority .  Thus the public research budget , which was only 32.9-million dinars in 1992 , had increased by 1995 to 57.9-million dinars .  
They called upon the developed countries to make every effort to coordinate their macroeconomic policies , including through multilateral institutions in which developing countries are represented , so as to stimulate the world economy through increased demand , stabilized markets and further liberalized trade , and thereby provide a conducive international economic environment for development .  
However , he questioned the wisdom of having one treaty body that was extremely well funded , while other treaty bodies had inadequate resources and administrative support with possibly no natural outside agencies to provide additional funding that could lead to increased effectiveness and more optimal functioning .  
His delegation recognized that it would not be easy to reach agreement on a 20 per cent ceiling , but in recent years Portugal and Greece had both voluntarily agreed to increase their peacekeeping rates and numerous countries had joined the consensus two years previously on a regular scale that increased their rates . 
Mr . SERIWA ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) said that his delegation supported the statement on the question of ageing made by the representative of Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China . Despite the encouraging growth in the global economy , economic and social conditions in many developing countries , particularly in Africa , were still disturbing , owing to a large number of external factors such as an increased debt-burden .  
Those programmes were beginning to bear fruit : the level of absolute poverty had been reduced while per capita income had increased ; economic growth had been sustained ; the debt service ratio had decreased in relation to exports ; and the Philippines had re-entered the private capital market in order to seek sources of external financing .  27 .  In order to promote sustainable human development to achieve real prosperity , economic growth in developing countries must reach between 5 and 9 per cent .  
The international economy was displaying mixed characteristics : in the case of the developed countries , there were prospects of continued cyclical expansion , but there were also fears of inflation and resulting suggestions to contain growth rates , and there was increased unemployment and slow progress in the structural transformation of economies ; in the case of the developing countries , there were significant growth rates and a greater contribution to world trade , but also problems of poverty , lack of infrastructure , human resources and technological strength .  
The United Nations should emphasize the formulation of policies aimed at fostering a consensus on development strategy as a vital step towards the building of a new global partnership , and should develop specific programmes to assist the least developed countries - most of which had yet to benefit from increased flows of private capital - and the African countries , which were suffering from a heavy debt burden and a lack of basic infrastructure for development .  
Building increased public awareness of the social , economic and human costs of anti-personnel mines is essential to develop and sustain the necessary political will for a global anti-personnel mine ban .  
The issue of resources for operational activities , however , was particularly important because , in the view of her delegation , if resources could not be increased on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , the effectiveness of such activities would be seriously impaired , developing countries ' development programmes would be jeopardized and , in the long run , international development cooperation would be affected .  
Recognize that increased use of solar energy can reduce environmental degradation caused by adverse human activities , such as industrial pollution and deforestation , and that it is the responsibility of Governments and all sectors of civil society to work together to find lasting solutions to problems threatening the sustainable development of humanity ;  
Commit ourselves to working towards the greater use of solar energy through the provision of adequate technical assistance and funding , the full utilization of existing international funds , and the facilitation of increased participation by both public and private sectors .  
Those international conventions constitute internal law as of the time they are sanctioned , are applicable ex officio by the courts and by all public services and have increased validity pursuant to paragraph 1 of article 28 of the Constitution , which stipulates that : " The generally acknowledged rules of international law , as well as international conventions as of the time they are sanctioned by law and become operative according to the conditions therein , shall be an integral part of domestic Greek law and shall prevail over any contrary provisions of the law .  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of , and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments which request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development that have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and that take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
A sustained commitment of all relevant parts of the United Nations towards increased cooperation under the guidance of the High Commissioner , increased resources for both technical and financial assistance and continued substantive programme development are required in order to provide an effective response to the growing demand by the Member States for cooperation with the United Nations regarding the rule of law .  
His delegation supported the continuing decentralization of functions which , in particular , increased managerial responsibility at the local level , and agreed that delegated management authority must be accompanied by delegated financial authority , subject , however , to the overall authority of the Office of Human Resources Management . 
In addition , price measures might suffer from a number of practical problems : the changing nature of output and the increased heterogeneity of products made it very difficult to compile consistent price measures over time ; service industry outputs were notoriously difficult to define and to price ; and measuring the price of governmental outputs presented major conceptual problems .  
Concerned about the dramatic humanitarian situation in eastern Zaire and encouraged by this statement by the Rwandan authorities , the High Commissioner is transmitting a message through the local media , reassuring the refugees that , while UNHCR would try to do everything possible to assist them where they are , the Office would be ready to help them back in Rwanda and had for that purpose increased its reception and assistance capacities inside Rwanda .  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way to the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of , and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development that have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and that take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
In assuming its complete role , with the completion of AICC construction work , the detention facilities , increased activity with the commencement of trials , and taking into consideration the general political situation of the region , additional security personnel would be required for facilities and access control , armed escort , personal protection and simultaneous courtroom operations .  
In recent years , the total number of such personnel has increased very significantly and activities performed by them have expanded to backstopping of peacekeeping operations , disarmament and humanitarian assistance , and to areas which have , in the past , been carried out exclusively by staff members , such as economic and social research , internal oversight services , administration and management .  
Also requests the Secretary-General , subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources , to provide increased advisory services and technical assistance to requesting Member States , in particular in the elaboration of national strategies , the elaboration or improvement of legislative and regulatory measures , the establishment or strengthening of national capacities to prevent and control corruption , as well as in training and upgrading skills of relevant personnel ;  
Concessional , bilateral contributions from the developed countries were crucial in that regard , as was a favourable international economic environment , characterized by improved access to markets , stable exchange rates , effectively managed international interest rates , increased resource flows and access by the developing countries to technology .  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way towards the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
Stresses the importance for developing countries of continuing their efforts to promote a favourable environment for attracting foreign investment , thereby promoting economic growth and sustainable development , and stresses the need for the international community to promote a conducive external economic environment through , inter alia , improved market access , stabilization of exchange rates , effective stewardship of international interest rates and increased resource flows , as well as improved access to technology for the developing countries ;  
Consequent to the low tariff rates , imports had increased while economic development and exports had been circumscribed by , in addition to other causes , exogenous factors including the restrictive policy of other countries coupled with the sluggish and diminished flow of both private and official funds .  
The representative of the European Commission said that it was likely that the number of transborder RBPs ( particularly cartels , abuses of dominance and mergers having international effects ) had increased in proportion with the considerable growth in international trade , in foreign direct investment , and in the size and number of transnational corporations .  
Stresses that the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda will require an increased commitment of financial resources , both domestically and externally , and in that context calls upon the developed countries to complement the national financial efforts of developing countries on human settlements development and urban management , and intensify their efforts to transfer new and additional resources to the developing countries within the framework of paragraphs 203 and 204 of the Habitat Agenda in order to ensure the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda ;  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way to the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
It would appear that the views of the Inspectors in this report vary significantly from the conclusions and recommendations of two previous JIU reports on the subject of advancing the status of women , issued in June 19943 and October 1995.4 Both reports were fully supportive of the special measures introduced by the Secretary-General to improve the status of women in the Secretariat and called for increased accountability of programme managers , in particular those who did not demonstrate real efforts to improve the status and representation of women in their respective departments .  
During that event , more than 140 leading media figures from around the globe , representing more than 50 countries , had discussed the growing significance of television in the changing contemporary world , the opportunities offered by the current technological revolution in communications , which vastly increased the possibilities of cultural exchange , the role of both private and public broadcasters in providing information on global events and the strengthening of the partnership between the United Nations system and the international media .  
Developing countries which have only recently joined such processes , or which are about to join , should , as appropriate , be assisted through action aimed at poverty alleviation ; institutional strengthening ; human resource development , with special consideration to gender issues and to education and training at all levels ; establishment of mechanisms for increased public participation ; research and technology transfer ; research networking ; ensuring access to , and dissemination and exchange of , information ; development of plans and programmes ; and field-level testing of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management ;  
The Panel recognized that the [ agreements reached ] [ documents adopted ] at UNCED have significantly [ underlined ] [ increased ] the understanding that forest policy and sustainable forest management must be [ reconciled ] [ addressed ] , taking into account the multiple benefits of forests [ at the national , regional and global levels ] and that these issues need to be addressed through a holistic and integrated approach [ rather than in a fragmented manner ] .  
Because of the increasing number of developing countries that are actively engaged in space science research , the United Nations , through the Programme and the Committee , has in recent years placed increased emphasis on promoting education and research in space science and technology and , in particular , planetary exploration and astronomy ( topics covered in a guidebook3 published for International Space Year , 1992 ) , comprising what has come to be known in the international space community as basic space science .  
Additional expenditures resulted from the higher than projected unit costs for rations ; troop rotation cost carried over from the prior period ; helicopter hire charges that exceeded projected costs ; higher than estimated costs for audit services ; increased demand for medical services coupled with a rapid rise in cost of medical treatment ; and longer than anticipated costs for miscellaneous ground maintenance and facility services and repairs .  
The Commission noted , bearing in mind the role of the Economic and Social Council in overall coordination , that increased dialogue between the Bureau of the Commission on the Status of Women and the Economic and Social Council , the chairpersons and secretariats , as appropriate , of the other functional commissions , other subsidiary bodies and related bodies , including the relevant executive boards , would assist in identifying issues that could be addressed under the agenda item on emerging issues and trends .  
The country has achieved a considerable improvement in housing conditions both in terms of living space and standard of dwellings but is now placing a special emphasis on increasing the production of rental and cooperative housing , increased renovation of existing housing , developing the housing finance system and promoting the stability of the market for rental housing .  
Thus , whereas the annual growth rate of the international migrant stock in developed countries increased only moderately , passing from 2.3 per cent per annum during 1965-1975 to 2.4 per cent during 1985-1990 , that of the total number of migrants in the developing countries increased ninefold , rising from 0.3 per cent during 1965-1975 to 2.7 per cent during 1985-1990 .  
The adoption of this theme highlighted the emphasis given by the international community to voluntary repatriation as a durable solution and asserted that a natural extension of that emphasis is the increased importance attached to the prevention of forced displacement .  
Indeed , increased cooperation between the two organizations will , we hope , make it possible to establish the foundations for international cooperation that is free from ideological confrontation and resolutely determined to meet its global challenges : economic and social development ; strengthening democracy and respect for human rights ; the promotion of sustainable development while taking account of the need for environmental conservation ; the struggle against the scourge of drugs ; and the promotion of gender equality .  
Considering the increased cooperation we have witnessed during the past year in support of Latin American and Caribbean Member States in the field of designing policies on social development including the follow-up to the World Summit for Social Development on economic integration and on trends in the globalization process , our delegations are in favour of a further broadening and deepening of the mutual supporting activities between ECLAC and the Latin American Economic System , as expressed this morning by the representative of Peru .  
At the same time , the reform process must assign special importance to measures and mechanisms designed to accelerate economic and social development , especially in Africa , by supporting domestic efforts at economic restructuring , diversification of raw materials and increased food security being carried out by the countries of the region . 
The scope for female employment has been rapidly expanded by technological change , increasing concentration of employment in service industries , increased flexibility of work times and availability of part-time work , changing social attitudes towards female employment , and improved provision of childcare .  
Over the past few years , higher international prices , new mining codes with more clearly defined rights and obligations of foreign investors , and aid-financed geologic surveys had contributed to a large increase in the exploration for mineral deposits and with notable success .  Gold production in particular has increased rapidly in several countries in western and southern Africa .  
The revitalized regional integration initiative of Kenya , the United Republic of Tanzania and Uganda , now called the East African Cooperation , provided expanded markets for local manufacturing output among member countries .  Also , the signing of a new trade protocol among the member countries of the Southern African Development Community has paved the way for expanded markets and increased trade among the Community 's member States , although regional manufacturing is increasingly dominated by South Africa .  
They include poverty and growing economic imbalances in and between countries ; rising unemployment and underemployment in many parts of the world ; environmental degradation ; war and civil strife ; intensified domestic and international conflicts for political , religious or ethnic reasons ; disparities in economic development and income levels ; globalization ; labour market demands ; and increased international trade and investment .  
While there has been an increased recognition of the importance of science and a considerable increase in international planning and coordination to provide the scientific basis for sustainable development , the actual amount of money being spent on scientific activities in a majority of both developing and developed countries has declined since 1992 .  
Some other issues that will require increased research activities in the future are related to ( a ) the pathways of man-made chemicals , in particular toxic chemicals , in ecosystems , agro-ecosystems and the global biosphere and the possible undesirable biological effects in humans and animals subsisting often far away from the source point ; and ( b ) interdisciplinary research on re-emerging tropical and subtropical diseases conditioned by particular environments and vectors .  1 Report of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , vol .  
Thus , whereas the annual growth rate of the international migrant stock in the developed countries increased only moderately , passing from 2.3 per cent per year during 1965-1975 to 2.4 per cent during 1985-1990 , that of the total number of migrants in the developing countries increased ninefold , rising from 0.3 per cent during 1965-1975 to 2.7 per cent during 1985-1990 .  
Yet its subsequent , rapid spread through tainted blood and heterosexual activity increased public concern , leading to actions that , if taken earlier , would have saved many lives .  
In spite of their transitory nature , those fluctuations may , owing to their echo-effect , cause significant longer-term changes in the age structure of populations at the local , national or even regional levels , such as an unusual increase or decrease in the number of older persons ( for instance , due to surges of refugees in sub-Saharan Africa ) , or an increase in the numbers of older widows ( due to increased male mortality among the older working-age groups in several European countries in transition from centrally planned economies ) .  
In some cities in Europe , campaigns to encourage communities to separate waste at the household level have been so successful that there is insufficient capacity to recycle all the waste collected by municipal authorities and , because of increased supply , the market price for recycled materials has dropped drastically .  
What is lacking is the development of the social and institutional structures that are needed to keep pace with the policy , regulatory and service demands arising from rapid population growth , increased complexity and the changes in technology ; and underlying this gap is the issue of good governance and its impact on building capacities and developing performance standards for sustainable development . 
Likewise , suburban sprawl , which has led to increased consumption of fossil fuel through extended commuting , disturbs the fragile ecosystems and permanently removes prime arable land from agricultural production .  
Given the increased number of decision-making bodies concerned with sustainable development , including those related to the international conventions , there is an ever-greater need for coordination at the intergovernmental level through consistent and coherent positions of Governments in these various forums , as well as for the development and strengthening of a collaborative process among secretariats .  
The idea of concentrating United Nations efforts on a situation that may become an inflamed dispute likely to endanger international peace and security has now been accepted , but the United Nations has not developed a special mechanism to deal with so many current crises .  While the then Secretary-General reorganized the Secretariat in such a way that information on incipient crises is being collected , the Secretariat is being downsized and is not likely to be increased to deal with an avalanche of new problems .  
Those events had a direct impact on humanitarian conditions , owing to the resultant imposition of increased restrictions on the Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in northern Cyprus , stricter security measures and interruption of regular medical transport to the southern part of the island as well as loss of employment for Turkish Cypriots working in the southern part of Cyprus .  
Their declaration recognized that public-private partnerships not only foster sustainable cities , but also generate profitable opportunities for business through increased productivity , a better educated and dynamic work force and improved infrastructure .  
The project has six immediate objectives : ( a ) increased awareness and improved understanding of the money-laundering phenomenon and acceptance of the need for countermeasures ; ( b ) introduction of relevant legislation , inter alia , promoting mutual legal assistance ; ( c ) improved global infrastructure , including the delivery of training services ; ( d ) improved capacity of legal and related law enforcement systems , including the establishment of financial intelligence units or similar bodies ; ( e ) reduced financial system vulnerability ; and ( f ) improved process of performance evaluation .  
It has also become clear that the problems created for countries by organized transnational crime may be solved only through the adoption and implementation of measures that could comprise up-to-date legislation to deal with this criminal phenomenon ; increased capacity of criminal justice systems to enforce existing legislation and control organized transnational crime ; strengthened ability to gather and analyse reliable information on organized crime activities , with a view to devising preventive and control policies ; and more effective inter-state cooperation when investigating , prosecuting or judging organized transnational crime offences .  
Recommendations to address these constraints included : ( a ) identifying promotional messages for SHD to be used by all staff in contacts with the media at seminars and other venues ; ( b ) improving links between the staff working in policy , substantive and operational matters and those in media ; ( c ) encouraging all staff to invest time in developing and communicating clear messages on the role and activities of UNDP ; and ( d ) allocating increased funding from the organizational budget for communication and advocacy efforts .  
The key elements are : ( a ) the creation of an effective and professional human resource management organization ; ( b ) implementation of human resource measures sensitive to a more equitable gender-balance in decision-making ; ( c ) increased efficiency of transaction-based services ; ( d ) maintenance of competitive benefits and conditions of service ; ( e ) foundations for continuous learning and learning opportunities for key staff .  
The objective of structural adjustment programmes was to enable developing countries to have more normal commercial relations with other countries , since access to international capital and increased exports were essential for development and growth .  
That new capital is envisaged to come from a redirection of private capital from mature markets to markets with new absorptive capacity created for sustainable development ; from the removal of existing subsidies ; from domestic savings ; from debt-relief ; and from public monies , including increased ODA . Efforts should be made to provide the necessary flexibility to allow those reallocations to take place naturally in response to incentives . 
Price is a major factor affecting the efficient use of energy ; as long as energy from different sources is not priced at its full cost , inclusive of the environmental damage it causes , there is no possibility of meeting the energy needs of the existing global population , let alone the needs of the expected increased population .  
Progress in the post-UNCED debate was attested by : the increased focus on exploring the scope of complementarities between trade liberalization , economic development and environmental protection ; the greater degree of confidence built up between the environmental and trade communities ; a balanced and integrated approach to the trade and environment agenda encouraged by the international community ; and , the work programmes of UNCTAD , WTO and UNEP which , together with the Commission on Sustainable Development , had clearly anchored the objectives of sustainable development and the trade and environment theme .  
Early implementation of key public investments would result not only in increased aggregate demand , employment and incomes , but in a recovery of private investment - an essential factor for a more sustained , self-reliant economic growth and significantly improved security .  
Recognizing further that the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Commission provides a historic opportunity for the Commission to bring about the wide participation of its members and associate members and to sharpen the focus of its work to enable it to respond more effectively to the evolving economic and social needs of the members and associate members within a rapidly changing global paradigm , including the changing scope of regional cooperation , by utilizing fully the multidisciplinary advantage of the Commission and its increased capability in technical assistance activities ,  
Serve as a mobilizer of ideas and a catalyst for action to identify and promote new policy options at the national , subregional and regional levels for the removal of constraints on the economic and social development efforts of these countries , with emphasis on the adoption of measures for increased mobilization of domestic and foreign resources , trade and private sector development , public sector reform , and provision of economic advice , on request , to Governments with limited internal capacity .  
There is an increased use in the region of satellite imagery and global positioning systems ( GPS ) ; geodetic networks are being improved ; and there is a continuing need to maintain topographic and thematic mapping and a priority need to produce data and maps in support of cadastre .  
Experts identified various global trends in the sector such as increased demand for health care , the phenomenon of consumerism , relative shortage of health personnel in some developed countries , aging population requiring tailor-made products , information / technology revolution , increased mobility of consumers and service providers , and increasing medical costs and decreasing public health care budgets requiring containment of health care costs .  
This commitment must also be linked to increased international support for the institution of asylum , and for identifying solutions , if the High Commissioner is to exercise her mandated protection functions of securing the fundamental rights of refugees , asylum-seekers and others in need of international protection ; playing a supervisory and standard-setting role in developing international refugee law ; and identifying and helping to implement fair and sustainable solutions .  
Concern about slack growth and mounting social problems led the Government to decide early in March on a new economic orientation , including promotion of investment and elimination of all obstacles to investment by Lebanese and foreigners ; protection of agriculture through limiting imports of competing agricultural products ; and selection and protection of competitive industries , which have an export potential , which will be supported to ensure increased productivity .  
This action has received increased support from different donor sources ; however , additional and increased development assistance is to be directed towards the basic social services with a view to improving primary and reproductive health care , basic education , skills development and literacy in priority , to at least meet the targets set by recent international conferences . 
Their experience provided valuable input for the design of future peacekeeping missions , pointing to the need to accord a greater role to the civilian component and to ensure increased cooperation with local and national civic movements .  
Also convinced that a year designed to enhance the recognition , facilitation , networking and promotion of volunteer service , with particular emphasis upon activity at the local level , could make a significant contribution to generating increased awareness of the achievements and the further potential of volunteer service , to encouraging offers of service from a greatly expanded number of individuals and to channelling resources to enable the even greater effectiveness of such service ,  
An international enabling environment also requires coordination of macroeconomic policies by the international community which foster conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and low fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments , technologies and knowledge to developing countries , and new and additional financial resources from all sources .  
An essential component of an enabling environment for development is sound national macroeconomic policies and the creation of favourable conditions for investment and increased domestic savings , including through the creation of a sound banking system .  
While the overall economic performance in the least developed countries has improved , poverty remains pervasive and the majority of the population in the least developed countries suffers from reduced caloric intakes , increased mortality and morbidity , the re-emergence and spread of disease and lower school enrolment .  
With reference to the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction , the countries of the Pacific region had expressed growing concern over the increased intensity and frequency of storms and typhoons in the region , with an impact that would continue to stretch their limited resources .  International assistance was required to make regional activities more efficient .  
The motor of that process was the promotion of an enabling environment that would ensure increased access for the poor to economic services and industrial goods , given that the great majority of poor people in rural areas were self-employed and that their prosperity depended on their having direct access to more and improved means of production .  
The participants noted the need for increased financial and technical assistance from a variety of sources , including export credit institutions , as well as import promotion agencies in the developed countries , for viable projects promoting the exports of developing countries , and encouraged governments and enterprises to make full use of the existing sources of assistance .  
In order to eliminate the causes of the refugee problem , it was necessary to establish a new international political and economic order based on increased international cooperation to promote progress and development in the developing countries , the peaceful settlement of disputes , respect for State sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States . 
The gap between developed and developing countries points to the continued need for a dynamic and enabling international economic environment supportive of international cooperation , particularly in the fields of finance , technology transfer , debt and trade , if the momentum for global progress towards sustainable development is to be maintained and increased .  
These initiatives focused on increased use of alternative transportation fuels ( e.g . , natural gas ) , support for urban public transport , and improved transportation planning and regulation .  
As a result of the increased volume of financial transactions both within and across major national and international payment and settlement systems , there has been concern about the ability of the present institutional arrangements to manage the load , in particular the settlement risk ( i.e . , the risk of the failure of one party to a transaction to complete its obligations in a timely fashion ) .  
Concerning future trends , UNCTADs technical cooperation programme was achieving its goals satisfactorily , and its efforts to cooperate with other organizations were worthy of praise , but two policy questions would have to be addressed : how did the UNCTAD secretariat resolve the apparent contradiction between the concentration of technical cooperation activities in LDCs and its proposals for cost recovery , and how could regular budget expenditures be decreased and technical cooperation activities increased without the implementation of other mandates established at UNCTAD IX being affected ?  
Despite the adoption of the Paris Declaration and the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s , [ 29 ] there has been a decline in real terms of total official development assistance for least developed countries and continued marginalization of those countries , and their number has increased from 41 to 48 without a proportionate increase in support measures despite national and international efforts .  
The reform of the national Government is also continuing and being extended to the provincial governments , the tax system is being strengthened and the efficiency of public spending in the social sphere increased at all levels of government .  
We also urge that an integrated initiative be agreed upon at that meeting on providing the least developed countries with coordinated and substantially increased technical cooperation in trade and trade-related areas with a view to strengthening their supply capacity of exportable goods and services , in line with the Marrakesh Ministerial Decision on Measures in Favour of the Least Developed Countries .  
Within the context of increased financial flows to developing countries and the continuing surge in foreign direct investment , equity and bonds , he noted with optimism the rapid turnaround in private sector financial flows to Mexico and Argentina after the crisis of 1995 and the modest private sector flows to Africa .  
Given that the five Central Asian Republics are landlocked , in search of world markets and in need of developing new transport corridors to improve trade performance , UNDP is providing support to the Government of Tajikistan to pave the way for a modern system of transit procedures and ensure adherence to international customs conventions that simplify border crossings among the five Central Asian Countries , resulting in reduced transport costs , increased competitiveness , expanded trade potential and augmented economic growth .  
In view of the continuing widespread violations of human rights in Kosovo as reported by the Special Rapporteur , the opening of an office of the High Commissioner in Prishtina , as well as an increased presence of other international organizations , would be indispensable for gathering reliable information on future human rights developments .  
He identified the following areas where Yemen required increased technical assistance : general training in trade matters ( under TRAINFORTRADE ) , training to operate ASYCUDA , quality control in the agricultural and food industries , trade information technology , establishment of a financial market , and policy advice and experience in the area of foreign trade and trade negotiations .  
Gravely concerned that , despite continued increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development , which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and which take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
In that light , agency programming through 1997 has evolved to reflect several new developments , including an increased orientation towards reconstruction projects and confidence-building measures , support for capacity-building of local authorities in the health , education and social welfare sectors , improved targeting of beneficiaries and more consolidated and integrated projects oriented towards employment / income generation .  
The already slow process of development in those countries would be further impeded , requiring three types of countermeasures : slowing of population growth , promotion of North-South partnership , such as that envisioned in Agenda 21 and the final documents of other major United Nations conferences , and the eradication of poverty through the creation of an international economic climate favourable to the opening up of markets , debt reduction and increased financial resources flows from North to South .  
In closing , she emphasized the important role of the Commission in the years to come , especially with regard to the ongoing and increasing process of globalization driven by increased foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and foreign portfolio equity investment flows .  
The objective in this thematic area is to equip Arab societies with an increased capacity to devise and implement measures that can ensure food security at the family level , especially among poor populations , by helping to increase the inclusion of the issue of food security in state economic and social policies , to the extent that they regulate markets , investments and social safety nets , and to develop elements of a coherent system focused on making food available to all .  
Success will be measured by the number of additional jobs and improved livelihoods generated by new investments , increased trade and development of infrastructure , and the cooperative mechanisms established and strengthened to ensure sustainability and promote peaceful and productive development among the member States .  
Allow me to reiterate here the great importance of the support of the international community in assisting the member States of the Standing Advisory Committee to carry out the positive measures they have adopted , in a context that must be described as particularly difficult , in order to strengthen subregional security through increased cooperation , as is reflected in document A / 52 / 283 , which contains the report of the ninth ministerial meeting of the Standing Advisory Committee , held in Libreville , Gabon , from 7 to 11 July 1997 .  
During the period following its establishment in 1922 , Jordan experienced tremendous economic , social and demographic changes which fundamentally altered its demographic map and affected the size , composition and distribution of the population , which increased from 225,000 in 1922 to 300,000 in 1938 , representing an annual growth of 1.8 per cent . 
Urges the international community , the United Nations system and other relevant organizations to give priority to supporting the efforts of developing countries to ensure the full and effective participation of women in deciding and implementing development strategies , through , inter alia , women 's increased access to health care , capital , education , training and technology , and wider participation in decision-making ;  
In view of potential as well as proved advantages of the use of advanced technologies , including electronic publishing , the increased use of such technologies for the publishing process should be enhanced by the Secretariat and a general shift towards the various forms of electronic publishing should be intensified and due regard paid to cost recovery and access to such electronic products in developing countries .  
Convinced of the necessity of protecting and promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms and determined to take new steps forward , nationally and with the increased cooperation and solidarity of the international community , with a view to achieving substantial progress in human rights ,  
Also stresses in this context the need for various measures to be taken by the international community , including increased trade-related technical assistance and human and institutional capacity-building for strengthening the supply capacity of exportable goods and services of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , with a view to their full integration into the world economy ;  
The main objective of the Symposium was to provide an opportunity for representatives of space industry and the private sector to interact with international space scientists , space technology experts and policy makers from developing and developed countries and to explore possibilities for increased scientific and technical cooperation .  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in the last few years , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , particularly those of developing countries ,  
The tripartite forms of governance of employment policy established in many countries have increased cohesion and reduced conflict so long as they were genuinely inclusive of all kinds of workers , and need to be developed in ways that take account of the transnational nature of much economic activity .  
Urges the international community , the United Nations system and other relevant organizations to give priority to assisting the efforts of developing countries to ensure the full and effective participation of women in deciding and implementing development strategies , through , inter alia , the increased access of women to health care , capital , education , training and technology and full and equal participation in decision-making ;  
The nature of this relationship should be clarified , as , in his view , the social effects of immigration will depend on whether the labour supplied by immigrants is perceived as competitive with or complementary to native labour and there is no satisfactory measure for determining whether racism has increased or decreased .  
Our increased input of international experience and police skills in order to support the police of Bosnia and Herzegovina in fighting crime and maintaining public security will remain ineffective without a democratically legitimized judicial system that guarantees fair investigations and trials as well as acceptable circumstances of detention .  
The country has achieved a considerable improvement in housing conditions , both in terms of living space and standard of dwellings , but is now placing a special emphasis on increasing the production of rental and cooperative housing , increased renovation of existing housing , developing the housing finance system and promoting the stability of the market for rental housing .  
There is absolutely no doubt that increased international assistance and initiatives for debt relief or cancellation , increased official development assistance to meet agreed targets , private capital flows , increased foreign direct investment , and improved terms of trade would play a catalytic role in Africa 's efforts to achieve economic development .  
The objectives are the following : the continuation and consolidation of the process of democratizing political and social life ; the increased participation of the citizens in political , economic and social life and in making decisions that concern them ; the establishment of sound rules of government ; the promotion of the private sector ; the development of human resources ; and the restoration and safeguarding of environmental equilibrium and of the ecosystem , with special attention being paid to environmental problems related to human activities .  
Transnational criminal organizations have , in fact , existed for a long time , but the globalization of international relations with regard to the economy , commerce , telecommunications and the rapid progress of technology , as well as the disappearance of ideological blocs , have permitted the activities of transnational criminal organizations to expand and have increased their power to such an extent that they are now a permanent threat to the foundation and internal security of States , to their cultural and artistic heritage and to the environment of the planet .  
These reform proposals as a whole represent a timely and welcome initiative , given the fact that in today 's world the need has progressively increased for global common action on a number of pressing problems , such as the eradication of poverty , humanitarian emergencies , refugee problems , climate change and desertification , diminishing official development assistance funding , drugs , nuclear disarmament , the implementation of Agenda 21 , democracy and the maintenance of peace and security in various regions of the world .  
Information provided both by the Secretariat and by specialized agencies gives an objective quantitative picture of where the phenomena of poverty , unemployment and social disintegration are most acute : the same places experiencing an increased deterioration in the terms of trade ; protectionism ; a fall in the prices of exported raw materials ; and the drying up of financial flows .  
The international economic system must be overhauled to enhance the trade prospects of the poor countries and to facilitate their access to science and technology , technical assistance and increased financial flows , both private and official .  
Despite increased flows to emerging markets , international capital flows remain highly concentrated , going from a small number of developed countries and transnational corporations to a small number of developing countries .  
A major trend in both developed and developing countries has been increasing wage differentials between skilled and unskilled workers , due both to technological change and to increased trade and capital flows .  
In the face of the increasing power of private global actors to determine the distribution of income and production and the content of economic and social policies , outside the political process , it is important to broaden participation in decision-making and to strengthen political accountability by means of increased transparency of decision-making in existing regional and international institutions . 
Developed countries should sustain stable economic growth at home and provide increased opportunities for developing countries to expand their exports , including both manufactured products from more advanced developing countries and primary commodities from less developed countries .  
Consumption will stay relatively weak , reflecting sluggish personal income growth and growing household debt , which increased from 65 per cent of personal disposable income in 1991 to almost 95 per cent in 1996 ; but the weakest component of demand will remain government spending owing to the continuation of fiscal austerity at all levels of government .  
In the face of the economic slowdown in Western Europe , and thus the slower growth of exports to the main foreign markets of these countries , aggregate demand was boosted by strong private consumption , made possible by rising real wages , and increased investment .  
While rapid economic growth based largely on investment in human resources has facilitated a reduction of the proportion of the poor in some parts of the ESCAP region , inadequate investment in human resources has sustained and in some cases actually increased the concentration of the poor in other parts of the region . 
We are of the view that given the positive global political climate following the end of the cold war , the work of the Conference has assumed even increased significance in that opportunities that did not exist during the period of heightened East _ West tension are now present , both in respect of conventional and , more importantly , nuclear disarmament .  
There is an increased willingness to work across national borders marked by mountain chains , in particular for scientific reasons , such as to study the behaviour of migratory species , for environmental conservation purposes , and for ecological / economic reasons among countries sharing major watercourses .  
Given the current scarcity of public resources , additional funds need to be mobilized through increased use of economic instruments ( general tax reforms , eco-taxes , subsidy reduction and tradeable permit schemes ) , increased private-sector involvement , national environmental funds and innovative international financial mechanisms .  
The predominant role of the private sector in the transfer and diffusion of ESTs and , more importantly , its leading function in the transition to cleaner production , have increased the private sector 's responsibility for ensuring that technology-related investments and industrial and business operations are consistent with community requirements for sustainable lifestyles and environmental protection .  
Also requests the Secretary-General , subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources , to provide increased advisory services and technical assistance to Member States , at their request , in particular in the elaboration of national strategies , the elaboration or improvement of legislative and regulatory measures , the establishment or strengthening of national capacities to prevent and control corruption , as well as in training and upgrading skills of relevant personnel ;  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development , which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and which take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
A typical example of the technical superiority of the traffickers has been their increased use of mobile cellular phones and faxes since the mid-1980s , once law enforcement authorities were known to be legally and technically equipped to carry out successful wire-tapping operations of the traditional phone network ( which showed improved interdiction and arrest results ) .  
The main responsibility of Governments is to " provide the required budgetary resources to the educational sector , with reallocation within the educational sector to ensure increased funds for basic education " ( Platform for Action , para . 84 ( a ) ) and " to monitor the implementation of educational reforms and measures in relevant ministries , and establish technical assistance programmes " ( Platform for Action , para . 84 ( b ) ) .  
However , while macroeconomic stabilization was a necessary but not sufficient condition for enterprise development , structural adjustment and liberalization measures had produced encouraging positive results such as the emergence of an enterprise culture and increased entrepreneurial activities to take advantage of the enlarged economic opportunities for the private sector arising from such measures .  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way towards the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
To meet the rapidly evolving tasks of the Programme , a new approach to its financing is required which , in the view of the High Commissioner , must be based on increased funds from the regular budget , expanded partnerships with United Nations agencies and programmes , including UNDP and the World Bank , NGOs and academic institutions , and on a greater contribution by Governments interested in receiving technical assistance .  
Although increased private flows have led to investments in industry and technology in some developing countries and economies in transition , many other developing countries have been left behind , slowing the process of technological change in those countries and limiting their ability to meet their commitments under Agenda 21 and other international agreements .  
To resolve the remaining debt problems of the highly indebted poorest countries , creditor and debtor countries and international financial institutions should continue their efforts to find effective , comprehensive , durable and development-oriented solutions , including such measures as debt reduction , debt swaps , debt cancellation , and increased grants and concessional flows . 
But if the assumption is that the existing level of funding is unlikely to be increased in the years ahead , then the current system is simply not sustainable and we will witness a steady diminution in the support available to each treaty body and in the ability of each to function in a meaningful way .  
Notes with concern that in the current biennium the budgetary resources for technical cooperation in the field of human rights have decreased by half as compared with the previous biennium , and requests the Secretary _ General to allocate to the human rights programme , in the context of the budgetary planning for the biennium 1998 _ 1999 , more human and financial resources for the enlargement of the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights in order to meet the substantially increased demand ;  
Governments have moved to accord high priority to child survival and health ; the work of non-governmental organizations and of the private sector has expanded ; community participation has increased , and families have been empowered by gaining greater knowledge and skills about utilizing low-cost , easily available life-saving technologies for their children ; bilateral and multilateral agencies have mobilized greater resources for child survival and health interventions ; and immunization , nutrition and reproductive health programmes have expanded .  
Loss of experienced personnel and skilled labour , declines in productivity , the need for increased resources to hire and retrain replacements , increased absenteeism and labour turnover , increased health-care costs , coupled with the human and social costs endured by the individuals and communities affected by the pandemic are imposing heavy burdens , particularly on developing countries with limited resources .  
Stresses also in this context the need for various measures by the international community , including increased trade-related technical assistance and human and institutional capacity-building for strengthening the supply capacity of exportable goods and services of developing countries , especially the least developed countries , for their full integration into the world economy ;  
Notes with concern that in the current biennium the budgetary resources for technical cooperation in the field of human rights have decreased by half as compared with the previous biennium , and requests the Secretary _ General to allocate to the human rights programme , in the context of the budgetary planning for the biennium 1998 _ 1999 , more human and financial resources for the enlargement of the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights in order to meet the substantially increased demand ;  
In many ways the performance of the Canadian economy last year was closer to that of western Europe than that of the United States : annual growth averaged some 1.5 per cent , rather less than in 1995 ; relatively weak labour markets and increased taxes held back the growth of personal disposable income , although consumption picked up to a large extent because of a steep fall in the savings ratio ; and business fixed investment is also more concerned with rationalization than expanding capacities .  
However , their situation at the regional , national and local levels has worsened as they confront increased discrimination regarding their economic , social , civil and cultural rights .  
Generally speaking , the capitalist revolution ( free-market reforms and well-conceived and prudently implemented privatization in the post cold war period ) has increased foreign investment , streamlined the public sector and reduced inflation , bringing about a significant level of stability and prosperity .  
The adoption of this theme highlighted the emphasis given by the international community to voluntary repatriation as a durable solution and asserted that a natural extension of this emphasis is the increased importance attached to the prevention of forced displacement .  
In 1995 , the gross domestic product stood at US $ 96 million , while per capita it increased to $ 6,415 .  4 .  The performance of the Turks and Caicos economy in 1995 was characterized by continued rapid growth in tourism , a steady rise in offshore financial services business and an increase in fishing activities , combined with lower inflation rates and a slight reduction in the unemployment rate .  
The above calls for coordination in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies by major industrialized countries to create and sustain conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments and technologies and appropriate knowledge to developing countries , as well as new and additional financial resources .  
As the scale of foreign capital has increased in the financial markets of certain developing countries , these markets have become highly vulnerable to shifts in sentiment among international investors and fund managers , especially since an important part is of a short-term speculative nature .  
The amount of resources potentially available under NAB is roughly $ 47-billion , double the amount that has been available under the General Arrangements to Borrow ( GAB ) , and the number of potential participating countries or monetary authorities with the financial capacity to support the international monetary system has increased to 25 , including a number of developing countries .  
The potential negative effects of trade liberalization on the least developed and net food importing countries should be mitigated by increased financial and technical assistance .  
All of the major developing regions of the world registered significant increases in primary school enrolments , with the combined total reaching some 545-million in 1995 , representing an increase of nearly 50-million in five years , double the pace of expansion during the 1980s .  Since enrolment rates increased faster than population growth , the net enrolment ratios continued to rise in all developing regions .  
Experts identified various global trends in the sector such as increased demand for health care , the phenomenon of consumerism , relative shortage of health personnel in some developed countries , aging population requiring tailor-made products , information / technology revolution , increased mobility of consumers and service providers , and increasing medical costs and decreasing public health care budgets requiring containment of health care costs .  
The importance of the national professional project personnel as the major source of expertise for technical cooperation projects has increased steadily in recent years because of their crucial advantages in transferring national private sector expertise to public institutions , using national talent that could be lost through the brain-drain and cultural compatibility with national work environment .  
The specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , as well as international and regional organizations , should therefore be invited to examine and review conditions in each of the Territories , commensurate with the pressing needs of the peoples concerned for increased transfer of resources , technology and know-how , and take appropriate measures to accelerate economic and social progress .  
Specific objectives are : food security through increased agricultural production , and improvement of nutritional levels and incomes of the poorest rural populations , the landless , marginal farmers , pastoralists , artisanal fishermen , and indigenous peoples ; and , cutting across all categories , poor rural women .  
IFAD 's Technical Assistance Grants Programme for Research and Training is a critical instrument for the pursuit of IFAD \ x { e5b8 } corporate strategy with regard to the development of innovative and effective means to eradicate rural poverty in IFAD \ x { e5b8 } own operations and , through increased policy dialogue and collaborative programming , in the operations of the entire ensemble of the operations of stakeholders in rural development .  
The gap between developed and developing countries points to the continued need for a dynamic and enabling international economic environment supportive of international cooperation , particularly in the fields of finance , technology transfer , debt and trade , if the momentum for global progress towards sustainable development is to be maintained and increased .  
Specifically , we advocate increased official development assistance , more transparent and democratic financial mechanisms , the transfer of suitable and environmentally benign technologies on concessional terms , the reorientation of technical cooperation to respond to the forces of demand in developing countries in such a way as to utilize and build indigenous expertise , the development of human resources and an improvement in the management systems and processes that run our institutions .  
Looking towards the future , he observed that this trend may very well continue but stressed that as intrastate conflicts increased , intensive peacekeeping efforts by the international community would be necessary , followed by long-term programmes to strengthen the foundations of peace .  
It should determine specific measures to foster an enabling international environment conducive to providing developing countries with increased financial and technical assistance , access to financial flows on a predictable and assured basis , increased foreign direct investment and a durable solution to debt problems .  
Convinced also that a year designed to enhance the recognition , facilitation , networking , and promotion of volunteer service , with particular emphasis upon activity at the local level , could make a significant contribution to generating increased awareness of the achievement and the further potential of volunteer service , to encouraging offers of service from a greatly expanded number of individuals , and to channelling resources to enable the even greater effectiveness of such service ,  
The implementation of the programmes as planned requires additional resources , which to an extent the Government of Lebanon has been forthcoming to make available through cost _ sharing ; a similar effort is required through increased mobilization of resources from bilateral donors and international institutions for United Nations system _ supported national programmes . 
The memorandum of understanding has paved the way for increased levels of cooperation , including discussion of possible joint missions to assess and address the needs of separated minors and other groups identified as particularly vulnerable and the establishment of common standards and practices .  
Important results have included increased gender mainstreaming in development programming , increased possibilities for UNDP to be engaged in the development of micro finance sectors as a tool for poverty alleviation , self-employment and social integration of excluded groups , and the broadening of the institutional base for civil society organization cooperation with the United Nations system .  
However , the increased international attention to , and importance of , transparency of transfers and possession of conventional arms are justified by the fact that these conventional arms cause serious human suffering in international and internal conflicts and are not subject to legal regimes in many parts of the world .  
Owing to the increasing globalization of the economy and the interdependence of national economies , the external debt problem must be addressed through a comprehensive , integrated and development-oriented approach , involving an open , rule-based and non-discriminatory international trading system , increased financial flows and increased access to technology .  
SFOR and its Civic Military Cooperation ( CIMIC ) Task Force has increased efforts to work with the Office of the High Representative and the international community on the media problems through several integrated working groups , sharing of resources and coordinated operations to develop means to counter blatant media bias and improve the populace 's ability to have alternative access to information .  
Even though there was a decrease of 1.8 per cent in the overall percentage of promotions of women in posts subject to geographical distribution , the percentage of promotions for women at the D-1 and P-5 levels has increased considerably as compared with the previous year , thus increasing the pool of women eligible for promotion to senior decision-making levels in the near future .  
In closing , she emphasized the important role of the Commission in the years to come , especially with regard to the ongoing and increasing process of globalization driven by increased foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and foreign-portfolio-equity investment flows .  
It has not been satisfied with ruining building sites in the occupied Golan since 1967 , including the liberated town of Quneitra , and established in their stead Israeli settlements whose number has gradually increased and risen to 40 settlements inhabited now by about 17,000 Israeli settlers , while suppression is imposed on building throughout the occupied Syrian villages , with heavy taxes imposed on building , which has resulted in an abnormal rise of building prices which is very onerous to the population . 
The expert group agreed that the problems raised by the imposition of coercive economic measures , including their economic , social , political and legal aspects , deserve increased attention by the international community and multilateral bodies .  
Although no reliable data exist on the prevalence of drug abuse in Afghanistan , anecdotal evidence suggests that it has increased during recent years , which may be explained as a consequence of the hard living conditions caused by a prolonged war , combined with the increasing availability of both opium and heroin .  
One result is that growing attention is being paid at the national level to the need to combine increased contestability with competition policies aimed at preventing market concentration and abuse of dominant positions , and / or with policies directly aimed at improving the competitiveness of domestic enterprises .  
There are no regular standards established to gauge the informal economy , which has increased in all countries , and the illegal or illicit economy , which is based not only on drugs , but on contraband , arms and other categories .  
At the national level , over the past 10 years , his Government had substantially increased domestic resources for development financing , but it continued to need external resources , both private and official , in order to sustain current growth rates .  
The recession had given rise to falling prices of raw materials and basic commodities , increased protectionism by the industrialized countries , the absence of a genuinely free transfer of technology , and a staggering rise in the external debt .  
In order for countries to have a real chance to eradicate poverty , they must achieve sustained economic growth , accompanied by increased public expenditure in the social sector , which could take place only in an expanding national economy .  
The speaker explained that there was an increased level of business risk flowing from increasing levels of environmental legislation and growing public interest in corporate compliance .  
Only effective and increased international cooperation could save developing nations from a deeper crisis and generate sustainable development , thereby enabling them to be true participants in the global partnership for development .  
A stable macroeconomic environment when accompanied by low inflation , competitive exchange rates , manageable public debt , democratic institutions and principles of good governance was conducive to increased domestic and foreign investment .  
For the medium term , his delegation supported calls for the development of a new international financial system based on increased accountability and global governance arrangements that were in keeping with the needs of the current globalized economy .  
His delegation was also deeply concerned about the illegal arms trade carried on by organized criminal groups , which increased the likelihood of international and internal armed conflict and resulted in the destruction of national structures and cultures .  
The international community has paid increased attention to the role that shared democratic values can play in solving major national issues and in improving the international environment .  
The potential use of diamond and DLC films in electronic circuits , where their high thermal conductivity and electrical insulation make them unique , as well as in cutting and grinding tool surfaces has led to increased commercial interest and activity .  
Holders of special procedures mandates have refined their methods of work ; increased the frequency of their country visits ; initiated , in some cases , comprehensive comparative analytical studies ; and developed procedures for handling individual complaints .  
The rise in social spending has encouraged public investment , which increased in 1997 to a level equivalent to 4 per cent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) , which in turn had a positive multiplier effect on other economic activities and on total employment .  
The majority of the reports indicate social / cultural benefits , including active involvement of local communities , increased public awareness , and maintenance of natural heritage and historical sites , as well as cleaner air .  
The Angolan economy continued to show signs of deep stagnation : foreign receipts from oil have been declining , public budget allocations have been revised downward and public domestic debt has increased .  
Their gross domestic product ( GDP ) had been over 5 per cent , inflation had stood at a 50-year low and a larger proportion of the increased capital flows into the region had been made up of foreign direct investment .  
We are particularly concerned that poverty continues unabated ; financial resources have taken a downturn ; the transfer of environmental technologies has not materialized ; human-induced climate change has increased ; trade and investments have become more difficult for developing countries ; and globalization has unleashed new threats to sustainable development .  
First , concerning the relationship between quality and quantity in the services provided by the Department and the resources allotted to its activities in the prevailing critical financial situation , it was evident that given the increased demand for public information the Department could not be expected to continue undertaking further responsibilities without additional resources .  
At the end of 1997 , the total external debt of all the developing countries and economies in transition had increased by 4 per cent compared with 1996 , and the tremendous efforts made by the developing countries to improve their performance had not been matched by international initiatives for debt reduction at the international level .  
To that end , international cooperation would have to be intensified by improving trade relations and access to markets , sharing new technologies , creating a favourable international financial and economic order and allocating increased development resources to developing countries .  
Consequently , there is increased land degradation on steep slopes , shallow coarse soils or volcanic deposits , while rehabilitation work is costly and labour scarce ; dry tropical islands present particular challenges and difficulties ;  
The Committee also recommended that efforts be intensified in order to establish a vigorous plan of increased mobilization of resources directed at the eradication of poverty , economic development , substantial reduction of debt , institution of partnership innovations , market access and trade opportunities , mobilization of domestic resources and allocation of additional resources .  
The concentration of shifting cultivators on a smaller or poorer resource base typically sets in motion a downward spiral of reduced agricultural productivity , increased forest depletion and worsened rural poverty , as cropland fallow periods are shortened and soil fertility declines .  
It was noted that the Working Group , throughout its thirty-first and thirty-second sessions , had experienced manifest difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues that arose from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures .  
Emphasizes that , in developing countries , rural development remains central to efforts to eradicate poverty and that this often includes agrarian reform , investment in infrastructure , extension of rural financial intermediation , measures to ensure food security , the provision of better education , greater utilization of appropriate technology , fair prices to provide incentives for agricultural investment and increased productivity , including productivity in the informal sector ;  
At this juncture , we would be well advised to recognize the increased risk of conflict inherent in the proliferation of high _ technology weapons with considerable aggressive potential if directed against terrestrial or space _ based targets .  
The Commission noted that the Working Group , throughout its thirty-first and thirty-second sessions , had experienced manifest difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues that arose from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures .  
However , their prospects for sustained economic growth and development continued to be dampened by their increased vulnerability to the unfavourable external economic environment , a situation that was even more critical for the least developed countries .  
Mr . Petrella ( Argentina ) , referring to the current international economic crisis , said that the countries most affected by the crisis should understand that the promotion of growth and stability was contingent on the existence of open markets that would allow increased exports , sustained flows of investment capital , the promotion of domestic savings and the continuation of structural reforms .  
These initiatives should run parallel to , and not be regarded as a substitute for , efforts to secure increased ratification and effective implementation of the existing international treaties concerning human rights , including the 1990 Convention on migrants .  
The Special Rapporteur is encouraged to note the passage of the Domestic Violence Act of 1995 , which includes provision for : a new single protection order ; a broadening of the definition of domestic violence to include psychological abuse ; increased penalties for breaches of protection orders ; free legal aid with respect to protection orders ; and new guidelines to ensure the arrest of violent abusers and the automatic revocation of firearms licences .  
The Office 's background investigations of targeted violence further confirmed the observations expressed in my previous report that the nature of violent activity in Kosovo , which has now spread to urban areas , has increased the number of persons who live in fear of being directly affected by violence or arbitrary treatment .  
Since the most recent triennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system , coordination had greatly improved , the resident coordinator system had been strengthened and cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions in such areas as humanitarian assistance , post-conflict peace-building and regional-level operations had increased .  
With regard to the volatility of financial flows , he said that while the amount of those flows to the developing countries had increased from $ 100-billion in 1990 to over $ 250-billion in 1996 , they were composed almost entirely of private capital and were concentrated in a limited number of developing countries .  
Nevertheless , it is evident that the long-term future of the Base will depend not only on the future level of peacekeeping operations ( new , ongoing and liquidating missions ) , but also on the extent to which the Base can be used to manage other assets of the United Nations , the specialized agencies , funds and programmes , as well as the extent to which its potential for training and communications services is increased .  
These activities are expected to contribute to the deepening of the regional cooperation and integration process in Africa , including effective trade liberalization , coordinated and convergent macroeconomic and sectoral policies , and to the promotion of increased investments in infrastructure development in the areas of transport and communication , energy and water and the exploration and exploitation of minerals through enhanced regional cooperation .  
Given the limited staffing capacity of the Service , its operations are more reactive than proactive : a greater focus on Headquarters strategic planning and staff resource management would lead to improved service delivery and increased effectiveness in meeting operational and administrative needs in the field .  
New modular programmes would be introduced to build specific core and managerial competencies and to build requisite skills for managing human and financial resources in a decentralized environment with increased delegation of authority and accountability ;  
There will be increased understanding of crime trends and emerging challenges in crime prevention and criminal justice , improved expertise for Member States to draw upon and enhanced international cooperation in addressing crime prevention and criminal justice concerns that require a concerted international response .  
In addition , in paragraph 25 , the Assembly expressed concern over continued high rates of self-revision during peak workload periods and occasional inadequate translations , which had sometimes hampered the work of delegations , and emphasized the importance of continuous training for all translators at all duty stations and of developing measures to provide translators with increased support from submitting offices and secretariats .  
In view of the substantial withdrawal of MONUA military units and observers , logistical support provided by the Observer Mission to the civilian police component was augmented both in terms of geographical coverage and the increased number of police observers , which reached their authorized strength of 345 by October 1998 .  
Recent cases of international capital flight from developing countries , which have created tremendous strains and increased poverty , have been attributed in part to shortcomings in domestic policies and institutions , for example , but they can also be seen as symptomatic of an international financial system which fails to differentiate satisfactorily the performance of individual developing countries .  
The Commission recognized that setting time-bound goals and targets for expanding employment and reducing unemployment would give a strong signal of the increased priority to be accorded to the objective of full employment . 7 In the past many countries have set targets for the intermediate goals of reduction of inflation or for the rate of economic growth but few set targets for the centrally important goal of employment growth and linked them with strategies for their achievement . 
The economic recovery programme and economic policy measures laid the foundation for accelerated privatization in FRY , opening up of the economy and other measures aimed at increased productivity , starting with improved conditions of business operations and the creation of real possibilities for enterprises to rid themselves of redundant workers , as well as at resolving employment issues and providing for the subsistence of these workers outside enterprises . 
Sudden inflows and equally sudden outflows of foreign capital create considerable difficulties for the management of domestic monetary policy ; 27 the resulting uncertainty and higher risks implied by financial volatility lead to caution on the part of Governments ( which tend to set interest rates higher than they might otherwise have been ) and of private business ( faced with increased costs of capital and increased uncertainty over future demand ) .  
That the rights of the child as laid out in international human rights instruments and international humanitarian law are at their most pertinent in time of armed conflict , expresses grave concern at the numerous damaging effects of armed conflicts on children and emphasizes the need for the world community to focus increased attention on this serious problem with a view to alleviating those effects ;  
Technical and economic cooperation among developing countries ( TCDC / ECDC ) facilitated increased South-South sharing of capacities through the development and dissemination of 250 best practices in good governance , structural adjustment , poverty eradication , micro-financing , maternal mortality , agriculture and food security , science and technology for sustainable human development , job creation and management of the environment and the sustainable development of small island states . 
In addition , the programme , through greater international cooperation and coordination and increased effectiveness of the United Nations human rights machinery , focuses on improving respect for human rights at the national level , the adoption of a comprehensive and integrated United Nations approach to the promotion and protection of human rights and on more efficient methods to prevent human rights violations and remove obstacles to the full realization of human rights .  
That the rights of the child as laid out in international human rights instruments and international humanitarian law are at their most pertinent in time of armed conflict , expresses grave concern at the numerous damaging effects of armed conflicts on children and emphasizes the need for the world community to focus increased attention on this serious problem with a view to alleviating those effects ;  
S &amp; amp ; D treatment could focus on specific features of market access , increased productivity , food security , the need to protect small farmers , the special situations of small island developing countries , landlocked countries , small and vulnerable economies and developing countries with large segments of the population dependent on the agricultural sector for employment .  
The budgets provide for the continued deployment of 1,350 military contingent personnel and 24 police officers , supported by an increased civilian staffing establishment of 114 international staff , 111 local staff and 13 United Nations Volunteers , with provisions for the Missions liquidation reflected in the proposed 1999 / 00 budget .  
For operational reasons , in view of a substantial quantity of military-pattern equipment provided to the MINURCA military contingents by the Government of France as a voluntary contribution in kind , increased provisions are also made for the supply under letter-of-assist arrangements of essential required spare parts and other matriel required to maintain those assets .  
In this regard , progress has been made in many developing countries where public spending on education and health has increased against a background of fiscal adjustment under IMF-supported programmes . 11 At the same time , unproductive public expenditure , such as excessive military spending , should be avoided or reduced ;

In terms of the increased role of services in the structure of the global economy , he observed that there was enormous development potential and developing countries must secure their place in this growing area .  
The Commission invited all organizations concerned with aspects of the oceans to consider whether their programmes of work provided sufficient consideration of the potential impact of increased climate variability , and to review what needed to be done to ensure adequate prediction and understanding of the impacts on coastal and marine areas of phenomena such as El Nio .  
A combination of good weather , which led to significant improvements in agricultural output , and an improved policy environment as evidenced , inter alia , by low fiscal deficits and inflation has been responsible for increased economic growth in a number of countries .  
There is a real threat that it may become an epoch in which the unmitigated promotion of increased international trade , investment and finance at the expense of the observance and protection of fundamental human rights and sustainable human development ( SHD ) is adopted as a mantra guiding many Governments and development economists as was amply demonstrated in the MAI process .  
Invited all intergovernmental agencies concerned with aspects of the oceans to consider , within their respective mandates , whether their programmes of work make sufficient allowance for considerations of the potential impact of increased climate variability , and to review through the various coordination arrangements what more needs to be done to ensure adequate understanding of the prediction of coastal and marine impacts of such phenomena as El Nio .  
Net private capital flows to emerging markets in 1999 barely increased from the low levels of 1998 , when flows contracted to less than half of their pre-crisis peak , but have been recovering modestly since mid-1999 . 
It was noted that the Working Group , throughout its thirty-first and thirty-second sessions , had experienced manifest difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues that arose from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures .  
Governments , with the increased participation of the United Nations system , civil society , donors and the private sector , are urged to pursue the research and development of new , safe , low-cost and effective family-planning and contraceptive methods , for both men and women , including female-controlled methods that both protect against sexually transmitted diseases , including HIV / AIDS , and prevent unwanted pregnancy .  
These included universal access to primary education , with special attention to closing the gender gap in primary and secondary school education , wherever it exists ; universal access to primary health care ; universal access to a full range of comprehensive reproductive health-care services , including family planning , as set out in paragraph 7.6 of the Programme of Action ; reductions in infant , child and maternal morbidity and mortality ; and increased life expectancy .

Whatever the relevance of these measures , it is important to stress that positive results objectives such as improving the living conditions of our peoples and the elimination of poverty in developing countries in general and in African countries in particular can be achieved only if there is an increased mobilization of international financial resources and a substantial alleviation of the crushing debt burden on those countries .  
It is therefore of utmost importance to recognize that responses to those changing circumstances and the achievement of sustainable development and social progress will require increased solidarity and exchange of ideas and information expressed through appropriate multilateral programmes and strengthened international cooperation .  
Decisive action at the national and international levels will determine whether these consequences will be either a downward spiral of increased poverty and environmental degradation or the achievement of sustainable development and improved quality of life for our people .  
While the increased use of advanced electronic communication , including the Internet , was welcomed and supported , views were expressed that , given the level of technological development in developing countries , emphasis should continue to be given to the traditional forms of mass media , including radio , television and print media , in order to reach a wider audience in the developing countries .  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit a report to the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session containing a comprehensive analysis of the organizational structure and technical , personnel and financial resources of the Non-Governmental Organizations Section , commensurate with the increased workload and the level of responsibility , necessary to implement the Secretariats mandate , as contained in Council resolution 1996 / 31 , parts 10 and 11 ;  
Despite the fact that four years have elapsed since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round , however , agricultural support measures in developed countries , which have been instrumental in their increased shares in agricultural exports and had detrimental impacts on developing countries , have not declined .  " Uruguay Round disciplines were not a constraint for most OECD countries . . . since . . . the current Total Aggregate Measure of Support was well below Uruguay Round commitment levels " [ 8 ] .  
The average age for a first marriage is about 29 years for females and 33 years for males , a phenomenon attributable to the higher educational standard attained by both sexes as a result of continuing to study through to the higher stages , as well as to the increased rate of participation by women in economic activity and other social and economic factors ;  
S &amp; amp ; D treatment could focus on specific features of market access , increased productivity , food security , the need to protect small farmers , the special situations of small island developing countries , landlocked countries , small and vulnerable economies and developing countries with large segments of the population dependent on the agricultural sector for employment .  
The increased political and financial support to UPE is a promising sign of greater international and domestic attention to creating a basis for effective recognition of the right to education .  
Although the growing influence of bilateral donors and conditionalities attached to their aid for education have increased the Governments budgetary allocation for primary education , this influence has not encompassed facilitating a translation of Ugandas human rights obligations - including those concerning primary education - into recognized and enforceable rights .  
The Security Council 's increased concern for the plight of civilians in armed conflict has been reinforced by the frequent briefings it has received on the humanitarian situation in countries affected by conflict , and is further illustrated by the establishment by the Council of international ad hoc criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda . 
[ Globalization and in particular financial liberalization , the extent of resources controlled by the private sector and corporate strategies for investment have at the same time far / Globalization greatly increased trade and capital flows , opens new opportunities for sustained economic growth and development of the world economy and also permits countries to share experiences and to learn from one anothers achievements and difficulties .  
The geophysical characteristics of many small islands leave them vulnerable to extreme climatological , seismic and volcanic events , and more critically to periods of drought , low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion and soil erosion , among others , and they require increased attention to watershed management , land and water use planning .  
The combined effects of this and of ongoing armed conflicts and several devastating natural calamities had a disproportionate effect on the most disadvantaged groups of society , also contributing to increased feminization of poverty .  
To meet the challenge , the Secretariat has made concerted efforts to move the discourse from a focus on definitions and prescriptive and value judgements to an emphasis on an increased understanding of the social , economic and cultural processes that affect the institution of the family in the performance of its central and irreducible functions in any society .  
The ninth G15 summit , held in Montego Bay , Jamaica , in February 1999 , had emphasized the need to find appropriate solutions to the financial crisis , which had had widespread negative economic and social consequences and had increased unemployment and poverty .  
Since landlocked developing countries were among the poorest countries in their particular geographical regions , and in addition to being landlocked most of them suffered from all the extreme handicaps of least developed countries , it was therefore important that financial assistance to landlocked developing countries be extended on the most concessional terms possible and that the flow of financial and technical assistance be prioritized and substantially increased .  
There can be little question that the increased interdependence of developed and developing countries has made trade and finance two key areas in which the introduction of coherent and complementary policies can help to achieve the maximum benefits of global growth and development .  
The project is being extended to 2001 to accommodate the increased demand for legislative assistance as a result of a comprehensive review by the Governments of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the newly independent States of their nuclear legislation and regulations , including non-proliferation and physical protection of nuclear material and facilities .  
Considerable advances have been achieved in the last five decades in social and economic development , including disease eradication , massive immunization programmes , improved agricultural productivity , increased adult literacy rates , improved sanitation and water systems , and technological advances for production and communication .

Since landlocked developing countries were among the poorest countries in their particular geographical regions , and in addition to being landlocked most of them suffered from all the extreme handicaps of the least developed countries , it was therefore important that financial assistance be extended to them on the most concessional terms possible and that the flow of financial and technical assistance be prioritized and increased substantially .  
Some of them emphasize the increased mobility of factors of production , goods and services across borders and the resultant emergence of a truly global market , others see primarily the results and future potential of an explosive progress in information technology , while still others view globalization primarily from societal and cultural perspectives .  
It provides such channels as absence of currency controls at borders ; increased and instant capital flows at the international level , making it difficult to isolate suspicious transactions ; dollarization of economies , thereby facilitating the circulation of dirty cash ; and a multiplication of the development of offshore financial services to attract foreign investments .  
Notes with appreciation the efforts of those Governments that have maintained , maintained at a high level or increased their contributions to UNDP , and encourages all Governments in a position to do so to increase their contributions and / or meet their existing commitments to UNDP and to help to put UNDP funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis and to reach the annual funding target of $ 1.1-billion ;  
In addition to the increased security and political measures taken by the international community , it is the establishment of the Kosovo Transitional Council and the active involvement , on a consultative basis , of political and local leaders in the executive functions of UNMIK that is expected to provide the most important confidence-building mechanism in the medium term for the improvement of the overall situation in Kosovo . 
This is true both because of the increased demand that we do something when gross and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law occur , and also because the new international security environment makes it more feasible to do so .  
During this time of increased calls for international resources for Kosovo and other parts of the world , when donor fatigue for Bosnia and Herzegovina is very real , the continued unwillingness of substantial parts of the local leadership to create conditions conducive to returns and to the integral implementation of the Dayton peace agreement can not be tolerated . 
Measures which should be taken to ensure the right to health are understood to be effective administration of available resources to improve health , establishment of health policies with an emphasis on prevention , increased primary health care , special attention to the health needs of the most vulnerable and free health care for the most economically disadvantaged .  
With regard to the indirect effects of economic sanctions , among the most visible and tangible signs of their adverse impact on the economies of so-called third countries are foregone tax and tariff revenues , job losses among both blue-collar and white-collar employees and , as a result , declining living standards among working people and increased social expenditures .  
It was noted that the Working Group , throughout its thirty-first and thirty-second sessions , had experienced manifest difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues that arose from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures .  
The annual summary of the economic and social situation in Africa submitted this year to the Economic and Social Council put the figure for gross domestic product growth in 1998 at 3.3 per cent , up from 2.9 per cent in 1997 , the highest growth rate of any region in the world ; it reported that the 33 African least developed countries increased their growth rate from 2.4 per cent in 1997 to 4.1 per cent in 1998 . 
The negative connotation often attached to trade liberalization , in view of its risks for employment and incomes during transition , calls for increased international assistance and improved remedies and the continuous monitoring of the developmental impact of multilateral trade agreements .  
While welcoming the Government 's proposed modest increase in the target caloric value of the food basket to 2,200 kilocalories per person per day , in view of the additional funds available , the Secretary-General recommends that the caloric value of the food basket should be increased at the minimum to 2,300 kilocalories per person per day country-wide , which was the level approved for the enhanced distribution plan for phase IV ( S / 1998 / 446 ) .  
Stability and efficiency of the national as well as regional financial markets , increased domestic savings and optimal allocation of resources are a sound basis for sustainable economic growth .  
In this context , increased win-win research into the potential to yield both direct economic benefits and positive environmental results for developing countries would be of specific importance .  
In order to carry out those difficult but necessary changes , Africa needed the international communitys support , including increased financial and humanitarian assistance , contributions to peacekeeping efforts , reduction of the debt burden , better access to export markets and incentives for foreign direct investment .  
With consistently negative economic growth and development indicators , the African countries needed an international economic and financial climate that promoted fair trade ; increased market access for African products ; stimulated net capital inflows and , above all , gave globalization a human face .  
Many developing-country speakers stressed that the vulnerability of developing countries to external shocks , particularly to swings in commodity prices , volatility in international capital flows , and financial contagion , had increased as a result of greater global integration .  
The international business community must become more actively involved in poverty reduction efforts through increased foreign direct investment ( FDI ) to developing countries , particularly the least developed countries in sub-Saharan Africa ; the prevention of systemic capital market instability ; the development of ethical trade and business principles ; and practices that were in conformity with the standards of the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) .  
Welcomes the increased cooperation between the Agency and international and regional organizations , States and relevant agencies and non-governmental organizations , which is essential to enhancing the contributions of the Agency towards improved conditions for the refugees and thereby the social stability of the occupied territory ;  
Experience with vehicles maintained and repaired at the local garages has shown that , during the initial years , when only 39 vehicles were operating in Arusha , work on the vehicles was executed more rapidly than in recent years when the fleet size significantly increased .  
National , regional and international efforts to find solutions to economic and social problems and to resolve conflicts must be increased if women were to be effectively involved in sustainable national development .  
His delegation stood behind the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States and recognized the many pressing issues that bore upon the small island States progress towards sustainable development , including the public health and economic effects of global warming , the conservation of fish stocks and the strain that increased tourism placed on local infrastructure .  
Welcomes the increased cooperation between the Agency and international and regional organizations , States and relevant agencies and non-governmental organizations , which is essential to enhancing the contributions of the Agency towards improved conditions for the refugees and thereby the social stability of the occupied territory ;  
Mr . Leiro ( Norway ) said that the assumption that globalization benefited everyone had yet to be proven ; the gap between rich and poor was growing both within and between nations and many poor countries attracted minimal foreign investment , lacked a dynamic private sector and were often deprived of the benefits of increased export earnings by heavy debt burdens and limited market access . 
After a further massive loss of human lives , increased suffering of the civilian population and immense physical destruction , the two sides found themselves roughly at the same positions they held in late 1998 .  
This early positioning for political advantage has taken place in a worsening political climate marked by increased polarization and intolerance , a rise in reports of threats and of acts of intimidation and harassment and continuing mutual mistrust between the political actors and between the latter and the Government , as well as repeated outbreaks of street violence , some undoubtedly politically motivated .  
It was noted that the Working Group , throughout its thirty-first and thirty-second sessions , had experienced manifest difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues that arose from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures .  
In a pessimistic scenario , increased pressure for an expanded role would undercut the WTOs already precarious level of political support , threatening existing international openness .  
The Registrys requirements for contractual services are estimated at $ 19,649,200 , reflecting an increase of $ 1,005,900 , owing to the revised detainee service agreements , the commencement of French verbatim reporting by an institutional contractor and increased requirements for contractual translation to meet urgent requirements caused by trial and appeal activities ( see A / 54 / 518 , para .  54 ) .  
Notes , in particular , Governing Council decision 20 / 31 of 4 February 1999 , entitled Proposed programme budget of the United Nations Environment Programme : revised requirements for the biennium 1998-1999 and proposed requirements for the biennium 2000-2001 , which gives concrete support to the integrated work programme of the Programme and endorsement of its new functional organizational structure , and anticipates an increased level of funding to the Environment Fund for the biennium 2000-2001 ;  
To encourage and persuade other States Parties and financial institutions to join them in the transfer of technology and increased technical cooperation by providing more training programmes and modern equipment to developing countries in order to assist them in achieving the objectives of this Convention . 3 .  These measures shall be without prejudice to existing foreign investment commitments or to other financial cooperation arrangements at the bilateral , regional or international level .  
So , references to wider macroeconomic concerns , i.e . debt relief and calls for increased official development assistance ( ODA ) levels by developed countries should be balanced by acknowledgement of the primary duty of all States to provide the conditions for the realization of the right to development , via good governance and the effective use of existing resources .  
Export subsidies should be outlawed , domestic producer subsidies reduced , access under tariff quotas increased , tariff escalation on processed agricultural products removed , and the level and the dispersion of bound tariffs on agricultural imports reduced .  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies in the last few years , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , in particular of civilians , the suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , in particular those of developing countries ,  
Calls for increased international cooperation to address the challenges of globalization through the enhanced participation of developing countries in the international economic policy decision-making process ; integrated consideration of trade , finance , technology transfer and development issues by the relevant international institutions ; and continuation of a wide range of reforms of the international financial system ;  
The matter of displaced persons and refugees could be settled only with the participation of the international community as a whole in establishing plans for integrated economic and social development through increased financial and technical cooperation .  
Other benefits , such as enhanced civic vitality , increased social solidarity and improved feelings of public safety , are important but are rarely measured in typical , empirical evaluation studies .  
Humanitarian agencies fear increased suffering of the most vulnerable , particularly refugees , internationally displaced persons , the disabled , children , the chronically ill , urban elderly and social cases .  
In view of the serious financial implications of the increased and unprecedented number of ex post facto presentations by field missions , regional economic commissions and international criminal tribunals to their respective local Committees on Contracts , and , when required , to the Headquarters Committee on Contracts ( " the Committee " ) , and in order to ameliorate the adverse consequences of this improper practice , the following provisions should be implemented immediately :  
Calculate the revised net base floor salaries at the dependency and single rates at each grade and step by increasing the corresponding net salaries from the existing scale by a predetermined percentage by which the existing base floor salary scale is to be increased .  
In addition , the programme , through greater international cooperation and coordination and increased effectiveness of the United Nations human rights machinery , focuses on improving respect for human rights at the national level , the adoption of a comprehensive and integrated United Nations approach to the promotion and protection of human rights and on more efficient methods to prevent human rights violations and remove obstacles to the full realization of human rights . 
The State of Bahrain is pleased and willing to contribute to international efforts aimed at achieving increased international economic cooperation , due to its stability and strategic location , and the trade and investment environment it enjoys elements that have helped it attract foreign capital and enhance its standing as an advanced financial and commercial centre .  
Equally important , they must promote and incorporate policies for universal access to basic and primary education , improved literacy , increased life expectancy , reduced infant and maternal mortality rates and the achievement of levels of health that lead to socially and economically productive lives .  
In order to meet the requirements of domestic resource mobilization to strengthen the fragile economies in Africa and reduce poverty there , current levels of external funding sources , such as official development assistance and foreign direct investment , need to be increased .  
In this connection , improved terms of trade , access to international markets , increased direct foreign investments , alleviation of the external debt burden and an expanded resource base are some of the crucial issues that have to be seriously considered .  
To this must be added the growing number of hotbeds of tension and conflict between and within States , the growing risk of outbreaks of ethnic , tribal and sectarian conflicts , greater risks of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , especially nuclear weapons , increased stockpiles of conventional weapons and the growth of terrorism as an international phenomenon that threatens democracy , human rights and international peace and security .  
The declared objective of the Convention is the achievement and preservation worldwide of a high level of nuclear safety through increased implementation of national measures and international cooperation .  
In Syria we look forward to a Middle East region where a just , lasting and comprehensive peace prevails , a peace based on international legality , not on expansion , occupation and the monopoly of nuclear military power , which can only lead to increased tension in the Middle East .  
The economic and political developments in international relations ; the far-reaching changes that have taken place , particularly in the wake of the end of the cold war ; and the accession of many new States to the membership of the United Nations all have made it imperative that the Security Council be reformed , its membership increased and its methods of work and activities made more effective in the discharge of the mandate entrusted to it by the Charter of the United Nations .  
Women are occupying more important positions in everyday life , and the numbers of women participating in all economic , cultural , political , social and intellectual activities has increased significantly .  
Initiatives in this area include safe delivery and neo-natal assistance , cervical and breast cancer prevention , voluntary access to contraceptive methods , regulation of surgical male and female sterilization , assistance within the public health system for legal abortion and adequate treatment of incomplete abortion.The number of free pre-natal care visits in Brazil increased almost threefold in the last four years .  
The problem of HIV AIDS is of prime importance in the policy of the Government of Honduras , and the focus of reproductive rights and of attention to priority vulnerable population groups is therefore principally on promoting low-risk behaviour , through a sustained and systematic information and education campaign , and through increased medical , counselling , hospital and laboratory services for sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS .  
The geophysical characteristics of many small islands leave them vulnerable to extreme climatological , seismic and volcanic events , and more critically to periods of drought , low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion and soil erosion , among others , and they require increased attention to watershed management , land and water use planning .  
Invites all intergovernmental agencies concerned with aspects of the oceans to consider , within their respective mandates , whether their programmes of work make sufficient allowance for considerations of the potential impact of increased climate variability , and to review through the various coordination arrangements what more needs to be done to ensure adequate understanding of the prediction and coastal and marine impacts of such phenomena as the El Nio phenomenon .  
Referring to the numerous calls by the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights for increased collaboration in the field of human rights among United Nations organs , specialized agencies and the various parts of the Secretariat , Mr . Alston stressed the need to build up a genuine partnership aiming at realizing the right to education as embodied in articles 13 and 14 of the Covenant . This applied equally to the various treaty bodies . 
Recommends that , given the extent of the burgeoning energy demand and the financial constraints in developing countries , partnerships and collaboration on renewable as well as on conventional sources of energy , such as those envisaged in the clean development mechanism and the joint implementation arrangements envisioned in the context of the Kyoto Protocol8 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , 9 should be increased in order to :  
To the contrary , tensions have increased in many parts of the world and have intensified human suffering because of a resurgence of the arms race with the attendant death , exodus , ethnic cleansing and famine .  
These achievements have been made more appreciable through the promotion of social dialogue following the signing of the agreement of 1 August 1996 by the Government and the social partners , the revitalization of the consultative process , and the gradual emancipation of civil society and its increased involvement in economic , social and cultural development .  
The Commission had expressed its appreciation for the work accomplished by the Working Group in its preparation of draft uniform rules on electronic signatures , and at the same time had noted that the Working Group had experienced difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues arising from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures , and on how those issues might be addressed in an internationally acceptable legal framework .  
The period marked increased collaboration between ICMC and several Council agencies , particularly those that extended funding for its actions in favour of persons uprooted or forced into flight because of war and conflict , racial or ethnic persecution , human rights violations , and environmental degradation.The ICMC programmes supported by Council agencies included : 
The Guidelines follow three broad and interconnected approaches , namely ( a ) improvement of governmental capacity for acknowledging the Governments responsibility for multisectoral coordination ; ( b ) widespread reform of laws and legal support services with a focus on the status of women , children and vulnerable groups ; and ( c ) support for increased private sector and community participation in the response to HIV AIDS .  
At a time when ways and means were being studied to better coordinate and strengthen the special procedures system , Malaysia , although it recognized the importance of preserving the systems independence and impartiality , stressed that the human rights mechanisms needed to be adjusted and rationalized , that their effectiveness must be increased in order to improve their credibility and that their objectives must be made clear .  
Where backward linkages between tourism and other sectors of the economy are weak or absent , income and employment multipliers from tourism are lower because the potential stimulus to indirect spending is dissipated by increased imports rather than domestic production , as happens with many small island developing States .  
Accordingly , it would appear timely to convene a meeting between government officials and representatives of the international community for the purpose of devising a common strategy for addressing not only the present , and very pressing , needs of the internally displaced for continued humanitarian assistance , but also their own expressed desire to become more self-reliant through increased access to opportunities for employment and other means of income-generation .  
Regrettably , it was observed , some of the psycho-social programmes established in the past had separated children from the community and had been designed in such a way that they actually increased the level of trauma and anxiety experienced by the intended beneficiaries .  
Providing increased financial and technical assistance to small island developing States for building human resource and institutional capacity at the national and regional levels ;  
In absolute terms , the use of modern renewable energy technology has increased , particularly solar PV systems , enabling households in small remote villages to operate a few electric lights and small appliances , such as televisions and video cassette recorders , small medical refrigerators , telecommunication equipment and water pumps .  
Currently , very few if any renewable energy sources are being developed on a commercial basis in small island developing States , and if the increased use of solar PV systems continues to depend on public funding and external assistance , effective institutional approaches must be developed . 
The interdependence in which SMEs were supposed to live was fraught with increased complexity and risks of instability and marginalization.For many African SMEs , the opportunities created by technological advances , the increased mobility of production factors and regional trading arrangements were either still nominal or not fully accessible . 
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in the last few years , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , in particular those of developing countries ,  
Under the new article , if the active subject engages in such conduct habitually ; abuses trust or authority ; uses deception , violence or intimidation ; is an older or younger relative , husband , brother , guardian , caregiver or person responsible for the upbringing of the victim ; or if the victim is a minor , the prison sentence is increased from the maximum medium term ( 5 years ) to any of the longer terms ( 5 years and 1 day to 20 years ) imposed by article 367 .  
In 1995 , Act No . 19 , 381 was published ; the Act increased some of the entitlements for male and female participants and regulated such areas as the authority of the Superintendency ; participants right to claim any surplus between their legal contribution and the cost of their agreed health plans ; increased access of participants to information ; regulation of coverage limits ; and exclusions .  
The action to be taken by Governments includes a range of practical and systematic measures directed at the full implementation of human rights instruments , the promotion of human rights education , the creation of national institutions for promoting women ' s rights , the promotion of the human rights of indigenous women , and the adoption of strategies for the mainstreaming of gender perspectives through increased and strengthened efforts and cooperation .  
Parts of the region are also concerned about increased mineral loading in marine estuaries from upstream , intensive paddy cultivation and the conversion of intertidal zones ( i.e . , salt marsh and mangrove ) to rice paddy .  
an increased commitment by Governments at the national and local levels , and their partners in civil society , to guide public and private investments for the provision of adequate shelter , basic infrastructure and services ;  
The development of more cost-effective mapping procedures based on satellite data will surely result in increased use of remote sensing data and consequently expand the market for such data , enabling developing countries to collect and update basic information on the topographic and thematic ( natural resource ) cartography of their territories .  
Bangladesh commended the Secretary-General for highlighting the plight of women in rural areas , women migrant workers and girls affected by traditional and customary practices , and agreed that the effects of globalization and liberalization , along with declining international cooperation , had resulted in the increased marginalization of rural women throughout the developing world .  
In the current economic circumstances , as world poverty increased , the threshold got closer and closer to the poverty level instead of reflecting the average distance between rich and poor .  
Governments , with the increased participation of the United Nations system , civil society , donors and the private sector , are urged to pursue the research and development of new , safe , low-cost and effective family-planning and contraceptive methods , for both men and women , including female-controlled methods that both protect against sexually transmitted diseases , including HIV AIDS , and prevent unwanted pregnancy .  
The Commission had stressed the need for promoting increased transparency and appropriate accountability for the implementation of sound national and corporate development policies , which enhance a country ' s abilities to reduce vulnerability to external shocks and volatile flows of short-term capital . 
First , countries which possessed space technology tended to monopolize the exploration and use of outer space for their own benefit while developing countries such as his own faced serious constraints which aggravated their poor economic situation and increased their debt .  
China therefore opposed any monopoly or militarization of outer space and favoured increased international cooperation in outer space based on peaceful uses , equality , mutual benefit , mutual learning and shared development .  
However , taking into consideration the unsatisfactory nutritional situation in Iraq and the necessity to provide a full food basket on a monthly basis , I have recommended to the Government of Iraq that the caloric value of the food basket should be increased to at least 2 , 300 kilocalories per person per day throughout the country ( see S 1999-1053 , annex I ) , which was the level approved for the enhanced distribution plan for phase IV ( see S 1998-446 ) .  
We emphasize that , in addition to the direct impact on the physical infrastructure of the health , education , housing and human settlements sectors , one of the principal effects of natures ravages on the population is their increased vulnerability to disease and the deterioration of nutritional and food security ; it is therefore essential to give priority to these aspects on the regional integration agenda .  
While there had been a significant strengthening of civil and political rights and fundamental freedoms , there had been no real progress in economic , cultural and social rights , which had even regressed because of the introduction of costly structural adjustments that had led to increased poverty , wider income gaps , reduced social security systems and increasing unemployment .  
Calls for increased international cooperation to address the challenges of globalization through the enhanced participation of developing countries in the international economic policy decision-making process ; integrated consideration of trade , finance , technology transfer and development issues by the relevant international institutions ; and the continuation of a wide range of reforms of the international financial system ;  
Decentralization of authority and decision-making should be encouraged ; as decentralization proceeds , there is a need to increase local capacities ; policies are needed to promote economic empowerment , enhanced civil participation and increased human resources at the local or community level ; there is a compelling need to evaluate services on the basis of data received from service users at the community level ;  
The drop in aid contributions , especially the continuing decline in the share of net official development assistance in the gross domestic product of donor countries , had led to increased reliance on private loans on the international capital market .  
Goals and targets agreed upon by the international community in relation to sustainable development , such as the adoption of national sustainable development strategies and increased support to developing countries , must be implemented in a timely fashion .  
The fact that the number of people worldwide living in abject poverty has increased is a clear signal of the imbalances and bias in the current global financial and trading system .  
This decentralized form of government has increased administration at the local level and proved to be the ideal way to ensure political participation from the grassroots to the uppermost levels .  
After a further massive loss of human lives , increased suffering of the civilian population and immense physical destruction , the two sides found themselves roughly in the same positions they held in late 1998 .  
After a further massive loss of human lives , increased suffering of the civilian population and immense physical destruction , the two sides found themselves roughly in the same positions they held in late 1998 .  
While the need for increased foreign direct investment remains paramount , we also wish to point out that our developed partners should continue to assist us and reverse the current trend of the decline in official development assistance .

The deputies and committee members were of the view : Although currently the overall situation is marked by social stability and sustained economic growth , we have been facing in-depth contradictions and problems accumulated over the years and new challenges arising from phased changes in economic development , such as effective demand in the domestic market has been insufficient , contradictions resulting from the unreasonable economic structure have become increasingly prominent , the employment pressure has increased , and increase in peasants ' incomes have slowed down .  
Since the beginning of reform and opening up , the egalitarian system of eating from the same big pot in rural areas has been broken , households have become the main entities for economic operation and investment , and peasants have continuously increased their initiative in participating in the social , political , and economic lives .  
In the face of the new situation of insufficient effective demand in the last two years , the central government put forward the fundamental policy of expanding demand and implemented a proactive fiscal policy and other supporting macroeconomic policies .  It issued additional treasury bonds and increased investment in infrastructure construction and technological transformation to bring along bank lending and nongovernmental investment and expand investment demand .  
After Tibet 's peaceful liberation , especially since the Democratic Reform , the people of all ethnic groups on this snow plateau have been living in harmony and sharing weal and woe with one another .  They have gradually formed a socialist ethnic relationship marked by equality , unity , and mutual assistance .  Reform and opening-up have increased economic and technological exchanges between the Tibetans and the people of other ethnic groups , thereby enhancing their solidarity .  
It is necessary to adhere to the principle of doing ideological and political work and doing economic and vocational work at the same time .  Ideological and educational work should permeate practical work , and the actual results in ideological and political work should be increased .  
According to the " 2000 report on China 's national economic and social development " published recently by the State Planning Commission , in 1999 , the total employment of China 's primary industry reduced by 1.96-million and that of the secondary industry increased by only 2.54-million , while the tertiary industry not only absorbed the great majority of the year 's new labor force but also accepted some of the labor force transferred from primary and secondary industry . 
But over the years , Lee Teng-hui [ Li Denghui ] has repeatedly provoked the " one China " principle , kept trying to solicit foreigners ' support , and hugely increased military spending for armament development .  Since the 1990 ' s , the national defense spending has grown by an average of 6.94 percent , with over $ 12-billion actual budget per year .  Over $ 40-billion has also been invested in purchasing weaponry , in a vain bid to " resist reunification with force " , which is , in reality , an idle dream .  
According to the latest statistics made by the People 's Bank of China , in the first quarter of this year , China 's banking and financial operations were normal and stable and showed a trend of positive development .  Continual increases in money supply and total credit met the need in expanding domestic demand , promoting production and the growth of consumption , and conformed in the main to the economic development .  The deposits of enterprises increased by a great extent , loans extended by financial institutions were expedited , and foreign exchange reserves increased steadily .  
Analyzing the distribution of increased loans , we can see that those loans have not only satisfied the need of state key construction projects , infrastructure construction and the reasonable funds requirement of large and medium sized enterprises , but also supported the development of medium and small enterprises and non-public sectors of the economy as well as the personal consumption needs .  Those loans have played an important role in expanding domestic consumption and promoting economic development .  
China 's economy has maintained a favorable momentum of sustained , rapid and sound development , ranking the seventh in the world in terms of economic aggregates .  Its overall national strength has increased markedly and the texture of life of its people improved notably .  
As in-depth changes in the military fields in the world are caused by the development of modern science and technology , especially high technology , the scientific and technological content of army building and modern warfare has been increased to an unprecedentedly high level .  This has put ever higher demands on the scientific and cultural qualities of our officers and men .  
However , since the goals were not clear and the standards were not clear , the understanding of " computerization and informationization " led to an emphasis on hardware , while taking software lightly ; an emphasis on single units , while taking networking lightly ; and an emphasis on development and redundant construction projects .  Shortcomings occurred where systems construction was not complete ; technical systems were not compatible ; and non unified standards increased daily .  
After the new technologies and new methods of operation produced through the academy and troops ' joint effort in tackling key problems were popularized and applied in the various relevant units , the scientific and technological content of army training have greatly increased .  As a result , troop training through science and technology , in which the troops under training strike extreme low-altitude , high-speed targets with air defense missiles , has gotten over its " bottleneck " and is developing in the direction of high quality and greater depth .  
Starting last year , we implemented drastic reforms in such overall areas of the enterprises as management models , mechanisms for motion , and management scope .  We greatly increased overall planning and policy , liquidation and investment , capital management , organized marketing , science and technology research and development for customer service and handling of public relations , and basically realized transformation from a State administered company to large size enterprise group .  
It was reported that the north and the south of the peninsula have continually stepped up all sorts of exchanges with each other in order to create a favorable atmosphere for the forthcoming north-south summit .  The news media of both the north and the south have cut down on their recriminations against each other to a considerable extent and have increased their propaganda reports calling for strengthening dialogue and cooperation instead .  
First , the final document avoids a grim aspect of the current international security situation in order to achieve unanimity in consultations .  In recent years , military factors have increased in international relations , with some military groups being expanded and strengthened .  
They also pointed out : Economic globalization has impacted the industries and domestic markets of developing countries that are in a " vulnerable positions " on differing degrees , and have greatly increased the risks of economic fluctuations and of triggering a financial crisis in a country .  Economic globalization has continuously widened the gap between the rich and the poor around the globe , and the economic sovereignty and independence of many countries have been tested .  
He said : Over the last few years , although the home electrical appliance industry , including the color television industry , has faced fierce competitions and experienced many price wars and price cuttings , and the price signal has indicated that supply of home electrical appliance has seriously outstripped market demand , the production capacity of home electrical appliance has not shrunk - - as a matter of fact , it has increased to some degree .  Moreover , not many enterprises have been eliminated .  The market competition mechanism has not played a noticeable role .  
After the beginning of reform and opening-up , our country 's gross economic quantity continued to expand .  GDP increased from 362.4-billion yuan to over 8,000-billion yuan , ranking seventh place in the world and ranking first among all developing countries .  The output of major farm produce and industrial products also ranks in an advanced position in the world .  
Statistical data from a battlefield showed that , after a tank crew have stayed in a small and closed space for a long time where it is filled with various kinds of radiation , waste gases , electromagnetic waves , heat , and noises , tank speed reduced by 19 percent , time to complete shooting increased by 35 percent , miss-hitting increased by 4 percent , and , in real-combat exercises , their fighting capacity declined by 7 to 10 percent everyday .  
The lightning pace of the advance of modern technology is right now influencing the earth on which we live with its mysterious power .  It is creating an unprecedented productive force , but at the same time , it also brings a host of problems like energy crises , environmental pollution , filth from the Internet , and increased polarization on a global scale .  Humanity even has the " nuclear threat " , with which it can destroy itself many times over .  
Compared to the same period last year , among the 14 key industries , metallurgical , petrochemical , machinery , electronics , light industry , textile , pharmaceutical , tobacco , and gold industries saw their profits increased and the power industry maintained a relatively high level of profitability .  
Besides , the armored units , the missile units , and other heavy equipment formed organic units to take part in the training for the first time in places over 5,000 m above the sea level on an average in the hinterland of the Kalakunlun Shan . The troops were tempered and their combat capability on plateaus under conditions similar to those of an actual combat was increased .  
The ice slabs , ice tunnels , and ice trenches in a certain defensive zone were natural obstacles that delayed our tactical movements in the past .  This time , our infantry detachments , which followed the armored cars , were imbued with heroism and forged straight ahead .  Their combat capability has obviously increased .  
As compared with the same period last year , among 14 major trades , metallurgical , petrochemical , machinery , electronic , light , textile , pharmaceutical , tobacco , and gold industries experienced increased profits .  Power industry continuously maintained a fairly high level of profit .  
In consumption , last year 84-million medium and low-wage townsfolk increased their income , bank interest was reduced , tax on interest was levied , and the system of true names for deposits was put into effect , festival holidays were extended , and other policies for stimulating consumption were put into effect ; all this played a role in encouraging people , with the result that social consumption changed out of the slackness of the previous two years .  
Through making efforts over the last 20 years or so , we have eventually opened up a most lively , active , and creative ideological and political situation in the history of our party and country and the ideological level and understanding capability of the masses of people have been greatly increased .  
The input into the construction of ecological construction has been noticeably increased .  The engineering projects of returning grain plots to forestry and protecting natural forests and the projects of harnessing " three rivers " ( Huaihe River , Liaohe River , and Haihe River ) and " three lakes " ( Taihu Lake , Dianchi Lake , and Chaohu Lake ) have obtained phased achievements .  The environmental quality in urban areas has improved and the sense of environmental protection among the whole people has noticeably enhanced .  
And the scientific and technological elements in these direct investments of foreign businessmen have increased , more transnational corporations have come to invest in China , and the scale of independent investments has expanded .  
In the face of the new situation , new state of affairs , and new issues , we have timely readjusted those moderately tight financial policies and monetary policies into actively financial policies and steady and safe monetary policies and coordinately applied various means to regulate and control economic operations .  We have both increased investment in infrastructure construction and supported the technical renovation of enterprises .  
Judging from the implementation of the five-year plan in the first four years , a sustained and steady growth was attained in agricultural production , the conditions of the supply and demand of agricultural products were fundamentally improved , the agricultural structural adjustment made a new advance , agriculture and the non-agricultural sector developed unceasingly , the peasants ' incomes increased to some extent , quality of life was further enhanced , and the rural economy obtained comprehensive development .  
With the acceleration of the establishment of the modern enterprise system , the strategic readjustment of the national economy , and the successive introduction of major reform measures , such as changing debts into equity , mergers and reorganization , the vitality of state-owned enterprises increased significantly and the goal of getting enterprises out of their plight was basically attained .  
The state has increased the intensity of investment in the ecological construction , carried out the natural forest protection project in a comprehensive way , activated the experimental project of returning land unfit for cultivation to forestry , prevented and controlled desertification , engaged in the work of soil and water conservation vigorously , controlled the water pollution in some major rivers to reach the targets within the time limit , and took the perpetual use of natural resources and the coordinated development of economy and environment more seriously than ever before .  
Besides , it has taken into consideration that providing long distance logistic support is prone to air raids by the enemy and has used abandoned vehicles to set up fake car parks , fake oil refueling stations , fake rear commanding posts , fake medical centers , and used camouflage in the air to hide the real and show the fake .  It has developed , through exploration , various means and methods to " guard against precision attacks , electronic attacks , reconnaissance and monitoring so that the overall logistic protection capability has been remarkably increased " .  
This requires the maintenance of the democratic centralist system and the effective implementation of the collective leadership system and the regulations for making decisions through collective discussion .  The internal supervision and the check-and-balance capacity inside leading bodies must be increased .  
In the exercise of " continuous attacks by submarines against an enemy frigate formation " organized by the base in early November , commanders of the " Red " and the " Blue " sides carried out confrontations without giving advance notice on their operational intentions .  Strong winds and heavy storms happened to be ragging at the sea area where the drill was conducted .  Large sea waves and low visibility increased the difficulty of spotting the targets .  
Fourth , the mutual visits and reunion of separated families of both sides and the fluttering of " flags of both sides on the Korean peninsula " during the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games increased understanding between the north and the south , and expressed their wishes of realizing peaceful reunification through self-reliance .  
After the reversion , the government of the special administrative region made the solution of social security the primary job under the strong support of the central government and increased the force to hit all crime activities , and had a distinct affect .  
China sustained , rapid , healthy development during the period of the Ninth Five-Year Plan must first be attributed to the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the center .  Their outstanding leadership skill in economic control and in flexible economic adjustment brought about the success , as did the incisive reforms by the macroeconomic adjustment departments .  The increased pace of the change of functions provided the beneficial conditions .  
Under the impetus of economic globalization , humanity has expanded its interaction , its contacts , and its understanding , and increased friendship , cooperation , and support .  Various converging and intermingling cultural torrents have smashed the " iron curtain " between countries with different social systems and ideologies , marking a new era in the ways countries compete and test their strength against one another .  
In order to meet the needs of future combined operations , the US military emphasized that more joint or combined exercises should be organized in future , and in particular the proportion of political military exercises should be increased .  
In recent years , following its sustained economic growth , India has become more eager to have its position as a big country recognized .  Therefore , it has continuously increased its national defense budget ( The 2000-2001 national defense budget increased by as much as 28.2 percent . ) and strengthened its military strength in quantity and quality .  
A destroyer squadron of the East China Sea Fleet has concentrated their efforts on solving problems at the " bottleneck " that restricts the increase of its combat capacity , carried out technical innovation and research , and successfully developed an automatic missile checking device , a missile loader checking device , and a missile full start checking system .  This has turned something sophisticated , unwieldy and backward into something simple , ingenious and advanced and has greatly increased the quick response capacity of the squadron .  
To increase the quick response capacity and the capacity to gain the initiative by striking first by the destroyers , the technical personnel of the squadron have boldly reformed the traditional methods for checking missiles before they are launched .  They have invented a way to check missiles quickly and to optimize the checking procedures without changing the technical performance of missiles .  This has greatly increased the response capacity of the system of multi-series vessel missiles and has ensured " launching missiles before the enemy . "  
Since atat present and for a certain present and in a given period of the future , our country will continuously focus on the economic construction , it is impossible for our country to substantially increase its investment in the military spending while the military faces complex and arduous tasks in the military modernization construction which does require an increased of the investment in the military spending .  The contradiction between the affordable practicality of and the need for demanded mmilitary spending will exist for a long time .  
During his US visit , by extensively coming into contact with US leaders , senior officials , and public figures from various circles , Vice Premier Qian has stepped up dialogues and exchanges , sought common grounds while reserving or narrowing differences , increased common understanding , expanded cooperation , and implemented the important consensus reached between the two heads of state on jointly promoting bilateral relations .

During the visit , the two sides conducted extensive , constructive , and frank and sincere dialogue ; increased mutual understanding ; and expressed the wish to make a concerted effort to push forward Sino-US relations .  
In recent years , Communist China has rapidly promoted military modernization and its national strength has continued to grow , while economic and trade relations between the two sides of the strait have become increasingly closer .  Besides , the succession of Communist China 's leading power will also take place in the near future .  All those factors have increased the attention of people at home and abroad to the question of arms sales to Taiwan by the United States .  
After our entry into the WTO , we must take advantage of the restrictions of increased production costs and insufficient resources for agricultural products in certain developed countries and regions and seek favorable opportunities to invest and build production bases abroad , further expand our force in attracting foreign agricultural business and capital , actively improve the agricultural investment environment and draw up agricultural policy in line with local conditions to attract investment by foreign business , and attract foreign business to invest in and operate agricultural enterprises as well as participate in comprehensive agricultural development in China .  
Russia has also merged some of its higher command schools with some of its engineering technology schools and increased courses on engineering technology for its postgraduate students studying in the command specialty by a large margin with an eye on training qualified high-level military personnel who are well-versed in scientific and cultural knowledge and proficient in various military specialties .  
In particular , since the two countries established diplomatic relations , the two sides have maintained frequent high-level exchanges , enhanced economic and trade cooperation , markedly increased contacts in scientific and cultural fields , and maintained sound cooperation in international affairs . "  
US allies generally connected this incident with the United States ' diplomatic tradition and the new Bush administration 's foreign policy .  They expressed the belief that such overbearing words and deeds to get what one wanted were no longer appropriate , increased tensions in the world , and made countries uneasy .  
The committee members held that the economic situation in the first quarter of this year was rather stable , and the gross domestic product increased by 8.1 percent according to comparable prices over the same period of the previous year .  The growth rate was kept at the same level as that of the same period last year .  A good tendency to grow steadily was maintained .  
Investment in the western areas increased obviously faster than that in the central and eastern parts of the country .  The high growth rate of investment was a result of the state 's policy to increase investment projects funded by national debt , and was also related to the fact that the base figure in the same period of last year was comparatively low and the construction periods this year moved ahead of schedule .  
In recent years , China and Austria increasingly enhanced their exchanges and cooperation in the political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , cultural , and environmental protection fields and also increased friendly exchanges at the provincial and city level .  
Some of the right wing figures in the moderate group even believed that , based on this , trade contact is helping to increase China 's overall national power and leading to an increased military threat of Taiwan by the mainland , and that the risk of the United States being involved in a regional conflict is even greater .  
Ding Jiye : This reform stresses improving the method and procedure in drawing up the budget .  The main special features are : The reform itself does not require increased input , while the regulation and control function of the military budget is markedly strengthened , the economic returns on military funds will be markedly enhanced , and funds can be concentrated on ensuring preparedness for military struggle ;  
While seizing the historical opportunities and concentrating strength on advancing modernization , we must also be soberly aware that the contemporary world is still not peaceful though the situation is easing on the whole , and the parity of international strength is seriously imbalanced .  Hegemonism and power politics still exist and make new developments in the fields of international politics , economy , and security .  Military interventionism has further increased .  
The continuous growth of the tax revenue has contributed significantly to the increased financial strength of various levels of government , effective implementation of the proactive fiscal policy , and the sustained , fast , and healthy development of the national economy .  
In the last 10 years , China 's private enterprises ' average registered capital has increased from 93,000 yuan to 681,000 yuan , increasing by more than 6 folds , but each enterprise 's employment has been reduced from 18.1 persons to 13.4 persons , cutting back by as much as one-quarter .  
This means each 100,000 yuan increase in capital only increased employment by 1 person .  This equipment level is comparable to the Chinese industries ' current average equipment level , and the trend is for the level to rise year after year .  The private economy 's labor-intensive characteristic is fast eroding .  
With the full support of Internet technology , the website has adopted an advanced databank structure and developed the function of multiple search , thus ensuring on-line audiovisual broadcast of an increased amount of pictures and precious historical materials , whose pictures and texts look excellent .  
Premier Zhu Rongji 's visit increased mutual understanding between China and the five countries , promoted bilateral economic and trade cooperation , consolidated and strengthened existing traditional friendly and good-neighborly relations , and expanded China 's influence .  
All of the 62 engineering projects which were built with aid from the whole country to Tibet have already been delivered for use , the situation of infrastructures in Tibet like transportation , energy resources , and communications lagging seriously behind has been greatly improved , its priority industries have been developed , and the living standards of the people have been further increased .  These are vivid embodiments of the central authorities applying the ideology of development to direct the work in Tibet .  
Qian Qichen pointed out that Asia and Europe have different ideologies and policies , but the two sides have steadily enhanced their mutual understanding and trust and increased cooperation through equal and frank dialog and consultation at a high level on a regular basis . 
General knowledge of the law has been widespread , and education in the legal system has been combined closely with the practice of law .  As a result , citizens ' awareness of the law has noticeably increased , and various social undertakings are vigorously managed according to law .  All this has played an important role in implementing the basic plan for governing the country according to law and building a country under the rule of the socialist legal system and played a guaranteeing role in maintaining the overall situation in reform , development , and stability .  
This partnership is aimed at pursuing common development through increased bilateral cooperation , proceeding from the reality that both China and Venezuela are developing nations faced with the task of expediting economic development to raise the living standards of the people .  
In military affairs , he has advocated a " decisive battle offshore " , increased military spending , intensified the purchase of advanced offensive weapons , and advocated that the United States should " coordinate in the defense of Taiwan " and help Taiwan to resist an " attack " by the mainland .  
Although water conservation work has been constantly strengthened , flood prevention capacities of major rivers in our country have been increased , and the flood prevention standards for these rivers have been raised in recent years , no fundamental change has been made in the weak foundation of flood prevention projects across the country , and risky sections of dikes and dams as well as risky reservoirs remain to be serious potential dangers in flood prevention .  
Under the banner of " self defense " , they broke through the " restricted zone " set by the constitution and relevant ordinances .  They have kept engaging in arms expansion .  They have increased their military spending year by year , ignoring long ago the regulation that Japan 's military expenditure is not allowed to exceed 1 percent of its gross national product .  
However , such suppression has also increased the national sentiment on the mainland , thus preventing its internal moderate forces from gaining ground , and isolation may even lead to dangerous rash actions .  Taiwan may become the victim of the international power struggle .  This is the most pressing crisis to Taiwan at present .  
As a result of implementation in the past six years of this guiding principle for the work in Tibet in the new period , the whole region 's social situation has stabilized , rate of economic growth has increased remarkably , efforts in reform and opening up have gradually picked up , construction of infrastructure facilities including that of energy , transportation and communication has developed fairly fast , local financial revenues have registered a relatively greater increase , and the people 's livelihood has clearly improved .  
He said that in recent years the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries of China and Cuba have developed rapidly , there has been mutual understanding and support in the political field , economic cooperation has unceasingly expanded , various exchanges have increased day by day , and there is close cooperation in the midst of international struggle .  
At present , China input in agricultural scientific research , only more than 5 billion yuan , is very low , and the per-capita operating expenses for agricultural scientific research units at the county level or above are only 10,000 yuan .  If the scientific research input is increased by 5 percent annually , it will take 45 years for China to catch up with the level of developed countries in the 1980s .  
As China 's accession to the WTO is approaching , the government has changed their views on civilian-run economic sectors , and civilian capital has also increased .  As a result , the authorities responsible for the media formally clarified their stand a month ago on foreign capital 's participation in media operations .  
Chen Yusu said : In May 2000 and January 2001 , General Secretary Kim Jong-il twice visited China at the important historical moments at the turn of the century , and held cordial meetings and important talks with General Secretary Jiang Zemin . This further increased the mutual understanding , trust , friendship , and cooperation between the two parties and the two countries , won warm support from the Chinese and Korean peoples , and also produced a positive impact on the international situation .  
The article expresses the belief that China will join the WTO before the end of the year , the openness of the domestic market will be increased , and the traditional means used to control import growth will be reduced , so there may be a rather significant growth in imports , while net exports will decline further , perhaps to the point where the trade surplus becomes a trade deficit , which would have a fairly serious adverse effect on macroeconomic stability .  
The mainland resident journalists have reported in objective fashion on Taiwan 's political , economic , and social situation and its natural conditions and social customs .  Their reports have been welcomed by compatriots on both sides of the strait , increased mainland people 's understanding of the state of affairs in Taiwan , and played a positive role in strengthening cross-strait understanding and contact .  
With the development of reforms , opening-up and the modernization drive , the working class , including intellectuals , in China has expanded steadily , the quality of the working class has improved markedly in terms of the ideological and moral standard and the scientific and cultural level , a large group of conscientious , advanced elements within the working class has been accepted by the Party , and the class foundation of our Party has increased markedly .  
In the more than 50 years since the founding of the PRC , especially in the more than 20 years since the beginning of reform and opening up , the Chinese people , under the leadership of the CPC , have continued their advance along the road of development they chose themselves ; China 's economic strength , national defense capacities , and scientific and technological strength have greatly increased ; and the people 's standards of living have noticeably improved .  
Rumsfeld has indicated on numerous occasions that , although Europe 's importance to the US remains unchanged , with the break up of the Soviet Union the military threat that the US faces in Europe has been greatly reduced , and the eastward expansion of NATO has also clearly increased NATO 's strategic depth , resulting in a great improvement in the security environment of the European allies , and at present the likelihood of war breaking out on the European continent is far less than in Asia .  
In light of the reality that this brigade had greatly increased amounts of weapons and equipment , the brigade made a systematic effort to develop a large number of high-quality people suited to the equipment on hand .  The brigade used several channels , such as foundational training , on the job training , and bringing in talented people , so that the entire brigade had people skilled in both equipment and technical support .  
In the " Ninth Five-Year Plan , " overall input into comprehensive agricultural development totaled 82.7-billion yuan of all types of funds ; the aggregate planned reformed mid-level production land was 173-million mu , the area of newly added and improved irrigation was 132-million mu , the area of newly added and improved reclaimed land was 60.33-million mu , and the area of increased field forest protection was 89.64-million mu , thus forcefully promoting the gradual heightening of China 's comprehensive agricultural production capabilities .  
Wen Jiabao pointed out that during the " Ninth Five-Year Plan , " through comprehensive agricultural development , we improved agricultural production conditions , protected and improved the ecological environment , raised comprehensive agricultural production capabilities and efficiency , and increased agricultural citizen income .  We thus made important contributions to the historical transformation from the long-term deficiency in chief agricultural products to an overall balance and years of surplus .  In our practice we also created many effective experiences .  
China 's overall national strength has been greatly increased , and the people 's material and cultural life enhanced .  China has also greatly raised its international status .  To uphold the Party 's absolute leadership over the army in accordance with the requirements of the " three represents , " we must even more unswervingly uphold the authority of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core .  
Following the continuous implementation of the proactive fiscal policy in depth , China had witnessed a major turnaround in economic development in 2000 .  The annual GDP grew 8 percent in 2000 .  The state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises had notably improved their economic performances .  China had basically achieved its goal to lift difficult enterprises out of their economic trouble .  Its exports increased by 28 percent and fiscal revenues reached 1.338-trillion yuan , a growth of 193.6-billion yuan over that in 1999 .  Its financial operation remained stable .  
The Military Region Air Force not only further increased the frequency of no-notice attacks , it also made them more difficult and intense .  When it selected air routes , it broke free of the previous method of using high altitudes and the same routes .  It made a point to select low altitudes , extra low altitudes , and new air routes , to minimize radar warning time as much as possible .  
These successes , however , were mainly achieved because the central authorities increased market demand by adopting effective macroeconomic regulation and control policies , and at the same time compressed and knocked out surplus and backward productive capacity , thus creating a favorable market environment for enterprise development .  
In accordance with the requirements of actual combat , the division has vigorously developed and strengthened its training .  It conducted successfully for the first time a tactical bombing training program in the small hours of the morning .  It has increased the proportion and intensity of training in highly difficult programs such as landing in adverse weather and through the use of marking lights .  
The state has clearly laid down : " Defining property rights follows the principle of ' the investor profits , ' " and " that portion of after-tax profits of enterprises owned by the whole people that are formed through the use of state capital and from funds inserted in the course of operations which is , with state permission , retained by the enterprises as increased investment , together with the surplus public funds and undistributed profits drawn from after-tax profits are defined as state assets . "  
Persistently acting according to the concept of " cracking down on drug rings , arresting drugpushers , and destroying narcotic drug factories , " the National Narcotics Control Commission has had the sources of its clues increased , strengthened its investigation , and stepped up its efforts to deal blows at those engaging in criminal activities to make and sell the " ice " drug , " ecstasy , " amphetamines , and other narcotic drugs .  
As an important measure for structural readjustment , the Chinese government has canceled the protective prices of poor-quality-seed grain , such as southern early rice and northern spring wheat , encouraged the production of marketable , good-quality-seed produce , and increased the purchase-price difference according to quality .  
In his briefing to a news conference , which held by the Information Office of the State Council today , Liu Hong said : In 1999 , China 's gross domestic product topped the mark of 8,000 billion yuan , or an increased of 7.1 percent over the previous year calculated on comparable items , thus achieving the expected growth target . 
The domestic economic situation also is not bad and has turned for the better since the second half of last year .  Inventories have dropped , enterprises ' economic results have improved , growth of the new - and high-technology and information industry has accelerated , the drop in prices has slowed down , and social consumption has increased steadily .  
Judging from these situations , the overall environment of this year 's economic work is good .  The negative factors are that currently demand for essential goods is insufficient and the employment pressure has increased and probably will be quite reduced as the international economic situation has further turned for the better and as the effect and results of the state 's macroeconomic regulation and control measures gradually come into play .  
First , we have been engaged in reform and opening up for more than 20 years , so that the country has considerably increased its economic strength , and the eastern region , in particular , has laid a relatively solid foundation for economic development and is capable of making further advance by mainly depending on its own efforts , thus enabling the country to shift the focus of development to the western region .  
It is of major practical significance and far-reaching historical significance .  Through two decades of reforms and opening up , China 's comprehensive national strength has notably increased and a socialist market economic system has been preliminarily established .  Thus , conditions are ripe for accelerating the development of China 's western regions .  
Ministry budgetary planning implies that China 's budgetary planning is gradually going on to the scientific , systemized , and standardized track , and the openness , fair , just , and other special qualities that the budgetary planning should posses , as well as the transparency in central budget , will also be improved and increased further .  
Since reform and opening up two decades ago , Fujian-Taiwan trade and economic exchanges and cooperation have developed steadily , their quality and level have been constantly increased , and people-to-people and social and cultural exchanges have become increasingly frequent , initially bringing about a situation of economic complementarity and mutual benefit , mutual promotion , and common development .  
In recent years , the state has increased the implementation intensity of the project for the protection of natural vegetation ; at the same time , it has adopted such policies and measures as " returning grain plot to forestry , closing hillside to facilitate afforestation , relieving people in disaster areas by giving them grain instead of outright grant , and introducing a contractual operation on individual household basis .

The long term financial sustainability of the current system is highly questionable , having regard to the aging population , the increased costs associated with adoption of new technology and the rising public expectation for quality services . 
However , we are of the view that the CFA 's interpretation of Articles 22 and 24 of the Basic Law differs from the SAR Government 's understanding of the legislative intent of the provisions .  The CFA judgment has increased tremendously the number of people who are qualified for ROA in Hong Kong , which would impose a severe social and economic burden on Hong Kong . ExCo has decided that the Chief Executive should report to the Central Authorities and request for an interpretation of the relevant articles of the Basic Law .  
She said Government expenditure would be increased by 3% in real terms in 2000-01 ( or $ 5.4 billion in additional spending ) This amount , together with the EPP savings of $ 1 billion , means an extra $ 6.4 billion for the delivery of all pledges on new or improved services made in the prevailing and two previous Policy Addresses . 
The centre has an enlarged capacity of 120 telephone and fax lines , which is more than double of the old system .

For the nominal wage indices , year-on-year increases , ranging from 0.9% to 1.9% , were found in nearly all the major sectors surveyed .  Yet for the transport services sector , a year-on-year decrease of 3.1% was recorded .  This was in part due to increased employment of workers at junior levels ( thus at relatively lower pay ) by some major land passenger transport operators during the past year , which had the effect of dragging down the average wage level .  
As regards capital goods , the volume of re-exports increased markedly by 20.5% in July 2000 over a year earlier .  Notable increases were recorded in the re-export volume of scientific , medical , optical , measuring , and controlling instruments and apparatus ; and electrical machinery .  
As an increased deterrent and to punish market misconduct , the Bill will retain , modernize and expand the existing criminal regime to deal with market misconduct where there is sufficient evidence that a criminal offence has been committed by an identifiable person , that there is a reasonable prospect of a conviction , and that it is in the public interest to bring a prosecution .

Yet for the community , social and personal services sector , a year-on-year decrease of 1.1% was recorded .  
And as Hong Kong is seeing increased heart attacks , I will consider advising the Force to follow its United States counterparts by procuring automated external defibrillators so instant treatment can be applied , " he said .  " At the scene of major disasters , it is vital to have sound co-ordination of first-aid initiatives and I think officers , apart from discharging their own duties , also have a role to play . "  
What is particularly encouraging is that between 1999 and 2000 , the number of regional headquarters and offices established by multinational corporations in Hong Kong increased from 2,500 to 3,000 ; Hong Kong is the second largest recipient of foreign direct investment in Asia after Mainland China , amounting to US $ 23.1 billion last year .

Some 3 000 overseas companies have established their regional headquarters or offices in Hong Kong . Two years ago we attracted the second highest amount of external direct investment in Asia , just behind the Mainland and far exceeding other places in Asia . That figure increased more than 1.5 times last year .  China 's accession to the World Trade Organisation is expected to add impetus to this momentum .  
Instead of the US $ 16 billion asset size criterion , it is proposed that foreign banks should be subject to the same size criteria with respect to total assets and customer deposits as locally incorporated banks ( proposed to be increased to HK $ 5 billion and HK $ 4 billion respectively ) , thereby applying a consistent treatment to all applicants for a banking licence - irrespective of their place of incorporation . 
It has also developed the Emergency Response Plans ; completed the first phase of the new electronic Environmental Information System ; increased the collection of recyclable materials from its estates by 19% ; and saved at least 33,000 tonnes of timber by using alternative construction practices and $ 36 million from improving energy efficiency in public housing estates . 
Comparing the third quarter of 2001 with the second quarter of 2001 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the visible trade deficit narrowed from $ 23.9 billion to $ 11.4 billion , while the invisible trade surplus increased from $ 32.8 billion to $ 34.8 billion .  
On the recommendation of the Standing Commission on Civil Service Salaries and Conditions of Service in 1990 , we have increased the starting pay of the medical officer rank by one point and the maximum pay by two points in recognition of the special characteristics of the medical services , the requirement to work irregular and unsocial hours and the problem of retaining experienced staff in the public service .

( b ) In deciding whether the penalty for contravention should be increased to deter the publication of obscene and indecent articles , we will strive to strike a proper balance between protecting public morals and our young people on the one hand and preserving the free flow of information and safeguarding the freedom of expression on the other hand .  
Earlier this year , in view of the increased public awareness and use of the waste separation bins , we considered it opportune to examine whether recycling of plastic bags would be practical and economically viable .  
In negotiating with the Guangdong Authority for an agreement on future water supply , the Hong Kong Government will carefully review the annual supply quantities according to the latest estimate of our freshwater demand .

The foundation of democracy was consolidated through local self-government . Agricultural and industrial production increased and economic construction was expanded . Nine years of free schooling improved the educational level . The rich traditions of Chinese culture were rediscovered and rejuvenated .  
Because of our economic construction in recent years , the average family income has increased sharply . The general living standard has risen and the gap between the rich and the poor has narrowed .  
Last year exported Taiwan canned pineapple totaled 1,300,000 cartons , valued at about US $ 13,600,000 . The Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction in the Republic of China is sponsoring species improvement . This includes such research work as seed selection , introduction of new varieties , cross breeding , tissue culture and quality analysis to prevent pests and diseases . It also seeks increased productivity and improved quality . Taiwan pineapple s in different export items are expected to play an increasingly important role in international markets .  
Medical knowledge is easy to obtain and medical techniques are advanced . Pregnant women are given complete prenatal care , and their babies ' safe births are almost assured . Cases of dystocia and stillbirth are now rare . The average length and weight of the newborn infants have increased .  
At the meeting , foreign guests discovered that the quality of Taiwan 's medicine had improved rapidly over the past 30 years . The death rate has declined and the average life expectancy has increased . This period has seen the eradication of most acute infectious diseases . Medical techniques and knowledge have advanced to such a degree that Taiwan may be considered equal to developed countries .  
Li uses special machinery to replace human labor , creating slabs of so fine a texture that the grain of the slick wooden mold used for shaping is clearly visible on the surface of the product . As production increased , Li opened a number of " cultural service centers " in smaller towns to offer his products at close-to-cost prices . He also opened a gallery where calligraphers and painters may exhibit their works free of charge .  
The ideal Chinese woman of ancient times played the backstage role of dutiful wife and loving mother . With time and social progress women began taking on low-level jobs outside the home . Eventually , as society demanded more capable workers , and women 's educational opportunities increased , so did their appearance in management and top-level jobs .  
" Taiwan 's economic progress over the past thirty or more years has raised living and educational standards and increased the desire of the populace to participate in politics . This , together with other changing objective conditions , has made ' lifting martial law ' and ' opening up the formation of new political parties ' a natural decision , " says government spokesman Chang King-yuh .  
In the social sciences , economics and public finance are the most promising departments , while the continued rise of the population 's median age will mean an increased demand for social workers to provide services for the elderly . However , limitations on the number of candidates who can pass the bar examinations make law a rather " cold " field .  
It does n't mean that this area is ideal for the ducks - - only that suitable places are getting fewer and fewer , " Fang Wei-hung says . Kuantu used to be another major resting place for the ducks , too , but the tidewater belt there has been gradually grown over by mangroves , and the ducks have been disturbed by increased fishing boat traffic . And the number of seasonal birds that appear at Lanyang Creek near Ilan has declined over the years because of overzealous hunters and fishermen .  
Through this method the level of industrial technology increased and a large sum of capital accumulated which was necessary for research . At the same time it also served to nurture technological talent laying down the foundation for the rapid economic growth of the sixties .  
Similarly , we forecast only 7.5% growth at the end of 1987 ; our growth rate should have increased with the global recovery , but the NT dollar appreciated faster than expected , leading to negative growth in exports to the U . S . , so the real growth rate of 7.33% was worse than anticipated .  
This has received attention because : ( a ) The proportion of the elderly in the population has increased ; they hope to continue to study and fill out their lives . ( b ) People demand satisfaction in their spiritual lives as the standard of living rises . ( c ) Constant technological change requires opportunities for continuing education .  
Refining entails a great deal of pollution , but the supply of petrochemical materials is vital for developing the economy and improving the life of the citizenry , so production and growth were constantly increased . Today the site encompasses more than sixty refineries producing a wide range of fuels along with two upstream naphtha plants and some mid - and downstream facilities . Most eye-catching are the hundred-some smokestacks that spout flames day and night , as the facilities are operated round-the-clock to advance the economic growth of Taiwan .  
While government breeding efforts have tended to concentrate on basic cereals such as rice and wheat , economic growth and rising living standards have brought increased consumer demand for high-profit horticultural products like flowers and fruit . Farmers now devote more growing area to these , new varieties are being introduced , and private-sector involvement in variety development is on the rise .  
The department found in 1990 that the rate of women aged 15 to 49 who lived with their parents or their husband 's parents within five years of being married increased 4.5 percent over 1988 . And the younger the woman and the lower her level of education ( meaning women with more financial difficulties ) , the more likely she was to live with one set of parents .  
If earthworms could be raised in polluted soil , and then after a time moved out , even if the total amount of heavy metals in the environment was not changed , the land could be improved in this way , and the speed at which heavy metals are " passed on ' ' could be increased , thus lowering the recuperation time for the land .  
Yet on this occasion Yang was able to put out five such vehicles . The key is that he improved the existing circuits and the design of the battery capacity meter , thus raising the effectiveness of the cars . These changes included raising the efficiency of electricity use from 27.5% to 45% ; lowering the recharging time to two hours ; and making it possible to precisely measure the battery capacity . These innovations have greatly increased the practicality of the electric vehicle .  
The objective international situation has changed and the Western economies have long been stuck in a period of economic malaise . The Asia-Pacific area , however - - especially the Southeast Asian region , including Indochina , Taiwan , Hong Kong and coastal mainland China - - has produced a rich economic stimulus . People have money and their purchasing power has increased dramatically . "  
Such painting for the scientific record was concerned primarily with seeking factual truth . When tools were developed to aid in the appreciation of nature and ecological research took off , conservationism swept the world and the number of bird watchers increased daily . Scientific illustrations were produced in great quantities and the demands of the art market gave rise to the ecological art of today .  
Professor Yang Ling-ling of the Taipei Medical College points out that Chinese are in the habit of taking composite medications rather carelessly In particular there are many so-called " informal recipes " for Chinese traditional remedies that include diuretic ingredients which are potentially toxic . Diuretics can create a false impression of increased urine flow , which can make uremia sufferers careless , when in fact they may be extending the illness and even worsening the damage to the kidneys . "  
Moreover , with social liberalizations , sexual relationships have become more complex . With increased work pressure and the ill effects of environmental pollution , the reproductive systems of both men and women have sustained direct damage .  
The changing face of Hakka womenIn recent years there has been a massive outflow of population from Hakka villages . Most young people have left to pursue their studies or careers . Even for those left behind , traditional Hakka values are fading in young people because of increased education , the impact of the mass media , and multifarious interactions with other ethnic groups .  
Because the liberalization of the electronic media has followed on the tails of the graphic media , many people compare it to the profligate development of political magazines during the 1980s . During the era when there was a ban on publishing , dissidents operated " non-partisan magazines " to strive for freedom of speech . After censorship was lifted , the scope of subjects in magazines vastly expanded , and public opinion forums and discussion exchange sections increased . The previous form of magazine exited the battlefield .  
Thus far nearly NT $ 100 million has been invested in efforts by more than a dozen agencies to breed the species , which exists in the wild only in the upstream portion of the Tachia River . Sadly , not only have its numbers not increased , none of the seven people who have earned PhDs or MAs through the breeding program hold out very optimistic hopes for the fate of the brook masu salmon .  
Today 's society is even more complex , and the powers ascribed to the tiger have also become more diverse . As people 's understanding of nature has increased , the tiger has lost its mystique , and with so few tigers left there is no longer any likelihood of people finding themselves in a face-to-face struggle with a tiger . Thus people are free to develop their own human perspective and let the tiger symbolize whatever they want it to .  
Community chief Tseng Chen-chuan describes how in the past , when village elders were happily drunk , they would sing a traditional ballad recounting tribal history , the gist of which was : " Our ancestors were born from the rocks , and came here from their place of origin on the other side of Tapachien Mountain . Ssumakussu was the first place they made home on the north side of the mountain , and when the population of the tribe increased they branched out to Hsiuluan , Tienpu , Hsinkuang and elsewhere . "  
From family businesses to chain storesHowever , with changing social structures in Taiwan , the number of people eating out has increased , and this has led businessmen to change their way of operating . They want to banish the stereotyped image which family-run beef noodle houses have acquired as dark , dirty places , and copy the bright and hygienic style of the fast food chains with their standardized products and decor ; and they have even taken beef noodle soup into international grade hotels .  
Over a thirty year period Taipower steadily developed new power plants until by 1986 , it had accumulated a margin reserve of 50% ( well above the normal level of 20% ) . Taipower was constantly running deficits , and at that point was criticized by the MOEA for wasteful investment . The margin reserve then began to decline as demand increased , until it reached only 4.7% during peak-demand hours last summer .  
" Starting from late 1994 , as the global economy recovered , demand increased greatly , and this brought sharp rises in the international prices of some agricultural and industrial raw materials , including petrochemical feedstocks , textile fibers , paper pulp , grains , basic metals and so on . Price rises in Taiwan are part of a global chain reaction , " says Liu Fang-jung , a specialist researching prices at the Council for Economic Planning and Development .  
But there are plenty of negative examples which can serve as a warning : in the late 1970s under the Carter administration , the United States ' budget deficit increased massively and inflation went into double figures for several years running . Unemployment rose sharply and economic growth stagnated , creating the dreadful problem of " stagflation . "  
Given the current intense anti-drug efforts and heavy sentences , it is difficult to move drugs within Taiwan , and the price of heroin has increased as supply has been unable to keep up with demand . Depending upon how much major suppliers have in stock , one kilo can be sold for NT $ 15 million .  
The judicial training center has lately increased the training it provides to prepare the judges in these areas , for example , taking the students abroad and having them tour legal gambling establishments ( all gambling is illegal in Taiwan ) and sex operations . In order to competently handle the traffic accidents which are more and more prevalent , the students must all learn to drive ; in order to combat the new styles of economic crimes , the aspiring judges must also make visits to securities exchanges .  
Following the economic development of Taiwan 's diplomatic partners , the number of cooperative programs the new Agricultural Technology Missions are involved in has steadily increased . In addition to growing grain and vegetables , the scope of the missions has also come to include animal husbandry work-raising pigs and chickens ; marine technology-fishing techniques and the breeding and raising of marine animals ; handicraft work-bamboo weaving , wood carving ; and such areas of work as flood prevention and water conservation projects among others .  
In past cases where private property has been set aside for public use , the owner generally has n't received reasonable compensation and has also lost the chance to benefit from increased land prices . No wonder that people in Taiwan say : " Being the owner of a historic building is just too painful . "  
Because the results of research over the previous decade gradually received international affirmation , in 1989 the World Bank approved the center 's five-year plan and provided substantial funding . The number of research projects increased substantially and regional cooperation projects were successively begun .  
The center has increased its range of research substantially since its establishment , and the external environment has also become more complex . However , its objectives remain as unchanged as the simple exterior of its building-improving the lives of people in difficult environments and offering them a better future .  
If employees feel this is not enough , they will be free to negotiate increased amounts with their employers , " says Anita Liu . For example , if the boss and workers each pay an additional 2% , then the workers will be doing a bit of " enforced saving " for their pensions . The most important reform envisaged under the new system is the change from a collective retirement fund account opened by the firm , to an individual account for each worker .  
Although investigation of the relationship between climate and infectious diseases is still at a preliminary stage , excessive human development of jungles and rainforests has increased people 's chances of coming into contact with the microorganisms which live there , and with their natural hosts .  
The park was originally approved to release a maximum of 28,200 kiloliters of treated effluent per day . But in October and November of last year , the electronics industry was booming and the volume of effluent increased rapidly . Treated waste water from the park hit a record high of over 72,000 kiloliters . And recently average daily discharge has been running at around 53,000 kiloliters .  
Vincent Siew particularly emphasizes that educational reform is a firm policy of the Executive Yuan . It has already approved the " Educational Reform Stimulus Package " drafted by the Ministry of Education . Starting from 1999 , more than NT $ 150 billion will be spent over a five-year period to advance 12 educational reform projects , including " promoting education for the entire citizenry " and " encouraging diversification and increased quality in vocational education . "  
Two-spotted lymantriid moth caterpillars ' bodies are covered with fine , spiny hairs , and although the insecticide quickly killed the grubs , their death throes released the hairs from their bodies . The number of poisonous spines drifting in the air increased dramatically , and with the help of Hsinchu 's strong winds they got into the children 's respiratory tracts ; the children also came out in an unbearably itchy red rash . Over half the school 's staff and pupils had to seek medical attention .  
Commenting on the results of this most recent meeting of APEC , Sung Chen-chao , a professor in the graduate institute of political economy at National Cheng Kung University , states that APEC has difficulty reaching decisions because it acts by consensus rather than by majority vote . The increase in the number of participating nations means that differences in economic level have also increased . Some of the organization 's less developed members are facing pressures which make it difficult for them to embrace the liberalization of economics and trade .  
After Taiwan 's economic development shifted to industry and commerce and cities were constructed rapidly , problems of water resource management became more complex , demand for water increased , underground water sources were excessively tapped , hillside development was allowed where soil conservation should have been exercised , and industrial pollution increased steadily . The government 's attention to the subject of water resources never kept pace with the rate at which these problems developed .  
In addition , the domestic cable television market has increased its openness to foreign investment , and foreigners can directly or indirectly own up to 50% of the stock . The central government has also authorized local governments to manage local cable television operations , stipulating that operators grade their programs and sign formal contracts with subscribers to ensure the rights of consumers .  
Due to the increased tension across the Taiwan Strait and incessant rumors of elevating levels of military alert , within five days Taiwan 's stock market shed more than a thousand points . On July 16 alone it plummeted 506 points , with total market value shrinking by more than NT $ 1.5 trillion . To prop up the market , the Ministry of Finance forced four major government-related funds-the postal savings fund , labor pension fund , labor insurance fund and civil service pension fund-to buy stock .  
The standard work week when President Chen took office was 48 hours . After the new government proposed to shorten this to 44 hours , the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan one-upped the administration by passing legislation that further reduced standard working time to 84 hours over two weeks . This measure saddled businesses with an extra burden , and manufacturing operations began migrating offshore at an accelerated rate , thus contributing to increased unemployment .  
For instance , 40 years ago , after Chinese-American scientists Yang Chen-ning and Lee Tsung-dao received a Nobel physics prize , there was a boom in the popularity of physics courses . For the last five or six years law departments have consistently topped the rankings in Category 1 , but although the demand for legally qualified personnel has grown thanks to Taiwan 's progress towards the rule of law , the number of universities with law departments has increased too , making competition between law graduates more intense than before .  
In the 1980s , she spent five years trekking around the coral rocks of Kenting , observing a local troupe of macaques . During that time their numbers gradually increased , but then suddenly almost the entire troupe was killed by hunters , and the population growth accumulated over many years was wiped out overnight . By the time Wu had finished writing up her thesis , the few survivors had disappeared among the windswept coral .  
COA chairman Chen Hsi-huang , who earned his degree in agricultural economics at National Taiwan University ( NTU ) notes that Taiwan 's agricultural policies used to stress increased production-producing as much as possible on the limited land available . Consequently , Taiwan-produced canned champignon mushrooms and asparagus commanded 65% of the international market . Coupled with the export of massive amounts of sugar , rice , and bananas , this stimulated the formation of capitalistic agriculture which , in turn , helped prepare the way for the subsequent take off of industry .  
In the same way , the demand for seafood increased when Taiwan 's economy took off . Taking advantage of this favorable situation , aquaculture began sprouting up on the west coast . At one point , coastal counties were waterlogged with fully 58,000 hectares of fish farms , causing massive erosion problems . With the widespread smuggling of seafood from the PRC in recent years , aquacultural land in Taiwan has dropped to 40,000 hectares as fisheries have shifted operations to mainland China .  
A study of weather data from the last 100 years that the National Science Council commissioned from a number of local universities revealed that Taiwan 's average temperature has increased by 1-1.4 �X C over the last century . While this increase was greater than the 0.6 �X C increase in average global temperature , it was in line with the increase in the average surface temperature on land . However , Taiwan 's summer temperatures have risen more than its winter temperatures , indicating a trend towards the hot getting hotter .  
If the Ma amendments had gone through , although funding to localities would have increased , the deep cuts to the central government 's coffers would have meant that numerous previously approved ( or even partially built ) local projects such as sewers and rapid transit would not have been able to go forward . The impact would have been enormous .  
Eight million years ago , the east coast of Taiwan was at the very edge of where the Philippine Sea Plate was crashing into the Asian mainland . As compression along the edge of the Eurasian Plate increased , fracturing of the crust in the Taiwan Strait came to an end . Channels for magma to reach the surface were sealed , and volcanic activity was locked out . All that remains is the basalt that the sea has been continuing to erode for tens of millions of years .  
The mid-1990s saw a crisis in the local paint industry as production costs increased in Taiwan . Most traditional paint factories closed or moved overseas , while those that remained were forced to make layoffs or cut back salaries .  
The risk of not having a place in the global disease warning network is reflected in Resolution 107 passed by the WHO Executive Board in 2001 , which reads in part : " The need for international cooperation on epidemic alert and response is greater today than ever before due to increased population movements , growth in international trade and biological products , changes in methods of food processing , and social and environmental changes . "  
One area of particular difficulty has been the decision to promote the simultaneous learning of local and international languages , intended both to strengthen local consciousness and as a response to global trends . This approach has dramatically increased the pressure on children , leaving many unsure about the relative importance of different languages .  
In recent years the daily customer traffic in the larger bookstores of major centers like Beijing and Shanghai has often hit the tens of thousands , and several have already been given " must-see " status in travel guides sold in Taiwan . To deal with the stream of visitors , the stores have expanded , improved their air-conditioning systems , taken on huge numbers of staff , and increased the width of the aisles between bookshelves ; the luxuriousness and sheer size of the stores is nothing short of amazing .  
When word got around about the teachers , Overseas Chinese rushed to sign up , so that the number of enrollments increased sharply to a figure far above that anticipated . Liu Shu-hui , principal of the Frankfurt Chinese School , who was in charge of organizing the event , began to worry that there would be too many students , so it would be impossible to give each the care and attention desired , thereby affecting the quality of the camp , and she began to refuse people .  
Suo points out that in recent years , the proportion of reported TB cases that have been changed from " suspected " to " confirmed negative " has increased from 10% to 20% . Some patients are blindly given medication even though it is unclear whether they in fact have contracted tuberculosis . Other patients , unable to obtain specialized medical care , spread M . tuberculosis while wandering from one regular health care institution to another .  
Whereas their predecessors ' values were shaped most by great economic opportunity and the experience of collective action for political and social change , many different elements have affected the values of these generations . Besides larger structural factors , educational reform has also been important . The reforms introduced by the government in the late 1990s increased the number of universities and graduate programs significantly , so that many more young people have access to higher education than did their predecessors .  
Before the 1960s , one third of Taiwan families were classified as " patriarchal families . " These were " extended families " consisting of both direct and co-lateral family members living together . After the 1980s the proportion of " blended families " ( a " stem " family composed of three directly related generations ) increased . Today it is the " nuclear family " of husband , wife and children that has become the norm .  
Another and most troubling phenomenon for researchers is that as a self-supporting economic unit caring for the elderly and looking after children , the number of economically disadvantaged families has increased in recent years , and the gap between rich and poor households has widened .  
Leaving aside families " in name only , " whether it 's the " single-parent family , " the " second family " ( after remarriage , bringing children from a previous marriage ) , the " geographically divided family , " or the " pseudo-single-parent family " ( one spouse absent for extended periods ) , they all have increased with surprising speed . Showing a slight increase in number are families where , because of the absence of both parents , Grandma and Grandpop are raising the children in their place " across generations . "  
However , kitchen waste is the main source of the foul odors and disease vector proliferation in garbage . When kitchen wastes are mixed with other garbage for processing , landfills are inundated with noxious gases , polluting the air . If taken instead to incinerators , due to their high water content , much energy will be wasted in the burning process , and the lifespan of the incinerator will also be reduced . At the same time , concentrations of the toxin dioxin will be increased .  
After eight years of hard work laying the foundation for the company , artkey executive vice-president Ivan Fan surveys the current scene and gives her analysis . After mainland China joined the World Trade Organization , intellectual property on both sides of the strait benefited from increased international protection . At the same time , another " East Asia fever " is set to grip the world as we come up to the 2008 Olympics in Beijing .  
The mountain Karen still make a living through such traditional methods as swidden farming , fishing , hunting and gathering , working hard to eke out an existence each and every day . However , as their numbers have increased , the limited availability of agricultural land and the impact of modernization and natural disasters have meant that they now lack adequate resources to meet their daily subsistence needs , and have been reduced to penury and perpetual shortage .  
After prices had risen , the number of fish farmers raising tilapia increased . And with a continual stream of orders from abroad , the tilapia industry entered a boom period . Fish fillets were sterilized with ozone and then frozen with liquid nitrogen to preserve freshness and texture , then shipped overseas . " That was the golden age for tilapia , " reminisces Yang Shu-fen , a Chiayi resident whose family has run fish processing plants for two generations .  
In 2000 , the Yushan Weather Station expansion project was finally completed , with the original 100-square-meter wooden hut expanded into a 160-square-meter steel frame structure with a sheet-metal roof . At the same time , new equipment , such as a live video feed system , was added . The number of photovoltaic panels and power storage batteries was also increased , as a result of which the power supply was improved .  
In 1988 , Hungary relaxed its immigration laws and concluded a bilateral visa exemption treaty with the PRC . In one fell swoop , thousands of Chinese people poured into Hungary . In a few years , their numbers increased more than tenfold , and when the Hungarian authorities realized that the situation was getting out of hand , they quickly imposed restrictions .  
The quality of building materials , the increased use of metal , cement , and plastic , and the uninspired colors , all make for a disorderly urban environment . No attempt is made to achieve a harmonious unity . Even on the drawing board , every building competes with every other building for attention .  
Chen Chung believes that the small cultivated plots of traditional farming make it difficult to use efficient , labor-saving technologies and thus hinder competitiveness in international markets . The usual remedy for this has been even further exploitation of the land , and as Chen Chung points out with a pained expression , " the result was heavy use of pesticides and fertilizers , increased soil depletion , and environmental pollution . "  
After base areas are set up at Meifeng , vegetable crops suitable for cool , high elevations can be planted by machine instead of by hand ; fruit trees too are planted in rain-sheltered systems and managed for increased yields . The wooded areas that separate cultivated fields from the original land provide staged filtration of contaminants from rainwater runoff . Meifeng 's soil management methods have proven effective enough to preserve its resources over an eight-year period that has seen numerous typhoons and the 921 earthquake .  
The chief executive of the LBMA said that the main cause of the increase in silver business was a high level of physical demand and increased activity in the forward market

The Commission noted that growing awareness of the UNCITRAL legal texts in many countries , in particular developing countries and newly independent States , had resulted in increased requests for training and technical assistance from individual Governments or regional organizations .  
The worsening of socio-economic conditions in many LDCs in the 1990s has increasingly been translated into a marked deterioration in human welfare as reflected in reduced caloric intakes , increased mortality and morbidity , the re-emergence and spread of diseases , lower school enrolment , further marginalization of the weakest members of society , and other signals of acute social distress , as further reviewed below in chapter V .  
Donors need to expeditiously implement the agreed menu of aid targets and / or commitments as set out in paragraph 23 of the Programme of Action and fulfil their commitments to provide a significant and substantial increase in the aggregate level of external support to LDCs , keeping in mind the increased needs of these countries , as well as the requirements of the new countries included in the list of LDCs following the Paris Conference .  
Forum countries had increased their active participation in recent international and regional forums , in which they had emphasized the importance of maintaining sound environmental management practices and sustainable development .  
Very often the economic model on which structural adjustment programmes are based has made it impossible to overcome the particularly serious social problems of the countries concerned , especially poverty , and in some cases has increased the concentration of wealth , exclusion and marginalization .  
That volume , which was fixed by the international community in the 1970s at 0.7 per cent of the GNP of the developed countries , has so far been attained by only four countries .  It should nevertheless be noted that appeals for official development assistance have become more and more pressing and numerous as needs - especially those of the least developed countries , which have steadily increased in number - have grown .  
In the interests of increased savings and the successful implementation of the operational activities of the United Nations system , and given the fact that the outcome thus far had fallen short of expectations , his delegation attached great importance to the ongoing efforts of resident coordinators to ensure closer involvement of the Bretton Woods institutions in operational activities , in particular at the field level . 
Reaffirms that the effective implementation of the Programme of Action will require an increased commitment of financial resources , both domestically and externally , and calls upon the developed countries to complement the national financial efforts of developing countries on population and development and intensify their efforts to transfer new and additional resources to the developing countries , in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Programme of Action , in order to ensure that population and development objectives and goals are met ;  
Reaffirms that the effective implementation of the Programme of Action will require an increased commitment of financial resources , both domestically and externally , and , in this context , calls upon the developed countries to complement the national financial efforts of developing countries on population and development and to intensify their efforts to transfer new and additional resources to the developing countries , in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Programme of Action , in order to ensure that population and development objectives and goals are met ;  
the geographic coverage of operational activities had been extended to the CIS countries and their scope now also included administrative reform , the defence of human rights and elections , and financial resources therefore should have been increased accordingly .

the geographic coverage of operational activities had been extended to the CIS countries and their scope now also included administrative reform , the defence of human rights and elections , and financial resources therefore should have been increased accordingly .  
At a meeting of ACC held the previous month in New York , all the Executive Heads of the organizations of the United Nations system had expressed deep awareness of the need for improved performance management and increased productivity at a time of increasing demands and scarce financial resources .  
Emphasizes the serious debt problems of the least developed countries , which necessitate strengthened efforts to formulate an international debt strategy that should include concrete measures to alleviate the debt burden and increased concessional financing in support of appropriate economic policy measures , which will be critical to the revitalization of the growth and development of the least developed countries , and encourages the Bretton Woods institutions to expedite the ongoing consideration of ways to address the issue of multilateral debt , including those concerning the least developed countries ;  
demographic trends would be compounded by the economic crisis facing the developing countries : even if global wealth increased , the gap between rich and poor , between and within countries , was likely to widen further and foster social unrest , drug abuse and crime .  
would therefore be advisable to allocate increased resources to basic educational and vocational training , which were essential elements in promoting the economic development of the least developed countries .  
Social trust can be increased , however difficult it may be to achieve consensus among those who have been combatants , through a predictable legal system , based on the rule of law , in which everyone can engage in social and economic activities knowing that a fair , impartial and predictable system of adjudication awaits any disputes .  
Clarification was sought and received regarding how the staff resources and grade structure of the translation services would be adjusted through the budget process to reflect the continuing increase in documentation ; the impact of increased reliance on contractual translation ; and the intent to expand the use of the optical disk system .  
In the past four years the economy recorded an average growth rate of 8.2 per cent , resulting in increased employment opportunities and significantly rising living standards in the country , primarily in urban areas , where private enterprises are flourishing , and in fertile rural areas , where farmers have better incentive to grow and market their produce .  
The increased number and growing sophistication of lethal nuclear , chemical and bacteriological weapons of mass destruction and the further development of their intercontinental delivery systems heightens the threat of annihilation for many countries and peoples , especially when some of the countries which possess them lack even minimal credibility .  
Negative economic growth rates , persistent imbalances in the commercial and financial fields , increased transitional or structural unemployment , and an absence of coordination in exchange rates and trade policies these are some of the problems connected with the system of the developed world which have an adverse impact on the developing countries .  
We commend the commitments made at national level to the implementation of relevant recommendations through , inter alia , the effective mobilization and efficient utilization of domestic resources and through increased allocation of resources to the social sector .  
Success in reforms , promotion of the private sector and direct foreign investment , increased activity in the democratic process and the strengthening of civilian society are essential elements of an Agenda for Development , and to a large extent depend on the support of the international community , in terms of resources and political will .  
Finally , in the context of the upcoming World Trade Organization Ministerial Meeting to be held in Singapore , it is essential for the future of Africa and the rest of the developing world that the increased opening of markets under way in our countries be accompanied by a genuine , far-reaching elimination of the trade barriers that still exist , thus ensuring access for the products of developing countries .  
Indeed , the argument that shortfalls in official development assistance have been compensated for by increased foreign direct investment flows to developing countries has not held true in the case of most African countries .  
In order to achieve the major objectives of the New Agenda and the target growth rate of 6 per cent , the international community must accelerate its support to African countries in order to sustain the momentum leading to recovery and sustainable development in areas such as the further alleviation of the burden of external debt , the attraction of foreign private investment , increased official development assistance , trade facilitation and market access , and development assistance for capacity-building .  
It is nevertheless regrettable that historical factors and the constraints imposed by the external economic environment , including a reduction in official development assistance , the heavy debt burden , deteriorating terms of trade , and increased barriers impeding access to developed country markets have prevented any fundamental improvement in the economic situation .  
We have developed , in close cooperation with the countries of the Caribbean region , a strategy based on three main priorities : support for the process of economic transition ; promotion of sustainable development of the Caribbean region with particular emphasis on human resource development , the protection of natural resources and combating socio-economic threats , including the fight against drugs ; and the promotion of increased economic cooperation leading to fuller integration in the world market .  
For example , even though calls for the promotion of the private sector , increased industrial development and foreign direct investment , and the reduction of external debt in African countries are regularly made in various forums , harsh marketplace reality shows that portfolio equity investment remains virtually absent , and that less than 5 per cent of global foreign direct investment is targeted to African countries .  
The Republic of Belarus deeply appreciates the efforts made by all the programmes , funds and specialized agencies of the United Nations system towards providing increased , speedier and better quality assistance to the various countries and regions suffering from armed conflicts , natural disasters , industrial ecological catastrophes and other emergency circumstances .  
Furthermore , and still within the same context of prevention , the countries whose institutions and infrastructures have been devastated by long-standing domestic warfare now need increased assistance from the international community to help them rebuild their economies and improve the living conditions of their peoples , because without ongoing economic and social development , internal tensions will always continue to threaten the stability of these countries .  
Stresses the need for Governments and relevant international institutions or organizations to examine how the rapid globalization of the world economy and the increased liberalization of trade is affecting the ability of States to design and implement effective strategies for eradicating poverty and to provide a stable legal framework that creates an enabling environment to achieve social development and to meet the basic human needs of all , in order to prevent greater inequality between different sectors of society ;  
Additional financial resources obtained through established means - including increased and dependable official development assistance ( ODA ) , better mobilization of domestic resources and greater foreign direct investment - are called for .  
Drought or inadequate supplies of water in southern and northern parts of the continent reduced agricultural output and increased the diversion of foreign exchange earnings for food imports in several countries in 1995 .  
Although adolescent fertility is increasingly perceived as an issue of social and policy concern , fertility rates among women under age 20 have been falling alongside overall fertility rates world wide , owing to rising age at marriage , increasing educational opportunities for young women and increased use of contraception .  
Moreover , long-term consequences of unsafe abortion may include chronic pelvic pain , pelvic inflammatory disease , tubal occlusion , secondary infertility and increased risk of spontaneous abortion in subsequent pregnancies ( WHO , 1994 ) .  
FATTAH ( Egypt ) said that , in view of the major responsibilities entrusted to the United Nations in recent years and the increased attention it was giving to social and economic matters , the Organization had a proportionately greater need to secure the support of world public opinion through the invaluable role currently played by the information media .  
Emphasizes the importance for developing countries of continuing their efforts to promote a favourable environment for attracting foreign investment , thereby promoting economic growth and sustainable development , and stresses the need for the international community to promote a conducive external economic environment through , inter alia , improved market access , stabilization of exchange rates , effective stewardship of international interest rates and increased resource flows , as well as improved access to technology for the developing countries ;  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , the illicit demand for , production of and traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , have expanded globally and , therefore , continue to threaten seriously the socio-economic and political systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments which request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development that have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and that take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ; 
It will provide the basis for national and international action to reduce pollution of the oceans from land-based activities , contributing , inter alia , to : ( i ) improvement of coastal habitats and productivity ; ( ii ) reduction of threats to food security and safety ; ( iii ) reduction of hazards to human health ; and ( iv ) increased control over coastal activities to stop and reverse the process of alteration of the coastal zone .  
Objectives of this endeavour include protecting public health , providing for safety and security conditions , education , and social integration , promoting equality , respect for diversity and cultural identities , increased accessibility for persons with disabilities , and preservation of historic , spiritual , religious and culturally significant buildings and districts , respecting local landscapes and treating the local environment with respect and care .  
We commit ourselves to strengthening existing financial mechanisms and , where appropriate , developing new mechanisms for financing the implementation of the Habitat Agenda , which will mobilize increased sources of finance - public , private , multilateral , and bilateral - at the international , regional , national and local levels , and will promote the efficient , effective and accountable allocation and management of resources .  
The resources available for applied climate science are already far from adequate and the increased involvement of the socio-economic research community in developing and understanding human influences on atmospheric processes is expected to call for substantial increase in funding over the next decade .  
The negative impacts of imports barriers by developed countries on the pace of forest-based industrialization in developing countries are not expected to lead to increased export of raw wood because of the many restrictions on raw wood exports imposed by most tropical timber exporting countries .  
Human activities that can contribute to forest decline include pollutant depositions , overgrazing when woodlands are used for pastoral purposes , insensitive harvesting operations , the use of plantations with low genetic diversity , the accidental introduction of pest species , fire , the alteration of hydrology and , finally , the anticipated climate change associated with the burning of fossil fuels and increased concentration of greenhouse gases .  
Reaffirms that the effective implementation of the Programme of Action will require an increased commitment of financial resources , both domestically and externally , and , in this context , calls upon the developed countries to complement the national financial efforts of developing countries on population and development and to intensify their efforts to transfer new and additional resources to the developing countries , in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Programme of Action , in order to ensure that population and development objectives and goals are met ;  
Emphasizes the serious debt problems of the least developed countries , which necessitate strengthened efforts to formulate an international debt strategy that should include concrete measures to alleviate the debt burden and increased concessional financing in support of appropriate economic policy measures , which will be critical to the revitalization of the growth and development of the least developed countries , and encourages the Bretton Woods institutions to expedite the ongoing consideration of ways to address the issue of multilateral debt , including those concerning the least developed countries ;

This kind of interactive networking at the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels ( such as the Permanent Inter-State Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel is now acting to supplement , and in some cases replace , more traditional forms of technical cooperation .  NULLAssistance to augmenting the critical role of information for capacity-building - its generation , access , transparency and cost - has increased rapidly over the past two to three years .  
2 During the reporting period , the international community paid increased attention to the illicit traffic in , and abuse of , narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , acknowledged to be a major threat to the fabric of society and the security of States .  
Stressing the necessity of promoting and implementing policies to create a supportive international economic environment , through , inter alia , alleviation of the external debt burden and the negative impact of structural adjustment programmes , through mobilization and / or the provision of new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable , and by ensuring equitable terms of trade and increased access of women in developing countries to markets , productive investments and technologies ,  
The Andean Presidents take note of the sustained and financially sound growth of the Andean Development Corporation in the international sphere , to the point where it has become the primary source of financing for the Andean countries , supporting physical integration projects , private-sector development , increased trade and the procurement of resources in capital markets .  
Fundamental to this expanded inflow has been the increased confidence generated within the private sector , including the banking and insurance sectors , as a result of the willingness of country administrations to demonstrate a continued responsiveness to private investor concerns in the area of policy development , in the development and enhancement of stable and transparent mining and investment codes , and in the development of supportive administrative frameworks .  
The private sector is slowly responding through increased financial investment , the development of primary and ancillary industries and businesses around mining , the implementation of education and training programmes for local workforces , the transfer of technology and the deepening of institutions required to sustain growth .  
Reforms are slowly taking hold , and in the countries where the reforms are most advanced , perceptible improvements in the business environments are noticeable , and the private sector is responding through increased direct investment in the minerals sector with a corresponding multiplier effect into the economy , i.e . with job creation , the development of local small - and medium-sized enterprises and capacity building in physical , social and economic infrastructure .  
38 Discussions about action against organized transnational crime often assume , sometimes implicitly , that if only Governments devoted more efforts and resources at the national level and increased cooperation at the bilateral level , they could make considerable inroads against organized transnational crime .  
The Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , complemented by the action already taken by the Commission at its fourth session , have set in motion a process of increased awareness of the threat posed by organized transnational crime and of the need for urgent action at the national and international levels .  
Changes in the structure of transportation systems to encourage modal shifting towards inherently more eco-efficient modes , such as rail and inland water for freight and increased urban mass-transit and high speed inter-city rail for passenger travel , would make a major contribution to reducing environmental problems but require a more complex set of policy interventions .  
The information received suggests that differences in the judicial traditions , systems and practices of the responding States did not prevent an increased number of countries from including in their domestic legislation , substantial and procedural provisions designed to improve the position of victims in civil , criminal and administrative proceedings .  
Some States have established central bodies at the national level to develop a comprehensive approach and coordinate the activities of an increased number of associations involved in action to support victims .  
Following with increased concern and apprehension the continued Israeli occupation of the Syrian Arab Golan , Israel 's persistent refusal to implement the resolutions of the United Nations and to submit to the will of the international community , which considers the Israeli occupation and Israel 's decision to annex the Syrian Arab Golan as null and void and lacking any legal validity ,  
The Working Group also stressed the need for increased support for training and capacity-building in the field of integrated management of coastal areas , and stressed the need for taking action to protect all critical habitats of marine living resources in the coastal zone , including coral reefs , mangroves , mudflats and estuaries .  
Accordingly , we have concluded that increased cooperation among our Governments to combat illicit trafficking in nuclear material will contribute to increased international security and public safety , and to achievement of global non-proliferation objectives .  
This audience-oriented approach focuses on rural young men and women , the key players in a global programme aimed at ensuring increased agricultural production that conserves our natural resources to the greatest extent and sustainable rural development that reduces the push of rural poverty that exacerbates the current high levels of rural to urban migration in many of the developing countries .  
In addition , their capacity to take advantage of the expansionary cycles of international and regional trade and to withstand adverse conditions and financial instability must be increased through the diversification of products and markets , the search for foreign investment and partnerships , the use of domestic stabilization mechanisms and better linkages between exports and other productive activities .  
For the underprivileged of the world , there is greater awareness of the situation in the developed countries , resulting in raised aspirations and calls in global forums for goals and standards regarding increased prosperity , a secure and healthy life , human rights , social justice and gender equality . 
A significant enhancement and strengthening of international cooperation in the field of human rights leading to increased effectiveness of international machinery , improved respect of human rights at the national level , through , inter alia , universal ratification of basic international human rights treaties and the incorporation of those standards into the domestic legislation of States ;  
To this end , we must address comprehensively , inter alia , unsustainable consumption and production patterns , particularly in industrialized countries ; unsustainable population changes , including structure and distribution , giving priority consideration to the tendency towards excessive population concentration ; homelessness ; increasing poverty ; unemployment ; social exclusion ; family instability ; inadequate resources ; lack of basic infrastructure and services ; lack of adequate planning ; growing insecurity and violence ; environmental degradation and increased vulnerability to disasters .  
Performance generally reflected strong growth in tourism and in offshore financial services , as well as increased domestic investment , with the gross domestic product recorded at US $ 90.2-million .  
At the same time , existing modalities will be reformed and streamlined in seven ways : reduced meetings ; fewer and improved reports and revitalized publications ; new networking arrangements ; increased interactions with member States ; more effective technical support , including use of country representatives ; enhanced South-South cooperation ; and strategic alliances with partners .  
Since its creation in 1992 pursuant to General Assembly resolution 46 / 182 , the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of the Secretariat has grown into an effective facilitator for the coordination of both natural and complex emergencies , and has increased its capacity to act as an advocate of humanitarian assistance in the context of both political and humanitarian policy discussions , and with respect to resource mobilization for humanitarian emergencies . 
The specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , as well as international and regional organizations , should therefore be invited to examine and review conditions in each of the Territories , commensurate with the pressing needs of the peoples concerned for increased transfer of resources , technology and know-how , and take appropriate measures to accelerate economic and social progress .  
Ethnic and religious tensions between Timorese and Indonesians had increased ; mass immigration of Indonesians into the territory of East Timor was continuing ; cases of torture , arbitrary detention , attacks , summary executions , disappearances and killings were becoming increasingly common ; the numbers and violence of the military and police forces were increasing , and many Timorese , especially young people , had become strangers in their own land and had been forced to seek asylum . 
In 1993 , the President of the Republic of Kalmykia , K . Ilyumzhinov , declared an ecological state of emergency owing to the rapid deterioration of the ecological situation in the territory of the Republic as a result of the increased impact in recent decades of the anthropogenic burden on the environment combined with the region 's extreme natural conditions .  
If sustainable forest management as conceptualized at the international level is to be widely implemented at the national level on a lasting basis , international solidarity in the sharing of technologies , know-how and information and in making resources available to meet common needs must receive increased attention .  
After 10 years of assessment and monitoring of forest condition , knowledge of the spatial and temporal distribution of forest damage has grown considerably , and public awareness of air pollution as a threat to the environment and notably to forests has increased , providing an impetus for new national and international environmental policies and expanded research into forest damage .  
NFP links together strategic and operational planning and it is specifically designed to increase effectiveness and efficiency in sustainable forestry development at the country level , potentially leading to increased commitments by potential sources of both domestic and external funds .  
More recently , the humanitarian situation has seriously deteriorated as a result of renewed intense fighting in the north-western provinces of Bubanza and Cibitoke , the outbreak of fighting in the south , increased massacres of civilians by both rebels and the Armed Forces , and the initially forceful repatriation by local Burundian authorities of large numbers of Rwandan refugees in the north-east .  
The field office in Sarajevo was originally conceived of as a small liaison office intended , among other things , to provide support to the investigation teams , to perform liaison functions with local and national Governments and organizations in the area and to provide expert legal advice on republican and federal law in the former Yugoslavia . Following the Dayton Accord , and the increased investigative activity in the region , the critical need for increased support for the investigation teams became immediately apparent .  
Factual and informative , as opposed to literary or propagandist , this publication has been well received : all of the six issues published so far have been reprinted , and its increased dissemination is expected to stimulate interest in the Tribunal 's work . 
The extent to which the scarcity of tropical hardwood resources may become a constraint on processing activities , as reflected in increased real prices for tropical logs and sawnwood , will depend on the willingness of major developing country producers to pursue sustainable management of remaining old-growth production forests and coordinate processing capacity with supply .  
A number of innovations were already introduced at the ninth session of the Conference , including reducing documentation ; scaled down formal plenary sessions ; increased use of informal debates , circulated written statements and videotaped interventions ; and remote translation .  
However , the implementation of return-and-reintegration programmes was subsequently disrupted because of increased political instability and armed conflict , in particular in southern Somalia , provoking renewed population movements , mainly towards relatively peaceful areas in the north-east and north-west , but also within the southern regions of the country .  
In October 1995 , fighting increased in intensity between rival factions in the city , causing the country 's main port in south Mogadishu to cease functioning and to have a negative effect on the flow of humanitarian assistance to the city and to the interior regions of the country .  
Reaffirms the need to raise the target for common premises on a case-by-case basis , taking into account cost-benefit analysis and operational sustainability , using lessons learned during the implementation of this request and avoiding an increased burden on host countries ; requests the funds and programmes of the United Nations system to develop a plan of action , administrative arrangements and a time-frame for the implementation of this request ; and encourages the United Nations specialized agencies and regional offices to share those common premises where practicable ;  
In response to the Summit 's call for increased cooperation at all levels , the regional commissions are expected to play a major role in supporting the implementation of the objectives set out in the Copenhagen Declaration and the Programme of Action , in particular to assist developing countries , Africa and the least developed countries , and the countries with economies in transition .  
It is patently clear - and accepted throughout the developing world - that functioning markets and private initiative are among the most efficient and powerful mechanisms to generate wealth and thus permit increased standards of living .

A growing need for effective and timely measures to address urgent water problems that are often directly or indirectly related to agricultural water uses , such as water scarcity and environmental degradation , has increased the demands for improved decision-making , clear water policies , and adequate legal and institutional frameworks at the national level .  
The promise is that if food import prices rise because of the Uruguay Round , net food-importing developing countries and the least developed countries could be eligible for increased food aid , financial support to maintain normal food imports , technical support to raise agricultural productivity , and eventually favourable treatment on agricultural export credits .  
The Institute was encouraged by an increased willingness of African States to base their policy decisions with regard to crime prevention and criminal justice issues on appropriate , adequate , valid and reliable data , as has been indicated by several participants of training activities organized by the Institute . The Institute will continue to undertake advisory missions and train national officials towards establishing appropriate structures and systems for the regular production of the required crime data .  
With the increased level of insecurity producing newly displaced persons daily , the United Nations system remains concerned that current stockpiles will be depleted and major shortages of essential relief items will soon occur .  
Additional financial resources are called for , whether obtained through established means including increased and dependable official development assistance , better mobilization of domestic resources and greater direct foreign investment , or through innovative means .  
The statutory length of paid holidays is one day per working month , with the maximum not exceeding 15 days , and this is increased for certain workers , being doubled in the case of young workers under 18 years of age and extended to 18 days for some senior workers ( art . 113 of the Labour Code ) . 
From the standpoint of improvement of agricultural productivity the optimal management of public land constitutes a priority means of substantially raising the contribution of such land to increased output and helping , by a multiplier effect , to disseminate advanced techniques .  Accordingly , a reform of the methods of managing this national land has been adopted after widespread national consultation .  
It explains why the Tunisia of the new era has opted for a national scientific development policy targeted on the needs of Tunisian society and guaranteeing increased protection of human rights conceived as an essential condition of economic , social and cultural progress .  
Where funding is concerned , the State has made a major effort to provide researchers with sufficient resources to enable them to carry out the research freely chosen by them in the scientific councils of the establishment or those to which they belong ( national mobilization programmes ) ; the resources are decided upon by scientific commissions and approved by the administrative authority .  Thus the public research budget , which was only 32.9-million dinars in 1992 , had increased by 1995 to 57.9-million dinars .  
They called upon the developed countries to make every effort to coordinate their macroeconomic policies , including through multilateral institutions in which developing countries are represented , so as to stimulate the world economy through increased demand , stabilized markets and further liberalized trade , and thereby provide a conducive international economic environment for development .  
However , he questioned the wisdom of having one treaty body that was extremely well funded , while other treaty bodies had inadequate resources and administrative support with possibly no natural outside agencies to provide additional funding that could lead to increased effectiveness and more optimal functioning .  
His delegation recognized that it would not be easy to reach agreement on a 20 per cent ceiling , but in recent years Portugal and Greece had both voluntarily agreed to increase their peacekeeping rates and numerous countries had joined the consensus two years previously on a regular scale that increased their rates . 
Mr . SERIWA ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) said that his delegation supported the statement on the question of ageing made by the representative of Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China . Despite the encouraging growth in the global economy , economic and social conditions in many developing countries , particularly in Africa , were still disturbing , owing to a large number of external factors such as an increased debt-burden .  
Those programmes were beginning to bear fruit : the level of absolute poverty had been reduced while per capita income had increased ; economic growth had been sustained ; the debt service ratio had decreased in relation to exports ; and the Philippines had re-entered the private capital market in order to seek sources of external financing .  27 .  In order to promote sustainable human development to achieve real prosperity , economic growth in developing countries must reach between 5 and 9 per cent .  
The international economy was displaying mixed characteristics : in the case of the developed countries , there were prospects of continued cyclical expansion , but there were also fears of inflation and resulting suggestions to contain growth rates , and there was increased unemployment and slow progress in the structural transformation of economies ; in the case of the developing countries , there were significant growth rates and a greater contribution to world trade , but also problems of poverty , lack of infrastructure , human resources and technological strength .  
The United Nations should emphasize the formulation of policies aimed at fostering a consensus on development strategy as a vital step towards the building of a new global partnership , and should develop specific programmes to assist the least developed countries - most of which had yet to benefit from increased flows of private capital - and the African countries , which were suffering from a heavy debt burden and a lack of basic infrastructure for development .  
Building increased public awareness of the social , economic and human costs of anti-personnel mines is essential to develop and sustain the necessary political will for a global anti-personnel mine ban .  
The issue of resources for operational activities , however , was particularly important because , in the view of her delegation , if resources could not be increased on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , the effectiveness of such activities would be seriously impaired , developing countries ' development programmes would be jeopardized and , in the long run , international development cooperation would be affected .  
Recognize that increased use of solar energy can reduce environmental degradation caused by adverse human activities , such as industrial pollution and deforestation , and that it is the responsibility of Governments and all sectors of civil society to work together to find lasting solutions to problems threatening the sustainable development of humanity ;  
Commit ourselves to working towards the greater use of solar energy through the provision of adequate technical assistance and funding , the full utilization of existing international funds , and the facilitation of increased participation by both public and private sectors .  
Those international conventions constitute internal law as of the time they are sanctioned , are applicable ex officio by the courts and by all public services and have increased validity pursuant to paragraph 1 of article 28 of the Constitution , which stipulates that : " The generally acknowledged rules of international law , as well as international conventions as of the time they are sanctioned by law and become operative according to the conditions therein , shall be an integral part of domestic Greek law and shall prevail over any contrary provisions of the law .  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of , and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments which request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development that have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and that take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
A sustained commitment of all relevant parts of the United Nations towards increased cooperation under the guidance of the High Commissioner , increased resources for both technical and financial assistance and continued substantive programme development are required in order to provide an effective response to the growing demand by the Member States for cooperation with the United Nations regarding the rule of law .  
His delegation supported the continuing decentralization of functions which , in particular , increased managerial responsibility at the local level , and agreed that delegated management authority must be accompanied by delegated financial authority , subject , however , to the overall authority of the Office of Human Resources Management . 
In addition , price measures might suffer from a number of practical problems : the changing nature of output and the increased heterogeneity of products made it very difficult to compile consistent price measures over time ; service industry outputs were notoriously difficult to define and to price ; and measuring the price of governmental outputs presented major conceptual problems .  
Concerned about the dramatic humanitarian situation in eastern Zaire and encouraged by this statement by the Rwandan authorities , the High Commissioner is transmitting a message through the local media , reassuring the refugees that , while UNHCR would try to do everything possible to assist them where they are , the Office would be ready to help them back in Rwanda and had for that purpose increased its reception and assistance capacities inside Rwanda .  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way to the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of , and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development that have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and that take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
In assuming its complete role , with the completion of AICC construction work , the detention facilities , increased activity with the commencement of trials , and taking into consideration the general political situation of the region , additional security personnel would be required for facilities and access control , armed escort , personal protection and simultaneous courtroom operations .  
In recent years , the total number of such personnel has increased very significantly and activities performed by them have expanded to backstopping of peacekeeping operations , disarmament and humanitarian assistance , and to areas which have , in the past , been carried out exclusively by staff members , such as economic and social research , internal oversight services , administration and management .  
Also requests the Secretary-General , subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources , to provide increased advisory services and technical assistance to requesting Member States , in particular in the elaboration of national strategies , the elaboration or improvement of legislative and regulatory measures , the establishment or strengthening of national capacities to prevent and control corruption , as well as in training and upgrading skills of relevant personnel ;  
Concessional , bilateral contributions from the developed countries were crucial in that regard , as was a favourable international economic environment , characterized by improved access to markets , stable exchange rates , effectively managed international interest rates , increased resource flows and access by the developing countries to technology .  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way towards the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
Stresses the importance for developing countries of continuing their efforts to promote a favourable environment for attracting foreign investment , thereby promoting economic growth and sustainable development , and stresses the need for the international community to promote a conducive external economic environment through , inter alia , improved market access , stabilization of exchange rates , effective stewardship of international interest rates and increased resource flows , as well as improved access to technology for the developing countries ;  
Consequent to the low tariff rates , imports had increased while economic development and exports had been circumscribed by , in addition to other causes , exogenous factors including the restrictive policy of other countries coupled with the sluggish and diminished flow of both private and official funds .  
The representative of the European Commission said that it was likely that the number of transborder RBPs ( particularly cartels , abuses of dominance and mergers having international effects ) had increased in proportion with the considerable growth in international trade , in foreign direct investment , and in the size and number of transnational corporations .  
Stresses that the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda will require an increased commitment of financial resources , both domestically and externally , and in that context calls upon the developed countries to complement the national financial efforts of developing countries on human settlements development and urban management , and intensify their efforts to transfer new and additional resources to the developing countries within the framework of paragraphs 203 and 204 of the Habitat Agenda in order to ensure the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda ;  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way to the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
It would appear that the views of the Inspectors in this report vary significantly from the conclusions and recommendations of two previous JIU reports on the subject of advancing the status of women , issued in June 19943 and October 1995.4 Both reports were fully supportive of the special measures introduced by the Secretary-General to improve the status of women in the Secretariat and called for increased accountability of programme managers , in particular those who did not demonstrate real efforts to improve the status and representation of women in their respective departments .  
During that event , more than 140 leading media figures from around the globe , representing more than 50 countries , had discussed the growing significance of television in the changing contemporary world , the opportunities offered by the current technological revolution in communications , which vastly increased the possibilities of cultural exchange , the role of both private and public broadcasters in providing information on global events and the strengthening of the partnership between the United Nations system and the international media .  
Developing countries which have only recently joined such processes , or which are about to join , should , as appropriate , be assisted through action aimed at poverty alleviation ; institutional strengthening ; human resource development , with special consideration to gender issues and to education and training at all levels ; establishment of mechanisms for increased public participation ; research and technology transfer ; research networking ; ensuring access to , and dissemination and exchange of , information ; development of plans and programmes ; and field-level testing of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management ;  
The Panel recognized that the [ agreements reached ] [ documents adopted ] at UNCED have significantly [ underlined ] [ increased ] the understanding that forest policy and sustainable forest management must be [ reconciled ] [ addressed ] , taking into account the multiple benefits of forests [ at the national , regional and global levels ] and that these issues need to be addressed through a holistic and integrated approach [ rather than in a fragmented manner ] .  
Because of the increasing number of developing countries that are actively engaged in space science research , the United Nations , through the Programme and the Committee , has in recent years placed increased emphasis on promoting education and research in space science and technology and , in particular , planetary exploration and astronomy ( topics covered in a guidebook3 published for International Space Year , 1992 ) , comprising what has come to be known in the international space community as basic space science .  
Additional expenditures resulted from the higher than projected unit costs for rations ; troop rotation cost carried over from the prior period ; helicopter hire charges that exceeded projected costs ; higher than estimated costs for audit services ; increased demand for medical services coupled with a rapid rise in cost of medical treatment ; and longer than anticipated costs for miscellaneous ground maintenance and facility services and repairs .  
The Commission noted , bearing in mind the role of the Economic and Social Council in overall coordination , that increased dialogue between the Bureau of the Commission on the Status of Women and the Economic and Social Council , the chairpersons and secretariats , as appropriate , of the other functional commissions , other subsidiary bodies and related bodies , including the relevant executive boards , would assist in identifying issues that could be addressed under the agenda item on emerging issues and trends .  
The country has achieved a considerable improvement in housing conditions both in terms of living space and standard of dwellings but is now placing a special emphasis on increasing the production of rental and cooperative housing , increased renovation of existing housing , developing the housing finance system and promoting the stability of the market for rental housing .  
Thus , whereas the annual growth rate of the international migrant stock in developed countries increased only moderately , passing from 2.3 per cent per annum during 1965-1975 to 2.4 per cent during 1985-1990 , that of the total number of migrants in the developing countries increased ninefold , rising from 0.3 per cent during 1965-1975 to 2.7 per cent during 1985-1990 .  
The adoption of this theme highlighted the emphasis given by the international community to voluntary repatriation as a durable solution and asserted that a natural extension of that emphasis is the increased importance attached to the prevention of forced displacement .  
Indeed , increased cooperation between the two organizations will , we hope , make it possible to establish the foundations for international cooperation that is free from ideological confrontation and resolutely determined to meet its global challenges : economic and social development ; strengthening democracy and respect for human rights ; the promotion of sustainable development while taking account of the need for environmental conservation ; the struggle against the scourge of drugs ; and the promotion of gender equality .  
Considering the increased cooperation we have witnessed during the past year in support of Latin American and Caribbean Member States in the field of designing policies on social development including the follow-up to the World Summit for Social Development on economic integration and on trends in the globalization process , our delegations are in favour of a further broadening and deepening of the mutual supporting activities between ECLAC and the Latin American Economic System , as expressed this morning by the representative of Peru .  
At the same time , the reform process must assign special importance to measures and mechanisms designed to accelerate economic and social development , especially in Africa , by supporting domestic efforts at economic restructuring , diversification of raw materials and increased food security being carried out by the countries of the region . 
The scope for female employment has been rapidly expanded by technological change , increasing concentration of employment in service industries , increased flexibility of work times and availability of part-time work , changing social attitudes towards female employment , and improved provision of childcare .  
Over the past few years , higher international prices , new mining codes with more clearly defined rights and obligations of foreign investors , and aid-financed geologic surveys had contributed to a large increase in the exploration for mineral deposits and with notable success .  Gold production in particular has increased rapidly in several countries in western and southern Africa .  
The revitalized regional integration initiative of Kenya , the United Republic of Tanzania and Uganda , now called the East African Cooperation , provided expanded markets for local manufacturing output among member countries .  Also , the signing of a new trade protocol among the member countries of the Southern African Development Community has paved the way for expanded markets and increased trade among the Community 's member States , although regional manufacturing is increasingly dominated by South Africa .  
They include poverty and growing economic imbalances in and between countries ; rising unemployment and underemployment in many parts of the world ; environmental degradation ; war and civil strife ; intensified domestic and international conflicts for political , religious or ethnic reasons ; disparities in economic development and income levels ; globalization ; labour market demands ; and increased international trade and investment .  
While there has been an increased recognition of the importance of science and a considerable increase in international planning and coordination to provide the scientific basis for sustainable development , the actual amount of money being spent on scientific activities in a majority of both developing and developed countries has declined since 1992 .  
Some other issues that will require increased research activities in the future are related to ( a ) the pathways of man-made chemicals , in particular toxic chemicals , in ecosystems , agro-ecosystems and the global biosphere and the possible undesirable biological effects in humans and animals subsisting often far away from the source point ; and ( b ) interdisciplinary research on re-emerging tropical and subtropical diseases conditioned by particular environments and vectors .  1 Report of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , vol .  
Thus , whereas the annual growth rate of the international migrant stock in the developed countries increased only moderately , passing from 2.3 per cent per year during 1965-1975 to 2.4 per cent during 1985-1990 , that of the total number of migrants in the developing countries increased ninefold , rising from 0.3 per cent during 1965-1975 to 2.7 per cent during 1985-1990 .  
Yet its subsequent , rapid spread through tainted blood and heterosexual activity increased public concern , leading to actions that , if taken earlier , would have saved many lives .  
In spite of their transitory nature , those fluctuations may , owing to their echo-effect , cause significant longer-term changes in the age structure of populations at the local , national or even regional levels , such as an unusual increase or decrease in the number of older persons ( for instance , due to surges of refugees in sub-Saharan Africa ) , or an increase in the numbers of older widows ( due to increased male mortality among the older working-age groups in several European countries in transition from centrally planned economies ) .  
In some cities in Europe , campaigns to encourage communities to separate waste at the household level have been so successful that there is insufficient capacity to recycle all the waste collected by municipal authorities and , because of increased supply , the market price for recycled materials has dropped drastically .  
What is lacking is the development of the social and institutional structures that are needed to keep pace with the policy , regulatory and service demands arising from rapid population growth , increased complexity and the changes in technology ; and underlying this gap is the issue of good governance and its impact on building capacities and developing performance standards for sustainable development . 
Likewise , suburban sprawl , which has led to increased consumption of fossil fuel through extended commuting , disturbs the fragile ecosystems and permanently removes prime arable land from agricultural production .  
Given the increased number of decision-making bodies concerned with sustainable development , including those related to the international conventions , there is an ever-greater need for coordination at the intergovernmental level through consistent and coherent positions of Governments in these various forums , as well as for the development and strengthening of a collaborative process among secretariats .  
The idea of concentrating United Nations efforts on a situation that may become an inflamed dispute likely to endanger international peace and security has now been accepted , but the United Nations has not developed a special mechanism to deal with so many current crises .  While the then Secretary-General reorganized the Secretariat in such a way that information on incipient crises is being collected , the Secretariat is being downsized and is not likely to be increased to deal with an avalanche of new problems .  
Those events had a direct impact on humanitarian conditions , owing to the resultant imposition of increased restrictions on the Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in northern Cyprus , stricter security measures and interruption of regular medical transport to the southern part of the island as well as loss of employment for Turkish Cypriots working in the southern part of Cyprus .  
Their declaration recognized that public-private partnerships not only foster sustainable cities , but also generate profitable opportunities for business through increased productivity , a better educated and dynamic work force and improved infrastructure .  
The project has six immediate objectives : ( a ) increased awareness and improved understanding of the money-laundering phenomenon and acceptance of the need for countermeasures ; ( b ) introduction of relevant legislation , inter alia , promoting mutual legal assistance ; ( c ) improved global infrastructure , including the delivery of training services ; ( d ) improved capacity of legal and related law enforcement systems , including the establishment of financial intelligence units or similar bodies ; ( e ) reduced financial system vulnerability ; and ( f ) improved process of performance evaluation .  
It has also become clear that the problems created for countries by organized transnational crime may be solved only through the adoption and implementation of measures that could comprise up-to-date legislation to deal with this criminal phenomenon ; increased capacity of criminal justice systems to enforce existing legislation and control organized transnational crime ; strengthened ability to gather and analyse reliable information on organized crime activities , with a view to devising preventive and control policies ; and more effective inter-state cooperation when investigating , prosecuting or judging organized transnational crime offences .  
Recommendations to address these constraints included : ( a ) identifying promotional messages for SHD to be used by all staff in contacts with the media at seminars and other venues ; ( b ) improving links between the staff working in policy , substantive and operational matters and those in media ; ( c ) encouraging all staff to invest time in developing and communicating clear messages on the role and activities of UNDP ; and ( d ) allocating increased funding from the organizational budget for communication and advocacy efforts .  
The key elements are : ( a ) the creation of an effective and professional human resource management organization ; ( b ) implementation of human resource measures sensitive to a more equitable gender-balance in decision-making ; ( c ) increased efficiency of transaction-based services ; ( d ) maintenance of competitive benefits and conditions of service ; ( e ) foundations for continuous learning and learning opportunities for key staff .  
The objective of structural adjustment programmes was to enable developing countries to have more normal commercial relations with other countries , since access to international capital and increased exports were essential for development and growth .  
That new capital is envisaged to come from a redirection of private capital from mature markets to markets with new absorptive capacity created for sustainable development ; from the removal of existing subsidies ; from domestic savings ; from debt-relief ; and from public monies , including increased ODA . Efforts should be made to provide the necessary flexibility to allow those reallocations to take place naturally in response to incentives . 
Price is a major factor affecting the efficient use of energy ; as long as energy from different sources is not priced at its full cost , inclusive of the environmental damage it causes , there is no possibility of meeting the energy needs of the existing global population , let alone the needs of the expected increased population .  
Progress in the post-UNCED debate was attested by : the increased focus on exploring the scope of complementarities between trade liberalization , economic development and environmental protection ; the greater degree of confidence built up between the environmental and trade communities ; a balanced and integrated approach to the trade and environment agenda encouraged by the international community ; and , the work programmes of UNCTAD , WTO and UNEP which , together with the Commission on Sustainable Development , had clearly anchored the objectives of sustainable development and the trade and environment theme .  
Early implementation of key public investments would result not only in increased aggregate demand , employment and incomes , but in a recovery of private investment - an essential factor for a more sustained , self-reliant economic growth and significantly improved security .  
Recognizing further that the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Commission provides a historic opportunity for the Commission to bring about the wide participation of its members and associate members and to sharpen the focus of its work to enable it to respond more effectively to the evolving economic and social needs of the members and associate members within a rapidly changing global paradigm , including the changing scope of regional cooperation , by utilizing fully the multidisciplinary advantage of the Commission and its increased capability in technical assistance activities ,  
Serve as a mobilizer of ideas and a catalyst for action to identify and promote new policy options at the national , subregional and regional levels for the removal of constraints on the economic and social development efforts of these countries , with emphasis on the adoption of measures for increased mobilization of domestic and foreign resources , trade and private sector development , public sector reform , and provision of economic advice , on request , to Governments with limited internal capacity .  
There is an increased use in the region of satellite imagery and global positioning systems ( GPS ) ; geodetic networks are being improved ; and there is a continuing need to maintain topographic and thematic mapping and a priority need to produce data and maps in support of cadastre .  
Experts identified various global trends in the sector such as increased demand for health care , the phenomenon of consumerism , relative shortage of health personnel in some developed countries , aging population requiring tailor-made products , information / technology revolution , increased mobility of consumers and service providers , and increasing medical costs and decreasing public health care budgets requiring containment of health care costs .  
This commitment must also be linked to increased international support for the institution of asylum , and for identifying solutions , if the High Commissioner is to exercise her mandated protection functions of securing the fundamental rights of refugees , asylum-seekers and others in need of international protection ; playing a supervisory and standard-setting role in developing international refugee law ; and identifying and helping to implement fair and sustainable solutions .  
Concern about slack growth and mounting social problems led the Government to decide early in March on a new economic orientation , including promotion of investment and elimination of all obstacles to investment by Lebanese and foreigners ; protection of agriculture through limiting imports of competing agricultural products ; and selection and protection of competitive industries , which have an export potential , which will be supported to ensure increased productivity .  
This action has received increased support from different donor sources ; however , additional and increased development assistance is to be directed towards the basic social services with a view to improving primary and reproductive health care , basic education , skills development and literacy in priority , to at least meet the targets set by recent international conferences . 
Their experience provided valuable input for the design of future peacekeeping missions , pointing to the need to accord a greater role to the civilian component and to ensure increased cooperation with local and national civic movements .  
Also convinced that a year designed to enhance the recognition , facilitation , networking and promotion of volunteer service , with particular emphasis upon activity at the local level , could make a significant contribution to generating increased awareness of the achievements and the further potential of volunteer service , to encouraging offers of service from a greatly expanded number of individuals and to channelling resources to enable the even greater effectiveness of such service ,  
An international enabling environment also requires coordination of macroeconomic policies by the international community which foster conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and low fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments , technologies and knowledge to developing countries , and new and additional financial resources from all sources .  
An essential component of an enabling environment for development is sound national macroeconomic policies and the creation of favourable conditions for investment and increased domestic savings , including through the creation of a sound banking system .  
While the overall economic performance in the least developed countries has improved , poverty remains pervasive and the majority of the population in the least developed countries suffers from reduced caloric intakes , increased mortality and morbidity , the re-emergence and spread of disease and lower school enrolment .  
With reference to the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction , the countries of the Pacific region had expressed growing concern over the increased intensity and frequency of storms and typhoons in the region , with an impact that would continue to stretch their limited resources .  International assistance was required to make regional activities more efficient .  
The motor of that process was the promotion of an enabling environment that would ensure increased access for the poor to economic services and industrial goods , given that the great majority of poor people in rural areas were self-employed and that their prosperity depended on their having direct access to more and improved means of production .  
The participants noted the need for increased financial and technical assistance from a variety of sources , including export credit institutions , as well as import promotion agencies in the developed countries , for viable projects promoting the exports of developing countries , and encouraged governments and enterprises to make full use of the existing sources of assistance .  
In order to eliminate the causes of the refugee problem , it was necessary to establish a new international political and economic order based on increased international cooperation to promote progress and development in the developing countries , the peaceful settlement of disputes , respect for State sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States . 
The gap between developed and developing countries points to the continued need for a dynamic and enabling international economic environment supportive of international cooperation , particularly in the fields of finance , technology transfer , debt and trade , if the momentum for global progress towards sustainable development is to be maintained and increased .  
These initiatives focused on increased use of alternative transportation fuels ( e.g . , natural gas ) , support for urban public transport , and improved transportation planning and regulation .  
As a result of the increased volume of financial transactions both within and across major national and international payment and settlement systems , there has been concern about the ability of the present institutional arrangements to manage the load , in particular the settlement risk ( i.e . , the risk of the failure of one party to a transaction to complete its obligations in a timely fashion ) .  
Concerning future trends , UNCTADs technical cooperation programme was achieving its goals satisfactorily , and its efforts to cooperate with other organizations were worthy of praise , but two policy questions would have to be addressed : how did the UNCTAD secretariat resolve the apparent contradiction between the concentration of technical cooperation activities in LDCs and its proposals for cost recovery , and how could regular budget expenditures be decreased and technical cooperation activities increased without the implementation of other mandates established at UNCTAD IX being affected ?  
Despite the adoption of the Paris Declaration and the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s , [ 29 ] there has been a decline in real terms of total official development assistance for least developed countries and continued marginalization of those countries , and their number has increased from 41 to 48 without a proportionate increase in support measures despite national and international efforts .  
The reform of the national Government is also continuing and being extended to the provincial governments , the tax system is being strengthened and the efficiency of public spending in the social sphere increased at all levels of government .  
We also urge that an integrated initiative be agreed upon at that meeting on providing the least developed countries with coordinated and substantially increased technical cooperation in trade and trade-related areas with a view to strengthening their supply capacity of exportable goods and services , in line with the Marrakesh Ministerial Decision on Measures in Favour of the Least Developed Countries .  
Within the context of increased financial flows to developing countries and the continuing surge in foreign direct investment , equity and bonds , he noted with optimism the rapid turnaround in private sector financial flows to Mexico and Argentina after the crisis of 1995 and the modest private sector flows to Africa .  
Given that the five Central Asian Republics are landlocked , in search of world markets and in need of developing new transport corridors to improve trade performance , UNDP is providing support to the Government of Tajikistan to pave the way for a modern system of transit procedures and ensure adherence to international customs conventions that simplify border crossings among the five Central Asian Countries , resulting in reduced transport costs , increased competitiveness , expanded trade potential and augmented economic growth .  
In view of the continuing widespread violations of human rights in Kosovo as reported by the Special Rapporteur , the opening of an office of the High Commissioner in Prishtina , as well as an increased presence of other international organizations , would be indispensable for gathering reliable information on future human rights developments .  
He identified the following areas where Yemen required increased technical assistance : general training in trade matters ( under TRAINFORTRADE ) , training to operate ASYCUDA , quality control in the agricultural and food industries , trade information technology , establishment of a financial market , and policy advice and experience in the area of foreign trade and trade negotiations .  
Gravely concerned that , despite continued increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development , which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and which take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
In that light , agency programming through 1997 has evolved to reflect several new developments , including an increased orientation towards reconstruction projects and confidence-building measures , support for capacity-building of local authorities in the health , education and social welfare sectors , improved targeting of beneficiaries and more consolidated and integrated projects oriented towards employment / income generation .  
The already slow process of development in those countries would be further impeded , requiring three types of countermeasures : slowing of population growth , promotion of North-South partnership , such as that envisioned in Agenda 21 and the final documents of other major United Nations conferences , and the eradication of poverty through the creation of an international economic climate favourable to the opening up of markets , debt reduction and increased financial resources flows from North to South .  
In closing , she emphasized the important role of the Commission in the years to come , especially with regard to the ongoing and increasing process of globalization driven by increased foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and foreign portfolio equity investment flows .  
The objective in this thematic area is to equip Arab societies with an increased capacity to devise and implement measures that can ensure food security at the family level , especially among poor populations , by helping to increase the inclusion of the issue of food security in state economic and social policies , to the extent that they regulate markets , investments and social safety nets , and to develop elements of a coherent system focused on making food available to all .  
Success will be measured by the number of additional jobs and improved livelihoods generated by new investments , increased trade and development of infrastructure , and the cooperative mechanisms established and strengthened to ensure sustainability and promote peaceful and productive development among the member States .  
Allow me to reiterate here the great importance of the support of the international community in assisting the member States of the Standing Advisory Committee to carry out the positive measures they have adopted , in a context that must be described as particularly difficult , in order to strengthen subregional security through increased cooperation , as is reflected in document A / 52 / 283 , which contains the report of the ninth ministerial meeting of the Standing Advisory Committee , held in Libreville , Gabon , from 7 to 11 July 1997 .  
During the period following its establishment in 1922 , Jordan experienced tremendous economic , social and demographic changes which fundamentally altered its demographic map and affected the size , composition and distribution of the population , which increased from 225,000 in 1922 to 300,000 in 1938 , representing an annual growth of 1.8 per cent . 
Urges the international community , the United Nations system and other relevant organizations to give priority to supporting the efforts of developing countries to ensure the full and effective participation of women in deciding and implementing development strategies , through , inter alia , women 's increased access to health care , capital , education , training and technology , and wider participation in decision-making ;  
In view of potential as well as proved advantages of the use of advanced technologies , including electronic publishing , the increased use of such technologies for the publishing process should be enhanced by the Secretariat and a general shift towards the various forms of electronic publishing should be intensified and due regard paid to cost recovery and access to such electronic products in developing countries .  
Convinced of the necessity of protecting and promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms and determined to take new steps forward , nationally and with the increased cooperation and solidarity of the international community , with a view to achieving substantial progress in human rights ,  
Also stresses in this context the need for various measures to be taken by the international community , including increased trade-related technical assistance and human and institutional capacity-building for strengthening the supply capacity of exportable goods and services of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , with a view to their full integration into the world economy ;  
The main objective of the Symposium was to provide an opportunity for representatives of space industry and the private sector to interact with international space scientists , space technology experts and policy makers from developing and developed countries and to explore possibilities for increased scientific and technical cooperation .  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in the last few years , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , particularly those of developing countries ,  
The tripartite forms of governance of employment policy established in many countries have increased cohesion and reduced conflict so long as they were genuinely inclusive of all kinds of workers , and need to be developed in ways that take account of the transnational nature of much economic activity .  
Urges the international community , the United Nations system and other relevant organizations to give priority to assisting the efforts of developing countries to ensure the full and effective participation of women in deciding and implementing development strategies , through , inter alia , the increased access of women to health care , capital , education , training and technology and full and equal participation in decision-making ;  
The nature of this relationship should be clarified , as , in his view , the social effects of immigration will depend on whether the labour supplied by immigrants is perceived as competitive with or complementary to native labour and there is no satisfactory measure for determining whether racism has increased or decreased .  
Our increased input of international experience and police skills in order to support the police of Bosnia and Herzegovina in fighting crime and maintaining public security will remain ineffective without a democratically legitimized judicial system that guarantees fair investigations and trials as well as acceptable circumstances of detention .  
The country has achieved a considerable improvement in housing conditions , both in terms of living space and standard of dwellings , but is now placing a special emphasis on increasing the production of rental and cooperative housing , increased renovation of existing housing , developing the housing finance system and promoting the stability of the market for rental housing .  
There is absolutely no doubt that increased international assistance and initiatives for debt relief or cancellation , increased official development assistance to meet agreed targets , private capital flows , increased foreign direct investment , and improved terms of trade would play a catalytic role in Africa 's efforts to achieve economic development .  
The objectives are the following : the continuation and consolidation of the process of democratizing political and social life ; the increased participation of the citizens in political , economic and social life and in making decisions that concern them ; the establishment of sound rules of government ; the promotion of the private sector ; the development of human resources ; and the restoration and safeguarding of environmental equilibrium and of the ecosystem , with special attention being paid to environmental problems related to human activities .  
Transnational criminal organizations have , in fact , existed for a long time , but the globalization of international relations with regard to the economy , commerce , telecommunications and the rapid progress of technology , as well as the disappearance of ideological blocs , have permitted the activities of transnational criminal organizations to expand and have increased their power to such an extent that they are now a permanent threat to the foundation and internal security of States , to their cultural and artistic heritage and to the environment of the planet .  
These reform proposals as a whole represent a timely and welcome initiative , given the fact that in today 's world the need has progressively increased for global common action on a number of pressing problems , such as the eradication of poverty , humanitarian emergencies , refugee problems , climate change and desertification , diminishing official development assistance funding , drugs , nuclear disarmament , the implementation of Agenda 21 , democracy and the maintenance of peace and security in various regions of the world .  
Information provided both by the Secretariat and by specialized agencies gives an objective quantitative picture of where the phenomena of poverty , unemployment and social disintegration are most acute : the same places experiencing an increased deterioration in the terms of trade ; protectionism ; a fall in the prices of exported raw materials ; and the drying up of financial flows .  
The international economic system must be overhauled to enhance the trade prospects of the poor countries and to facilitate their access to science and technology , technical assistance and increased financial flows , both private and official .  
Despite increased flows to emerging markets , international capital flows remain highly concentrated , going from a small number of developed countries and transnational corporations to a small number of developing countries .  
A major trend in both developed and developing countries has been increasing wage differentials between skilled and unskilled workers , due both to technological change and to increased trade and capital flows .  
In the face of the increasing power of private global actors to determine the distribution of income and production and the content of economic and social policies , outside the political process , it is important to broaden participation in decision-making and to strengthen political accountability by means of increased transparency of decision-making in existing regional and international institutions . 
Developed countries should sustain stable economic growth at home and provide increased opportunities for developing countries to expand their exports , including both manufactured products from more advanced developing countries and primary commodities from less developed countries .  
Consumption will stay relatively weak , reflecting sluggish personal income growth and growing household debt , which increased from 65 per cent of personal disposable income in 1991 to almost 95 per cent in 1996 ; but the weakest component of demand will remain government spending owing to the continuation of fiscal austerity at all levels of government .  
In the face of the economic slowdown in Western Europe , and thus the slower growth of exports to the main foreign markets of these countries , aggregate demand was boosted by strong private consumption , made possible by rising real wages , and increased investment .  
While rapid economic growth based largely on investment in human resources has facilitated a reduction of the proportion of the poor in some parts of the ESCAP region , inadequate investment in human resources has sustained and in some cases actually increased the concentration of the poor in other parts of the region . 
We are of the view that given the positive global political climate following the end of the cold war , the work of the Conference has assumed even increased significance in that opportunities that did not exist during the period of heightened East _ West tension are now present , both in respect of conventional and , more importantly , nuclear disarmament .  
There is an increased willingness to work across national borders marked by mountain chains , in particular for scientific reasons , such as to study the behaviour of migratory species , for environmental conservation purposes , and for ecological / economic reasons among countries sharing major watercourses .  
Given the current scarcity of public resources , additional funds need to be mobilized through increased use of economic instruments ( general tax reforms , eco-taxes , subsidy reduction and tradeable permit schemes ) , increased private-sector involvement , national environmental funds and innovative international financial mechanisms .  
The predominant role of the private sector in the transfer and diffusion of ESTs and , more importantly , its leading function in the transition to cleaner production , have increased the private sector 's responsibility for ensuring that technology-related investments and industrial and business operations are consistent with community requirements for sustainable lifestyles and environmental protection .  
Also requests the Secretary-General , subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources , to provide increased advisory services and technical assistance to Member States , at their request , in particular in the elaboration of national strategies , the elaboration or improvement of legislative and regulatory measures , the establishment or strengthening of national capacities to prevent and control corruption , as well as in training and upgrading skills of relevant personnel ;  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development , which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and which take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
A typical example of the technical superiority of the traffickers has been their increased use of mobile cellular phones and faxes since the mid-1980s , once law enforcement authorities were known to be legally and technically equipped to carry out successful wire-tapping operations of the traditional phone network ( which showed improved interdiction and arrest results ) .  
The main responsibility of Governments is to " provide the required budgetary resources to the educational sector , with reallocation within the educational sector to ensure increased funds for basic education " ( Platform for Action , para . 84 ( a ) ) and " to monitor the implementation of educational reforms and measures in relevant ministries , and establish technical assistance programmes " ( Platform for Action , para . 84 ( b ) ) .  
However , while macroeconomic stabilization was a necessary but not sufficient condition for enterprise development , structural adjustment and liberalization measures had produced encouraging positive results such as the emergence of an enterprise culture and increased entrepreneurial activities to take advantage of the enlarged economic opportunities for the private sector arising from such measures .  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way towards the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
To meet the rapidly evolving tasks of the Programme , a new approach to its financing is required which , in the view of the High Commissioner , must be based on increased funds from the regular budget , expanded partnerships with United Nations agencies and programmes , including UNDP and the World Bank , NGOs and academic institutions , and on a greater contribution by Governments interested in receiving technical assistance .  
Although increased private flows have led to investments in industry and technology in some developing countries and economies in transition , many other developing countries have been left behind , slowing the process of technological change in those countries and limiting their ability to meet their commitments under Agenda 21 and other international agreements .  
To resolve the remaining debt problems of the highly indebted poorest countries , creditor and debtor countries and international financial institutions should continue their efforts to find effective , comprehensive , durable and development-oriented solutions , including such measures as debt reduction , debt swaps , debt cancellation , and increased grants and concessional flows . 
But if the assumption is that the existing level of funding is unlikely to be increased in the years ahead , then the current system is simply not sustainable and we will witness a steady diminution in the support available to each treaty body and in the ability of each to function in a meaningful way .  
Notes with concern that in the current biennium the budgetary resources for technical cooperation in the field of human rights have decreased by half as compared with the previous biennium , and requests the Secretary _ General to allocate to the human rights programme , in the context of the budgetary planning for the biennium 1998 _ 1999 , more human and financial resources for the enlargement of the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights in order to meet the substantially increased demand ;  
Governments have moved to accord high priority to child survival and health ; the work of non-governmental organizations and of the private sector has expanded ; community participation has increased , and families have been empowered by gaining greater knowledge and skills about utilizing low-cost , easily available life-saving technologies for their children ; bilateral and multilateral agencies have mobilized greater resources for child survival and health interventions ; and immunization , nutrition and reproductive health programmes have expanded .  
Loss of experienced personnel and skilled labour , declines in productivity , the need for increased resources to hire and retrain replacements , increased absenteeism and labour turnover , increased health-care costs , coupled with the human and social costs endured by the individuals and communities affected by the pandemic are imposing heavy burdens , particularly on developing countries with limited resources .  
Stresses also in this context the need for various measures by the international community , including increased trade-related technical assistance and human and institutional capacity-building for strengthening the supply capacity of exportable goods and services of developing countries , especially the least developed countries , for their full integration into the world economy ;  
Notes with concern that in the current biennium the budgetary resources for technical cooperation in the field of human rights have decreased by half as compared with the previous biennium , and requests the Secretary _ General to allocate to the human rights programme , in the context of the budgetary planning for the biennium 1998 _ 1999 , more human and financial resources for the enlargement of the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights in order to meet the substantially increased demand ;  
In many ways the performance of the Canadian economy last year was closer to that of western Europe than that of the United States : annual growth averaged some 1.5 per cent , rather less than in 1995 ; relatively weak labour markets and increased taxes held back the growth of personal disposable income , although consumption picked up to a large extent because of a steep fall in the savings ratio ; and business fixed investment is also more concerned with rationalization than expanding capacities .  
However , their situation at the regional , national and local levels has worsened as they confront increased discrimination regarding their economic , social , civil and cultural rights .  
Generally speaking , the capitalist revolution ( free-market reforms and well-conceived and prudently implemented privatization in the post cold war period ) has increased foreign investment , streamlined the public sector and reduced inflation , bringing about a significant level of stability and prosperity .  
The adoption of this theme highlighted the emphasis given by the international community to voluntary repatriation as a durable solution and asserted that a natural extension of this emphasis is the increased importance attached to the prevention of forced displacement .  
In 1995 , the gross domestic product stood at US $ 96 million , while per capita it increased to $ 6,415 .  4 .  The performance of the Turks and Caicos economy in 1995 was characterized by continued rapid growth in tourism , a steady rise in offshore financial services business and an increase in fishing activities , combined with lower inflation rates and a slight reduction in the unemployment rate .  
The above calls for coordination in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies by major industrialized countries to create and sustain conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments and technologies and appropriate knowledge to developing countries , as well as new and additional financial resources .  
As the scale of foreign capital has increased in the financial markets of certain developing countries , these markets have become highly vulnerable to shifts in sentiment among international investors and fund managers , especially since an important part is of a short-term speculative nature .  
The amount of resources potentially available under NAB is roughly $ 47-billion , double the amount that has been available under the General Arrangements to Borrow ( GAB ) , and the number of potential participating countries or monetary authorities with the financial capacity to support the international monetary system has increased to 25 , including a number of developing countries .  
The potential negative effects of trade liberalization on the least developed and net food importing countries should be mitigated by increased financial and technical assistance .  
All of the major developing regions of the world registered significant increases in primary school enrolments , with the combined total reaching some 545-million in 1995 , representing an increase of nearly 50-million in five years , double the pace of expansion during the 1980s .  Since enrolment rates increased faster than population growth , the net enrolment ratios continued to rise in all developing regions .  
Experts identified various global trends in the sector such as increased demand for health care , the phenomenon of consumerism , relative shortage of health personnel in some developed countries , aging population requiring tailor-made products , information / technology revolution , increased mobility of consumers and service providers , and increasing medical costs and decreasing public health care budgets requiring containment of health care costs .  
The importance of the national professional project personnel as the major source of expertise for technical cooperation projects has increased steadily in recent years because of their crucial advantages in transferring national private sector expertise to public institutions , using national talent that could be lost through the brain-drain and cultural compatibility with national work environment .  
The specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , as well as international and regional organizations , should therefore be invited to examine and review conditions in each of the Territories , commensurate with the pressing needs of the peoples concerned for increased transfer of resources , technology and know-how , and take appropriate measures to accelerate economic and social progress .  
Specific objectives are : food security through increased agricultural production , and improvement of nutritional levels and incomes of the poorest rural populations , the landless , marginal farmers , pastoralists , artisanal fishermen , and indigenous peoples ; and , cutting across all categories , poor rural women .  
IFAD 's Technical Assistance Grants Programme for Research and Training is a critical instrument for the pursuit of IFAD \ x { e5b8 } corporate strategy with regard to the development of innovative and effective means to eradicate rural poverty in IFAD \ x { e5b8 } own operations and , through increased policy dialogue and collaborative programming , in the operations of the entire ensemble of the operations of stakeholders in rural development .  
The gap between developed and developing countries points to the continued need for a dynamic and enabling international economic environment supportive of international cooperation , particularly in the fields of finance , technology transfer , debt and trade , if the momentum for global progress towards sustainable development is to be maintained and increased .  
Specifically , we advocate increased official development assistance , more transparent and democratic financial mechanisms , the transfer of suitable and environmentally benign technologies on concessional terms , the reorientation of technical cooperation to respond to the forces of demand in developing countries in such a way as to utilize and build indigenous expertise , the development of human resources and an improvement in the management systems and processes that run our institutions .  
Looking towards the future , he observed that this trend may very well continue but stressed that as intrastate conflicts increased , intensive peacekeeping efforts by the international community would be necessary , followed by long-term programmes to strengthen the foundations of peace .  
It should determine specific measures to foster an enabling international environment conducive to providing developing countries with increased financial and technical assistance , access to financial flows on a predictable and assured basis , increased foreign direct investment and a durable solution to debt problems .  
Convinced also that a year designed to enhance the recognition , facilitation , networking , and promotion of volunteer service , with particular emphasis upon activity at the local level , could make a significant contribution to generating increased awareness of the achievement and the further potential of volunteer service , to encouraging offers of service from a greatly expanded number of individuals , and to channelling resources to enable the even greater effectiveness of such service ,  
The implementation of the programmes as planned requires additional resources , which to an extent the Government of Lebanon has been forthcoming to make available through cost _ sharing ; a similar effort is required through increased mobilization of resources from bilateral donors and international institutions for United Nations system _ supported national programmes . 
The memorandum of understanding has paved the way for increased levels of cooperation , including discussion of possible joint missions to assess and address the needs of separated minors and other groups identified as particularly vulnerable and the establishment of common standards and practices .  
Important results have included increased gender mainstreaming in development programming , increased possibilities for UNDP to be engaged in the development of micro finance sectors as a tool for poverty alleviation , self-employment and social integration of excluded groups , and the broadening of the institutional base for civil society organization cooperation with the United Nations system .  
However , the increased international attention to , and importance of , transparency of transfers and possession of conventional arms are justified by the fact that these conventional arms cause serious human suffering in international and internal conflicts and are not subject to legal regimes in many parts of the world .  
Owing to the increasing globalization of the economy and the interdependence of national economies , the external debt problem must be addressed through a comprehensive , integrated and development-oriented approach , involving an open , rule-based and non-discriminatory international trading system , increased financial flows and increased access to technology .  
SFOR and its Civic Military Cooperation ( CIMIC ) Task Force has increased efforts to work with the Office of the High Representative and the international community on the media problems through several integrated working groups , sharing of resources and coordinated operations to develop means to counter blatant media bias and improve the populace 's ability to have alternative access to information .  
Even though there was a decrease of 1.8 per cent in the overall percentage of promotions of women in posts subject to geographical distribution , the percentage of promotions for women at the D-1 and P-5 levels has increased considerably as compared with the previous year , thus increasing the pool of women eligible for promotion to senior decision-making levels in the near future .  
In closing , she emphasized the important role of the Commission in the years to come , especially with regard to the ongoing and increasing process of globalization driven by increased foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and foreign-portfolio-equity investment flows .  
It has not been satisfied with ruining building sites in the occupied Golan since 1967 , including the liberated town of Quneitra , and established in their stead Israeli settlements whose number has gradually increased and risen to 40 settlements inhabited now by about 17,000 Israeli settlers , while suppression is imposed on building throughout the occupied Syrian villages , with heavy taxes imposed on building , which has resulted in an abnormal rise of building prices which is very onerous to the population . 
The expert group agreed that the problems raised by the imposition of coercive economic measures , including their economic , social , political and legal aspects , deserve increased attention by the international community and multilateral bodies .  
Although no reliable data exist on the prevalence of drug abuse in Afghanistan , anecdotal evidence suggests that it has increased during recent years , which may be explained as a consequence of the hard living conditions caused by a prolonged war , combined with the increasing availability of both opium and heroin .  
One result is that growing attention is being paid at the national level to the need to combine increased contestability with competition policies aimed at preventing market concentration and abuse of dominant positions , and / or with policies directly aimed at improving the competitiveness of domestic enterprises .  
There are no regular standards established to gauge the informal economy , which has increased in all countries , and the illegal or illicit economy , which is based not only on drugs , but on contraband , arms and other categories .  
At the national level , over the past 10 years , his Government had substantially increased domestic resources for development financing , but it continued to need external resources , both private and official , in order to sustain current growth rates .  
The recession had given rise to falling prices of raw materials and basic commodities , increased protectionism by the industrialized countries , the absence of a genuinely free transfer of technology , and a staggering rise in the external debt .  
In order for countries to have a real chance to eradicate poverty , they must achieve sustained economic growth , accompanied by increased public expenditure in the social sector , which could take place only in an expanding national economy .  
The speaker explained that there was an increased level of business risk flowing from increasing levels of environmental legislation and growing public interest in corporate compliance .  
Only effective and increased international cooperation could save developing nations from a deeper crisis and generate sustainable development , thereby enabling them to be true participants in the global partnership for development .  
A stable macroeconomic environment when accompanied by low inflation , competitive exchange rates , manageable public debt , democratic institutions and principles of good governance was conducive to increased domestic and foreign investment .  
For the medium term , his delegation supported calls for the development of a new international financial system based on increased accountability and global governance arrangements that were in keeping with the needs of the current globalized economy .  
His delegation was also deeply concerned about the illegal arms trade carried on by organized criminal groups , which increased the likelihood of international and internal armed conflict and resulted in the destruction of national structures and cultures .  
The international community has paid increased attention to the role that shared democratic values can play in solving major national issues and in improving the international environment .  
The potential use of diamond and DLC films in electronic circuits , where their high thermal conductivity and electrical insulation make them unique , as well as in cutting and grinding tool surfaces has led to increased commercial interest and activity .  
Holders of special procedures mandates have refined their methods of work ; increased the frequency of their country visits ; initiated , in some cases , comprehensive comparative analytical studies ; and developed procedures for handling individual complaints .  
The rise in social spending has encouraged public investment , which increased in 1997 to a level equivalent to 4 per cent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) , which in turn had a positive multiplier effect on other economic activities and on total employment .  
The majority of the reports indicate social / cultural benefits , including active involvement of local communities , increased public awareness , and maintenance of natural heritage and historical sites , as well as cleaner air .  
The Angolan economy continued to show signs of deep stagnation : foreign receipts from oil have been declining , public budget allocations have been revised downward and public domestic debt has increased .  
Their gross domestic product ( GDP ) had been over 5 per cent , inflation had stood at a 50-year low and a larger proportion of the increased capital flows into the region had been made up of foreign direct investment .  
We are particularly concerned that poverty continues unabated ; financial resources have taken a downturn ; the transfer of environmental technologies has not materialized ; human-induced climate change has increased ; trade and investments have become more difficult for developing countries ; and globalization has unleashed new threats to sustainable development .  
First , concerning the relationship between quality and quantity in the services provided by the Department and the resources allotted to its activities in the prevailing critical financial situation , it was evident that given the increased demand for public information the Department could not be expected to continue undertaking further responsibilities without additional resources .  
At the end of 1997 , the total external debt of all the developing countries and economies in transition had increased by 4 per cent compared with 1996 , and the tremendous efforts made by the developing countries to improve their performance had not been matched by international initiatives for debt reduction at the international level .  
To that end , international cooperation would have to be intensified by improving trade relations and access to markets , sharing new technologies , creating a favourable international financial and economic order and allocating increased development resources to developing countries .  
Consequently , there is increased land degradation on steep slopes , shallow coarse soils or volcanic deposits , while rehabilitation work is costly and labour scarce ; dry tropical islands present particular challenges and difficulties ;  
The Committee also recommended that efforts be intensified in order to establish a vigorous plan of increased mobilization of resources directed at the eradication of poverty , economic development , substantial reduction of debt , institution of partnership innovations , market access and trade opportunities , mobilization of domestic resources and allocation of additional resources .  
The concentration of shifting cultivators on a smaller or poorer resource base typically sets in motion a downward spiral of reduced agricultural productivity , increased forest depletion and worsened rural poverty , as cropland fallow periods are shortened and soil fertility declines .  
It was noted that the Working Group , throughout its thirty-first and thirty-second sessions , had experienced manifest difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues that arose from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures .  
Emphasizes that , in developing countries , rural development remains central to efforts to eradicate poverty and that this often includes agrarian reform , investment in infrastructure , extension of rural financial intermediation , measures to ensure food security , the provision of better education , greater utilization of appropriate technology , fair prices to provide incentives for agricultural investment and increased productivity , including productivity in the informal sector ;  
At this juncture , we would be well advised to recognize the increased risk of conflict inherent in the proliferation of high _ technology weapons with considerable aggressive potential if directed against terrestrial or space _ based targets .  
The Commission noted that the Working Group , throughout its thirty-first and thirty-second sessions , had experienced manifest difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues that arose from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures .  
However , their prospects for sustained economic growth and development continued to be dampened by their increased vulnerability to the unfavourable external economic environment , a situation that was even more critical for the least developed countries .  
Mr . Petrella ( Argentina ) , referring to the current international economic crisis , said that the countries most affected by the crisis should understand that the promotion of growth and stability was contingent on the existence of open markets that would allow increased exports , sustained flows of investment capital , the promotion of domestic savings and the continuation of structural reforms .  
These initiatives should run parallel to , and not be regarded as a substitute for , efforts to secure increased ratification and effective implementation of the existing international treaties concerning human rights , including the 1990 Convention on migrants .  
The Special Rapporteur is encouraged to note the passage of the Domestic Violence Act of 1995 , which includes provision for : a new single protection order ; a broadening of the definition of domestic violence to include psychological abuse ; increased penalties for breaches of protection orders ; free legal aid with respect to protection orders ; and new guidelines to ensure the arrest of violent abusers and the automatic revocation of firearms licences .  
The Office 's background investigations of targeted violence further confirmed the observations expressed in my previous report that the nature of violent activity in Kosovo , which has now spread to urban areas , has increased the number of persons who live in fear of being directly affected by violence or arbitrary treatment .  
Since the most recent triennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system , coordination had greatly improved , the resident coordinator system had been strengthened and cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions in such areas as humanitarian assistance , post-conflict peace-building and regional-level operations had increased .  
With regard to the volatility of financial flows , he said that while the amount of those flows to the developing countries had increased from $ 100-billion in 1990 to over $ 250-billion in 1996 , they were composed almost entirely of private capital and were concentrated in a limited number of developing countries .  
Nevertheless , it is evident that the long-term future of the Base will depend not only on the future level of peacekeeping operations ( new , ongoing and liquidating missions ) , but also on the extent to which the Base can be used to manage other assets of the United Nations , the specialized agencies , funds and programmes , as well as the extent to which its potential for training and communications services is increased .  
These activities are expected to contribute to the deepening of the regional cooperation and integration process in Africa , including effective trade liberalization , coordinated and convergent macroeconomic and sectoral policies , and to the promotion of increased investments in infrastructure development in the areas of transport and communication , energy and water and the exploration and exploitation of minerals through enhanced regional cooperation .  
Given the limited staffing capacity of the Service , its operations are more reactive than proactive : a greater focus on Headquarters strategic planning and staff resource management would lead to improved service delivery and increased effectiveness in meeting operational and administrative needs in the field .  
New modular programmes would be introduced to build specific core and managerial competencies and to build requisite skills for managing human and financial resources in a decentralized environment with increased delegation of authority and accountability ;  
There will be increased understanding of crime trends and emerging challenges in crime prevention and criminal justice , improved expertise for Member States to draw upon and enhanced international cooperation in addressing crime prevention and criminal justice concerns that require a concerted international response .  
In addition , in paragraph 25 , the Assembly expressed concern over continued high rates of self-revision during peak workload periods and occasional inadequate translations , which had sometimes hampered the work of delegations , and emphasized the importance of continuous training for all translators at all duty stations and of developing measures to provide translators with increased support from submitting offices and secretariats .  
In view of the substantial withdrawal of MONUA military units and observers , logistical support provided by the Observer Mission to the civilian police component was augmented both in terms of geographical coverage and the increased number of police observers , which reached their authorized strength of 345 by October 1998 .  
Recent cases of international capital flight from developing countries , which have created tremendous strains and increased poverty , have been attributed in part to shortcomings in domestic policies and institutions , for example , but they can also be seen as symptomatic of an international financial system which fails to differentiate satisfactorily the performance of individual developing countries .  
The Commission recognized that setting time-bound goals and targets for expanding employment and reducing unemployment would give a strong signal of the increased priority to be accorded to the objective of full employment . 7 In the past many countries have set targets for the intermediate goals of reduction of inflation or for the rate of economic growth but few set targets for the centrally important goal of employment growth and linked them with strategies for their achievement . 
The economic recovery programme and economic policy measures laid the foundation for accelerated privatization in FRY , opening up of the economy and other measures aimed at increased productivity , starting with improved conditions of business operations and the creation of real possibilities for enterprises to rid themselves of redundant workers , as well as at resolving employment issues and providing for the subsistence of these workers outside enterprises . 
Sudden inflows and equally sudden outflows of foreign capital create considerable difficulties for the management of domestic monetary policy ; 27 the resulting uncertainty and higher risks implied by financial volatility lead to caution on the part of Governments ( which tend to set interest rates higher than they might otherwise have been ) and of private business ( faced with increased costs of capital and increased uncertainty over future demand ) .  
That the rights of the child as laid out in international human rights instruments and international humanitarian law are at their most pertinent in time of armed conflict , expresses grave concern at the numerous damaging effects of armed conflicts on children and emphasizes the need for the world community to focus increased attention on this serious problem with a view to alleviating those effects ;  
Technical and economic cooperation among developing countries ( TCDC / ECDC ) facilitated increased South-South sharing of capacities through the development and dissemination of 250 best practices in good governance , structural adjustment , poverty eradication , micro-financing , maternal mortality , agriculture and food security , science and technology for sustainable human development , job creation and management of the environment and the sustainable development of small island states . 
In addition , the programme , through greater international cooperation and coordination and increased effectiveness of the United Nations human rights machinery , focuses on improving respect for human rights at the national level , the adoption of a comprehensive and integrated United Nations approach to the promotion and protection of human rights and on more efficient methods to prevent human rights violations and remove obstacles to the full realization of human rights .  
That the rights of the child as laid out in international human rights instruments and international humanitarian law are at their most pertinent in time of armed conflict , expresses grave concern at the numerous damaging effects of armed conflicts on children and emphasizes the need for the world community to focus increased attention on this serious problem with a view to alleviating those effects ;  
S &amp; amp ; D treatment could focus on specific features of market access , increased productivity , food security , the need to protect small farmers , the special situations of small island developing countries , landlocked countries , small and vulnerable economies and developing countries with large segments of the population dependent on the agricultural sector for employment .  
The budgets provide for the continued deployment of 1,350 military contingent personnel and 24 police officers , supported by an increased civilian staffing establishment of 114 international staff , 111 local staff and 13 United Nations Volunteers , with provisions for the Missions liquidation reflected in the proposed 1999 / 00 budget .  
For operational reasons , in view of a substantial quantity of military-pattern equipment provided to the MINURCA military contingents by the Government of France as a voluntary contribution in kind , increased provisions are also made for the supply under letter-of-assist arrangements of essential required spare parts and other matriel required to maintain those assets .  
In this regard , progress has been made in many developing countries where public spending on education and health has increased against a background of fiscal adjustment under IMF-supported programmes . 11 At the same time , unproductive public expenditure , such as excessive military spending , should be avoided or reduced ; 
The revised budget for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 is therefore based on the maintenance of 1,350 military contingent personnel , 24 civilian police officers supported by the increased ( from 1 March 1999 ) civilian staffing establishment of 114 international staff , 111 local staff and 13 United Nations Volunteers .  
An increased dialogue among the governing bodies is in response to the need for high-level discussions on policies at the national and global levels , development cooperation , and commitment to issues of common concern such as poverty , financial stability and economic and social sustainability .  
In terms of the increased role of services in the structure of the global economy , he observed that there was enormous development potential and developing countries must secure their place in this growing area .  
Among the core principles of the Africa Partnership are : national commitment and ownership ; political action ; joint national strategic action plans ; mobilization of increased resources ; stronger regional technical platforms for action ; protection of human rights ; compassion and solidarity .  
In terms of the increased role of services in the structure of the global economy , he observed that there was enormous development potential and developing countries must secure their place in this growing area .  
The Commission invited all organizations concerned with aspects of the oceans to consider whether their programmes of work provided sufficient consideration of the potential impact of increased climate variability , and to review what needed to be done to ensure adequate prediction and understanding of the impacts on coastal and marine areas of phenomena such as El Nio .  
A combination of good weather , which led to significant improvements in agricultural output , and an improved policy environment as evidenced , inter alia , by low fiscal deficits and inflation has been responsible for increased economic growth in a number of countries .  
There is a real threat that it may become an epoch in which the unmitigated promotion of increased international trade , investment and finance at the expense of the observance and protection of fundamental human rights and sustainable human development ( SHD ) is adopted as a mantra guiding many Governments and development economists as was amply demonstrated in the MAI process .  
Invited all intergovernmental agencies concerned with aspects of the oceans to consider , within their respective mandates , whether their programmes of work make sufficient allowance for considerations of the potential impact of increased climate variability , and to review through the various coordination arrangements what more needs to be done to ensure adequate understanding of the prediction of coastal and marine impacts of such phenomena as El Nio .  
Net private capital flows to emerging markets in 1999 barely increased from the low levels of 1998 , when flows contracted to less than half of their pre-crisis peak , but have been recovering modestly since mid-1999 . 
It was noted that the Working Group , throughout its thirty-first and thirty-second sessions , had experienced manifest difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues that arose from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures .  
Governments , with the increased participation of the United Nations system , civil society , donors and the private sector , are urged to pursue the research and development of new , safe , low-cost and effective family-planning and contraceptive methods , for both men and women , including female-controlled methods that both protect against sexually transmitted diseases , including HIV / AIDS , and prevent unwanted pregnancy .  
These included universal access to primary education , with special attention to closing the gender gap in primary and secondary school education , wherever it exists ; universal access to primary health care ; universal access to a full range of comprehensive reproductive health-care services , including family planning , as set out in paragraph 7.6 of the Programme of Action ; reductions in infant , child and maternal morbidity and mortality ; and increased life expectancy .  
Governments , with the increased participation of the United Nations system , civil society , donors and the private sector , are urged to pursue the research and development of new , safe , low-cost and effective family-planning and contraceptive methods , for both men and women , including female-controlled methods that both protect against sexually transmitted diseases , including HIV / AIDS , and prevent unwanted pregnancy .  
Whatever the relevance of these measures , it is important to stress that positive results objectives such as improving the living conditions of our peoples and the elimination of poverty in developing countries in general and in African countries in particular can be achieved only if there is an increased mobilization of international financial resources and a substantial alleviation of the crushing debt burden on those countries .  
It is therefore of utmost importance to recognize that responses to those changing circumstances and the achievement of sustainable development and social progress will require increased solidarity and exchange of ideas and information expressed through appropriate multilateral programmes and strengthened international cooperation .  
Decisive action at the national and international levels will determine whether these consequences will be either a downward spiral of increased poverty and environmental degradation or the achievement of sustainable development and improved quality of life for our people .  
While the increased use of advanced electronic communication , including the Internet , was welcomed and supported , views were expressed that , given the level of technological development in developing countries , emphasis should continue to be given to the traditional forms of mass media , including radio , television and print media , in order to reach a wider audience in the developing countries .  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit a report to the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session containing a comprehensive analysis of the organizational structure and technical , personnel and financial resources of the Non-Governmental Organizations Section , commensurate with the increased workload and the level of responsibility , necessary to implement the Secretariats mandate , as contained in Council resolution 1996 / 31 , parts 10 and 11 ;  
Despite the fact that four years have elapsed since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round , however , agricultural support measures in developed countries , which have been instrumental in their increased shares in agricultural exports and had detrimental impacts on developing countries , have not declined .  " Uruguay Round disciplines were not a constraint for most OECD countries . . . since . . . the current Total Aggregate Measure of Support was well below Uruguay Round commitment levels " [ 8 ] .  
The average age for a first marriage is about 29 years for females and 33 years for males , a phenomenon attributable to the higher educational standard attained by both sexes as a result of continuing to study through to the higher stages , as well as to the increased rate of participation by women in economic activity and other social and economic factors ;  
S &amp; amp ; D treatment could focus on specific features of market access , increased productivity , food security , the need to protect small farmers , the special situations of small island developing countries , landlocked countries , small and vulnerable economies and developing countries with large segments of the population dependent on the agricultural sector for employment .  
The increased political and financial support to UPE is a promising sign of greater international and domestic attention to creating a basis for effective recognition of the right to education .  
Although the growing influence of bilateral donors and conditionalities attached to their aid for education have increased the Governments budgetary allocation for primary education , this influence has not encompassed facilitating a translation of Ugandas human rights obligations - including those concerning primary education - into recognized and enforceable rights .  
The Security Council 's increased concern for the plight of civilians in armed conflict has been reinforced by the frequent briefings it has received on the humanitarian situation in countries affected by conflict , and is further illustrated by the establishment by the Council of international ad hoc criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda . 
[ Globalization and in particular financial liberalization , the extent of resources controlled by the private sector and corporate strategies for investment have at the same time far / Globalization greatly increased trade and capital flows , opens new opportunities for sustained economic growth and development of the world economy and also permits countries to share experiences and to learn from one anothers achievements and difficulties .  
The geophysical characteristics of many small islands leave them vulnerable to extreme climatological , seismic and volcanic events , and more critically to periods of drought , low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion and soil erosion , among others , and they require increased attention to watershed management , land and water use planning .  
The combined effects of this and of ongoing armed conflicts and several devastating natural calamities had a disproportionate effect on the most disadvantaged groups of society , also contributing to increased feminization of poverty .  
To meet the challenge , the Secretariat has made concerted efforts to move the discourse from a focus on definitions and prescriptive and value judgements to an emphasis on an increased understanding of the social , economic and cultural processes that affect the institution of the family in the performance of its central and irreducible functions in any society .  
The ninth G15 summit , held in Montego Bay , Jamaica , in February 1999 , had emphasized the need to find appropriate solutions to the financial crisis , which had had widespread negative economic and social consequences and had increased unemployment and poverty .  
Since landlocked developing countries were among the poorest countries in their particular geographical regions , and in addition to being landlocked most of them suffered from all the extreme handicaps of least developed countries , it was therefore important that financial assistance to landlocked developing countries be extended on the most concessional terms possible and that the flow of financial and technical assistance be prioritized and substantially increased .  
There can be little question that the increased interdependence of developed and developing countries has made trade and finance two key areas in which the introduction of coherent and complementary policies can help to achieve the maximum benefits of global growth and development .  
The project is being extended to 2001 to accommodate the increased demand for legislative assistance as a result of a comprehensive review by the Governments of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the newly independent States of their nuclear legislation and regulations , including non-proliferation and physical protection of nuclear material and facilities .  
Considerable advances have been achieved in the last five decades in social and economic development , including disease eradication , massive immunization programmes , improved agricultural productivity , increased adult literacy rates , improved sanitation and water systems , and technological advances for production and communication .

Since landlocked developing countries were among the poorest countries in their particular geographical regions , and in addition to being landlocked most of them suffered from all the extreme handicaps of the least developed countries , it was therefore important that financial assistance be extended to them on the most concessional terms possible and that the flow of financial and technical assistance be prioritized and increased substantially .  
Some of them emphasize the increased mobility of factors of production , goods and services across borders and the resultant emergence of a truly global market , others see primarily the results and future potential of an explosive progress in information technology , while still others view globalization primarily from societal and cultural perspectives .  
It provides such channels as absence of currency controls at borders ; increased and instant capital flows at the international level , making it difficult to isolate suspicious transactions ; dollarization of economies , thereby facilitating the circulation of dirty cash ; and a multiplication of the development of offshore financial services to attract foreign investments .  
Notes with appreciation the efforts of those Governments that have maintained , maintained at a high level or increased their contributions to UNDP , and encourages all Governments in a position to do so to increase their contributions and / or meet their existing commitments to UNDP and to help to put UNDP funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis and to reach the annual funding target of $ 1.1-billion ;  
In addition to the increased security and political measures taken by the international community , it is the establishment of the Kosovo Transitional Council and the active involvement , on a consultative basis , of political and local leaders in the executive functions of UNMIK that is expected to provide the most important confidence-building mechanism in the medium term for the improvement of the overall situation in Kosovo . 
This is true both because of the increased demand that we do something when gross and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law occur , and also because the new international security environment makes it more feasible to do so .  
During this time of increased calls for international resources for Kosovo and other parts of the world , when donor fatigue for Bosnia and Herzegovina is very real , the continued unwillingness of substantial parts of the local leadership to create conditions conducive to returns and to the integral implementation of the Dayton peace agreement can not be tolerated . 
Measures which should be taken to ensure the right to health are understood to be effective administration of available resources to improve health , establishment of health policies with an emphasis on prevention , increased primary health care , special attention to the health needs of the most vulnerable and free health care for the most economically disadvantaged .  
With regard to the indirect effects of economic sanctions , among the most visible and tangible signs of their adverse impact on the economies of so-called third countries are foregone tax and tariff revenues , job losses among both blue-collar and white-collar employees and , as a result , declining living standards among working people and increased social expenditures .  
It was noted that the Working Group , throughout its thirty-first and thirty-second sessions , had experienced manifest difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues that arose from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures .  
The annual summary of the economic and social situation in Africa submitted this year to the Economic and Social Council put the figure for gross domestic product growth in 1998 at 3.3 per cent , up from 2.9 per cent in 1997 , the highest growth rate of any region in the world ; it reported that the 33 African least developed countries increased their growth rate from 2.4 per cent in 1997 to 4.1 per cent in 1998 . 
The negative connotation often attached to trade liberalization , in view of its risks for employment and incomes during transition , calls for increased international assistance and improved remedies and the continuous monitoring of the developmental impact of multilateral trade agreements .  
While welcoming the Government 's proposed modest increase in the target caloric value of the food basket to 2,200 kilocalories per person per day , in view of the additional funds available , the Secretary-General recommends that the caloric value of the food basket should be increased at the minimum to 2,300 kilocalories per person per day country-wide , which was the level approved for the enhanced distribution plan for phase IV ( S / 1998 / 446 ) .  
Stability and efficiency of the national as well as regional financial markets , increased domestic savings and optimal allocation of resources are a sound basis for sustainable economic growth .  
In this context , increased win-win research into the potential to yield both direct economic benefits and positive environmental results for developing countries would be of specific importance .  
In order to carry out those difficult but necessary changes , Africa needed the international communitys support , including increased financial and humanitarian assistance , contributions to peacekeeping efforts , reduction of the debt burden , better access to export markets and incentives for foreign direct investment .  
With consistently negative economic growth and development indicators , the African countries needed an international economic and financial climate that promoted fair trade ; increased market access for African products ; stimulated net capital inflows and , above all , gave globalization a human face .  
Many developing-country speakers stressed that the vulnerability of developing countries to external shocks , particularly to swings in commodity prices , volatility in international capital flows , and financial contagion , had increased as a result of greater global integration .  
The international business community must become more actively involved in poverty reduction efforts through increased foreign direct investment ( FDI ) to developing countries , particularly the least developed countries in sub-Saharan Africa ; the prevention of systemic capital market instability ; the development of ethical trade and business principles ; and practices that were in conformity with the standards of the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) .  
Welcomes the increased cooperation between the Agency and international and regional organizations , States and relevant agencies and non-governmental organizations , which is essential to enhancing the contributions of the Agency towards improved conditions for the refugees and thereby the social stability of the occupied territory ;  
Experience with vehicles maintained and repaired at the local garages has shown that , during the initial years , when only 39 vehicles were operating in Arusha , work on the vehicles was executed more rapidly than in recent years when the fleet size significantly increased .  
National , regional and international efforts to find solutions to economic and social problems and to resolve conflicts must be increased if women were to be effectively involved in sustainable national development .  
His delegation stood behind the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States and recognized the many pressing issues that bore upon the small island States progress towards sustainable development , including the public health and economic effects of global warming , the conservation of fish stocks and the strain that increased tourism placed on local infrastructure .  
Welcomes the increased cooperation between the Agency and international and regional organizations , States and relevant agencies and non-governmental organizations , which is essential to enhancing the contributions of the Agency towards improved conditions for the refugees and thereby the social stability of the occupied territory ;  
Mr . Leiro ( Norway ) said that the assumption that globalization benefited everyone had yet to be proven ; the gap between rich and poor was growing both within and between nations and many poor countries attracted minimal foreign investment , lacked a dynamic private sector and were often deprived of the benefits of increased export earnings by heavy debt burdens and limited market access . 
After a further massive loss of human lives , increased suffering of the civilian population and immense physical destruction , the two sides found themselves roughly at the same positions they held in late 1998 .  
This early positioning for political advantage has taken place in a worsening political climate marked by increased polarization and intolerance , a rise in reports of threats and of acts of intimidation and harassment and continuing mutual mistrust between the political actors and between the latter and the Government , as well as repeated outbreaks of street violence , some undoubtedly politically motivated .  
It was noted that the Working Group , throughout its thirty-first and thirty-second sessions , had experienced manifest difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues that arose from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures .  
In a pessimistic scenario , increased pressure for an expanded role would undercut the WTOs already precarious level of political support , threatening existing international openness .  
The Registrys requirements for contractual services are estimated at $ 19,649,200 , reflecting an increase of $ 1,005,900 , owing to the revised detainee service agreements , the commencement of French verbatim reporting by an institutional contractor and increased requirements for contractual translation to meet urgent requirements caused by trial and appeal activities ( see A / 54 / 518 , para .  54 ) .  
Notes , in particular , Governing Council decision 20 / 31 of 4 February 1999 , entitled Proposed programme budget of the United Nations Environment Programme : revised requirements for the biennium 1998-1999 and proposed requirements for the biennium 2000-2001 , which gives concrete support to the integrated work programme of the Programme and endorsement of its new functional organizational structure , and anticipates an increased level of funding to the Environment Fund for the biennium 2000-2001 ;  
To encourage and persuade other States Parties and financial institutions to join them in the transfer of technology and increased technical cooperation by providing more training programmes and modern equipment to developing countries in order to assist them in achieving the objectives of this Convention . 3 .  These measures shall be without prejudice to existing foreign investment commitments or to other financial cooperation arrangements at the bilateral , regional or international level .  
So , references to wider macroeconomic concerns , i.e . debt relief and calls for increased official development assistance ( ODA ) levels by developed countries should be balanced by acknowledgement of the primary duty of all States to provide the conditions for the realization of the right to development , via good governance and the effective use of existing resources .  
Export subsidies should be outlawed , domestic producer subsidies reduced , access under tariff quotas increased , tariff escalation on processed agricultural products removed , and the level and the dispersion of bound tariffs on agricultural imports reduced .  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies in the last few years , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , in particular of civilians , the suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , in particular those of developing countries ,  
Calls for increased international cooperation to address the challenges of globalization through the enhanced participation of developing countries in the international economic policy decision-making process ; integrated consideration of trade , finance , technology transfer and development issues by the relevant international institutions ; and continuation of a wide range of reforms of the international financial system ;  
The matter of displaced persons and refugees could be settled only with the participation of the international community as a whole in establishing plans for integrated economic and social development through increased financial and technical cooperation .  
Other benefits , such as enhanced civic vitality , increased social solidarity and improved feelings of public safety , are important but are rarely measured in typical , empirical evaluation studies .  
Humanitarian agencies fear increased suffering of the most vulnerable , particularly refugees , internationally displaced persons , the disabled , children , the chronically ill , urban elderly and social cases .  
In view of the serious financial implications of the increased and unprecedented number of ex post facto presentations by field missions , regional economic commissions and international criminal tribunals to their respective local Committees on Contracts , and , when required , to the Headquarters Committee on Contracts ( " the Committee " ) , and in order to ameliorate the adverse consequences of this improper practice , the following provisions should be implemented immediately :  
Calculate the revised net base floor salaries at the dependency and single rates at each grade and step by increasing the corresponding net salaries from the existing scale by a predetermined percentage by which the existing base floor salary scale is to be increased .  
In addition , the programme , through greater international cooperation and coordination and increased effectiveness of the United Nations human rights machinery , focuses on improving respect for human rights at the national level , the adoption of a comprehensive and integrated United Nations approach to the promotion and protection of human rights and on more efficient methods to prevent human rights violations and remove obstacles to the full realization of human rights . 
The State of Bahrain is pleased and willing to contribute to international efforts aimed at achieving increased international economic cooperation , due to its stability and strategic location , and the trade and investment environment it enjoys elements that have helped it attract foreign capital and enhance its standing as an advanced financial and commercial centre .  
Equally important , they must promote and incorporate policies for universal access to basic and primary education , improved literacy , increased life expectancy , reduced infant and maternal mortality rates and the achievement of levels of health that lead to socially and economically productive lives .  
In order to meet the requirements of domestic resource mobilization to strengthen the fragile economies in Africa and reduce poverty there , current levels of external funding sources , such as official development assistance and foreign direct investment , need to be increased .  
In this connection , improved terms of trade , access to international markets , increased direct foreign investments , alleviation of the external debt burden and an expanded resource base are some of the crucial issues that have to be seriously considered .  
To this must be added the growing number of hotbeds of tension and conflict between and within States , the growing risk of outbreaks of ethnic , tribal and sectarian conflicts , greater risks of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , especially nuclear weapons , increased stockpiles of conventional weapons and the growth of terrorism as an international phenomenon that threatens democracy , human rights and international peace and security .  
The declared objective of the Convention is the achievement and preservation worldwide of a high level of nuclear safety through increased implementation of national measures and international cooperation .  
In Syria we look forward to a Middle East region where a just , lasting and comprehensive peace prevails , a peace based on international legality , not on expansion , occupation and the monopoly of nuclear military power , which can only lead to increased tension in the Middle East .  
The economic and political developments in international relations ; the far-reaching changes that have taken place , particularly in the wake of the end of the cold war ; and the accession of many new States to the membership of the United Nations all have made it imperative that the Security Council be reformed , its membership increased and its methods of work and activities made more effective in the discharge of the mandate entrusted to it by the Charter of the United Nations .  
Women are occupying more important positions in everyday life , and the numbers of women participating in all economic , cultural , political , social and intellectual activities has increased significantly .  
Initiatives in this area include safe delivery and neo-natal assistance , cervical and breast cancer prevention , voluntary access to contraceptive methods , regulation of surgical male and female sterilization , assistance within the public health system for legal abortion and adequate treatment of incomplete abortion.The number of free pre-natal care visits in Brazil increased almost threefold in the last four years .  
The problem of HIV AIDS is of prime importance in the policy of the Government of Honduras , and the focus of reproductive rights and of attention to priority vulnerable population groups is therefore principally on promoting low-risk behaviour , through a sustained and systematic information and education campaign , and through increased medical , counselling , hospital and laboratory services for sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS .  
The geophysical characteristics of many small islands leave them vulnerable to extreme climatological , seismic and volcanic events , and more critically to periods of drought , low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion and soil erosion , among others , and they require increased attention to watershed management , land and water use planning .  
Invites all intergovernmental agencies concerned with aspects of the oceans to consider , within their respective mandates , whether their programmes of work make sufficient allowance for considerations of the potential impact of increased climate variability , and to review through the various coordination arrangements what more needs to be done to ensure adequate understanding of the prediction and coastal and marine impacts of such phenomena as the El Nio phenomenon .  
Referring to the numerous calls by the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights for increased collaboration in the field of human rights among United Nations organs , specialized agencies and the various parts of the Secretariat , Mr . Alston stressed the need to build up a genuine partnership aiming at realizing the right to education as embodied in articles 13 and 14 of the Covenant . This applied equally to the various treaty bodies . 
Recommends that , given the extent of the burgeoning energy demand and the financial constraints in developing countries , partnerships and collaboration on renewable as well as on conventional sources of energy , such as those envisaged in the clean development mechanism and the joint implementation arrangements envisioned in the context of the Kyoto Protocol8 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , 9 should be increased in order to :  
To the contrary , tensions have increased in many parts of the world and have intensified human suffering because of a resurgence of the arms race with the attendant death , exodus , ethnic cleansing and famine .  
These achievements have been made more appreciable through the promotion of social dialogue following the signing of the agreement of 1 August 1996 by the Government and the social partners , the revitalization of the consultative process , and the gradual emancipation of civil society and its increased involvement in economic , social and cultural development .  
The Commission had expressed its appreciation for the work accomplished by the Working Group in its preparation of draft uniform rules on electronic signatures , and at the same time had noted that the Working Group had experienced difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues arising from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures , and on how those issues might be addressed in an internationally acceptable legal framework .  
The period marked increased collaboration between ICMC and several Council agencies , particularly those that extended funding for its actions in favour of persons uprooted or forced into flight because of war and conflict , racial or ethnic persecution , human rights violations , and environmental degradation.The ICMC programmes supported by Council agencies included : 
The Guidelines follow three broad and interconnected approaches , namely ( a ) improvement of governmental capacity for acknowledging the Governments responsibility for multisectoral coordination ; ( b ) widespread reform of laws and legal support services with a focus on the status of women , children and vulnerable groups ; and ( c ) support for increased private sector and community participation in the response to HIV AIDS .  
At a time when ways and means were being studied to better coordinate and strengthen the special procedures system , Malaysia , although it recognized the importance of preserving the systems independence and impartiality , stressed that the human rights mechanisms needed to be adjusted and rationalized , that their effectiveness must be increased in order to improve their credibility and that their objectives must be made clear .  
Where backward linkages between tourism and other sectors of the economy are weak or absent , income and employment multipliers from tourism are lower because the potential stimulus to indirect spending is dissipated by increased imports rather than domestic production , as happens with many small island developing States .  
Accordingly , it would appear timely to convene a meeting between government officials and representatives of the international community for the purpose of devising a common strategy for addressing not only the present , and very pressing , needs of the internally displaced for continued humanitarian assistance , but also their own expressed desire to become more self-reliant through increased access to opportunities for employment and other means of income-generation .  
Regrettably , it was observed , some of the psycho-social programmes established in the past had separated children from the community and had been designed in such a way that they actually increased the level of trauma and anxiety experienced by the intended beneficiaries .  
Providing increased financial and technical assistance to small island developing States for building human resource and institutional capacity at the national and regional levels ;  
In absolute terms , the use of modern renewable energy technology has increased , particularly solar PV systems , enabling households in small remote villages to operate a few electric lights and small appliances , such as televisions and video cassette recorders , small medical refrigerators , telecommunication equipment and water pumps .  
Currently , very few if any renewable energy sources are being developed on a commercial basis in small island developing States , and if the increased use of solar PV systems continues to depend on public funding and external assistance , effective institutional approaches must be developed . 
The interdependence in which SMEs were supposed to live was fraught with increased complexity and risks of instability and marginalization.For many African SMEs , the opportunities created by technological advances , the increased mobility of production factors and regional trading arrangements were either still nominal or not fully accessible . 
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in the last few years , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , in particular those of developing countries ,  
Under the new article , if the active subject engages in such conduct habitually ; abuses trust or authority ; uses deception , violence or intimidation ; is an older or younger relative , husband , brother , guardian , caregiver or person responsible for the upbringing of the victim ; or if the victim is a minor , the prison sentence is increased from the maximum medium term ( 5 years ) to any of the longer terms ( 5 years and 1 day to 20 years ) imposed by article 367 .  
In 1995 , Act No . 19 , 381 was published ; the Act increased some of the entitlements for male and female participants and regulated such areas as the authority of the Superintendency ; participants right to claim any surplus between their legal contribution and the cost of their agreed health plans ; increased access of participants to information ; regulation of coverage limits ; and exclusions .  
The action to be taken by Governments includes a range of practical and systematic measures directed at the full implementation of human rights instruments , the promotion of human rights education , the creation of national institutions for promoting women ' s rights , the promotion of the human rights of indigenous women , and the adoption of strategies for the mainstreaming of gender perspectives through increased and strengthened efforts and cooperation .  
Parts of the region are also concerned about increased mineral loading in marine estuaries from upstream , intensive paddy cultivation and the conversion of intertidal zones ( i.e . , salt marsh and mangrove ) to rice paddy .  
an increased commitment by Governments at the national and local levels , and their partners in civil society , to guide public and private investments for the provision of adequate shelter , basic infrastructure and services ;  
The development of more cost-effective mapping procedures based on satellite data will surely result in increased use of remote sensing data and consequently expand the market for such data , enabling developing countries to collect and update basic information on the topographic and thematic ( natural resource ) cartography of their territories .  
Bangladesh commended the Secretary-General for highlighting the plight of women in rural areas , women migrant workers and girls affected by traditional and customary practices , and agreed that the effects of globalization and liberalization , along with declining international cooperation , had resulted in the increased marginalization of rural women throughout the developing world .  
In the current economic circumstances , as world poverty increased , the threshold got closer and closer to the poverty level instead of reflecting the average distance between rich and poor .  
Governments , with the increased participation of the United Nations system , civil society , donors and the private sector , are urged to pursue the research and development of new , safe , low-cost and effective family-planning and contraceptive methods , for both men and women , including female-controlled methods that both protect against sexually transmitted diseases , including HIV AIDS , and prevent unwanted pregnancy .  
The Commission had stressed the need for promoting increased transparency and appropriate accountability for the implementation of sound national and corporate development policies , which enhance a country ' s abilities to reduce vulnerability to external shocks and volatile flows of short-term capital . 
First , countries which possessed space technology tended to monopolize the exploration and use of outer space for their own benefit while developing countries such as his own faced serious constraints which aggravated their poor economic situation and increased their debt .  
China therefore opposed any monopoly or militarization of outer space and favoured increased international cooperation in outer space based on peaceful uses , equality , mutual benefit , mutual learning and shared development .  
However , taking into consideration the unsatisfactory nutritional situation in Iraq and the necessity to provide a full food basket on a monthly basis , I have recommended to the Government of Iraq that the caloric value of the food basket should be increased to at least 2 , 300 kilocalories per person per day throughout the country ( see S 1999-1053 , annex I ) , which was the level approved for the enhanced distribution plan for phase IV ( see S 1998-446 ) .  
We emphasize that , in addition to the direct impact on the physical infrastructure of the health , education , housing and human settlements sectors , one of the principal effects of natures ravages on the population is their increased vulnerability to disease and the deterioration of nutritional and food security ; it is therefore essential to give priority to these aspects on the regional integration agenda .  
While there had been a significant strengthening of civil and political rights and fundamental freedoms , there had been no real progress in economic , cultural and social rights , which had even regressed because of the introduction of costly structural adjustments that had led to increased poverty , wider income gaps , reduced social security systems and increasing unemployment .  
Calls for increased international cooperation to address the challenges of globalization through the enhanced participation of developing countries in the international economic policy decision-making process ; integrated consideration of trade , finance , technology transfer and development issues by the relevant international institutions ; and the continuation of a wide range of reforms of the international financial system ;  
Decentralization of authority and decision-making should be encouraged ; as decentralization proceeds , there is a need to increase local capacities ; policies are needed to promote economic empowerment , enhanced civil participation and increased human resources at the local or community level ; there is a compelling need to evaluate services on the basis of data received from service users at the community level ;  
The drop in aid contributions , especially the continuing decline in the share of net official development assistance in the gross domestic product of donor countries , had led to increased reliance on private loans on the international capital market .  
Goals and targets agreed upon by the international community in relation to sustainable development , such as the adoption of national sustainable development strategies and increased support to developing countries , must be implemented in a timely fashion .  
The fact that the number of people worldwide living in abject poverty has increased is a clear signal of the imbalances and bias in the current global financial and trading system .  
This decentralized form of government has increased administration at the local level and proved to be the ideal way to ensure political participation from the grassroots to the uppermost levels .  
After a further massive loss of human lives , increased suffering of the civilian population and immense physical destruction , the two sides found themselves roughly in the same positions they held in late 1998 .  
After a further massive loss of human lives , increased suffering of the civilian population and immense physical destruction , the two sides found themselves roughly in the same positions they held in late 1998 .  
While the need for increased foreign direct investment remains paramount , we also wish to point out that our developed partners should continue to assist us and reverse the current trend of the decline in official development assistance .  
In light of increased demand for urban and related infrastructure developments , Luxembourg has developed regional and national land management planning schemes so as to set aside land for the exclusive use of agricultural production .  
Export subsidies should be outlawed , domestic producer subsidies reduced , access under tariff quotas increased , tariff escalation on processed agricultural products removed , and the level and dispersion of bound tariffs on agricultural imports reduced .  
A major part of the worlds population still faced intolerable living conditions , which were further aggravated by the rapid pace of urbanization , increased poverty and the negative effects of globalization .  
It was agreed that the organization should enhance its capacity to predict and respond to a changing global environment , marked by increased frequency and intensity of civil strife , armed conflict and natural disasters .  
Had these assets been freely available , they might have made a major contribution to the economic and social development process and it is possible that they might have increased more than twofold by contributing to gross domestic product .  
Economic globalization and increased international competition force governments to reconsider other national economic policies , beyond specific changes in tax and social policies , in order to strengthen their relative position in the global economic system .  
The need to support increased participation of civil society in national and international policy and project development through the rule of law and democratic , participatory and transparent decisionmaking was expressed .  
Small island developing States on their own are simply unable to shoulder the vast responsibility that falls upon them the guardianship of the essential global public goods , without increased support from the international community .  
These options could further include voluntary measures regarding weaponsusable fissile material related to military inventories with a view to achieving increased transparency , which could prepare the ground for ultimately agreed irreversible net reductions .  
The resultant increased political commitment to an enhanced regular resource base for UNDP was reflected during the April 2000 meeting , when 18 countries pledged higher level contributions for 2000 , including nine OECD / DAC donors and 10 programme countries .  
There were tangible improvements in 1999 : wages in the public sector increased by 50 per cent ; scholarships were doubled ; pensions were indexed on a permanent basis and now almost equal the minimum standard of living .  
With the increased flow of private capital for energy financing to the developing countries , the multilateral institutions have focused more on technical , policy and institutional assistance than on direct lending in the liberalized energy market .  
Fourthly , official development assistance targets must be fulfilled , with special attention to the least developed countries and to effective implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative aimed at ensuring increased resources for social development .  
Given the limited size of the domestic market and the unstable conditions of the international market , the major difficulty faced by Viet Nams agricultural sector is to find markets for its increased production .  
The negative effects resulted mainly from the increased dominant or monopoly power of the merged firm , and this made competition between large multinational corporations and companies of developing countries ever more difficult .  
The negative effects resulted mainly from the increased dominant or monopoly power of the merged firm , and this made competition between large multinational corporations and companies of developing countries ever more difficult .

Warnings of bad weather and natural disasters to remote areas and ships : satellite telecommunications offer increased reliability compared to the standard terrestrial maritime communications facilities that were used in the past ;  
In short , increased responsibility in the arena of selfgovernance is linked to mature political and civic behaviour , which is not demonstrated by these violent acts .  
The benefits derived from the mobilization of scarce financial resources via international capital flowing to the most productive uses have contributed to economic growth and increased standards of living in all regions of the world .  
The view was expressed that the consideration of this regular item represented an innovation that had opened the door for an increased interest in the work of the Subcommittee of international organizations engaged in space activities and their active contribution to the progressive development of space law .  
Noting the concern and apprehension of the partners of the International Coral Reef Initiative that the extensive evidence that coral reef ecosystems continue to be damaged or severely degraded as the result of both direct human activities and global climate change as witnessed by the increased global incidence of episodes of coral bleaching since its twentieth session ,  
Second , Jamaica supports the steps proposed by the Secretary-General to enhance his traditional preventive role with respect to : the increased use of United Nations interdisciplinary fact-finding and confidence-building missions ; to develop regional prevention strategies with regional partners and appropriate United Nations organs and agencies , including the possibility of establishing liaison offices with regional organizations ; to use eminent persons for advice and action in support of preventing and resolving armed conflicts ; and to improve the capacity and resource base for preventive action in the Secretariat .  
In its presidential statement on peace-building , adopted last February , the Council also reiterated that efforts to ensure lasting solutions to conflicts and to maintain the momentum for peace in any given country or region require increased solidarity , sustained political will and timely and adequate resources on the part of the international community .  
However , they will not be regarded as a process of development , as objects of claim , as human rights , so long as they are attended by increased inequalities or disparities and rising concentrations of wealth and economic power , and without any improvement in indicators of social development , education , health , gender balance and environmental protection and , what is most important , if they are associated with any violation of civil and political rights .  
Individuals living in the contaminated areas showed increased morbidity due to diseases of the endocrine , circulatory and digestive systems , as well as a higher rate of mental disorders , but it was difficult to interpret those results .  
The statement provided an opportunity to recall the inclusive and broad-based process through which the Principles were developed , their basis in existing international human rights and humanitarian law and refugee law by analogy , and to inform delegates of the ways in which the Principles were proving valuable to international organizations , NGOs , displaced communities and also to Governments . 23 .  As a sign of the increased and welcome emphasis on internal displacement , a panel discussion on the issue was convened during the Segment , moderated by the Emergency Relief Coordinator a.i .  
In order to extricate the continent from its deep-rooted socioeconomic problems , domestic policy reforms had to be accompanied by concerted action at the global level , including measures designed to achieve an expeditious resolution of the debt crisis , enhanced productive capacity , improved and expanded market access , increased official development assistance and a more generous transfer of technology .
