At present , we must further straighten the guiding thought in science and technological training of troops , conscientiously do a good job of making plans , set hierarchies rationally , handle the relationship between common and individual characteristics correctly , as well as strengthen planning guidance and training management .

Practice over the past five years has proved clearly that President Jiang 's eight-point proposal is a powerful weapon for opposing attempts to split the motherland and for crushing forces advocating " Taiwan independence " ; a banner for uniting all the descendants of the Chinese nation both at home and abroad , who have an ardent wish for a national rejuvenation , to make a common effort for the reunification of their country ; and a rational and pragmatic way for bringing about stable growth in cross-strait relations .  
We hold that , as to the current operating state of the Chinese national economy , there is no need to over-debate the meaning of deflation , because these three versions have a common economic focus , or that China 's overall prices have been in a sustained falling trend for over two years since October 1997 .  
He said : Practice has proved that the establishment of a strategic cooperative partnership between China and Russia is indeed a wise choice of historical significance [ li shi xing de zheng que jue ze 2980-0670-1840-4104-2973-4292-2115-2344 ] .  In the new millennium and the new century , the two sides should take a long view and become good neighbors , good partners , and good friends who trust each other , engage in cooperation , and pursue common development .  
Meanwhile , they are also conducive to enhancing understanding , expanding common understanding , turning the party and government policies and principles into the majority of people 's conscious action , discovering and pooling the wisdom and experience of the masses , relying on the people to tide over difficulties and resolve problems , harmonizing the relationship in distribution of interests , eliminating social contradictions , and safeguarding and developing the political situation featured by unity and stability .  
Since the beginning of reform and opening up , China has persistently followed the principle of national unity and common development and properly handled the relations among reform , development , and stability , thus ensuring the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy and the noticeable improvement of the people 's living standards .  
Speaking about the two main themes of " unity and democracy , " Li Ruihuan said being the most extensive patriotic united front organization , the CPPCC should hold high the banner of unity , and pull together people of different parties , different social strata , different ethnic groups and different religious beliefs through seeking common ground while reserving differences , understanding , magnanimity , coordinating relations , and resolving contradictions .  
Thanks to the achievements of modern science and technology , modern people enjoy a higher level of living standard .  Rapid progress has also been made in medical science .

The decision is of great significance to expand domestic demand and bring about sustained growth of national economy , to promote coordinated economic development in all regions and eventually achieve a common prosperity , and to strengthen ethnic unity , maintain social stability and fortify border defense .  
The ideal and belief education should be taken as a key point of in-depth education in Deng Xiaoping Theory . Through such education , people should profoundly understand that communism and socialism is a just , inevitable , and arduous cause , understand that the cause of communism and socialism is noble and beautiful .  The people should be guided to integrate their personal values with socialist values and integrate the lofty ideal with the objectives of the struggle in the current stage , and dedicate themselves to the common ideal of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Deputy Li Changchun said : The policy decision on western development reflects Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's thinking of " two overall situations , " and is of extremely important significance to expanding domestic demand , precipitating the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy , promoting the coordinated economic development of various regions to ultimately achieve common prosperity , intensifying national unity , maintaining social stability , and solidifying national defense .

I believe that a healthy , stable , and friendly relationship between China and India is in the common interests of the peoples of the two countries and is also conducive to the global peace and stability .  The Sino-Indian friendship , diligently cultivated by the leaders of the two countries , will certainly continue advancing forward in the new century .  
We are glad to see the smooth progress made in the relations between the two parties and two countries since the normalization of Vietnamese-Chinese ties .  In particular , the framework of a " comprehensive and cooperative relationship based on good-neighborliness and friendship and oriented toward the 21st century " between Vietnam and China agreed upon by the leaders of both countries a year ago is completely in keeping with the fundamental interests of both countries and the common aspirations of the two peoples .  
Jiang Zemin indicated : Both China and Vietnam are socialist countries under the leadership of the communist party .  In the face of the present complicated and changeable international situation , we two countries should seize the current favorable opportunity , meet the challenges head-on , step up cooperation , and strive for common development .  
We have attached great importance to developing good neighborly and friendly relations , as well as relations of all-round cooperation , with Vietnam ; and are willing to make common efforts with Vietnam 's new leading collective in opening up a brighter future prospect for the relations between our two parties and two countries .

For many years we have worked hard to put into practice Deng Xiaoping 's thinking of common prosperity .  Having gained a certain economic strength , we began to carry out the " project of common prosperity " and , relying mainly upon the financial departments at the city level for many consecutive years , raised funds totaling 1.88-billion yuan and put them into the relatively backward areas of the city in a bid to improve their infrastructure facilities , industrial layout , and cultural and educational conditions , thereby bringing about the coordinated development of various localities .  
The people from the eastern , central , and western regions have reached a consensus : The grand western development is not only a historical turning point for the people of the western region to rouse themselves to catch up with the developed region and narrow the gap between them , but also a huge space for the eastern region to further its prosperity and development .  It is a common opportunity for both the eastern and western regions in China .  
She even brazenly denied the common knowledge , universally recognized by the international community and known even to women and children , that Taiwan has been Chinese territory since ancient times , and is still talking about seeking " substantive diplomacy " in the " joint rule of two sexes . "  Is she not asking the people of Taiwan to ride a horse blindfolded and approach the deep pond in the middle of the night ?  
Whether it is in terms of blood relationship and geographical ties , or tradition or culture , the two sides of the strait are an inseparable entity , which has been universally recognized by the international community and a common understanding of all the Chinese descendants at home and abroad .  
It is necessary to reiterate time and again and earnestly put into practice the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , persistent peaceful settlement of international disputes , sovereign equality of all countries , respect for the national conditions of countries , seeking common ground while shelving differences , and the principle of closer mutually-beneficial cooperation for common development .

Marx pointed out in " Critique of the Gotha Program " that in future society , some of total social output should be set aside for replenishing exhausted means of production , for expanding reproduction , for common needs such as ordinary management expenses , schools , and public health facilities , and for use as reserve or guarantee funds for dealing with unfortunate accidents and natural disasters , and for establishing a fund for people who have lost their laboring ability , and so on .

Jiang Zemin said : China and Turkey are located respectively at the eastern and western ends of the Asian continent , and Turkey links the Asian and European continents .

After the Cold War , peace and development have become major topics that are of common concern to peoples of all nations in the world .  In this situation , Japan has not made more contributions to world peace and development , but has instead used all its armed might to indulge in wars of aggression , expanded its armament without restraint , and attempted to elevate its international status and political and economic interests as a military power .  This obviously runs counter to the historical trend .  
Today , with the reforms and opening to the outside , only when leading cadres at all levels possess noble values , strive to become pure people , noble people , people detached from base interests , people benefiting the people , thinking what the masses think , feeling the anxiety of the masses , suffering first , enjoying later , content to live an austere life , and having far-reaching ambitions , can they unite and lead the masses to approach common prosperity sooner .

Thus , greater enthusiasm , initiative , and creativity will burst forth among our people in their joint struggle for building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
In taking the lead in implementing the important concept of " three represents , " leading cadres should , above all , have firm ideals and convictions and take realizing the common ideal of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and achieving the long-term , grand communist goal as their unchangeable lifelong conviction and pursuance .

[ Wu Yuliang ] Since the beginning of reform and opening-up , our party has set forth the principle of taking public ownership as the main body and promoting common development of multiple economic elements .  This is determined by the basic national conditions of our country at the initial stage of socialism .  
Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , we have been implementing an economic system that takes public ownership as the mainstay and encourages common development of multiple economic sectors .  We have broken down the unitary system of ownership by the whole people under the traditional planned economic system .  This has given rise to an economic situation characterized by the common development of different economic sectors amid competition , including state-owned economy , collective economy , individual economy , private economy and foreign businessmen 's economy .  
Meticulously studying and understanding Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important directive combined with closely adhering to the kernel of education on ideals and convictions form an important guidance in strengthening and improving ideological and political work and in instructing people to set up a common ideal of building up socialism with Chinese characteristics and to establish a scientific view on the world , life values and values .

As capital , technology , goods , services , labor , information , and other productive factors flow outward across regions , overstepping national boundaries , and transcending cultures and concepts of values , this links the whole world more tightly together through common markets , mutual trade , and shared interests .

Let us put it in another way .  Man 's various imaginations about the afterlife are actually based on this life ; therefore , if an afterlife theory totally negates the value and meaning of this life , totally runs counter to man 's essential common sense in this life , and totally violates man 's moral principles in this life , then it can easily fall into a ridiculous and weird circle , and can easily be used for conducting all kinds of activities that bring harm to man .

The Chinese side is willing to strive for new progress through joint efforts in the long-term and stable relationship of friendship and cooperation in the new century .  
As regards human rights , Li Peng has stressed and pointed out : It is impossible to demand that various countries follow the same viewpoint or mechanically transplant the same mode on the question of human rights , for human rights is an integral concept , and complete and common human rights should include not only the political rights of citizens but also the economic , social , and cultural rights , especially the right of survival and the right of development .

Nevertheless , at the same time , the Taiwan authorities have refused to make appropriate efforts to respond to the two proposals put forward by the mainland of the motherland on clearly promising not to practice the " state-to-state theory " and clearly promising to adhere to the common understanding reached between ARATS and SEF in 1992 that both sides may verbally express their respective views on " adhering to the principle of one China by both sides of the strait . "  They disregarded historical facts .

During the visits , with specific targets in mind Chairman Li Peng expounded and re-stressed the principled standpoints and viewpoints of China on some important international and regional issues and acquired comprehensive common understanding with the leaders of these six countries .  
The above mutual understanding regarding specific issues that was reached by the two leaders made both sides more full of confidence regarding the prospects for relations between China and Italy , which have numerous points in common politically , have strong complementary natures economically , and have great potential for development .  
Although in each case there are objective and subjective reasons , these cases have something in common : They developed during exceptional times under exceptional conditions , and if they do not pay close attention to improving their quality , they very easily become swell-headed and make wrong decisions .  
With regard to the recent tragic incident of illegal immigration , we also have had a common stand .  China is resolutely opposed to illegal immigration and has formulated strict laws and adopted stern measures to prevent it .  However , trans-national criminal gangs are rampant and very fraudulent .

After Mr .  
Since assuming office , Taiwan 's new leader has adopted a delaying , evasive approach toward the one-China principle , denying that the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait and the Strait Exchange Foundation had in 1992 reached a common understanding on the one-China principle .  He has changed his wording again and again and yet had no clear and definite measures for easing and improving cross-strait relations and thus has been ridiculed by the Taiwan media as " having saliva of goodwill of a volume enough to drown people but taking no visible action . "  
Huang Yuanzhi , standing committee member of the provincial party committee and secretary of the provincial discipline inspection commission , said : " It is very necessary to carry out admonitory education among party members-cum-cadres .  People like Cheng Kejie , Hu Changqing , and Jin Jianpei followed different orbits of transformation , but they had things in common .  They gave party members-cum-cadres these warnings : First , party members-cum-cadres , particularly leading cadres , must intensify theoretical study , and foster correct outlooks on the world , life , and value .  
Through the east-west cooperation of township enterprises , by supplementing each other with respective advantages , and through the common development of the east and west , as well as the effective distribution of natural resources , the east can shift in an orderly manner its labor-intensive and resources processing-intensive industries to the west and then readjust its product mix and concentrate on developing technology-intensive , capital-intensive , and export-oriented enterprises .  
At the same time , he chaired a CIS summit and visited six CIS countries .  He settled the debt , gas shipment , common border defense issues with the countries concerned and , using security and energy cooperation as cohesive power , improved Russia 's leading role in the CIS .

At the turn of the century and the millennium today , the international community has realized more and more clearly that the most important factor to narrow the South-North gap and achieve a common development of all countries is to reform the current international economic system and build a just and reasonable new international economic order , which fully reflects and guarantees the economic interests of developing countries .

They had an extensive exchange of views on bilateral relations , the international and regional situation , and other issues of common concern in a friendly atmosphere .  
The pursuit of peace and development becomes both the common aspirations of the people throughout the world and the theme of our times .  However , the unfair and irrational old order in international politics and economics has yet to undergo fundamental changes .  There is still a long way to go before the two strategic issues of peace and development are solved and a fair and equitable new international political and economic order is established .  
As the most representative and most authoritative international organization of sovereign states , the United Nations has played an irreplaceable role in maintaining world peace , promoting common development , and in establishing a fair and reasonable new international political and economic order .  
Resolving only the issue of poverty in developing countries is far from enough .  It is essential to create a favorable external environment for developing countries , provide them with capital , technological , and manpower support , and help them eliminate the " digital gap , " so that all countries of the world can seek common development and prosperity in the process of economic globalization .  
At the turn of the century , the international situation is going through profound changes .  The world is not peaceful , and various factors that threaten world peace and security have continued to exist .  Regional conflicts arising from racial , religious , and territorial disputes are on the rise , and there are complex conflicts and problems hampering the common development of countries .  
Li Peng stressed : China and Russia share extensive common interests ; and have had fruitful cooperation in a series of major international issues in recent years , including human rights , the anti-missile issue [ fan dao ] , arms control , and the reform of the United Nations . Such cooperation should go on in the future . 
After studying Cheng Kejie 's case , Hu Changqing 's case , and some other typical cases , we have found that they shared some common characteristics : They had economically grown insatiably avaricious and had become corrupt and degenerate in their daily life .  
Even the present conviction for illegal handling of classified information and the nine-month prison term are excessive because similar practices are rather common in major scientific research institutions and government organs in the United States , and the overwhelming majority of the handlers would get away unscathed or with disciplinary sanction .  
The voice of the greater number of developing nations has been a united voice , particularly focusing on suffering from unfair treatment and other issues , and stressing that we must through strong efforts establish a new international political and economic order that is equal , just , and rational .  The " joint declaration " passed by the conference embodies the spirit of seeking common ground and reserving differences , and achieved positive results .  
During his visit to the six countries , Li Peng met and held talks with presidents , parliamentary leaders , and prime ministers of those countries , exchanged views with them on bilateral relations including contacts between parliaments as well as other issues of common concern in a profound , frank , and friendly manner .

The current centralized cleanup has further implemented " several regulations on rigorous enforcement of economy and curbing luxury and waste practiced at party and government organs issued by the State Council under the Central CPC Committee , " promoted the development of cultivating honesty and self-discipline among leading cadres at central and state organs , and improved the common practices at various organs , in addition to saving a huge amount of state funds .  
With those in subordinate positions following the example set by their superiors , the entire industrial and commercial administration department of Zhuhai was " rotten from the inside out . "  The local common people all said that if the industrial and commercial administration cadres were all dragged out to be shot , there would not be a single innocent man wrongly killed .  
At a news conference held for the " China-Africa Cooperation Forum-Ministerial Meeting in Beijing in the Year 2000 , " Ji Peiding said the current meeting has two main topics : One is how to promote the establishment of a just and reasonable international political and economic new order geared to the needs of the 21st century in order to protect the common interests of developing countries , and the second is how to further strengthen cooperation between China and Africa in economic and other tangible fields .  
In line with the aim of " consultation on an equal footing , increasing understanding , expanding consensus , strengthening friendship , and promoting cooperation , " the two sides will jointly discuss major issues , such as how to push for the establishment of a new just and rational , international , political , and economic order geared to the 21st century ; how to safeguard the common interests of developing countries ; and how to further enhance Sino-African trade and economic cooperation .  
Tang Jiaxuan said : The current forum has two major topics : First , facing the 21st century , how we should work to establish a just and reasonable new international political and economic order in order to ensure developing countries ' common interests .  
He expressed his firm belief that establishment of a new type of partnership relations between China and African countries within the framework of South-South cooperation , and , in the principle of equality , mutual benefits , diversification , attaching importance to practical results , and common development , deepening and broadening bilateral cooperation in all fields , will be a positive contribution to the establishment of a new international political and economic order .  
The Ambassador said : " I particularly appreciate the remarks made by the late Premier Zhou Enlai that we should ' seek common ground on major issues while reserving differences on minor points . '  Japan and China have normalized their relations for nearly 30 years , and the obligations shouldered by the two countries in maintaining world peace and prosperity have indeed been steadily growing .  Looking forward into the 21st century , I believe that Japanese-Chinese relations will definitely develop into a relationship based on solid mutual reliance that can contribute to world peace . "  
In response to some important issues with common interests in both the Asian side and the European side , the Chinese Government proposed the holding an Asia-Europe environmental ministerial meeting , carrying out scientific and technological cooperation in Asian and European forest protection and sustainable development , and holding a seminar of Asian and European law enforcement institutions on cracking down on transnational crimes .  These proposals also won support from various Asian and European countries .  
In the sphere of political cooperation , the priority tasks to be carried out are the increase of political dialogues between the senior officials of various countries , the acceleration of the United Nations ' reforms , the promotion of the common interest of international organizations , and some global issues of common concern ( such as the restrictions on the proliferation of large-sized weapons , the solution of worldwide environmental protection , the crackdown on transnational crime , money laundering , and international terrorism , and others ) .  
The DPP-led " Executive Yuan " asserted that stabilizing the political situation and getting rid of the economic crisis would be taken as two major tasks to tackle .  But it has not introduced any new measures on improving cross-strait relations - - an issue of common concern to the Taiwan public .  
Deng Xiaoping Theory has provided the powerful ideological weapon for our party to understand the world and remold the world , and it is also the spiritual dynamic to gather and inspire the entire party and people of the whole country to attain the common ideal and promote overall social progress .  
On the contrary , since the new economies , which have knowledge as the basis , are mainly grouped in the developed countries , and the people of most developing countries are still living in poverty without any chances at all of getting in contact with the revolution of information technology , the differences between the south and north have been further expanded instead due to the " digital gap , " which has thrown a gloom over the prospects of common development and prosperity for the mankind .  
Especially , since the start of reform and opening , nationalities of our country have made tremendous achievements in producing common prosperity and progress in the process of economic development , and have worked continually to consolidate socialist nationality relationships based on equality , unity , and mutual help ; the Chinese nation has shown strong cohesion amid changes in the international situation .  
During his brief stay in the United States , Xiang Huaicheng also held talks with Summers and US National Economic Adviser Sperling [ si po lin ] .  The two sides exchanged views on international and domestic issues of common concern .

Li Peng said that as the social system and development level of various countries are different and their historical and cultural background and concepts on value differ in a thousand ways , it is not at all surprising that they have divergent views on some problems .  The best way of solving the problems is to conduct exchanges and dialogues on the basis of friendliness , equality , mutual respect , and the principle of seeking common ground while reserving differences .  
The Law on the National Common Language adopted at this meeting will provide a correct guide for the normalization , standardization , and healthy growth of our national common spoken and written languages ; and it is therefore conducive to the country 's reunification and national unity , and to our building of socialist material and spiritual civilizations .  The passing of the revised Law on Fisheries is of great significance to stepping up our protection , multiplication , development , and rational utilization of fishery resources ;  
III . The two parties agree to maintain consultations and exchanges between their foreign ministries ; to exchange views on bilateral relations and regional and international issues of common concern in a timely manner ; and to maintain regular contact and communication by taking advantage of various bilateral occasions , so as to vigorously push forward the development of relations between the two countries .

The regular meeting of the general staff departments of the Chinese and Russian armed forces to discuss international and regional situations and issues of common interest is an important component of the Sino-Russian strategic cooperative partnership and a specific embodiment of the further development of relations between the two armed forces , and it will help both sides not only strengthen mutual understanding and trust but also coordinate their stand and strengthen their cooperation in international affairs .  
China always maintains that economic and technological cooperation is an important channel for APEC to achieve common prosperity , and an inevitable choice for promoting the sustained and steady growth of the world and regional economies under the conditions of economic globalization .  
He said that China and Sudan have a common language on many issues and are faced with the complex and ever-changing international situation ; the Chinese side is willing to continue increasing coordination and cooperation with Sudan and make concerted efforts to establish a new international political and economic order characterized by fairness and rationality , and to safeguard the common interests of the developing countries .

When the talks were about to conclude , the SEF representative proposed three more forms of expression and also produced the content of their final expression : " Although in the course of the common efforts of both sides in pursuing national reunification , both sides uphold the one China principle , they have different understanding regarding the meaning of one China .  
Their common goals are : Actively explore China 's enormous market , strive hard to bring China into the world economic and international political systems dominated by the West , use the game rules formulated by Western countries , which are led by the United States , to restrain China , maintain the status quo in the Taiwan Strait , prevent armed conflict in the Taiwan Strait , strengthen ties with regional allies , and step up the efforts to contain and guard against China in the security domain .  
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said today : The Chinese government has pursued a consistent and clear-cut stance on the Kashmir issue .  We welcome and support all efforts conducive to improving Indian-Pakistani ties and alleviating regional tension .

The people 's uniformity has tremendously increased in terms of fundamental interests , common ideals , and target of endeavor .  
[ Wang ] Upon entering the new century , the party 's basic requirements on united front work are : Holding high the banner of patriotism and socialism ; uniting with all the forces that can be united ; mobilizing all positive factors ; turning negative factors into positive ones ; catering to the establishment of socialist economy , politics , and culture with Chinese characteristics ; catering to the political situation of stability and unity ; catering to the realization of the motherland 's complete reunification ; catering to world peace ; and catering to common development .  
Consequently , the common objectives that the two major parties in the United States have been pursuing in recent years as far as China is concerned are : to vigorously exploit the huge market in China , with a view to bringing China into the West-led world economic system and international political system , so as to restrain China with the rules of game laid down by Western countries ;  
Hu Jintao emphasized : In the face of complex , changeable international situation at the turn of the century , the further strengthening and development of PRC-DPRK traditional friendship is not only in line with the common aspirations and fundamental interests of the two parties and two countries , but also conducive to safeguarding peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula , Northeast Asia , and the world as a whole .

The most common problem is the blocking of fire exits , which is extremely dangerous .

Exercise : The Stepping Stone to Rehabilitation : Taking sufferers from infantile paralysis as an example , Wu says that if no rehabilitation treatment is administered , lower limbs are too weak to support the body and normal walking is impossible . Excessive joint friction , ineffectual muscles , and numbness are common consequences , resulting in " second-degree disability . " Some cerebral palsy victims sometimes reach the point where their entire bodies need rehabilitative treatment , Wu explains .  
The museum enables employees to gain a concrete idea of just how we built up our corporate reputation and an understanding of what each department does , " explains the museum 's director , Wu Mu-hsiang . Learning about the past gives them common memories and produces a sense of cohesion , he says , citing an example . When they discovered a refrigerator made 30 years ago still being used in one family 's kitchen , their hearts lit up with pride .  
Head librarian Wu Wen-chin says : " The work of the library is comprehensive . When we arranged all our common Chinese and Japanese books , we edited a catalog of 72 volumes , which was a huge process that was only finished eight years ago . After that we began an automatic system , which requires a very big budget . "  
This group of new directors , called the fifth generation , includes such figures as Chen Kai-ge and Tian Zhuang-zhuang . They share some things in common . Because of the cultural revolution , they all lost the chance to study . Among those 20 million intellectual youths dispersed to the remote regions to live with the peasants , they know about these places ' odd customs .  
The main characters in these dramas were mostly country girls , women vendors , or actresses in dramatic troupes . The trademark Hsinhua film was a common love story built around these leading characters . Production was simple , and performance techniques were based on traditional Chinese opera or the singing techniques of folk songs . To these were added clever , catchy songs by the basic team of Yao Min , who wrote the music , Chen Tieh-yi , who composed the lyrics , and Yao Li , who sang the vocals offstage .  
Probably the most common type of amulet is a lion 's head carved on a wooden panel , hung on the lintel over the front door . Its simple , mottled colors and stern features stand guard over the entrance day and night , keeping evil at bay .  
Entertaining at home will become more and more common in Taiwan in the future , " says Li Tao , the director of external affairs at Ford Lio Ho Motors , who will occasionally whip up a few steaks for special guests . The is play of personal care , the warm atmosphere and the savings all make entertaining at home a good choice .  
Many public officials are a step ahead of these laws , publicly declaring their assets before they go into effect . " Snails without a shell , " those too poor to afford to buy a house , have grabbed the opportunity to show their moral incorruptibility . But under-reporting was common . It seemed as if everyone was deeply afraid of being wealthy , worried that they would be deemed a " gold bull . "  
Perhaps a philosophy of life and death can be free from objectivity , formality , and rigidity , but it has the opposite critical problem of becoming personalized , and freely verified only in one 's own mind , so it is impossible to come to a common spiritual consensus .  
His eldest daughter Chung Yu-ching retorts that there is less and less field work to be done , and at home appliances have taken over many tasks formerly done by hand , so it 's impossible to insist that modern women live like those in the past . In Taiwan , young people share a common backdrop to their upbringings , a common language , and a great deal of information . The impact of traditional family education is waning , and can not overcome social values , schooling , and peer interactions .  
Taking this theme a step farther , Chu Chia-hua 's cloth of abundantly colorful flowers and dried roses uses common objects to show the consumer manipulation people are subject to in modern urban life , where the flow of information is unchecked .  
" This is because in the past in every medium of communication , the listener 's role was the smallest , " says " Nation United " host Ling Er-hsiang . Every time a major incident takes place , the media hurriedly interview government officials and expert scholars or elected representatives . " But really , the people are most important , not to mention the fact that the opinions of some common citizens are more outstanding and cut closer to reality . "  
Although Taiwan practices democratic politics , bureaucratic corruption also exists ; Taiwan 's economy is relatively advanced , but suffers the vital weaknesses of scarce resources and over-reliance on others ; the people of Taiwan have quite a high standard of living , yet there are still classes which rely on welfare payments to make ends meet ; Taiwan has been quite deeply influenced by Western culture , yet still maintains traditional Chinese culture and traditional Confucian thinking , family values and even our ancient culinary culture , all of which spring from a common source .  
But what they have in common is a deep love of the photographic image , which leads them to choose photography for their creative work . When their works appear , they almost always break with accepted ideas that a photograph creates a record , is decided in an instant , is immutable and is capable of unlimited reproduction .  
Under the assimilation policy , the Japanese issued the Taiwan education law , eliminated differential education , implemented the common study system , recognized improperly documented marriages , set basic principles for internal governance , and more .  
But other textbooks do give a thoroughly positive view of Emperor Yu 's achievement in taming the waters : one first-year secondary school textbook describes how through 13 years of ceaseless effort , Yu finally brought the flood waters under control , and how " while he was taming the waters , he would often pass by his own door without going in . This spirit of selflessness and working for the common good aroused people 's deep admiration . " How do textbooks from the three areas handle lessons on moral character and proper behavior ?  
And once they have been admitted , it is difficult to discharge them . Chronic illness includes stroke-induced paralysis , pathological changes to the liver and kidney , and rheumatoid arthritis . Patients with those afflictions can not possibly get well and leave the hospital within a short period of time . As a result , those patients who are actually in urgent need of hospitalization can not find a bed covered by insurance ( ie . , in common rooms with three or more beds ) .  
The notion of female chastity began to be reinforced . Previously it had been common for widows to remarry , but from the Song onwards remarriage was seen as " unchaste , " and was not tolerated by the society of the time . Stories such as " The widow cutting off her arm " ( after it had been accidentally touched by a man ) and " An injured breast left untreated " ( because exposure to the doctor 's gaze would have been worse than death ) were taken as models and ideals and widely promoted .  
In fact , the real cause of power rationing and blackouts can be seen from even a superficial glance : Because of rapid economic growth with a corresponding increase in national wealth , commercial and industrial demand for electricity has risen while consumer electric products have become common . On top of these , Taipower has run into land-acquisition problems and local resistance for plants it planned to develop , so these plants have not been able to come on line in a timely manner .  
The common saying goes , " Mild in the south , salty in the north , sour in the east , and spicy in the west . " The food of Fujian , which lies in the south of China , is best known for its light , fresh flavor .  
Traditional dwellings used very direct methods to deal with these problems : " first avoid , then block . " Professor Lin Sheng-feng explains that the most common method was for traditional courtyard farmhouses to be surrounded by a " green wall " of bamboo planted as a windbreak . Later , " typhoon shutters " were developed : thick wooden boards or metal plates which could be hung up over windows .  
Knowledge vs . philosophy of lifeThe classics were attacked as part of the old civil service exams , but the exams , which were graded irrespective of social rank and made it possible for men of common background to serve the nation , were bad only for having set questions and standards for grading . Particularly near the end , people were selected based on how they wrote " the eight-legged essay , " which imposed great restrictions on form and wiped out originality of thought .  
For a while now , Li Wen-ling , an elementary school teacher , has led her entire class in reading the classics during activity period . Because this was n't common in schools when she started , she had to play the hard and lonely role of pioneer . In addition to a few parents who looked askance on the activity , her students would ask why they had to recite when other kids did n't and would use the classical Chinese they had learned in class to attack her in their essay books .  
Contrary to the common impression that expatriates have little contact with their native land , more than 80% of the respondents had been back in Taiwan within the past three years . More than half had been in Taiwan within the previous year . This suggests that they have maintained close ties with Taiwan . In terms of provincial origin , a plurality of our respondents - - more than 40% - - were second generation mainlanders ( that is , children of fathers who left mainland China before 1949 ) .  
In regard to this problem , Paolaban believes that each indigenous group has its own distinct naming method ; recovering the names is not the action of individuals , but should be based on information from a detailed survey . From common discussions among the nine groups and linguistic scholars , a single universal system should be derived .  
A food supply is the most basic of human needs , and farm produce is the last bastion of protectionism in the ROC ; it is also the segment most prone to sensitive price fluctuations . This situation is not unique to Taiwan , but is common throughout the world . Fortunately , except for agricultural produce , most household items , domestic appliances , cosmetics and so on were thrown open to free competition earlier , and so have already entered an era of more stable prices in line with those in advanced countries worldwide .  
Second , because the members of these societies do n't have a high level of education , the clubs are very much a part of local Taiwanese culture - - virtual reflections of common Taiwanese society . " These poetry societies were not established in the modern academic era , and so they are representative of local temple fair society , " Chien says .  
Fifty years of a common destiny forged in fortune and misfortune have united us all into a closely bound and interdependent community . The first-ever popular presidential election has reconfirmed our collective consciousness that we in Taiwan have to work together as one . How to make this land of ours more beautiful and how to make its inhabitants feel safer and live a happier and more harmonious life is the common responsibility of our 21.3 million people !  
Han Pao-te , who now heads the preparatory office to set up the Tainan National College of the Arts , says that the Chinese were skilled in the use of water , which was the most common source of motive power . An example is the water wheels used to raise water for irrigation . " The astronomical clock tower represents Chinese water culture , and from the celestial globe and armillary sphere we can see the Chinese conception of the heavens , so they are an expression of the Chinese soul . "  
Of late , members of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly , the highest publicly elected body at the provincial level , have been embroiled in numerous scandals involving election bribery , libel charges , financial disputes and various lawsuits . In an effort to clean itself up and drive out malevolent forces , the Assembly conducted a prayer session in honor of the " good brothers , " thereby resorting to ghosts instead of turning to the common people .  
Against this background , Huang advises that it is inappropriate for students , lacking experience in society and with immature minds , to be allowed to participate in long-termed , closed activities like the summer camp . Moreover , he suggests , the government should regulate all religious activities that do not follow general practice or common sense . Otherwise , it is not impossible that similar crises of family and social ethics will again occur .  
Li describes a six-hour procedure in which he participated : The patient was suffering from a malignant tumor on the common bile duct , which connects to the hepatic duct , bile duct , and pancreatic duct . Because it affected so many organs , the surgery was extremely difficult . Seven persons-the assistant chief of the hospital , a chief resident , a resident , an anesthe-siologist , and three nurses-labored for those six hours to complete the job .  
One of the more extreme examples often cited is that of the nearby Philippines , where university education is very common . Nevertheless , even the Filipina maids who come to work in Taiwan have university diplomas , thus wasting the talented manpower of that nation . How should the quality of human labor be synchronized with economic development ?  
Its functions were similar to that of a small-scale city government . Besides managing the affairs of businessmen , it also handled the affairs of a municipal government , such as ferry services , night watchman duties and relief for the poor during the winter months . In the past , the imperial government did almost nothing at all . They only handled taking taxes and spanking the common people 's bottoms ( keeping public order ) , so business organizations joined together to manage city government on their own .  
Vegetarian food in the US is less than exemplary . Besides salad bars , the most common offerings are tasteless , squishy boiled vegetables . And canned foods are even less appetizing . No wonder the only way they could persuade kids to consume veggies was to show Popeye saving the damsel-in-distress by eating spinach .  
Anyone who has eaten kimche before might have an idea what to expect in Korean vegetarian cooking . The variety of vegetables is simple ; and steaming , boiling , and scalding are the most common cooking techniques . Oil is not often used , with sugar , soy sauce , sesame oil , hot peppers , and garlic-all ( save sugar ) powerful acrid flavorings-being preferred . Jung really enjoys this style , and feels that these are simple vegetarian recipes that people can use for a long time without getting tired of them .  
In Western music , perhaps it 's only the composer who is creative , while all the rest are interpreters . In Chinese music , the creators are at every level , and the performers are especially important creators . It is " homogeneous evolution , " " looking for difference in homogeneity , looking for similarity in difference , " " common appreciation of the elite and the popular , stressing commonality over difference . " These seem to be simple , ordinary descriptions , but this is its real nature .  
Q : As you have said , the intellectuals threw out the most refined part of traditional music , and ordinarily people talk about aesthetic values in social terms , in terms of elite or common values , so they belittle folk music . In an era such as this , when traditional music is becoming more and more distant from modern life , what use does it have , and how do we obtain access to it ?  
After a trip abroad , he discovered that Chinese Muslims had little understanding of their own religion 's doctrines , and were in dire need of an accurate Qur'an and other materials for interpreting it . He thus spent more than 20 years translating three Chinese texts altogether : one in classical Chinese , one in jingtangwen ( an old form with specific religious terms left in their original form , that is , not translated into a common equivalent ) , and one in the vernacular .  
Currently , the problem is that " there are no rules of the game . Just looking at circulation tricks to expand or maintain sales , apart from giving discounts , giving papers away for free is also common , " suggests mass communications scholar Hsu Chia-shih . There is no mutual trust in the newspaper industry , and there is no objective standard to determine " number of newspapers sold . " That is why they are so chilly toward the ABC .  
Although the traditional robe-and-vest has virtually disappeared , the comfortable Tang suit has survived , and remains a formal wear choice for a select few . Originally , the Tang suit was a term foreigners used , in a sweeping way , to describe all Chinese fashion . In fact , what people have over time come to define as the Tang suit is something that was created in the late Qing and early Republican era among the common people .  
The desire of " civilized " humanity for material goods is insatiable . Man is also the only animal to have developed commerce . Ivory has been a common raw material since the earliest days of markets , and its consumption has grown continuously .  
Although under the pens of literati since the Tang and Song , this fairy visitor among flowers had been washed clean of all connection with the vulgar mortal world , for the common people the osmanthus symbolized gold and jade , fame and fortune , and success at every level in the imperial examinations . So in the end even the literati could not escape the mundane .  
Furthermore , public electricity service in Nicaragua was unreliable , and brown-outs were common . The electric generator which the hotel used had insufficient wattage , so embarrassing episodes of guests with heads full of soap suds wrapped in bath robes screaming complaints were all too common .  
Taiwan composer Ma Shui-lung affirms Wong 's heartfelt efforts . But , purely from a musical point of view , he feels that the arrangements could be broader and deeper . Though it is great that popular tunes can be arranged to be more edifying without losing their common touch , it is also worth performing truly original works ; after all , the space for Chinese music is broad .  
The ROC government had been established on Taiwan for 20 years and the fruits of land reform had provided a basis for the greater prosperity of the common people . Economic activity , primarily from public investment , was flourishing . However , the island was still under martial law , political prohibitions such as those outlawing the establishment of political parties had not yet been repealed , and the social atmosphere was tense .  
This recognition returned me again to thinking about that tension experienced by the expatriate between the nagging desire to retreat back to one 's own country and the dogged intention to stay where one is . And it suggested some common ground between the fear and fascination I see written on the face of the two-year-old who comes upon me in the mall and my own fascination with the specter , every day repeated , on sidewalks all around me filled with " foreign " Asian faces .  
Jan Jyh-horng responded that although Taipei has never sought to avoid political negotiations aimed at eventual reunification , both Beijing and Taipei would first have to approach such negotiations with a common understanding that " the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are ruled by separate and equal entities . "  
Not conceding defeat , she filed a final appeal for a constitutional ruling . According to statistics in the yearbook of the Judicial Yuan , intentional abandonment is the most common grounds for divorce , accounting for more than half of all cases , many of which hinge upon the wife not living at her husband 's official residence .  
" I keep mulling over this thought : Has this natural , simple , non-calculating character of the common man been lost under the capitalist system with its private ownership of property ? When these three people begin to specialize , they will become more adept at running the restaurant and become more calculating . Will the three of them be as happy then as they are now ? "  
In recent years organically grown vegetables have become increasingly popular . " Wild " veggies , grown without depending on man-made fertilizers and not using pesticides , fit right in with this trend . Add to this the common belief that bitter tasting foods have medicinal value , and wild vegetables have become a new favorite for health-minded modern people .  
The fairy realms portrayed in literature have many established features . A common plot element is that if a visitor to fairyland stays there , he can live there as an immortal forever . But usually the hero is stricken with homesickness and leaves ; once back among the distracting , vulgar pleasures of the mortal world , he never finds his way into fairyland again .  
All the women who volunteer their services at Hsing Tien Temple understand that they can not go to the temple during their menstrual period . A common sight at temple festivals in Taiwan is the jitong , or spirit medium , who defies nature by piercing his body and walking over hot coals without bleeding or blistering .  
Laozi and Confucius both emerged late in the Spring and Autumn period , in a time of frequent warfare when the system of moral education through ritual and music of the Zhou dynasty ( 11th century-256 BC ) had collapsed , and the nobility had abandoned themselves to a life of wanton extravagance supported by ruthless exploitation of the common people .  
Fan also wrote China 's first fish farming manual , thus paving the way for the aquaculture industry of later generations . From the Tang dynasty onwards , it became common practice to raise such fish as common carp , mud carp , blunt snout bream , black carp and grass carp together , with the different species-some carnivorous and some herbivorous-occupying different niches within the waters of the same pond . " From a modern perspective this was very scientific , and consistent with maintaining an ecological balance , " says aquaculture nutritionist Chuang Chien-lung .  
These included " fish souls , " made from the lips cut from live sturgeon ; " Xi Shi 's bosom , " made with white fat from pufferfish bellies and named after a famous beauty ; and the " gold soup and jade slices " served by Mrs . Song outside Qiantang Gate , which comprised a thick wild rice stem soup and sliced raw common carp and crucian carp .  
" This is something that both sexes want , " avers Wang Hao-wei , psychiatrist and author of the book Taiwan Men . Women , he notes , are experiencing rising self-consciousness , and want equal status and a fairer division of labor . Men , meanwhile , are hoping to escape rigid traditional roles and to have the chance to be more relaxed , more free to express their true selves . Men and women together have built up and share a common image of a new man .  
Firstly , there is strong support among Taiwan 's population of 22 million people , regardless of ethnic group or provincial ancestry , for the concept of " new Taiwanese . " We share a common life and our interests fully coincide , and as we confront the latest round of threats from communist China it is vital that we rally together to protect our own national security .  
People in their prime years ( 30s and 40s ) have always been considered the elite of the employment structure , positioned as they are between inexperienced workers and aging seniors . But in recent years , there have been dramatic structural changes in the employment market . Unemployment and forced career changes have become increasingly common among workers in their prime .  
Because past surveys of Taiwan faults were mostly limited to examinations of surface geology , with no money to obtain more precise results by digging or drilling under the surface , major mistakes were common . Particularly in metropolitan areas where high real estate prices mean that all the land is covered by buildings , ruptures are impossible to see .  
The Han dynasty and the Roman Empire were unified imperial states facing complex problems , and as a result shared much in common . In particular , their legal systems were extremely pragmatic and concrete , with the focus on day-to-day governance .  
Rather this kind of thing is a " trademark " that has become attached to Taiwanese drama over the course of its history . As a result , even though " nativist drama " has escaped the stereotypical setting of the Taiwanese countryside of the past and increasingly focuses on contemporary urban life , such provocative scenes-playing to elemental emotions to pull on the heart-strings-are still common .  
Lu Hsiao-fen , a film star who has won numerous awards at the Golden Horse and Asia-Pacific film festivals and who has recently jumped into prime time as the female lead in Fortune , explains : " They have a special name for shows that are being broadcast episode by episode as each one is shot : ' ON programming . ' It is common for an episode finished today to be shown two days later . "  
At the door between the living room and dining room , there 's a tall ceramic cylinder suitable for storing scrolls , with a design that features the bright red canna blossom-a common sight in the countryside-around which bees are buzzing . Above are the words : " Busy Bees at Work . " The hardworking artist himself , who spends all day at his labors , is perhaps not unlike those bees .  
On the subject of cross-strait relations , Chen stressed that the people of Taiwan and mainland China share a common ancestral , cultural , and historical background , and he stated his belief that the leaders on both sides have the wisdom and creativity to jointly deal with the question of a future " one China . "  
When these become common , you will be able to go online through television , wireless application protocol ( WAP ) - standard phones , personal digital assistants ( PDAs ) , and even digital watches . Moreover , you 'll be able to stay connected 24 hours a day . It will be just like TV today-flip it on and you are ready to go .  
Many non-flowering aquatic plants propagate through asexual reproduction , which is arguably more efficient than the process employed by terrestrial plants . It is common to think of flowering plants as more advanced , but in Yen 's view , " Maybe plants that can reproduce without going through that process are actually the most advanced from an evolutionary standpoint . "  
In traditional China , single-fold eyelids were favored . But modern people are inclined to want large , bright , expressive eyes . For many years now , making of double-fold eyelids has been the most common procedure among cosmetic surgeons .  
As for gangs and secret societies , these are organizations which have existed among the common people in China since ancient times . They began to grow more widespread in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties , and particularly after the Yongzheng and Qianlong reigns [ 1723-1795 ] , they spread all over China like a cancer . I call them " local armed fighting groups , " and in fact what they did was to fight and grab territory .  
Not the first time Each of these emerging bands has a style of its own , but they also have in common a way of combining homegrown and western styles of music . For example , Luan Tan 's beiguan-derived music alludes to the communal rural spirit of earlier times , something which is being rediscovered in the extra-curricular life of today 's students . It is a collective , pluralist mode of creation which contrasts starkly with the staleness of mainstream pop and illuminates new possibilities for music in Taiwan .  
With simple common sense , a basic level of awareness and proper personal hygiene , the public has very little to fear from infectious diseases .  
The story is much the same when it comes to birds . Surveys of foreign starlings and mynas , also by TESRI , identified 13 non-native members of the family Sturnidae living wild in Taiwan , mainly escaped or released pets and their offspring . " White-vented mynas and common mynas have been recorded in over a third of Taiwan 's 361 urban townships , rural townships and city districts , " says a survey report by Lin Ruey-shing of TESRI .  
While there are few examples of knights-errant with an overriding interest in justice , our recollection of one or two positive attributes dominates our image of these figures . The way we remember selfless Guo Jie and forget his more ruthless contemporaries is a case in point . When people feel oppressed , such idealization is still more common , and whenever China has been in decline the image of knight-errants has waxed bright in the popular mind .  
In such times , people naturally honor a wandering knight who kills on behalf of the powerless . Yuan Jiegang , a scholar of the early Republican era , described the waxing and waning of the knight-errant 's image as follows : Knights-errant were common people who had usurped the power to kill . This could not be tolerated by the imperial authorities . At its height , the Han dynasty sought to eliminate the knights-errant , and their fighting spirit was quickly broken .  
Lin Pao-chun says , " Before Historical Records , Chinese military strategy had absorbed the idea of ruling with compassion , and the highest objective of the student of the martial arts was to eliminate the violence in his own heart . Lin expands on this point , stating that in the ethos of the knight-errant , magnanimity was more important than fighting skill . Moreover , knights-errant were expected to be ethical , moral , honorable , decorous and patriotic , as well as protecting the common folk .  
Red team scholars typically argue that the US and PRC share many long-term interests in common and that a cooperative relationship can be built and maintained . The Clinton administration 's policy of an " active strategic partnership " was based on suggestions made by so-called red team scholars .  
The ITRI 's fever chip applies similar principles . Oligonucleotides from 25 of the most common fever-causing pathogens are arranged on the chip , and infection with any of them can be detected from a single drop of a patient 's blood , urine or cerebrospinal fluid . The fever chip too is currently in clinical trials at National Taiwan University Hospital .  
In fact it is not unusual for a change of seasons to occasionally come early or late and upset the sequence of nature , and it is quite common for plants to be fooled by the weather . In ancient times farmers were aware that " if a fruit tree that normally flowers in spring blossoms in autumn , it will not set fruit . "  
In addition , Taiwan 's background as a former Japanese colony and the many Taiwanese who have studied and worked in the US give the island a human network of international dimensions . Add in the fact that the island shares a common language and culture with China and with ethnic Chinese in Southeast Asia , and the tight ties between its own business , political and academic circles , and Taiwan looks to be very well positioned here at the beginning of the era of globalization .  
In order to protect Penghu 's precious basalt formations , as well as the countless sea birds that pass by here , in 1993 the Council of Agriculture , acting on suggestions from academics , declared a group of islands in the southeast part of Penghu which rarely see human activity to be the Penghu Columnar Basalt Nature Preserve . The basalt islands , like black pearls across the Western Pacific , are glittering assets of the common heritage of mankind .  
Take , for instance , The Myriad Poses of Ants . The large black ants common to Taiwanese fields are seen scurrying on top of a piece of bamboo , transporting food . Every ant has a different pose , and the dark green sheen of Taiwan jade gives the bamboo a great vibrancy . When you look close , the ants almost appear to be breathing .  
At left are pictured conventional ( above ) and " earth bull " ( below ) tops . Though different in shape ( the former are conical and solid , the latter tubular ) , they share one thing in common : it 's not that easy to use them well !  
The emergence of the cross-platform " central editorial desk " has also created a trend for convergence of various personnel previously scattered in different fields such as the visual media , print media and technology firms . Phenomena such as magazine editors operating web sites and publishing their own electronic newspapers , or the China Times investing in Power TV to enable readers of the paper 's electronic edition to watch direct transmissions of the station 's world news online at any time , are becoming more and more common .  
The applications for refined CHM can be extended considerably . Already a number of manufacturers in Taiwan are adding raw materials from Kingstone to all kinds of products , including yogurt and ice cream . These raw materials can also be put to use in natural colorings and flavorings , edible fibers , cosmetic masks , bandages , and more . These uses are already common overseas , with the production value of such products increasing year in and year out , but in Taiwan there is still vast room for R &amp; D and promotion .  
M . Samuel Noordhoff , a doctor from the United States , had been in Taiwan for decades when he founded the NCF in 1990 , and he began taking teams of Taiwan-trained craniofacial surgery experts to other countries in 1998 . Whereas the most common formula adopted to explain overseas aid is " giving something back to international society , " Rebecca Wang says that it would be more accurate to say that they are driven by " a missionary spirit , " with their religious-based concern for others naturally knowing no national boundaries .  
Taiwan , on the other hand , has strict laws restricting flying and has yet to issue hot-air balloon licenses , not to mention licenses for nine-seater aircraft , the most common type of recreational plane . If any engineers addicted to flying do make it to Taiwan , where can they give their passion free rein ?  
The most common complaint for children is respiratory infections . This is because local residents have not yet learned to pay close attention to public health norms . People spit wherever they want , while the houses let in little sunlight and have poor ventilation , so children are much more likely to get infected and it is correspondingly difficult to cure them .  
These instruments are not only the main characters in Indian music and dance but are also a principal medium for honoring the gods and entertaining people . And the erotic paintings that cause people to blush at the museum are not only expressions of human carnal desires . They are even better illustrations of the many-layered Indian religious philosophy , which holds that gods rose out of the common human world .  
In 1896 , Hirata Gengo came to Peitou on the recommendation of a friend . He originally came for the curative effects of the hot springs , but then established the first hot springs hotel , " Tengu Cabin . " After that , all kinds of luxurious and sophisticated establishments for visitors to the springs lined both banks of Peitou Creek . The common people , however , preferred to enjoy the hot springs via Peitou Creek 's open-air Tang Lung Bathing Pool .  
The situation is quite different in mainland China , where it is common for writers-both the famous and the unheralded-to have the same piece published some dozen times in publications large and small around the country . Relative to the cost of living , the writing fees there are quite ample , and writers who produce enough work should definitely be able to make a living off their writing . Under the circumstances , the publishing industry has tremendous potential and should move in the direction of the European and American models .  
The 2003 Asia-Pacific Arts Forum marked another step in cooperation between the Council for Cultural Affairs ( CCA ) and NTUA , following on the 2000 Asia-Pacific Traditional Arts Forum . The Arts Forum , specially coordinated with the CCA 's 2003 " Creative Culture Industry Year , " devoted special attention to culture not only as an end in itself but also as an economic activity . It aimed to encourage discussion about the common problems facing the development of indigenous cultures and cultural industries in the Asia-Pacific region .  
Perhaps the most common ceramic product was the teapot . After Taiwan 's economy started growing by leaps and bounds in the 1970s , enjoyment of fine teas became a popular pastime , and one for which the teapot was indispensable . A number of outstanding teapot masters appeared on the scene to meet the demand . Consciousness of the existence of pottery as an art , however , has led potters since the 1990s to look beyond the teapot and explore the other creative possibilities open to them .  
Analyses of suicide have shown that the most common contributing factor is mental illness , but of the broad range of mental illnesses only a few display a close link to suicide . Among these are depression , bipolar disorder , schizophrenia , borderline personality and antisocial disorders , alcoholism , and drug abuse .  
The town charter , carved on a black tablet in front of the town hall , is less a set of regulations than a gentle reminder of the townsfolk 's common ideals , and the Shikatsu Historical and Folklore Museum , situated behind the town hall , could be considered a physical manifestation of these very ideals .  
Ko Tsang-ming explains that neurofibromatosis is a common autosomal dominant inherited single-gene disorder .

Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
The relative success of the Federation in protecting the international civil servant against gross political interference by one member country did not mean that , overnight , FICSA became a respected interlocutor of the management in the common system organizations .  
Initially , i.e . , before the establishment of ICSC 20 years ago , these relationship agreements tying the specialized agencies to the United Nations through adherence to " a single unified international civil service " ( later termed " United Nations common system " ) were intended to be between equals .  
The Group of 77 and China were unable to share the view that the current cash-flow problem was somehow linked to the existing systems of assessment , which were the incremental result of shared experience and common understanding .  
Strongly support United Nations , regional and national efforts on arms control , limitation and disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , in all aspects , and other weapons of mass destruction , including biological and chemical weapons and other forms of particularly excessively injurious or indiscriminate weapons , in pursuit of our common commitment to a world free of all these weapons ;  
For their part , Member States will pursue and take responsibility for reforming that system .  NULLWe recognize that our common work will be the more successful if it is supported by all concerned actors of the international community , including non-governmental organizations , multilateral financial institutions , regional organizations and all actors of civil society .  
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
Conscious of the forthcoming tenth anniversary of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which became the largest technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
We recognize that our common work will be the more successful if it is supported by all concerned actors of the international community , including non-governmental organizations , multilateral financial institutions , regional organizations and all actors of civil society . 
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to cooperate more closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue cooperation in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation ;  
We recognize that our common work will be the more successful if it is supported by all concerned actors of the international community , including non-governmental organizations , multilateral financial institutions , regional organizations and all actors of civil society .

their field of activity - telecommunications , atomic energy , patent law , education , agriculture , health , aviation , postal services or trade - the shared concern of the organizations of the common system was loss of competitiveness in relation to other international organizations and national civil services .  
delegation considered that decision unjustified , since it linked the basic level of remuneration in the common system to non-representative remuneration levels in selected subsectors of the United States federal civil service .  
By its resolution 48 / 75 F of 16 December 1993 , the General Assembly recognized that illicit arms trafficking is a disturbing , dangerous and increasingly common phenomenon and that , with the technical sophistication and destructive capability of conventional weapons , the destabilizing effects of illicit arms trafficking increase .  
The Board 's analysis of country offices in the biennium established the common causes of unsatisfactory implementation as political instability , frequent changes in the leadership of implementing partners , delayed delivery of supplies , unrealistic project targets and late receipt of funds .  
The various protagonists must understand that only a new political agreement , based on ordinary common sense , with respect for the intangible principles of democracy , human rights and fundamental freedoms , will contribute to an acceptable solution to all .  
Therefore , assistance to promote economic development in African countries that are committed to the democratization of their institutions will result in the emergence of new political classes that are protected from need and that will be more likely to regard politics as a means of governing a community of men and women who are bound by a territory and a common destiny than as the only means to get ahead in an economically poor environment .  
Nevertheless , just as we understand that the world has changed , that there is a new international agenda governed by the common concerns of all peoples over environment preservation , population growth , respect for human rights , strengthening of democratic systems , recognition of women 's rights , and the social and economic development of nations , we also understand that this Organization must be renewed and readapted to the new world circumstances . 
This interrelatedness of interests has formed a sort of common culture among nations and has created a favourable climate for the exchange of ideas and the tools of knowledge , thus enabling cultural and intellectual interaction among peoples of the world and enhancing a deeper understanding of the bases of world peace and security , an objective which the United Nations has sought to achieve over the past five decades .  
The main purposes of the United Nations , as outlined in Chapter I of the Charter , include the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and also to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends .  
I am confident that the United Nations will continue to do its best to act as a catalyst in the achievement of peaceful coexistence among States , and to reinforce the notion of the interdependence of national aspirations and the common welfare of humanity , thus creating conditions conducive to the political stability and sustainable economic development of States .  
The goals of sustained economic growth , social development , environmental protection and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms set in the plans of action of several international conferences have sustainable development as their common denominator .  
In the meantime , we are pleased that the five major international summits organized by the United Nations , ranging from the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 to Habitat II in Istanbul earlier this year , have proved to be useful in enabling Member States to focus on the various aspects of development and to cultivate a common vision and a comprehensive strategy for cooperation among themselves .  
At the conclusion of the series of high-level world Conferences organized under the auspices of the United Nations in the course of the 1990s , we noted that their common denominator was the promotion of economic and social justice , with the fundamental objective of approaching the structural causes of poverty in a concerted manner .  
In this context , we believe that the current session of the General Assembly must approach with daring and political resolve all current issues of common concern , including those in the areas of international peacekeeping and security and the healing of the economic and social crisis that afflicts the developing world .  
The evident behavioural characteristics of this menace , disguised behind appealing facades , can be summarized in the following manner : first , there is unilateralism , which means a total lack of commitment to mutual cooperation and common solutions , and complete reliance on unilateral measures in various fields .  
Turbay ( Colombia ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : As stated in the draft resolution before us today , the United Nations must be the centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of common ends such as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
In conclusion , convinced that effective , ongoing cooperation between the United Nations and the IPU is fundamental to the achievement of the foregoing common objectives , my delegation looks forward to the annual inclusion of this item in the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly .  
This is because of the close interrelationship and joint interests among members of the international community and the common destiny that binds us together once we recognize that we live in a global village in which geographic borders can not protect others from the physical or mental effects of those problems .  
The report of the Secretary-General on this item ( A / 51 / 381 ) is especially helpful in that it recalls the need to continue cooperation in their common search for solutions to global problems relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation .  
It clearly portrays the endeavours of the United Nations system in implementing General Assembly resolution 50 / 17 of 20 November 1995 , which requested the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation , as well as to continue to expand the parameters of this cooperation in response to the growing needs of our common member States . 
A common understanding of shared objectives by the agencies involved and a willingness to support the Emergency Relief Coordinator and the Department of Humanitarian Affairs are crucial to ensuring an effective , timely and coordinated response to emergencies .  
We should study that document in depth in order to determine the extent to which the mandates established by Member States have been carried out and to enable Member States to establish common priorities in the context of the major political , economic , social administrative and financial issues on the agenda of the Organization .  
This is because their genuine efforts to achieve a just and lasting peace in the region have in recent months met with grave and hostile incidents provoked by the occupying Power with an aggressive and dangerous policy that threatens the course of the peace process in the region .  It is common knowledge that all of this is possible thanks to the support Israel continues to receive from the United States , which has never concealed its determination to veto in the Security Council any resolution that contains firm statements against Israel 's conduct in the Middle East .  
Peace should have prevailed in the post-cold-war world , in which equal members of the international community should respect each other 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , refrain from invading each other or interfering in each other 's internal affairs , and live in harmony with each other , in a spirit of seeking common ground and putting aside differences .  
From the plundering of the oceans , the common heritage of mankind , by unsustainable fishing to the destruction of forests , the poisoning of air and water in disregard for environmental sustainability ; the destruction of communities , marginalization of whole segments of societies and eventually , civil unrest attributable to social unsustainability ; the world has seen the importance of pursuing sustainable development , whether in developed or developing countries or the economies in transition .  
There may be no other single individual who has been as instrumental or as effective in leading the world community in recent years in the difficult search for common ground , particularly on issues relating to environmentally sustainable development .  
After 14 years of consideration of this item in this Committee , my delegation is gratified that the international community now has a better understanding of this remote and pristine continent and of the need for collective efforts to protect this fragile and vulnerable environment for the common benefit of humankind . 
The Working Group entrusted with this issue should also strive to reach an understanding on the possibility of harmonizing legal norms and existing national administrative procedures in the area of domestic control of weapons and in the import and export of arms , in order to establish a common and effective international arms control system that would make it impossible for arms to be diverted through clandestine or illicit channels .  
Themes found in both the guidelines and the common advocacy statement include putting people first ; promoting sustainable human development ; reducing gender inequality and inequity ; fostering accountability and transparency ; developing common indicators that are critical to the monitoring of programme impact ; strengthening country-level collaboration ; enhancing national capacity-building ; and facilitating dialogue between and among the United Nations resident coordinator system , Governments , non-governmental organizations , the private sector and civil society . 
Whereas in the past , neighbouring States had been wary of South Africa 's military strength , South Africa 's current deliberate policy of transparency and the concerted use of common resources to ensure regional stability should form the basis for fruitful cooperation between States in the future .  
At its second regular session of 1982 , the Council decided to identify , at its annual organizational session , a subject relating to interregional cooperation , of common interest to all regions , for detailed consideration under the agenda item on regional cooperation and to request the executive secretaries of the regional commissions to submit their joint recommendations in this regard to the Council at its annual organizational session ( decision 1982 / 174 ) .  
It established the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities of industrialized and developing countries in achieving sustainable development and made clear the responsibility of the developed countries for examining and changing their own consumption and production levels . 
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
Following a technical consultation involving India and Pakistan that had been held at Vienna in July 1994 under the auspices of UNDCP , the Governments of those two States had agreed to meet at regular intervals at the policy and operational levels to review and determine common approaches on drug-related problems affecting their common borders , such as the movement of precursors and trafficking in heroin and other drugs , as well as to establish systems for the regular and systematic exchange of operational information .  
Conscious of the forthcoming tenth anniversary of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which became the largest technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
This has been a common phenomenon in forest history where the movement of unused species , in both temperate and tropical forests , moved from rejected to accepted and even to preferred status in the markets , without any assistance from trade policy measures .  
This initiative , supported by the Government of Jordan , is designed to create a community of potential future leaders who have shared a common training experience in global issues .  
While the largest proportion of activities fall into the traditional areas of administrative reform , training and financial systems improvement , it is increasingly common to receive requests from the field in emerging areas such as transparency , accountability , judicial and legislative administration , disaster management , electoral administration and result-oriented management based on productivity improvement .  
In seeking a common standard of achievement for all people and all countries in the area of human rights , the World Conference on Human Rights , held at Vienna from 14 to 25 June 1993 , called upon all nations , regions and the international community to create favourable conditions for and effective enjoyment of basic human rights .  
In addition to the common staff costs for international and local staff which were calculated based on standard scales , provision is also made for the repatriation of 80 international staff at the end of the Mission at the rate of $ 1,400 per person inclusive an allowance for 100 kilograms of unaccompanied excess baggage ( $ 112,000 ) . 
In this regard , they endorse the commitment made at the seventh meeting of the Andean Presidential Council to strengthen existing ties of cooperation with a view to developing common policies and actions to promote closer cooperation with other countries and regional groupings in order to pursue a concerted , comprehensive effort to combat all of the crimes related to the phenomenon of drugs and illicit substances , including their production , distribution and consumption ; money-laundering ; the diversion of chemical precursors ; and illegal trade in light arms .  
In the same resolution , the Secretary-General was requested to seek cooperation and to join efforts with other international , global and regional organizations and mechanisms that have played an active role in combating money-laundering in order to reinforce common regulatory and enforcement strategies in that area .  
Stress the need to develop a greater range of more attractive positive measures , such as effective instruments to facilitate financial and technology transfers to developing countries in order to assist them to meet multilaterally agreed targets , in keeping with the principle of common but differentiated responsibility ; and recommend that positive measures are preferable to the threat of the use of trade restrictions to secure compliance with the objectives of the MEA .  
48 Argentina has pointed out the merits of common regional strategies and measures against organized transnational crime , while Australia , Canada , Philippines , Republic of Korea and Turkey have drawn attention to the growing number of their bilateral agreements on extradition and mutual assistance in criminal matters .  
Cuban legislation has made association with criminal intent an offence and has proscribed as punishable offences those types of behaviour associated with the most common forms of organized transnational crime , but has made no provision for controlled deliveries and electronic surveillance .  
Japan is of the view that , although it is necessary to consider the formulation of extensive and comprehensive measures , including the preparation of legal norms , in order to standardize the systems of Member States against organized crime , it hardly appears that there is currently an adequate common understanding among Member States regarding the actual pattern of illegal activity in question .  
It emphasized that the principle of a common but differentiated responsibility for developing and developed countries , as outlined in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development , should be applied in any development of measures to protect the atmosphere on a global scale .  
We have always held the view that the progress achieved jointly by the Israelis and the Palestinians for the peace and common prosperity of the region is undeniable proof that any regional dispute , no matter how deep-seated and complex , can eventually be solved through dialogue between the parties directly concerned .  
Those who considered that the question deserved prompt consideration by the Commission stressed that rules concerning the nationality of legal persons might be more common in State practice and customary law , thus lending themselves more easily to systematization , in contrast to the striking absence of specific provisions on the nationality of natural persons in the context of State succession in the legislation of the majority of States .  
Croatia reported a total of 2,064 offences committed involving firearms in 1994 , including 135 murders or attempted murders , 28 cases resulting in serious physical injuries , 375 cases involving crime against common safety , 352 aggravated robberies , 420 cases involving illegal possession of weapons and 30 cases involving concealment of weapons .  
" The relevant provisions of General Assembly resolutions relating to common premises and services in the field should be further submitted by the specialized agencies to their respective governing bodies , which should provide more precise legislative authority to their secretariats on the subject of this report in fulfilment of their treaty obligations under the relationship agreements they have concluded and ratified with the United Nations . "  
ACC members shared the position expressed by the Secretary-General in his report on the triennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system , cited in paragraph 1 above . a / The General Assembly in paragraph 42 of resolution 47 / 199 , recognized the cost factor and indicated that common premises and the consolidation of administrative infrastructures should be achieved without increasing the costs for the United Nations system or for developing countries .  
These include unwanted and unsafe sex ( giving rise to teenage pregnancy , HIV infection and other sexually transmitted diseases ) ; psychoactive substance use , including tobacco and alcohol ; violence and accidents ; and poor nutrition and certain common endemic diseases .  
In developing further the orientation and objectives of national strategies , the Commission may wish to focus on the identification of characteristics of poverty which could be common to most countries , regardless of their definition of poverty and which could be used to measure progress ; the identification of elements for elaborating national strategies comprising macroeconomic , structural , distributional and regulatory policies , together with specific short - and long-term objectives ; and the further identification of specific international actions .  
The regional integration process reveals the simultaneous rise of unidimensional or limited integration agreements , the aim of which is to free markets for goods , services and factors of production ( with the exception of the work force ) , and multidimensional or broad integration agreements , which have already reached the stage of customs unions and which aim at common markets and economic unions and at coordinated , harmonized and even joint policies .  
By providing a unique platform for dialogue , the United Nations helps to articulate shared values , enhance common understanding , elaborate multilateral agreements on norms and standards , and promote practical cooperation on a broad range of issues ;  
The meeting was convened to pursue a common ambition to achieve universal access to basic social services over an ambitious but realistic time period , by reorienting existing and mobilizing additional resources as well as increasing cost-effectiveness , efficiency and quality in service delivery .  
Although at times difficult political , economic and technical problems had to be solved , common sense and the two sides ' commitment to their international obligations always won out .  
The paramount task in the settlement of conflicts is the formation of a common economic area , the all-round development of trade and economic and scientific and technical cooperation , the implementation of joint projects in the field of telecommunications , construction , transport , fuel and energy and environmental protection , and the encouragement of investment and trade on the basis of the universally recognized principles of international law , bearing in mind cultural and historical ties .  
At the same time , the financial benefits of common premises are not evident in all cases , particularly if a move into joint premises can not fully accommodate all operational requirements , or if various current premises are provided by the Government free of charge as part of its in-kind contribution to the organizations , or if opportunities for appropriate premises are scarce and initial costs of moving are significant .  
As we move into the twenty-first century , we offer a positive vision of sustainable human settlements , a sense of hope for our common future and an exhortation to join a truly worthwhile and engaging challenge , that of building together a world where everyone can live in a safe home with a promise of a decent life of dignity , good health , safety , happiness and hope .  
Moreover , the inaction of the institutions responsible for investigating the appearance in public places of abandoned corpses , whose common characteristics conform to the modus operandi of " social cleansing " operations , supports reasonable doubts as to the existence of the clandestine structures referred to in commitment IV of the Comprehensive Agreement .  
Ethnic and religious tensions between Timorese and Indonesians had increased ; mass immigration of Indonesians into the territory of East Timor was continuing ; cases of torture , arbitrary detention , attacks , summary executions , disappearances and killings were becoming increasingly common ; the numbers and violence of the military and police forces were increasing , and many Timorese , especially young people , had become strangers in their own land and had been forced to seek asylum . 
We fully believe that through mutual good will , realism and observance of international commitments , the tendencies aiming at the maintenance of tension in the region will be defeated and a sound political decision in favour of peace and stability and our good multi-purpose relations with the fraternal Republic of Tajikistan will prevail , and no place will be left for the exchange of such notes where wisdom and common sense stand firm .  
Non-environmental related activities in plans of work for exploration .  With regard to the non-environment parameters of the contents of a plan of work for exploration , the review also revealed that , based on considerations such as annual periodic reports of the registered pioneer investors , it would be very useful to come to a common understanding on their achievements and to establish reasonable performance targets during the 15-year period of an approved plan of work for exploration .  
In Brazil , for example , the National Confederation of Health-care Cooperatives ( Unimed do Brasil ) has grown from a single cooperative set up in 1967 to a business complex now comprising 304 provider-owned health cooperatives , many owning hospitals , organized in 17 State-level networks , and a national holding company that owns subsidiaries in insurance and provides bulk purchasing and common services for members ' hospitals and clinics ; data management and communications ; and training , research and development .  
The cooperative movement believes that democratic procedures applied to economic activities are feasible , desirable and efficient , and that democratically elected economic organizations make a contribution to the common good .  
A cooperative is an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic , social and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise .  
Accordingly , with the aim of reconciling potential or actual conflicts in the event of the development of multiple uses and of providing for the optimum rational development of a common source to the benefit of each State in whose territory any part of the system is situated , it has become necessary to focus on the question of the concept of the drainage basin .  
Ensuring common measurement and assessment standards and methods worldwide is part of the framework of the preparation of FRA 2000 , and some of the parameters to be assessed are directly related to indicators of sustainable forest management at the national level identified in the four main international processes .  
If sustainable forest management as conceptualized at the international level is to be widely implemented at the national level on a lasting basis , international solidarity in the sharing of technologies , know-how and information and in making resources available to meet common needs must receive increased attention .  
This initiative , supported by the Government of Jordan , is designed to create a community of potential future leaders who have shared a common training experience in global issues .  
Moreover , since there were wide variations in the actual vacancy rates in different duty stations , and the standard cost of each post differed in terms of post adjustment and the percentage attributable to common staff costs , the Board considered that the adoption of a uniform vacancy rate for formulation of budgetary proposals for staff costs was likely to give rise to significant inaccuracies ( A / 51 / 5 ( Vol . I ) , sect .  
Alternative intellectual property rights regimes suitable for the needs of local communities that collectively possess TFRK have been proposed , taking into account the way in which traditional knowledge is acquired as the common property of a people and hence constitutes an integral and inalienable feature of its culture .  
Holders of TFRK will need to feel secure in their land tenure arrangements ; reassured that they have been accorded status equal to that of the other members of the partnerships ; convinced of a common purpose compatible with their cultural and ecological values .  
If two adjoining countries do not agree on a set of common rules on how goods passing through each other 's territory will be treated , then national law will prevail in each case , and a motor vehicle , for example , might be subject to multiple unnecessary inspections , might require different insurance coverage , might be subject to special license requirements , etc .  
We agree to support ongoing and new creative partnerships , recognizing that indigenous people , youth and other disadvantaged and vulnerable groups possess in common the potential for diverse realization of full human development .  
The pool of non-retirees , particularly for specific language combinations and / or functions , is limited for two reasons : first , the Organization must ensure that the freelancers it recruits meet the same high standards required of established language staff ; and , second , the United Nations must compete on the freelance market with other organizations both within and outside the common system who in some cases can be more stable or financially advantageous sources of employment .  
No one fully knows how deep and friendly are the relations that link the Egyptian people with the Sudanese people : their ties are as old as the Nile , are enhanced by geographical proximity , neighbourly relations , a common language , the similarity of their social customs and the human relations between the two peoples in the Nile valley since time immemorial .  
Regarding the proposed United Nations humanitarian programme for Somalia , the United Nations agencies at the country level have embarked on an inter-agency analytical and consultative process with a view to defining and reaching consensus on the role of the United Nations in the country over the medium-term , reflecting a common system-wide vision and outlining a set of broad objectives and strategies .  
The objective should be , therefore , to develop a common methodology that could be used by the affected States in preparing the explanatory material for their requests for assistance , as well as by the United Nations system , the international financial institutions and the donor community in considering how their assistance activities may be helpful to mitigate the special economic problems of those States .  
Urges the funds and programmes of the United Nations system to finalize work on the harmonization of their budget presentations in time for a final decision to be made by their respective executive boards in advance of the biennium 1998-1999 , and to include in this work a common presentational framework for the budget based on agreed definitions and usage of budget terms and the identification of additional steps required for further harmonization and improved transparency ;  
Reaffirms the need to raise the target for common premises on a case-by-case basis , taking into account cost-benefit analysis and operational sustainability , using lessons learned during the implementation of this request and avoiding an increased burden on host countries ; requests the funds and programmes of the United Nations system to develop a plan of action , administrative arrangements and a time-frame for the implementation of this request ; and encourages the United Nations specialized agencies and regional offices to share those common premises where practicable ;  
The programme on education for peace , human rights , democracy and international understanding provided a meaningful contribution to the struggle against terrorism inasmuch as it promoted thinking and behaviour based on common humanistic and cultural values .  
UNICEF 's review of country experiences where remarkable social progress has been achieved shows that their common features include strong political commitment to the well-being of children , widespread community participation in the delivery of basic social services and the allocation of adequate resources to the cause of children .  
The meeting was convened to express a mutual commitment and pursue a common ambition to achieve universal access to basic social services by reorienting existing and mobilizing additional resources as well as increasing cost-effectiveness , efficiency and quality in service delivery . 
The High Commissioner 's participation in the sixth extraordinary session of the Islamic Conference on Bosnia and Herzegovina and her subsequent visit to OIC headquarters at Jeddah constituted a step forward in the two organizations ' common search for humanitarian solutions to the increasingly complex refugee situation in the OIC member States . 
The majority of the Expert Group concluded that while changes in the direction of harmonization with the 1993 SNA and BPM5 may be introduced , radical and rapid change is not possible because of expected continued reliance on customs-based documents that record the movement of goods across borders as the most common source of data .  Such harmonization should , however , be treated as a longer-term objective .  
Danish development policy is an integral part of Danish foreign policy , in which the main objectives are , inter alia : promotion of common security , promotion of democratic government and human rights , creation of economic and social development and ensuring ecologically sustainable development .  
The Council , in its resolution 1995 / 11 of 24 July 1995 , requested the Secretary-General to seek cooperation and to join efforts with other international , global and regional organizations and mechanisms that have played an active role in combating money laundering in order to reinforce common regulatory and enforcement strategies in that area .  
In order to facilitate the proper initial functioning of the common institutions , my Office , in collaboration with a number of international organizations , is preparing a quick start package comprising the minimal legislative basis for the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina to operate .  
The political leadership now has the opportunity to ensure that , in particular through the functioning of common institutions at the national level , all three communities can work towards the consolidation of a sovereign and united Bosnia and Herzegovina based on the rule of law , respect for the human rights of all peoples and the development of a representative democracy .  
The goal of the Peace Agreement has been commonly understood by the international community as being to restore peace and stability to Bosnia and Herzegovina as a sovereign , unified country composed of two entities with unprecedented autonomy , united through common governing institutions resulting from free and fair elections .  
The information received recently by the Special Rapporteur hardly suggests any improvement in the treatment of detainees in prisons and detention centres , which he described in earlier reports .  11 / Those reports give an account of the overcrowding , terrible sanitary conditions , inadequate and substandard food , limited medical care , beatings , restrictions on family visits , the problems of having common criminals share living quarters with political prisoners , and the jailing of many political prisoners far from their home towns , which makes contact with their families extremely difficult .  
In that connection , based on the updated deployment table contained in annex V , the inclusion of 8 additional international staff and 25 local staff for six months , the application of the Zagreb salary scales for local staff as at 1 July 1996 and the inclusion under common staff costs of provision for contributions to the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund for local staff , the net reduction to civilian staff costs is only $ 642,000 .  
The Government of Mauritius stated that the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities were guaranteed through a combination of constitutional provisions , which were fully compatible with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , statutory legislation and common law .  
It was emphasized that the establishment and maintenance of unimpeded contacts among persons belonging to a national minority , as well as contacts across frontiers by persons belonging to a national minority with persons with whom they share a common ethnic or national origin , cultural heritage or religious belief , contributes to mutual understanding and promotes good neighbourly relations .  
Recalling that the purposes of the United Nations are , inter alia , to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , and to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends ,  
Since many questions and misunderstandings surround the definitions and content of the terminologies of sects , new religious movements and even formal religion and since in international practice confusion reigns and States may have diametrically opposed attitudes to the same group , raising it to formal religious status or pejoratively classifying it as a sect , the Special Rapporteur feels that an international high-level governmental conference should be held to study and decide upon a common approach to sects and religions that respects human rights . 
Recalling that the purposes of the United Nations are , inter alia , to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , and to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends ,  
It is important that an effective mechanism be established , so that international actors and the authorities can discuss issues of common concern on a regular basis , share information on current activities and take joint decisions , especially on how best to meet the needs of vulnerable groups .  
Our ultimate objective in pursuing these reforms is to bring about a democratic , representative , dynamic and revitalized Security Council which will be more relevant to the common problems we all face .  
Recalling also that , in view of the different contributions to global environmental degradation , States have common but differentiated responsibilities , and standards applied by some countries may be inappropriate or of unwarranted economic and social cost to other countries ,  
Calls upon the international community to apply , where necessary , the principle of common but differentiated responsibility in ongoing international cooperation on the protection of the environment and in efforts to implement existing instruments of international environmental law and the elaboration of new instruments , and to continue to take fully into account specific circumstances and requirements , in particular , those of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , thus facilitating their compliance with their obligations under international agreements ;  
We hope that the effective cooperation between the two organizations in the field of the gradual development and codification of international law and in other areas of common concern can be further enhanced so that a positive contribution can be made to the promotion of friendly cooperation among countries , the maintenance of world peace and security , common prosperity for all societies , and the achievement of a just and sound new international order based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence and the spirit of the Bandung Conference .  
While the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s ( UN-NADAF ) , which was adopted by the General Assembly by resolution 46 / 151 of 18 December 1991 , represented a global compact between African countries on the one hand and the international community on the other , the conclusions and recommendations of the Ad Hoc Committee submitted for adoption at this session constitute a set of common and complementary objectives and targets to be implemented in an integrated manner and in a spirit of full partnership .  
Also recognizing the critical problems common to human settlements in the developing countries , including poverty , unemployment , social disintegration , inadequate shelter and lack of proper maintenance of urban and infrastructure and services ,  
Recalling that the purposes of the United Nations are , inter alia , to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends ,  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue cooperation in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation ;  
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
It supported proposals which allowed the Secretariat to have a greater capacity to conduct feasibility studies of options for the consideration of the Security Council ; translate mandates into achievable concepts of operations ; provide timely advice and support to the field and meaningful feedback to the Security Council ; and develop doctrines and operational concepts , standing operational procedures and related common terminology for United Nations peacekeeping operations .

Recommendations and decisions of ICSC or resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly concerning the conditions of service of common system staff were not automatically binding , for the following reasons : the organizations were in different financial and budgetary situations ; staff recruitment and retention difficulties varied ; and each common system organization was an independent and sovereign intergovernmental organization and should have the final word regarding the conditions of service of its staff .  
In order to implement Agenda 21 in a satisfactory manner , it was imperative to create conditions for environmental protection and sustainable development at both the national and international levels and ensure compliance with common but differentiated responsibilities .  
Calls upon the Government of Myanmar and other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully the obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , [ 117 ] to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population and to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law , and to avail itself of such services as may be offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;

Also recognizing the critical problems common to human settlements in the developing countries , including poverty , unemployment , social disintegration , inadequate shelter and lack of proper maintenance of urban and rural infrastructure and services ,  
" Recalling also that , in view of the different contributions to global environmental degradation , States have common but differentiated responsibilities , and standards applied by some countries may be inappropriate or of unwarranted economic and social cost to other countries ,  
Calls upon the international community to apply , where necessary , the principle of common but differentiated responsibility in ongoing international cooperation on the protection of the environment and in efforts to implement existing instruments of international environmental law and the elaboration of new instruments , and to continue to take fully into account specific circumstances and requirements , in particular , those of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , thus facilitating their compliance with their obligations under international agreements ;  
It had emphasized that the special needs and concerns of participating organizations should be addressed within the framework of the common system , and had stressed the importance of maintaining a coherent and unified system . 
Europe possesses what is essential for achieving this - a space with a single world-view extending from Vancouver to Vladivostok , where the bipolar world no longer exists and a common value system based on the philosophy of democratic liberalism and respect for human rights is being established . 
This Declaration reflected the central goals of a common , comprehensive , indivisible security zone free from demarcation lines ; security ; cooperation between the OSCE and other international organizations to achieve these goals ; recognition that no single organization , State or group can bear the predominant responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and stability in the OSCE region ; and recognition of the importance of States complying with their obligations regarding national minorities .  
Our common goal is to ensure that , while keeping and promoting this positive trend , we are vigilant and active in order to contribute together to the maintenance of peace , the establishment and consolidation of democratic societies based on the rule of law and respect for human and minority rights , social development and the promotion of international cooperation .

Regional cooperation should be encouraged through the development of a common strategic framework for the exploitation of opportunities involving space technologies to meet regional needs , including the networking of existing and planned national and regional centres of excellence .  
CARICOM countries had assumed primary responsibility , while fully conscious that the ultimate success of their efforts could only be guaranteed within a framework of international cooperation and partnership based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibility .

Invites the executive heads of the organizations of the common system to develop and submit proposals , as a matter of priority , to their relevant intergovernmental bodies on the possibility of introducing performance awards or bonuses to a limited number of staff in recognition of their outstanding performance and specific achievements in a given year , and to coordinate , to the extent possible , these proposals with those developed by the Secretary-General ;  
Requests the Commission to take the lead in analysing new approaches in the human resources management field so as to develop standards , methods and arrangements that will respond to the specific needs , especially regarding future staffing , of the organizations of the common system including , inter alia , consideration of flexible contractual arrangements , performance-based pay and the introduction of special occupational pay rates , and to report to the General Assembly thereon at its fifty-third session .  Replace the tables in paragraph ( b ) ( i ) by the following :

While today 's major challenges are undeniably global in character , it is at the local level where their impact is felt most directly , which is why local authorities , such as mayors and metropolitan officials , have become notably more active on global issues and , in some cases , collectively organized across countries on matters of common concern .  
The Committee will continue , especially during the transitional period and until a fair , satisfactory solution is achieved , to strive to achieve maximum effectiveness in the implementation of its mandate and to adjust its work programme in the light of developments in order to continue to contribute , to the extent possible , to the realization of the common United Nations objective of achieving a just and lasting solution to the question of Palestine .  
The paradigm of sustainable development , based on economic growth that is sustained , socially equitable and ecologically viable , constitutes the common denominator on which the international community now agrees in order to give new direction to the collective search for the economic and social well-being of our peoples .  
The agreement expands cooperation to new fields , such as preventive diplomacy , the maintenance and consolidation of peace and , pursuant to paragraph 4 of resolution 50 / 3 , all subjects of common interest in the political , economic , social , scientific and cultural fields .  
Many times during the biennial conferences held since 1986 the Heads of State and Government of countries that use French as a common language one country out of four in the world have recognized the role of multilateralism in the new international context and confirmed their will to help find a solution to global political and economic problems .  
It describes the endeavours of the United Nations system in implementing General Assembly resolution 51 / 18 of 14 November 1996 , which requested the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue cooperation in their common search for solutions to global problems relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation , as well as to continue to expand the parameters of this cooperation in response to the growing needs of our common member States .  
However , be they federal or unitary , presidential or parliamentary , they all embody a set of essential common values , inter alia , the freedom of citizens to express themselves through free and transparent elections , and the active development and strengthening of civil society .  
All countries should increase their mutually beneficial cooperation in the economic field , eliminate unequal practices in trade and economic relations , and do away with discriminatory policies with a view to gradually narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor and achieving common prosperity .  
I am certain that the First Committee can make a significant contribution towards the attainment of our common objective : a world free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and a greatly reduced level of conventional weapons .  
The conditions that prevailed prior to the establishment of the zones included , inter alia , peaceful relations and mutual confidence , economic cooperation and a general belief in the enhancement of common interests through institutional regional frameworks .  
Let the message go back to the various capitals , to non-governmental organizations and to all stakeholders that the achievement of sustainable development requires nothing less than action that integrates economic , environmental and social components into decision-making and programmes , and the resurgence of a true global partnership based on common but differentiated responsibilities .  
The process for elaborating a common vision , as outlined in document E / CN . 16 / 1997 / CRP . 2 , should be anchored in effective international cooperation , with a recognized role and responsibility for the United Nations system ; should bridge conceptual and practical issues ; and should combine both global and regional dimensions .  
A useful model for developing improved partnerships with non-governmental organizations is the PARinAC initiative of UNHCR , which emphasizes the formulation of common principles and goals and the creation of an umbrella framework for action and extensive consultative processes involving non-governmental organizations at the country , regional and international levels .  
Whereas the Constitution in force since 1986 sets forth the responsibility of the State , as the expression of the legal and political organization of society , for promoting the common good and the consolidation of the rule of legality , security , justice , equality , freedom and peace , and defines as a central concern the promotion of the full enjoyment of human rights within a stable , permanent and popular institutional order in which governed and government act with absolute adherence to the law ,  
Also in relation to the clause mentioned in paragraph 20 , the National Reconciliation Act shall extinguish criminal liability for related common crimes committed in the armed conflict , such crimes being defined as those which are directly , objectively , intentionally and causally related to the commission of the political crimes referred to in the preceding paragraph and which can not be shown to be motivated by personal goals .  
In respect of persons who were involved in the internal armed conflict owing to institutional mandates , the National Reconciliation Act shall contain specific provisions equivalent to those previously mentioned , in that they shall extinguish criminal liability for common crimes perpetrated with the aim of preventing , thwarting , suppressing or punishing the commission of political crimes and related common crimes , where such crimes were directly , objectively , intentionally and causally related to that aim , unless it is demonstrated that there is no relationship between the criminal act and the stated aim .  
None of the parties to the conflict has fulfilled the obligations arising from article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions , and serious violations of its provisions have occurred , including attempts on life and physical integrity , homicide , torture , taking of hostages , outrages upon personal dignity and arbitrary arrests , including arrests of wounded and sick people , without the justification of military necessity .  
Improving these pragmatic arrangements appears to be less costly and more effective for the time being than undertaking a radical reform of common services , unless convincing proof is offered to the contrary .  
Also recognizing the critical problems common to human settlements in the developing countries , including poverty , unemployment , social disintegration , inadequate shelter and lack of proper maintenance of urban and rural infrastructure and services ,  
This acknowledgement is given concrete meaning through the incorporation of the legal principle of common but differentiated responsibility in paragraph 4 of article 20 , which makes the obligations and commitments of developing countries contingent upon the effective implementation by developed country Parties of their commitments under the Convention related to financial resources and transfer of technology .  This overriding priority is apparent in every aspect of the development and implementation of the Convention 's principles .  
Underlines the responsibility of the parties to cooperate fully and in good faith in the prompt formation and functioning of all the new common institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and in establishing the necessary conditions for holding democratic , free and fair democratic local elections in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Peace Agreement ;  
This should include appropriate delegation of authority , enhancement of the capacity of the staff through training and the provision of a stable resource base to ensure the continuous presence of an institutional critical mass .  A first step in that direction would be for Headquarters to provide urgent assistance by assigning to Nairobi for one month a senior administrator with proven experience in the establishment and functioning of United Nations common services outputs ( SP-96-001-19 ) .  
This Government is necessary not just because it will symbolize the participation of all political parties represented in the Parliament , but because it establishes an important starting point for efforts to strengthen still fragile balances and constitutes a special forum for joint action that can help the taking of decisions devoted to the common management of national affairs .  
The new UNDP structure will reflect an effort to recognize three distinct components or functions : headquarters , being those units whose functions concentrate on organizational policy , global advocacy , management oversight and quality control and global resource mobilization ; operating units , comprising the country offices and the regional bureaux ; and common administrative and financial services .  
Calls upon the Government of Myanmar and other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully the obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , [ 8 ] to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law and to avail itself of such services as may be offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
Holders of TFRK will need to be represented by their own representatives ; to feel secure in their land tenure arrangements ; to be reassured that they have been accorded status equal to that of the other members of the agreements ; and to be convinced of a common purpose compatible with their cultural and ecological values .  
Among the questions emerging on multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) , he referred to the range of policy instruments for achieving their objectives , their economic and developmental effects and the participation of developing countries in MEAs , taking into account the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities .  
Calls upon all parties to the hostilities to respect fully the applicable provisions of international humanitarian law including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , to halt the use of weapons , including landmines , against the civilian population and to protect all civilians , especially women , members of minorities and children , from violations of human rights and humanitarian law , including forcible displacement , arbitrary detention , ill _ treatment , torture and summary executions ;  
As a result of this initiative by Ethiopia , leaders of 26 Somali political organizations were able to meet for a high-level consultation in Sodere , Ethiopia , and after eight weeks of intensive , frank and responsible negotiations , agreed on a common course of action to resolve the crisis in their country and to put an end to the misery and suffering of their people .  
Several resident coordinators believe that a more effective collaboration in country operations should be encouraged both by Bretton Woods institutions and the United Nations system organizations at headquarters level , while another group of resident coordinators suggests that the Bretton Woods institutions be associated in the joint programming consultation of the United Nations system , through common participation in periodic meetings on programming and coordination , and regular consultation on planning and strategy issues .  
The entities within the United Nations system have an important role to play in developing a reference framework for the energy-related activities of the United Nations system based on a common understanding of a sustainable energy future , and thereby providing synergies to the activities . 3 Such a framework would promote a balanced and mutually reinforcing approach to economic , social and environmental aspects of sustainable energy development and foster partnerships for sustainable energy development with relevant actors outside the United Nations system , particularly with non-United Nations intergovernmental organizations dealing with energy and the private sector . 
These agreements constitute a starting point for a hemisphere-wide position on sustainable development - the cornerstone of a cooperative alliance among the States of the Americas in their common search for a better quality of life for their peoples , based on integrated , mutually reinforcing economic , social and environmental objectives .  
The Conference has been recognized as a forum for technical cooperation , technology transfer and programme coordination for the countries of the Americas region , providing government officials , planners , scientists and experts from the Americas and elsewhere with an opportunity to address common needs , problems and experiences in the field of surveying and mapping , cartography , hydrography , remote sensing , and land and geographical information systems , including educational and training aspects , scientific and technological requirements , implementation issues and benefits . 
A relatively intense internal armed conflict ( where it is assumed that the intensity of hostilities and the level of organization of the combatants is below that required by the above Protocol ) , in which case the provisions set forth in article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions apply .  
Given the complementary and non _ exclusive nature of the protective norms of international law , it is extremely important to consider the positive linkage that exists with international humanitarian law and , in particular , at what point article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions , which also establishes fundamental guarantees during internal armed conflicts , enters into force .  
The Special Rapporteur has drawn the attention of the Commission and the Sub-Commission to the incompatibility with international law and with the concurrent criteria established by it of some legislations _ generally inspired by common law and based on national security _ that authorize the adoption of exceptional measures ( such as prolonged administrative detentions , severe restrictions of freedom of expression , freedom of assembly and freedom to demonstrate , and which lay down severe penalties for any breach of them ) without the need to proclaim a state of emergency .  
In such cases , it is also common for the majority of the members of the judiciary to be removed from office and for the ordinary courts to be replaced by military courts to try people for alleged political offences , culminating in a Supreme Court of Justice that legalizes institutional acts or their equivalent , or confers a supra _ constitutional status on emergency rules adopted by the regime .  
An appeal by the special session to the Governments of the Russian Federation and the United States of America to consider the rational employment of their missile and nuclear potential as a contribution of these two countries to common efforts to ensure sustainable development and preservation of the natural environment of this earth ; to start - should the response of the two Governments be positive - developing relevant international programmes and projects ensuring respect for the regime of non-proliferation of nuclear and missile technologies and for intellectual property rights ;  
Having due regard to all relevant definitions of the practice of forced evictions under international human rights provisions and instruments , the present Guidelines apply to instances of forced evictions in which there are acts and / or omissions involving the coerced and involuntary removal of individuals , groups and communities from their homes and / or lands and common property resources they occupy or are dependent upon , thus eliminating or limiting the possibility of an individual , group or community residing or working in a particular dwelling , residence or place .  
The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung elucidated in an all-round way the questions on the founding of the DCRK , including the problem of forming a supreme national confederal assembly with an equal number of representatives from the north and the south and an appropriate number of representatives of overseas nationals under which a confederal standing committee is organized to discuss and decide on common issues related to the overall interests of the country and nation . 
Many of the overall civilian implementation tasks coordinated by my Office , such as the building of common institutions , supporting economic reconstruction , creating communications and transport links between the entities , and providing a basis for a functioning civil society are fundamental to creating the necessary conditions for the return of displaced persons and refugees .  
Deeply concerned at the continuing unstable and tense security conditions in the Gali region , characterized by acts of violence by armed groups , by armed robbery , and other common crime and , most seriously , by the laying of mines , including new types of mines , and deeply concerned also at the resulting lack of safety and security for the local populations , for the refugees and displaced persons returning to the region and for the personnel of UNOMIG and of the CIS peacekeeping force ,  
Deeply concerned at the continuing unstable and tense security conditions in the Gali region , characterized by acts of violence by armed groups , by armed robbery , and other common crime and , most seriously , by the laying of mines , including new types of mines , and deeply concerned also at the resulting lack of safety and security for the local populations , for the refugees and displaced persons returning to the region and for the personnel of UNOMIG and of the CIS peacekeeping force ,  
At a broad level , technical assistance , complemented by adequate financial support , should be provided to the least developed countries through the common and coordinated efforts of all donors , including international organizations such as WTO , UNCTAD , ITC , UNDP , the World Bank and IMF .  
She emphasized the importance of the work of the Ad Hoc Intergovernmental Panel on Forests , which would lay the foundations for building on the Intergovernmental Panel 's activities in five key areas : provision of clear and comprehensive directions to international organizations and instruments dealing with forests ; setting of common priorities ; regular measuring of collective progress towards sustainable forest management ; creation of an independent high-level political forum to provide governance on forest issues ; and participation of all interested parties .  
The High Contracting Parties , attaching importance to stable development and the effective exploitation of the economic potential of both States , shall cooperate in implementing the ongoing economic reforms on the basis of market relations , promote the intensification of economic integration between the two States , and create conditions for the establishment of a common economic space in accordance with their obligations under bilateral and multilateral treaties and agreements concluded by the High Contracting Parties within the framework of the Commonwealth of Independent States .  
The Member State also noted that the Secretary-Generals report categorized violence into economic exploitation , social / psychological violence , physical / sexual violence and violence resulting from operation of the legal system and pointed out that non-payment or delay in the payment of wages and / or violation of wages agreed to under contract had been highlighted as a common type of economic exploitation in receiving countries . 
Progress has been made in incorporating the principles contained in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development - including the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities , which embodies the important concept of and basis for international partnership ; the precautionary principle ; the polluter pays principle ; and the environmental impact assessment principle - in a variety of international and national legal instruments .  
While it is the primary responsibility of national Governments to achieve the economic , social and environmental objectives of Agenda 21 , it is essential that international cooperation be reactivated and intensified , recognizing , inter alia , the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities as set forth in Principle 7 of the Rio Declaration .  
Moreover , issues , including environmental issues , that bear on the international economic environment can be approached effectively only through a constructive dialogue and genuine partnership on the basis of mutuality of interests and benefits , taking into account that , in view of the different contributions to global environmental degradation , States have common but differentiated responsibilities . 
The General Assembly also invited the executive heads of the organizations of the common system to develop and submit proposals , to their relevant intergovernmental bodies , as a matter of priority , on the possibility of introducing performance awards or bonuses to a limited number of staff in recognition of their outstanding performance and specific achievements in a given year , and to coordinate , to the extent possible , those proposals with those developed by the Secretary-General .  
VIII . 177 .  The Advisory Committee was informed that the arrangements for common and joint services in Vienna that had been in place since 1979 and were based on a tripartite agreement between IAEA , UNIDO and the United Nations , have changed to the extent that certain programmes have become increasingly difficult to maintain at the previous levels .  
As the economic basis of security , all countries and regions should , on the basis of equality and mutual benefit , promote trade , economic and technological cooperation and scientific and cultural exchanges among themselves , with a view to narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor and achieving common prosperity and development .  
While the formulation of common standards for prudential oversight and management of risk situations and efforts to involve developing countries and countries with transition economies were welcome , States remained responsible for the establishment of a stable and predictable national environment for foreign investment .  
The factors for promoting an international environment conducive to development included the creation and maintenance of peaceful and stable economic conditions , democratization and the establishment of open , common , fair and transparent rules that offered equal opportunities for all .  
It is therefore our common task and responsibility to seize this historic opportunity , provided by the present international environment , to work together for the total elimination of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and for the regulation and control of other conventional tools of killing .  
He indicated that in support of the devolution of responsibility to the most effective managerial level , in some carefully defined areas , consolidation provided considerable cost saving and other administrative benefits and could also result in more effective services , including those provided through the establishment of a common services facility , an area in which work was already proceeding . 
Those organizations had been in general agreement that an accurate and transparent impact assessment , based on a common approach to or understanding of the issues involved , was essential both to design the appropriate domestic policy response and to seek adequate external assistance .  
These were further compounded by growing hunger , sickness , unemployment , illiteracy , the eruption of violence and terrorism , illicit drug and arms trafficking , environmental degradation , and continued violations of human rights which gravely imperil our common future .  
Throughout the session , intensive consultations , both formal and informal , were held under the authority of the successive Presidents with a view to clarifying positions and developing a minimum common ground which would allow the Conference to discharge its mandate as the sole multilateral negotiating forum of the international community in the field of disarmament .  
These national services , working collaboratively in real time , provide the unique operational capabilities of the World Weather Watch of the World Meteorological Organisation ( WMO ) , a coordinated international system of national meteorological and hydrological services that is based on the common acceptance of protocols and standard terminology .  
The fact that the texts bearing on procedural matters contained fewer alternatives and brackets indicated that decisions were easier where political considerations were not so prominent , but also that the harmonization of elements of civil law and common law systems was not insuperable when there was a genuine will to go forward .  
Success in the thematic area of environment and development will be measured by : ( a ) the relevance of the new knowledge and methods produced for policy decision ; ( b ) the actual participation of pertinent decision makers in considering the proposed alternatives ; and ( c ) the extent of involvement of interested parties in consensus-building for policy decisions and of partnerships forged , joint initiatives funded and programmes launched relating to the management of common natural resources .  
Expected results in the thematic area of gender include : ( a ) four regional networks established and a common agenda developed ; ( b ) a programme implemented on violence against women , including the promotion of inter-agency activities , the creation of a directory of organizations and resources available , the production of messages and the promotion of national debates and support to organizations ; and ( c ) tools developed to monitor gender-mainstreaming , directories established best practices documented , and national surveys conducted on issues related to gender themes .  
Success in the thematic area of gender will be measured by : ( a ) the extent to which a viable , common regional agenda is established in the area of leadership and women ; ( b ) the extent to which public awareness about violence against women is raised in specific target groups on violence ; ( c ) the extent to which mainstreaming tools are utilized by target groups and disseminated in the region .  
All RCF programmes for Asia and the Pacific are based on one or more of the following regional criteria : sharing and / or pooling resources ( including intellectual and natural resources ) ; addressing trans-boundary issues ; addressing a common need or common problem ; and developing or promoting agreed upon regional regimes , norms or policies .  
But it goes beyond a mere series of defined activities , combining political , economic , legal , social and environmental measures within a common framework .  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation ;  
In introducing the draft resolution , I find it of significance to state that my delegation , while fully aware of the common desire of all concerned to preserve the consensual dimension of this draft resolution , found it essential to reflect the relevant and non-controversial regional realities of which all parties directly concerned are fully conscious and aware .  
Other organizations interested in the process , such as governments , trade unions , industrial sectors , TNCs and other NGOs , should contribute and cooperate with each other to disseminate , as widely and as homogenously as possible , basic information on EMS in order to guarantee a common ground for achieving the opportunities for a fair development of worldwide trade and avoid negative effects that may arise from an inadequate implementation of EMS in developing countries .  
Acting on the basis of the fundamental principles of the Treaty on friendship , cooperation and mutual assistance between Ukraine and the Republic of Georgia of 13 April 1993 , the Declaration on the prospects for the development of cooperation and common approaches to questions of international relations , signed on 10 January 1995 , and the Declaration on the intensification of the partnership relationship between Ukraine and Georgia , signed in Kiev on 14 February 1997 , which demonstrated their strong determination and set forth the preconditions for the expansion and intensification of such cooperation ,  
Calls upon the Government of Myanmar and other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully the obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , [ 8 ] to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law and to avail itself of such services as may be offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
If the General Assembly decided to implement the composite post adjustment for Geneva , the organizations concerned should be requested to make the necessary changes in their respective staff rules , and should be given sufficient time to do so ; otherwise , further inequities could result , which would be tantamount to a break-up of the common system .  
In general , it planned to focus on strategic policy formulation and the broad issues facing the common system , with a view to shaping the international civil service of the future .  
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
In most cases , however , the growth processes remain fragile and the outlook is surrounded by considerable uncertainty . 4 While high inflation rates have been largely reduced to more manageable levels , prices still do not guide economic activity to the degree common in most market economies , as enterprise governance and institutional frameworks for business decision-making are still in transition . 
While it is relatively common that States envisage in their legislation universal jurisdiction in respect of certain gross violations of human rights , even if such jurisdiction is not expressly required by relevant international instruments , it should be noted that in respect of the rules of international humanitarian law the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and Additional Protocol I of 1977 provide for universal jurisdiction over grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and the Protocol .  
Paragraph 4 indicated that the net reduction of $ 25.1-million reflected the combined effect of projected additional requirements of $ 31.6-million due to changes in inflation assumptions , commitments entered into under resolution 50 / 217 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses and commitments authorized by the General Assembly ; a $ 28.7-million decrease in income ; and an anticipated reduction of $ 85.4-million due to changes in exchange rate assumptions , variations in post and common staff costs and adjustments to objects of expenditure other than posts .  
I would be less than honest if I did not admit that at times , I thought the game was not worth a candle , and yet we went on because we perceived among the partners in negotiation an accommodating approach to finding a common understanding on some of the most intractable problems and complex issues that were the substance of the negotiations .

The Secretary-General 's reform initiative is the most comprehensive attempt to date at fashioning the United Nations of tomorrow into an instrument capable of serving the common interests of all peoples , guided by the enduring tenets of peace , human rights , the rule of law and social progress , enshrined in the Charter more than half a century ago .  
The destiny of mankind , however contradictory and diverse , and the interests of nations and States may become more amenable to one common denominator , are increasingly concerned with the well-being of humanity , and display numerous convergent features which make it possible now to discuss the opportunity for a new international order .  
We must therefore urgently find an effective response to this threat by defining a common objective based on a united stand and coherent action , by establishing or strengthening cooperation for exchanging experience and knowledge , by increasing our exchange of information and , above all , by actively promoting and supporting cooperation with international or regional forums so as to provide institutional technical assistance and logistical support .  
These reform proposals as a whole represent a timely and welcome initiative , given the fact that in today 's world the need has progressively increased for global common action on a number of pressing problems , such as the eradication of poverty , humanitarian emergencies , refugee problems , climate change and desertification , diminishing official development assistance funding , drugs , nuclear disarmament , the implementation of Agenda 21 , democracy and the maintenance of peace and security in various regions of the world .  
The interdependence of the situation emerging in Central Asia , the common European security system taking shape and the outlook for developing situations within the vast Asian continent means there is an urgent need for the international community to take measures to ensure durable peace and stability in this region along with its sustainable development .  
Mr . Takht-Ravanchi ( Islamic Republic of Iran ) : The World Summit for Social Development was a manifestation of the continuing drive at the global level towards achieving a better common understanding of the various elements involved in the social development of modern societies .

Moreover , family allowances are not common in developing countries , unemployment insurance rarely exists , and social security contributions are generally lower than in OECD countries . 7 Therefore , while some parts of the labour market regulations in developing countries are no longer compatible with today 's economic situation , whether or not there is a need for reform has to be ascertained from a specific examination of the empirical evidence . 
This initiative , supported by the Government of Jordan , is designed to create a community of potential future leaders who have shared a common training experience in global issues .

That State further observed that all current and future aerospace vehicles had a common denominator in that such objects were designed to travel using both aeronautical and astronautical properties , thereby enabling them to fly in airspace and move in outer space .  
It has been increasingly recognized that positive measures are important and can be indispensable elements to assist developing countries to meet the multilaterally agreed targets of an MEA , in keeping with the principle of common but differentiated responsibility .  
These efforts towards reorganization reflect the common understanding that in order to provide objective , impartial and candid assessments , the audit unit has to be granted an adequate measure of operational independence from the entities subject to its scrutiny .

In order to achieve this , the foundation for a single normative legal basis is to be laid by the end of 1997 , chiefly by developing general norms as well as unifying civil and customs codes and simultaneously introducing common taxation legislation .  
Agenda 21 and the principles contained in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development established a comprehensive global approach to the achievement of sustainable development , recognizing the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and the importance of international cooperation .

In addition , draft article 4 constituted a very useful saving clause : the presumption that acquisition of a new nationality automatically entailed loss of the former nationality was no longer generally respected .  
It also was necessary to exclude international juridical events , such as various notifications which did not entail an intention on the part of the author to become bound thereby , including fairly common situations in which internal juridical acts became , at the international level , simple juridical events .  69 .  Whatever the final scope of the topic turned out to be , his delegation would follow with particular interest the Commissions work on the regime of unilateral acts , particularly the question of their revocability .  
Such a strategy should be based on three principles : developed countries should take the lead now in committing themselves to reduce greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 level ; developing countries should also take actions to address climate change problems in promoting their sustainable development , taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities under the Convention and their respective capabilities ; and developed countries should strengthen their partnership with developing countries through the provision of financial and technological support for mitigating global greenhouse gas emissions .

Although no concerted move has yet been made by the system to set up the mechanisms to collect the essential baseline data necessary for a comprehensive impact evaluation of operational activities , there have been extensive efforts within JCGP to prepare a common country assessment that , once established , could provide basic data against which progress could be measured .  
UNDP has played a key role in the development of a common understanding of the programme approach which is now contained in the Operational Activities Reference Manual published in 1996 by the Consultative Committee on Programme and Operational Questions ( CCPOQ ) with significant substantive and financial support from UNDP . 
In fact , it should be evident that in our forum , political realism and a diplomatic approach constitute the fundamental essence of any aim and , consequently it would be advisable , albeit without denying the full respect of each national position , that adequate room be left for a free comparison of different theses in order to find a minimum common denominator on which the best solution for the successful attainment of our endeavours can be arrived at .

While it is the primary responsibility of national Governments to achieve the economic , social and environmental objectives of Agenda 21 , it is essential that international cooperation be reactivated and intensified , recognizing , inter alia , the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities as set forth in principle 7 of the Rio Declaration .  
Moreover , issues , including environmental issues , that bear on the international economic environment can be approached effectively only through a constructive dialogue and genuine partnership on the basis of mutuality of interests and benefits , taking into account that , in view of the different contributions to global environmental degradation , States have common but differentiated responsibilities .

The memorandum of understanding has paved the way for increased levels of cooperation , including discussion of possible joint missions to assess and address the needs of separated minors and other groups identified as particularly vulnerable and the establishment of common standards and practices .  
The information covers administrative arrangements set in place by Governments , such as designation of focal points and establishment of committees and commissions , as well as substantive measures such as elaboration of policies , formulation of programmes and organization of seminars , such as the Copenhagen seminars for social progress organized by Denmark , host Government of the Summit , to enrich the discourse and formulate common concepts and strategies on issues addressed by the Summit .

Despite the decision pursuant to the peace accords signed by the Palestinian Liberation Organization ( PLO ) and Israel to postpone discussion of certain items , including the matter of settlements , pending negotiations on final status , the illegal confiscation of Arab lands by the Israeli Government in order to build settlements was incompatible with the achievement by all parties of the common goal of economic and social stability .

The Group of 77 and China had always held the view that the problems of development could not be reduced to their economic component but rather involved a set of social problems and situations and of equally essential ethical and political factors that formed part of an integral whole whose common denominator was the right of every man and woman to a life of dignity and a future of hope .  
A common vision had developed that sound financial and economic policies , including development of human resources and respect for human rights , good governance , individual initiative and the private sector , were critical to creating an environment conducive to economic growth , environmental sustainability and social equity .  
Attention should be drawn to the need to strike a balance between the interests of the various States so as to reduce the gap between the excessive well-being of some and the alarming poverty of others , since , in an increasingly interdependent world which shared a common destiny , solutions to environmental problems must be closely interrelated .  
What was needed was an innovative , effective and lasting approach , based on a common set of principles for future debt negotiations , which would include arrangements for a substantial reduction of all categories of debt .

In illustration of a " top-down " method for estimating the impact of coercive economic measures , the expert group referred itself to a recent study that attempts to empirically measure the impact of sanctions on bilateral trade flows , particularly on exports by the United States which is the most frequent sender of unilateral sanctions . 36 But the method used , a common one in economics known as the " gravity model " , also captures the impact on the trade of the target country . 
Specifically , operational activities at national , subregional and regional levels addressed : preventive education for high risk groups ( school children , street children ) ; prevention for intravenous drug abusers to contain the spread of HIV / AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases ; implementation of common standards for epidemiological monitoring and systems of information on drug abuse ; prevention of drug abuse in the workplace ; and training for rehabilitation and integration of former drug addicts into society , involving health and education authorities .  
We , the representatives of the international community , can not , at this historical juncture , ignore such a dangerous argument and a destructive theory that runs counter to the common work and collective obligations we agreed upon for international life .  
It will be not only testimony to the common desire to overcome long neglected failures of national legal systems , but a unique chance to contribute to international stability deterrence and , hopefully , the prevention of atrocious crimes .  
We want it to be a strong , principled and effective body , the common inheritance of all mankind , not the preserve of a few wealthy and powerful States , but the guardian of all , especially the poor , the weak and the defenceless . 
As the first comprehensive international proclamation of the basic rights of the individual , it established a common understanding of human rights for mankind .  
At a more basic level , the question was raised as to whether the categories of acts listed in chapter III of the outline possessed sufficient elements in common to be treated alike or to be subjected to the same legal regime .  
Under common article 3 , rape has also been charged in isolated instances of rape and other instances of sexual assault and sexual mutilation as cruel treatment , an outrage upon human dignity and humiliating and degrading treatment .  
Partnerships between the public and private sectors , which are becoming common in many developing countries , ensure that essential skills and theory acquired through formal education are complemented by enterprise-based practical training .  
Although industry is a major user of natural resources and a direct or indirect source of pollution and other environmental impacts , business and industry must remain a key partner in the common endeavour to achieve sustainable development .  
Action at the global level and action at the regional , national and local levels should be consistent with each other and based on common norms .

While democratic systems can take on different forms according to the prevailing circumstances , there are certain constituent key elements common to all of them , such as accountability , respect for human rights , the rule of law and genuine periodic elections .

Applying a common statistical technique , known as ordinary least squares regression analysis , to the gravity model allows the researcher to isolate the direct and indirect effects of sanctions on bilateral trade flows while holding other factors constant .  
The existence of common historical , political , economic and cultural and humanitarian links with countries which in the past formed a single whole necessitates the maintenance and development of relations through bilateral and multilateral cooperation .  
Although international humanitarian law , refugee law and human rights law are often treated as separate branches of international law , they all have a common goal of protecting individuals from harm and should therefore be considered as complementary .  
Thus was born the Rio compact and Agenda 21 a new spirit of partnership , a social , ethical and political contract forged on interdependence , intergenerational equity and common but differentiated responsibilities .  
In an era when ethnic conflict and civil war have become increasingly common in comparison to international armed conflicts , the responsibility of a new Government to pay for past violations may require a specific guiding principle , which should be incorporated in the guidelines .  
Declares solemnly its commitment to the fulfilment of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations and as a source of inspiration for the further promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms political , economic , social , civil and cultural including the right to development . 
It was argued , moreover , that the text failed to embody important principles such as the sovereign right of States to exploit their own natural resources according to their own policies , the concept of common but differentiated responsibility and the international consensus on the right to development ; it was also considered unfortunate that none of the draft articles had been devoted specifically to the need for an overall balance between environmental and developmental imperatives .  
However , considering the value of these forests to local populations , it will be difficult to adequately identify quality changes , especially change in species composition and biological diversity , which is mostly induced by the common practice of selective cutting of highly valuable trees .  
Mutilation , cruel treatment and torture , as well as the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without judgments being pronounced by a regularly constituted court that affords all the judicial guarantees recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples , common article 3 of the Geneva Conventions , which specifies crimes that are also considered as war crimes under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court . 
There is a common thread running through the preceding statements that makes unequivocally clear one of the characteristics of the recent armed conflicts that have led to political or military action by this Organization : the fact that their first and principal target has been the civilian population , in particular its most vulnerable sectors children , women , the elderly , the sick , refugees and internally displaced persons .  
The success of these programmes would not have been possible without the respect for international humanitarian law and the direct and indirect cooperation of the parties to the conflict , which in practice shared common areas of mutual respect , to the benefit of the civilian population and the national and international non-governmental humanitarian assistance organizations , particularly the International Committee of the Red Cross .  
It had been observed , for example , that Governments should have been more involved from the very beginning of the process , including in the preparation of the common country assessments ; that a way must be found to involve civil society and non-governmental organizations ; and that UNDAF should be introduced gradually , so that experience could be absorbed as the process unfolded , and the lessons learned could be applied to the planning of future activities .  
The reasons for this lack of effective function are many and varied ; common themes include unsupportive policy and institutional framework , a lack of political and community commitment to protection , the alienation of communities from their traditional lands , and lack of capacity associated with the provision of insufficient resources for effective management .  
It was noted that the Working Group , throughout its thirty-first and thirty-second sessions , had experienced manifest difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues that arose from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures .  
It will therefore be crucial to establish at the international level a conceptual and methodological platform from which to develop further a common understanding and a concerted approach .  
If it is generally accepted that Special Coordinators are an effective mechanism to develop common understanding , why do we not give the CD President discretionary powers to nominate a Special Coordinator with a simple standard mandate , when he needs help in the search for common ground on how to proceed on a particular subject in the CD ? 
The two ministers exchanged views on different issues of common interest and expressed their satisfaction on the full resumption of bilateral cooperation in the diplomatic , security , economic , cultural , scientific and technical fields .  
It includes the lack of response to acts of political violence but is also reflected in the almost daily reports of abuses by military and police officials against common people , including killing , rape , illegal arrest or kidnapping for extortion as well as beating and other violent acts .  
The activities undertaken to mark the anniversary by Governments , international and regional organizations and , most notably , by civil society at all levels - local , national , regional and international _ have also provided clear evidence of a reinvigorated commitment to human rights as the common principles which should unite the international community as a new century begins . 
The Commission noted that the Working Group , throughout its thirty-first and thirty-second sessions , had experienced manifest difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues that arose from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures .  
The view was expressed that any legal principles of a possible future legal regime of the geostationary orbit , which was a part of outer space , should be consistent with the principles and rules of the Outer Space Treaty , which was the common legal framework for all activities in outer space and that , therefore , it was not certain that the geostationary orbit required a sui generis regime .  
Where specific legislation is required in order for the contracting authority to carry out certain types of projects , the relevant statute often sets forth the conditions for the operation and maintenance of the relevant infrastructure facilities and is supplemented by more detailed provisions in regulations governing that particular infrastructure sector and in the project agreement , an approach that is common to various legal systems .  
Under those circumstances , the international community was currently engaged in searching for an appropriate architecture for the international financial system , which should include the following basic elements : better regulation and supervision in all countries , based on a common set of norms ; better information and transparency ; and more effective surveillance .  
Mention should be made of the social problems existing in EPZs : local landlords take advantage of the accommodation shortage to charge enormous rents for sub _ standard accommodation ; transport services and social infrastructure ( especially child _ care facilities ) are often non-existent ; friction between the EPZ workers and local residents is common and real integration of workers in local communities is difficult to achieve , in particular because of the high turnover in many Zones .  
By making its withdrawal from the rest of the occupied Ethiopian territory conditional on demilitarization along the common border and on mutual redeployment , Eritrea is simply confirming that its declared acceptance of the Framework Agreement is bogus and , as Ethiopia has already insisted , is tactical and designed to buy time .  
We believe that the establishment of a reliable system for European security and stability is possible only on a common European basis with unswerving observance of international law and by making use of the potential of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) as the most representative and universal common European organization capable of dealing with all the challenges of the twenty-first century - political , economic , military and humanitarian ones .  
As an initial matter , we note that such a limitation is arbitrary in two senses : it ignores the principle that criminal culpability should be linked with the degree of personal responsibility of an individual and not partisan political factors - that justice is blind ; and it imparts to the notion of " leaders " a meaning that is at odds with the common understanding of the term .  
Mr . Nesho ( Albania ) : The moment that we are going through is a historic moment for the future of the Balkans , as the international community is intervening in order to stop the humanitarian catastrophe and the tragedy of a nation whose people have been tortured , killed and buried in common graves , a nation that is justly demanding its legitimate rights to freedom and to its very existence undeniable rights for all peoples .  
It works for international understanding , for improved social and economic conditions and for basic human rights for all people ; and acts in cooperation with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations in matters of common concern .  
The view was expressed that any legal principles of a possible future legal regime of the geostationary orbit , which was a part of outer space , should be consistent with the principles and rules of the Outer Space Treaty , which was the common legal framework for all activities in outer space and that , therefore , the future legal regime of the geostationary orbit should not be described in advance as a sui generis regime , since that status would depend on the rules and principles agreed upon .  
The European Union has supranational competition rules ( relating to RBPs , to public undertakings and undertakings granted special or exclusive rights , and to subsidies ) , which are linked by the Treaty of Rome to the fundamental objective of establishing a common market .  
The Set also provides for work aimed at achieving common approaches in national policies relating to RBPs compatible with the Set ( article F . 1 ) , and continued work on the elaboration of a model law or laws on RBPs in order to assist developing countries in devising appropriate legislation ( article F . 2 ) ; the OECD instruments do not have such provisions , but the 1998 OECD recommendation recommends convergence in ( as well as effective enforcement of ) laws prohibiting hardcore cartels .

In particular , the introduction and implementation of common country assessments and UNDAFs , by providing a framework for a consistent and coordinated interaction among national priorities and international objectives as identified by global conferences and possible United Nations system response , is expected to contribute to more integrated United Nations system support for conference follow-up and to redefine and enhance the work of thematic groups accordingly .  
The Council may also wish to recommend that the executive boards of the funds and programmes consider the subject of further progress to achieving common premises and shared services , possibly at upcoming joint session of the boards , and consider a practical joint programme of action , including appropriate cost-sharing and adequate financing .

The Republic of China a democratic country concerned with safeguarding and promoting human rights , a world economic Power recognized by nations , and , last but not least , a nation that maintains trade relations through commercial delegations shares with deep conviction our common faith in the noble ideals of peace , solidarity and cooperation enshrined in the Charter .

The inundation of coastal areas can result in : ( a ) loss of agricultural land , a common concern because agriculture is still the primary source of income in many small island developing States , and most agricultural land lies along the coastline , increasing its vulnerability to sea level rise ; ( b ) loss of exclusive economic zone ( EEZ ) , a common concern because sea level rise will also reduce the exclusive economic zone , thereby reducing the resource base .  
Welcomes the implementation since 1994 by the Paris Club of the Naples terms , as well as the decision to go beyond the Naples terms to provide debt reduction for eligible countries , in particular the poorest and most heavily indebted countries , and invites all other bilateral , multilateral and commercial creditors to make an appropriate and consistent contribution to the common objective of debt sustainability ;  
The key to this success was the fact that ( 1 ) the Summit was organized around a number of very concrete developmental problems which affected major aspects of the development process and ( 2 ) a common interest between UNCTAD and non-governmental actors had been clearly identified in advance .  
It was vital that the international community should reach a greater understanding of the moral implications of genetic engineering and continue its efforts to arrive at a common response , built on consensus , to the ethical problems raised by scientific progress .  
The draft should use as its starting point the preamble common to the two international Covenants of 1966 , as well as other relevant instruments which recognize that the ideal of the free individual , delivered from fear and poverty , can not be achieved without the creation of conditions allowing each person to enjoy all human rights .  
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
The Division will be engaged in formulating guidelines and common understandings within the United Nations system to provide guidance as to the implementation of relevant resolutions of the Assembly and the Council , and will conduct system-wide impact evaluations that will focus on both the analytic normative and evolving operational dimensions of United Nations system activities in the economic and social fields . 
In turn , directing international assistance to support decentralized and locally owned activities on behalf of all affected parties can help in regenerating war-torn communities and in promoting national reconciliation by inducing beneficiaries from different ethnic groups to work together towards a common future .  
The unified international approach was the determining factor for making faster progress at local , national , regional and hemispheric levels because it was helping establish a common institutional framework for focusing efforts and enhancing the distribution and utilization of the human and financial resources involved .  
Increased efforts are needed by the United Nations system , with support from the international community , to develop and agree upon common key indicators on reproductive health programmes , including , inter alia , family planning , maternal health , sexual health , sexually transmitted diseases , HIV AIDS , and information , education and communication for appropriate consideration in the relevant intergovernmental process .  
Therefore , what is proposed is a decentralized technical , administrative and budgetary approach to a globally coordinated collaborative facilities management based on information exchange and common operational practices is therefore proposed .  
Included under this heading are : ( a ) differences between actual average salary and common staff costs compared with the standards included in the revised appropriations ; ( b ) differences between realized vacancy rates compared with those assumed in the revised appropriations ; and ( c ) adjustments to objects of expenditure other than posts based on actual and anticipated requirements to the end of the biennium .  
The estimates are based on the 1999 and 2000 standard salary costs for New York and the local salary scale applicable to the mission area and reflect the application of a projected vacancy rate of 20 per cent for international and local staff , as well as salary and common staff cost adjustments for 70 per cent of international staff classified as mission appointees .  
Finally , the active involvement of the Bretton Woods institutions both in the final event and in the preparatory process was crucial : only through the coordinated efforts of the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions would the common objective of poverty reduction and sustainable development be achieved .  
A crucial component common to most of these principal and supporting functions is that any future international arrangement and mechanism should also make provisions for an open and transparent participatory process that includes all stakeholders .

Inadequate budgetary allocations for the social sectors , slow disbursement of available funds , weak institutional and human resources capacities , and unreasonably low salary levels for civil servants are constraints common to all sectors .  
It was recognized that building an effective reporting system , with an analytical focus on actual results achieved against planned objectives , required a gradual process and presented a common challenge shared by other agencies .  
The historical and , alas , still actual misuse of religions and moral philosophies with a universal intent for purposes of domination and control should not obscure the evidence that the sharing of a common humanity is fundamental to the human race .  
Monitoring is the process of comparing common selected indicators or targets against actual performance , whereas surveillance is not only the organized exchange of information but also the means of encouraging remedial policy action at the national level .

The mission also reviewed and assessed the HDI programme more broadly in terms of its effectiveness in pursuing the common goal of addressing the critical humanitarian and basic human needs in Myanmar at the grassroots level .  
Thus , only through broad and sustained efforts to create a shared future , based upon our common humanity in all its diversity , can globalization be made fully inclusive and equitable ( see General Assembly resolution 55 / 2 , para .  5 ) .  
PARIS 21 is key to efforts to have reliable statistics to monitor these goals as well as other , complementary indicator lists such as the United Nations common country assessment indicators and the minimum national social data set ( MNSDS ) .  
That Group , composed of representatives of governing bodies , executive heads and participants , is focusing on possible changes to make the United Nations pension system more responsive to the demographics of the work force , the growing number of non-career staff and the personnel policies of the organizations , while maintaining a strong , fully funded and comprehensive , defined benefit pension plan for the common system , providing also appropriate social security coverage .  
The challenges faced by the organizations of the common system ( in broad terms , the need for competitiveness and improved organizational performance ) were not isolated from the outside world and were also being experienced by a number of national administrations .  
They heard each member of the Council make comments and ask relevant and specific questions of the President of Rwanda , namely concerning the presence of forces of aggression on the Congolese territory , the permeability of common borders and the need to build a free , secure and democratic Rwandan society based on human rights , equality and respect for diversity .

The work of the Committee also addressed technical issues dealing with the content of SDI , including the definition of a common geodetic reference frame , the necessity of integrating cadastral and topographical data bases , the development of metadata and clearinghouse sites , and the employment of international standards ( ISO / TC 211 ) in the implementation of national and regional SDI .  
The net additional requirements of $ 900 under this heading were attributable to additional requirements under mission subsistence allowance ( $ 354,200 ) and other official travel costs ( $ 435,100 ) , as well as to unforeseen expenditure under the consultants budget line item ( $ 74,400 ) , offset by savings under the international and local staff salaries ( $ 104,700 and $ 171,500 , respectively ) and common staff costs ( $ 589,000 ) .  
This will also include coordinating the development of common policies on humanitarian issues ; improving the management and practice of humanitarian coordination through the enhancement of practical tools for field and headquarters coordination , based on lessons learned ; ensuring that gender-sensitive strategies are incorporated in humanitarian action plans ; increasing support for and awareness of humanitarian assistance issues and international humanitarian law in the work of the United Nations and its Member States ; and intensifying resource mobilization .

Deeply convinced of the need to create a new spirit of international cooperation based on the principle of achieving shared benefits , but also based on common but differentiated responsibilities , between the developing and industrialized countries ,  
This will require the operationalization by all relevant actors of common policy goals set out in the international development targets and the Millennium Declaration agreed to by all United Nations Member States , and , when possible , common country approaches and strategies based on developing countries national priorities and development plans , including strategies for sustainable development .  
At the national level , this will require ministries / government agencies and central banks responsible for different international and regional organizations and involved in their norm-setting / policy-making to become more coordinated and to increase coherence among themselves when discussing and deciding on such common goals and approaches in the governing bodies of the United Nations , IFIs and other international and regional organizations .  
It will also be important to receive proposals from CPF on streamlining national reporting formats required by various forest-related international organizations and instruments , taking also into account the streamlining work on reporting in other relevant forums . 13 UNFF may wish to focus on advancing the common understanding and use of those key concepts , definitions and terms that could benefit greatly the implementation at a practical level , as well as the monitoring of progress . 
In this context , human resources directors meet prior to the sessions of the International Civil Service Commission to review matters under consideration by the Commission , appoint spokespersons to represent the executive heads of the participating organizations at the Commission sessions and put forward common positions on the relevant issues under consideration .  
During the biennium 2002-2003 , in the personnel and general administration areas the High-level Committee on Management will place emphasis on human resources management and reform of the common system by continuing specific studies covering the role and function of the international civil service and its underpinnings , the development of a senior management cadre , the further development of system-wide standards on contractual patterns and employment conditions and the implications of other management reforms , such as downsizing and outsourcing , for the participating organizations .  
As to the form that work might take , while a model law might be more desirable from the point of view of completeness and uniformity , to the extent that it would need to reflect certain fundamental guiding principles that would not be common ground to all legal systems , it would represent a significant change from current law in many countries and might , as a result , not meet with sufficient acceptance .  
Deeply convinced of the need to create a new spirit of international cooperation based on the principle of achieving shared benefits , but also based on common but differentiated responsibilities , between the developing and industrialized countries ,  
This initiative is expected to promote regional integration through enhancing the collective value of small and fragmented markets in the creation of trade and the expansion of exports ; develop shared infrastructure ; and tackle common environmental and social problems .  
Based on common international understandings that respect diversity and specific country circumstances , these national efforts should be supported by an enabling international environment , including good international financial and trade governance and adequate external resources mobilization .  
The stated purpose of the report is to provide a coherent framework for the creation and strengthening of a unified , comprehensive and centralized common services entity for United Nations organizations located at Geneva to enable them to rationalize their overhead structures and costs and to concentrate diminishing resources on their constitutional mandates .  
As recommended in part I of the report , Overview of administrative cooperation and coordination ( JIU / REP / 98 / 4 ) ( A / 53 / 787 ) , the objective of part II , Case studies , is to identify key strengths and constraints of some existing services in order to derive lessons that can be applied to the expanded sharing of support services in accordance with the plan of action for Geneva common services , 2000-2010 .  
Since 1993 , however , secondary-level institutions have been undergoing extensive restructuring through the Reform of Secondary Education ( ROSE ) project which is aimed at improving the quality and equity of educational provisions at the secondary level through the establishment of a common national curriculum for grades 7 to 9 .  
Donors and some recipient countries consulted for the present triennial comprehensive policy review confirmed the high relevance of this effect of UNDAF as a means to enhance the internal dialogue within the system on country-level cooperation38 and in the promotion of a common understanding of strategic directions . 39 Decentralization and delegation of authority by most organizations have strengthened this team-building effect . 
They especially appreciated the fact that the concept put forward by the Secretary-General that we must put people at the centre of everything we do was strongly reflected in the United Nations Millennium Declaration ; the Summits reference to the United Nations as the indispensable common house of the entire human family ; and its wish to make the United Nations system a more vital and effective tool in the hands of all the worlds peoples .  
In this respect , it was felt that the role of the United Nations within the system would be effective to the extent that participatory approaches were pursued , and the United Nations built on its role as a forum where the competencies of different agencies could be drawn together and where their respective constituencies were engaged in a dialogue towards common , overriding objectives .  
ACCs contribution to policy coherence and overall progress should not be limited to the elaboration of common , comprehensive approaches to development and the development of a common framework for country level action , but should extend to the identification of global public goods and of the balances and synergies that need to be created among them to strengthen international governance , further policy coherence and advance the goals set at the Summit .  
During the discussion held in the Commission in 2000 , it was concluded that common rules could be elaborated relating to certain issues concerning unilateral acts , but not relating to all aspects , which led to the earlier exercise on the classification of unilateral acts on which the draft articles to be prepared by the Commission on this subject would be based .  
The objectives of third-country training , which takes place in a particular region where developing countries have a common base in terms of natural , social and cultural factors , are to transfer the technology and know-how of Japan in a form that is compatible with local conditions , and to promote TCDC .  
To contribute to the search for a common denominator based on the peace agreements that would win the support of broad sectors of the population , MINUGUA , at the request of the parties , held an extensive round of consultations through which it discovered that there was some readiness on the part of sectors of society to work together on specific issues .  
Apart from the shared feature that their host countries were not involved in a violent internal or international conflict , the common features included the possibility , or even the likelihood , of armed conflict , consent of the States concerned to the peacekeeping operations as the form of prevention , and the authorization of the operation by the Security Council .  
FAO also assists in the development of institutions for the management of common pool natural resources oriented towards reconciling conflicting interests in watersheds between upstream and downstream water users or in fish-producing areas between artisanal and commercial fishermen . 
A salient feature of that programme was organizing periodic seminars / symposia to focus attention on specific issues falling within the framework of disarmament and development in the context of current international relations , as well as providing a forum where relevant United Nations bodies , non-governmental organizations and other international agencies could share their experience in areas of common or overlapping concerns .  
Thus , only through broad and sustained efforts to create a shared future , based upon our common humanity in all its diversity , can globalization be made fully inclusive and equitable ;  
Allow me to briefly reiterate some of these proposals : enhanced coordination ; a regular flow of information ; the exchange of liaison officers ; joint training of staff in the field of early warning and prevention ; joint expert meetings on specific areas of early warning and prevention ; the development of common indicators for early warning ; and the establishment of a database on the conflict prevention capabilities of both the United Nations and the regional organizations . 
Because of common purposes and objectives ( education and training ) , similar geographic and human target areas , similar operational modes and strategies and a common institutional location , there are large areas of synergetic opportunity between the programmes : funding , management and execution , cost rationalization - let alone the added value of a comprehensive and integrated approach to commercial and logistic manpower requirements .  
We hope that you will enjoy your stay here as you experience the proverbial hospitality of our country and , at the same time , that your time here will be fruitful and useful and will contribute to the achievement of our common objective , the international communitys target of eradicating colonialism , and that the Committee will leave Havana with renewed motivation to continue its noble and praiseworthy endeavours .  
It is , however , without prejudice to the right of any State identified in article 48 ( 1 ) to take lawful measures against a responsible State to ensure cessation of the breach and reparation in the interests of the victims ( article 54 ) .  ( 9 ) In common with other chapters of these Articles , the provisions on countermeasures are residual and may be excluded or modified by a special rule to the contrary ( see article 55 ) .  
Although experts had expressed diverse views in the report , which demonstrated the difficulty in finding common solutions , the report and the Meeting had clearly indicated that UNCTADs analytical work in this area should continue and contribute to future multilateral trade negotiations , as well as to the definition of the national trade policy of individual countries .  
I would therefore like to recall the prohibition against targeting civilians and conducting indiscriminate attacks on civilians , enshrined in customary international humanitarian law , which is binding not only on States and their Governments but equally and directly so on armed groups that are parties to the conflict , as stated in article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 . 
The representative of Benin stated that a project to adopt a competition law in his country had been stopped when the West African Economic and Monetary Union , of which Benin was a member , decided on the adoption of a common competition regulation that would supersede competition laws at the national level .  
Finally , in cooperation with OHCHR , UNEP is organizing a seminar on environment and human rights to discuss interlinkages , common protection approaches , the special role played by some groups and their vulnerability , and proposals for future courses of action at the national and international level .  
He also stressed that the technology transfer provisions analysed in the secretariat = s issues note related to specific circumstances , as indicated in the note , where a common good was at stake ( such as the global ozone layer in the Montreal Protocol and the deep sea-bed in UNCLOS ) and it was only to this extent that there was a politically and legally persuasive case for asking developed country addressees to give additional incentives for transfer of technology .  
This exercise will require further hard work and considerable negotiating skills in search of a delicate balance between the respective national interests and our common responsibilities as the sole negotiating body with a universal task in the field of international security and disarmament .  
To this end , it is essential to secure universal participation in the common endeavour , which requires an approach of cooperation rather than confrontation , and a uniform standard rather than double or even multiple standards .  
Recognizing the importance , from an analytical and operational point of view , of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development and of the need for comprehensive , coherent and effective policies on international migration based on the spirit of genuine partnership and common understanding ,  
To this end , an annual meeting at the level of permanent missions in New York , to exchange views , coordinate strategies and adopt a common regional position among member States would be an important forum in which similar experiences can be shared and solutions sought to common problems .  
Through the efforts of UNOA and in particular of my Adviser for Special Assignments in Africa , as well as my Representative in Angola , broad contacts have been established with the Government , political parties , civil society , and the church which could provide a strong support base in the common search for a peaceful resolution of the conflict . 
But central to its success has been an organic sense of common purpose around which most operational and organizational questions revolve , and are resolved , with a minimum of fuss , by multilateral standards .  
As I had told you at Salzburg , Austria , Greek Cypriot policy , actions and finally their reactions and unanimous rejection of your statement of 12 September 2000 ( which we had received as formulating , in the most neutral and simple way , a framework for the talks ) had left nothing , no common ground whatsoever from which to engage in invigorated meaningful talks .  
The panellists suggested that less reliance on private capital flows should be a common goal for all developing countries , because of ( i ) the volatility of such flows , ( ii ) the likelihood that financial flows to developing countries would decline in reaction to the less optimistic outlook for the global economy and to the falling profitability of FDI in major recipient countries , and ( iii ) the lack of meaningful international financial reforms .  
While bilateral cooperation , especially in regard to technical cooperation , remains a prevalent form of South-South cooperation , conscious efforts are being made by developing countries to pool their resources and capacities institutional , intellectual , technical and financial to address issues of common concern or specific development problems that affect a large number of people and countries .  
Our objective observation of these approaches and situations which can under no circumstances be dealt with separately from an understanding of the common framework of their causes and motives prompts us to call upon the international community to set a binding international strategy for security cooperation among all States , whose components are based on the principles of international law , the Charter , resolutions , agreements , conventions and protocols of the United Nations that do not discriminate between States and peoples .  
The Task Force is responsible for : ( a ) recommending initiatives or actions which will lead to the establishment of a common service or the reinforcement of an existing one ; ( b ) reviewing proposals and recommendations put forward by the working groups on common services ; and ( c ) defining the degree of commitment of cooperation , participation and human and financial resources required from participating organizations .  
The working groups are responsible for : ( a ) assessment of critical existing central , shared or common services with a view to identifying areas of possible improvement in quality and cost-effectiveness ; ( b ) review of the potential for expansion of central , shared or common services ; and ( c ) recommendation of the specific actions to be taken , together with the timetable , estimate of resources required and definition of accountability for their implementation , including the identification of a lead agency or organization , where appropriate .  
The International Labour Organization ( ILO ) maintained close cooperation with the League of Arab States and particularly with its specialized agency , the Arab Labour Organization ( ALO ) , by conducting joint activities and coordinating work pertaining to issues of common interest to both organizations .  With a view to strengthening cooperation with the League of Arab States , the two organizations signed a memorandum of understanding in March 2000 , with respect to employment in the occupied Palestinian territory .  
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting and expanding the exploration and use of outer space , as the province of all mankind , for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
It was important to cooperate to find common solutions that would make it possible to reduce the vulnerability of the economies of the developing countries which was linked to the instability of external resources and inequitable access to private capital markets and to strengthen the world financial system so that it would serve the interests of all and lead to the attainment of the development goals established by the international community .  
It was therefore the urgent duty of the international community to combat two current threats to development and common security poverty and HIV / AIDS . Governments themselves must be the driving force in pursuing a policy that would embrace the economic and social factors affecting development . 
Due to the increased harmonization and simplification of procedures , the reports of UNDP , UNFPA , UNICEF and WFP to their respective Executive Boards had a common format and were very similar in content ; the four agencies were therefore suggesting that reporting on the implementation of the triennial policy review and on United Nations reforms to the legislative bodies should be streamlined ; they looked forward to the Committees advice on that .  
It had applied a model unique of its kind based on a number of common policies with regard to asylum and migration providing , inter alia , for criteria for the granting of refugee status , minimum standards regarding reception , minimum standards regarding the status of long-term residents from third countries , and the establishment of analytical and descriptive statistics by the Statistical Office of the European Communities ( EUROSTAT ) .  
Recognizes the urgent need to build stronger South institutions , including policy research and development institutions and centres of excellence , especially at the regional , inter-regional and global levels , and to have linkages among them through networking arrangements , and by making more effective use of the Souths institutional capacity , so as to improve South-South knowledge-sharing , capacity-building and information flow , and policy analysis and coordination among developing countries on major development issues of common concern ;  
As a consequence , the plague of hijackings of aircraft in mid-flight soon spread to the United States itself , where , for the most varied reasons , a number of people , most of them unbalanced individuals , adventurers or common criminals , from both the United States and Latin America , began to hijack aircraft , armed with firearms , knives , Molotov cocktails and sometimes just bottles of water made to look as though they contained gasoline , with which they threatened to set the aircraft on fire .  
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and complexity and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
For the first time in my countrys history , free and direct elections were held for the presidency of the Republic and at the local level to ensure administrative decentralization and to safeguard the common partnership of the people in assuming the burdens of comprehensive development .

Believe that extreme poverty , environmental degradation , underdevelopment , unsustainable production and consumption patterns , and the lack of equity in income distribution impact all the countries in the international community , particularly developing countries , and that it is in this light that international cooperation should be regarded as a unifying element for the efforts of the peoples and Governments of the entire world to build a common objective : to improve the living conditions of present and future generations . 
Welcoming the New Partnership for Africas Development , which embodies a common African vision of the future and a shared conviction of the pressing duty to eradicate poverty and to place African countries , both individually and collectively , on a path of robust growth and sustainable development , thereby fully integrating Africa into the global economy and political system ,  
Notes the progress achieved in the area of common premises and shared services at the country level within the United Nations system , recognizes the need to justify the pursuit of common premises on the basis of the adequate nature and size of the development cooperation programmes and projects , reaffirms the need to take fully into account cost-benefit studies as called for in relevant resolutions , and encourages further implementation of such initiatives , where appropriate , while ensuring that there will be no additional burden imposed on host countries ;  
Reiterates the growing need for incorporating the regional and subregional dimensions , where appropriate , in the operational activities for development of the United Nations system , and encourages the resident coordinators , in close consultation with Governments , to secure the greater involvement of the regional commissions , taking into account their agreed mandates and work programmes , in the common country assessment and the United Nations Development Assistance Framework , as appropriate ;  
Recognizes the urgent need to build stronger South institutions , including policy research and development institutions and centres of excellence , especially at the regional , inter-regional and global levels , and to have linkages among them through networking arrangements , and by making more effective use of the Souths institutional capacity , so as to improve South-South knowledge-sharing , capacity-building and information flow , and policy analysis and coordination among developing countries on major development issues of common concern ;  
A number of projects ( Ionosphere-1 , Ionosphere-2 , Ionosphere Variant ) are devoted to designing facilities and software for the investigation of acoustic communications channels in lithospheric-ionospheric systems in the infrasound range , to conducting experiments to investigate acoustic and electromagnetic effects in the atmosphere and ionosphere , to taking terrestrial measurements of electromagnetic signals and echoes caused by acoustic disturbances in the atmosphere , and to assessing the potential for seismographic forecasting based on these signals .  10 .

As a result of Kim T'ae-chung 's visit to North Korea as President , the North and South have formally acknowledged the objective existence of their respective independent political entities ; in addition , mentally redefining each other 's status is beneficial not only for easing antagonism and tension in their relationship but also for establishing a relationship of peaceful coexistence and replacing their cold war relations of more than 50 years with a new relationship of coexistence and common prosperity ;  
To this end , Niu Wenyuan proposed the establishment of universal rules based on common ground in the course of the rapid progress of economic globalization and letting economic globalization bring a more rational , fair , and civilized new atmosphere to the world .  
Jiang Zemin stressed that the two parties ' improving relations on the peninsula is in accord with both sides ' fundamental interests and with the common aspirations of the Korean nationality .  He expressed the belief that the meeting would enhance the mutual understanding and trust between the two sides , promote both sides ' exchanges and cooperation in various fields , and ultimately create an excellent opening for realizing independence and peaceful unification on the peninsula .  
Countries , large or small , rich or poor , and strong or weak , all have their equal right to actively participate in international economic organizations and join the common effort to formulate various rules of the game governing " liberalization " in all areas , in an endeavor to establish a fair and just new global economic order in the 21st century .  
Li Ruihuan said : The large-scale development of the western region is a strategic decision made by the CPC Central Committee according to Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's concept of " two general situations , " which will be of the utmost importance for the development of both the western and eastern regions and even for sustainable economic and social development throughout the country and for achieving the third-step strategic objective of the modernization drive and common prosperity for all people .  
The most fundamental thing for maintaining the momentum of healthy and steady development of Sino-US relations is to firmly grasp the overall situation in their relationship and the common interests of their peoples , persist in handling their bilateral relations from the strategic level and from the long-term angle , and in particular , adhere to the basic norms of international relations in mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , equality and mutual benefit , and mutual noninterference in internal affairs .  
In distributing the productive forces , designing the industrial structure and planning regional development , we should encourage the advanced , stress efficiency , give higher priority to selected projects as necessary , and let good examples spur on others .  We should also pay attention to structural balance and coordinated development , and to gradually narrowing the gap between different regions and between different trades so as to benefit national unity and social stability and eventually achieve common prosperity .  
At present Sino-US relations are facing new opportunities .  The most fundamental thing for maintaining the momentum of healthy and steady development of Sino-US relations is to firmly grasp the overall situation in their relationship and the common interests of their peoples , persist in handling their bilateral relations from the strategic level and from the long-term angle , and in particular , adhere to the basic norms of international relations of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , equality and mutual benefit , and mutual noninterference in internal affairs .  
It is not the product of wishful thinking that China and the United States should work for establishing a " constructive strategic partnership . "  It is based on their common needs .  It helps the governments of the two countries to grasp the major orientation in developing bilateral relations .  
Their common interests have determined that the area of cooperation between China and the United States will become larger and larger .  A rising and responsible power , China 's constructive participation in global , regional , and major international issues will inevitably make Sino-US cooperation more fruitful .  
Zhu Rongji fully affirmed the positive role played by friends of Hong Kong 's industrial and commercial circles in promoting economic cooperation between China 's interior and Hong Kong and common prosperity of the two places .  He expressed his appreciation for friends of Hong Kong 's industrial and commercial circles , who have the tradition of loving the country and Hong Kong by consistently putting the interests of the country and the nation before anything else .  
At present the world situation is experiencing important and profound changes ; as two major developing countries , China and Iran are facing many common tasks and challenges , and share the same or similar views on many international and regional issues .  The Chinese side is willing to strive for new progress through joint efforts in the long-term and stable relationship of friendship and cooperation in the new century .  
As regards human rights , Li Peng has stressed and pointed out : It is impossible to demand that various countries follow the same viewpoint or mechanically transplant the same mode on the question of human rights , for human rights is an integral concept , and complete and common human rights should include not only the political rights of citizens but also the economic , social , and cultural rights , especially the right of survival and the right of development . 
The Chinese Government has attached importance to the development of relationship with Britain and is willing to bring about long-term , stable , and sound development of this friendly relationship and cooperation in the principle of mutual respect , the sought of common ground while reserving difference , equal and mutual benefit , and joint development .  
At a joint meeting held between Premier Zhu Rongji and the EU leaders in London two years ago , both parties reached a common understanding on accelerating the negotiation process of China 's accession to the World Trade Organization , ( WTO ) .  They also defined the objective of establishing a long-term and stable constructive partnership between China and the EU .  
The party and the government attach great importance to economic development and social progress in areas inhabited by ethnic minority , and attach great importance to training and fostering a contingent of ethnic minority cadres with both moral integrity and ability , taking this as a major measure for safeguarding the unity of the motherland , realizing national regeneration and the common prosperity of all ethnical groups .  
Finally , Zhu Rongji emphasized China 's readiness to join hands with Bulgaria in actively promoting lasting , stable and comprehensive development of friendly bilateral relations in the 21st century , in striving to tap potential in mutually beneficial cooperation on the basis of complete equality , mutual respect , seeking common grounds while reserving differences , and non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , and in constantly substantiating the contents of bilateral relations , strengthening cooperation in international affairs , and safeguarding common interests .

Nevertheless , at the same time , the Taiwan authorities have refused to make appropriate efforts to respond to the two proposals put forward by the mainland of the motherland on clearly promising not to practice the " state-to-state theory " and clearly promising to adhere to the common understanding reached between ARATS and SEF in 1992 that both sides may verbally express their respective views on " adhering to the principle of one China by both sides of the strait . "  They disregarded historical facts .  
During the visit , the two heads of state held talks , and in a constructive atmosphere of mutual understanding , discussed the question of further developing the two countries ' relations of good neighborliness , friendship , and cooperation , and also exchanged views and reached broad consensus on international and regional issues of common concern .

The meeting of the five countries ' heads of state held on 5 July in Dushanbe is a major event in the history of the Eurasian continent .  The " Dushanbe Statement " signed jointly by the five countries ' heads of state marks an excellent beginning of cooperation among the five countries in the new century which fully reflects the common wishes of the people of the five countries to be always friendly toward each other and to become eternal " good neighbors , good partners , and good friends . "  
During the meeting , the five countries ' heads of state exchanged extensive views on the regional situation and on international issues of common interest and reached a broad consensus on building a " big building " for good-neighborly , friendly , and peaceful cooperation oriented toward the 21st century .

During the visits , with specific targets in mind Chairman Li Peng expounded and re-stressed the principled standpoints and viewpoints of China on some important international and regional issues and acquired comprehensive common understanding with the leaders of these six countries .  
The above mutual understanding regarding specific issues that was reached by the two leaders made both sides more full of confidence regarding the prospects for relations between China and Italy , which have numerous points in common politically , have strong complementary natures economically , and have great potential for development .  
Although in each case there are objective and subjective reasons , these cases have something in common : They developed during exceptional times under exceptional conditions , and if they do not pay close attention to improving their quality , they very easily become swell-headed and make wrong decisions .  
With regard to the recent tragic incident of illegal immigration , we also have had a common stand .  China is resolutely opposed to illegal immigration and has formulated strict laws and adopted stern measures to prevent it .  However , trans-national criminal gangs are rampant and very fraudulent .  
Zhu Rongji made clear to the countries visited that China holds an active attitude of developing bilateral ties , and emphasized China 's willingness to strengthen political dialogue and consultations with these countries on the basis of mutual respect , reciprocity based on equality , and seeking common ground while reserving differences .  
Third , the two countries shared common historical experiences .  China and Burma have constantly shown sympathy for and supported each other in their efforts for independence and liberation , safeguarding of national independence and sovereign and territorial integrity , and national construction .  Common national fates have closely linked the two countries together .  
When receiving visiting US Secretary of Defense Cohen in Beijing recently , President Jiang Zemin spoke with him in a grave tone and with sincerity : The Chinese and US Governments and leaders should look far ahead from a high ground , be oriented to the future , grasp the general direction of Sino-US relations from a strategic height and long-term angle , and properly handle Sino-US relations on the basis of the three Sino-US joint communiques and in the spirit of mutual respect , equality , mutual benefit , and seeking common ground while reserving differences .

Thanks to its abundant natural resources , its sound economic foundation , and its strong scientific and technological strength , Sichuan occupies an extremely important position in the development of the western region .  
and Chamber of Representatives Chairman A . Malofeyev . In a friendly , pragmatic , and constructive atmosphere , the two leaders had a thorough exchange of views on bilateral relations and international issues of common interest and reached broad consensus .

Seventy years ago , facing the white terror of the Kuomintang reactionaries , Mr . Deng Yanda established the Interim Action Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang , the predecessor of the Peasants ' and Workers ' Democratic Party , and explicitly set forth the political program of overthrowing the Chiang Kai-shek regime by means of armed force and establishing a political power of common people with peasants and workers as the main body .  After Mr .  
Since assuming office , Taiwan 's new leader has adopted a delaying , evasive approach toward the one-China principle , denying that the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait and the Strait Exchange Foundation had in 1992 reached a common understanding on the one-China principle .  He has changed his wording again and again and yet had no clear and definite measures for easing and improving cross-strait relations and thus has been ridiculed by the Taiwan media as " having saliva of goodwill of a volume enough to drown people but taking no visible action . "  
Huang Yuanzhi , standing committee member of the provincial party committee and secretary of the provincial discipline inspection commission , said : " It is very necessary to carry out admonitory education among party members-cum-cadres .  People like Cheng Kejie , Hu Changqing , and Jin Jianpei followed different orbits of transformation , but they had things in common .  They gave party members-cum-cadres these warnings : First , party members-cum-cadres , particularly leading cadres , must intensify theoretical study , and foster correct outlooks on the world , life , and value .  
Through the east-west cooperation of township enterprises , by supplementing each other with respective advantages , and through the common development of the east and west , as well as the effective distribution of natural resources , the east can shift in an orderly manner its labor-intensive and resources processing-intensive industries to the west and then readjust its product mix and concentrate on developing technology-intensive , capital-intensive , and export-oriented enterprises .  
At the same time , he chaired a CIS summit and visited six CIS countries .  He settled the debt , gas shipment , common border defense issues with the countries concerned and , using security and energy cooperation as cohesive power , improved Russia 's leading role in the CIS . This has further solidified Russia 's security in the adjacent region and its strategic buffer zone .  
At the turn of the century and the millennium today , the international community has realized more and more clearly that the most important factor to narrow the South-North gap and achieve a common development of all countries is to reform the current international economic system and build a just and reasonable new international economic order , which fully reflects and guarantees the economic interests of developing countries .  
Li Peng , chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress ( NPC ) , held official talks with Vytautas Landsbergis , chairman of the Parliament of Lithuania , in the conference room of the Vilnius International Airport on the afternoon of 5 September . They had an extensive exchange of views on bilateral relations , the international and regional situation , and other issues of common concern in a friendly atmosphere .  
The pursuit of peace and development becomes both the common aspirations of the people throughout the world and the theme of our times .  However , the unfair and irrational old order in international politics and economics has yet to undergo fundamental changes .  There is still a long way to go before the two strategic issues of peace and development are solved and a fair and equitable new international political and economic order is established .  
As the most representative and most authoritative international organization of sovereign states , the United Nations has played an irreplaceable role in maintaining world peace , promoting common development , and in establishing a fair and reasonable new international political and economic order .  
Resolving only the issue of poverty in developing countries is far from enough .  It is essential to create a favorable external environment for developing countries , provide them with capital , technological , and manpower support , and help them eliminate the " digital gap , " so that all countries of the world can seek common development and prosperity in the process of economic globalization .  
At the turn of the century , the international situation is going through profound changes .  The world is not peaceful , and various factors that threaten world peace and security have continued to exist .  Regional conflicts arising from racial , religious , and territorial disputes are on the rise , and there are complex conflicts and problems hampering the common development of countries .  
Li Peng stressed : China and Russia share extensive common interests ; and have had fruitful cooperation in a series of major international issues in recent years , including human rights , the anti-missile issue [ fan dao ] , arms control , and the reform of the United Nations . Such cooperation should go on in the future . 
After studying Cheng Kejie 's case , Hu Changqing 's case , and some other typical cases , we have found that they shared some common characteristics : They had economically grown insatiably avaricious and had become corrupt and degenerate in their daily life .  
Even the present conviction for illegal handling of classified information and the nine-month prison term are excessive because similar practices are rather common in major scientific research institutions and government organs in the United States , and the overwhelming majority of the handlers would get away unscathed or with disciplinary sanction .  
The voice of the greater number of developing nations has been a united voice , particularly focusing on suffering from unfair treatment and other issues , and stressing that we must through strong efforts establish a new international political and economic order that is equal , just , and rational .  The " joint declaration " passed by the conference embodies the spirit of seeking common ground and reserving differences , and achieved positive results .  
During his visit to the six countries , Li Peng met and held talks with presidents , parliamentary leaders , and prime ministers of those countries , exchanged views with them on bilateral relations including contacts between parliaments as well as other issues of common concern in a profound , frank , and friendly manner .  Li Peng also had wide-ranging discussions with people from various walks of life in various countries , including parliaments , governments , and economic , cultural , education , and science and technology circles .  
The passing of PNTR marks the realization of normalization in Sino-US economic and trade relations , is a win-win outcome , lays a foundation for long-term and stable development of the Sino-US economic and trade cooperative relationship , is in accord with the common interests of the Chinese and American people , and is of major significance for the comprehensive , stable , and healthy development of Sino-US relations .  
The current centralized cleanup has further implemented " several regulations on rigorous enforcement of economy and curbing luxury and waste practiced at party and government organs issued by the State Council under the Central CPC Committee , " promoted the development of cultivating honesty and self-discipline among leading cadres at central and state organs , and improved the common practices at various organs , in addition to saving a huge amount of state funds .  
With those in subordinate positions following the example set by their superiors , the entire industrial and commercial administration department of Zhuhai was " rotten from the inside out . "  The local common people all said that if the industrial and commercial administration cadres were all dragged out to be shot , there would not be a single innocent man wrongly killed .  
At a news conference held for the " China-Africa Cooperation Forum-Ministerial Meeting in Beijing in the Year 2000 , " Ji Peiding said the current meeting has two main topics : One is how to promote the establishment of a just and reasonable international political and economic new order geared to the needs of the 21st century in order to protect the common interests of developing countries , and the second is how to further strengthen cooperation between China and Africa in economic and other tangible fields .  
In line with the aim of " consultation on an equal footing , increasing understanding , expanding consensus , strengthening friendship , and promoting cooperation , " the two sides will jointly discuss major issues , such as how to push for the establishment of a new just and rational , international , political , and economic order geared to the 21st century ; how to safeguard the common interests of developing countries ; and how to further enhance Sino-African trade and economic cooperation .  
Tang Jiaxuan said : The current forum has two major topics : First , facing the 21st century , how we should work to establish a just and reasonable new international political and economic order in order to ensure developing countries ' common interests .  
He expressed his firm belief that establishment of a new type of partnership relations between China and African countries within the framework of South-South cooperation , and , in the principle of equality , mutual benefits , diversification , attaching importance to practical results , and common development , deepening and broadening bilateral cooperation in all fields , will be a positive contribution to the establishment of a new international political and economic order .  
The Ambassador said : " I particularly appreciate the remarks made by the late Premier Zhou Enlai that we should ' seek common ground on major issues while reserving differences on minor points . '  Japan and China have normalized their relations for nearly 30 years , and the obligations shouldered by the two countries in maintaining world peace and prosperity have indeed been steadily growing .  Looking forward into the 21st century , I believe that Japanese-Chinese relations will definitely develop into a relationship based on solid mutual reliance that can contribute to world peace . "  
In response to some important issues with common interests in both the Asian side and the European side , the Chinese Government proposed the holding an Asia-Europe environmental ministerial meeting , carrying out scientific and technological cooperation in Asian and European forest protection and sustainable development , and holding a seminar of Asian and European law enforcement institutions on cracking down on transnational crimes .  These proposals also won support from various Asian and European countries .  
In the sphere of political cooperation , the priority tasks to be carried out are the increase of political dialogues between the senior officials of various countries , the acceleration of the United Nations ' reforms , the promotion of the common interest of international organizations , and some global issues of common concern ( such as the restrictions on the proliferation of large-sized weapons , the solution of worldwide environmental protection , the crackdown on transnational crime , money laundering , and international terrorism , and others ) .  
The DPP-led " Executive Yuan " asserted that stabilizing the political situation and getting rid of the economic crisis would be taken as two major tasks to tackle .  But it has not introduced any new measures on improving cross-strait relations - - an issue of common concern to the Taiwan public .  
Deng Xiaoping Theory has provided the powerful ideological weapon for our party to understand the world and remold the world , and it is also the spiritual dynamic to gather and inspire the entire party and people of the whole country to attain the common ideal and promote overall social progress .  
On the contrary , since the new economies , which have knowledge as the basis , are mainly grouped in the developed countries , and the people of most developing countries are still living in poverty without any chances at all of getting in contact with the revolution of information technology , the differences between the south and north have been further expanded instead due to the " digital gap , " which has thrown a gloom over the prospects of common development and prosperity for the mankind .  
Especially , since the start of reform and opening , nationalities of our country have made tremendous achievements in producing common prosperity and progress in the process of economic development , and have worked continually to consolidate socialist nationality relationships based on equality , unity , and mutual help ; the Chinese nation has shown strong cohesion amid changes in the international situation .  
During his brief stay in the United States , Xiang Huaicheng also held talks with Summers and US National Economic Adviser Sperling [ si po lin ] .  The two sides exchanged views on international and domestic issues of common concern .  On 27 October , representatives of the Chinese Finance Ministry and the US Treasury Department will also hold a Sino-US financial dialogue and the first vice-ministerial-level session of the Sino-US Joint Economic Committee here to exchange views on such issues as capital markets , financial monitoring , corporate reorganization , and disclosure of accounting information .  
Li Peng said that as the social system and development level of various countries are different and their historical and cultural background and concepts on value differ in a thousand ways , it is not at all surprising that they have divergent views on some problems .  The best way of solving the problems is to conduct exchanges and dialogues on the basis of friendliness , equality , mutual respect , and the principle of seeking common ground while reserving differences .  
The Law on the National Common Language adopted at this meeting will provide a correct guide for the normalization , standardization , and healthy growth of our national common spoken and written languages ; and it is therefore conducive to the country 's reunification and national unity , and to our building of socialist material and spiritual civilizations .  The passing of the revised Law on Fisheries is of great significance to stepping up our protection , multiplication , development , and rational utilization of fishery resources ;  
III . The two parties agree to maintain consultations and exchanges between their foreign ministries ; to exchange views on bilateral relations and regional and international issues of common concern in a timely manner ; and to maintain regular contact and communication by taking advantage of various bilateral occasions , so as to vigorously push forward the development of relations between the two countries .  
In his speech , Tang Jiaxuan pointed out that economic and technological cooperation is an important channel for APEC to achieve common prosperity and also an inevitable choice to promote the sustained and steady growth of the world and regional economies under the condition of economic globalization .  
The regular meeting of the general staff departments of the Chinese and Russian armed forces to discuss international and regional situations and issues of common interest is an important component of the Sino-Russian strategic cooperative partnership and a specific embodiment of the further development of relations between the two armed forces , and it will help both sides not only strengthen mutual understanding and trust but also coordinate their stand and strengthen their cooperation in international affairs .  
China always maintains that economic and technological cooperation is an important channel for APEC to achieve common prosperity , and an inevitable choice for promoting the sustained and steady growth of the world and regional economies under the conditions of economic globalization .  
He said that China and Sudan have a common language on many issues and are faced with the complex and ever-changing international situation ; the Chinese side is willing to continue increasing coordination and cooperation with Sudan and make concerted efforts to establish a new international political and economic order characterized by fairness and rationality , and to safeguard the common interests of the developing countries .  
At the end of the visit , Chi Haotian said he was accorded a warm reception by the Algerian Government and armed forces during the visit .  He also had fruitful talks with leaders of the Algerian Government and armed forces on issues of common concern .  The visit has enhanced mutual understanding and friendship between the peoples and armed forces of the two countries and achieved complete success .  
They stressed that a healthy and fair multilateral trade system will improve the sustainable and stable growth of world trade and promote common prosperity for both the developed nations and the developing nations .  
It was stressed at the eighth APEC informal leadership meeting that APEC needs to enhance economic and technological cooperation centered on human capacity building and human resource development so as to narrow gaps between member states and to realize common development .  
The theme is aiming at the future , and it is designed to reflect the latest developments and trends of the international and regional situation , meet the objective needs of Asian-Pacific regional cooperation , maintain continuity of the APEC work , respect the APEC 's principle of diversity and consensus through consultation , seek the converging point of the interests of all parties to the maximum extent , and promote common development and prosperity among all APEC members .  
As a major power in the Arab world and Africa , Wu said , Egypt has played an important role in regional and global affairs .  Egypt has won widespread acclaim for maintaining peace and stability in the Middle East region and the world at large , strengthening unity among the Arab and African nations , and promoting and developing common prosperity of the developing nations .  
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi expressed here today his appreciation for the efforts of US President Clinton in improving Sino-US ties during his presidency over the past eight years .  He said : So long as both Chinese and US leaders , especially US leaders , are able to regard Sino-US ties with a long-term and strategic viewpoint , to abide by the three Sino-US joint communiques , and to fully understand the basic common interests between China and the United States , Sino-US ties will healthily and steadily advance forward in the new century .  
Chi Haotian said : China has attached great importance to developing friendly cooperative relations with Tunisia . China will adhere to the basic principle of " being sincere and friendly to each other , treating each other as equals , maintaining unity and cooperation , seeking common development , and facing the future , " and will jointly build a new long-term , stable , and comprehensive cooperative partnership with African countries to gear to the needs of the 21st century .  
Zhu Rongji said : Not long ago , President Jiang Zemin made a historical visit to Cambodia and reached extensive common understanding with King Norodom Sihanouk and Your Excellency Prime Minister on strengthening the traditional good neighborly friendship between China and Cambodia . The Chinese side wishes to make joint efforts with the Cambodian side to implement the " Joint Statement " signed by the two sides to strengthen friendship and cooperation in various fields . 
In the new century , the party 's basic requirements for the united front are to hold high the banner of patriotism and socialism , unite with all forces that can be united , bring all positive factors into play , and turn native factors into positive ones to serve the purposes of developing socialist economics , politics , and culture with Chinese characteristics , maintaining the political situation characterized by unity and stability , realizing the complete reunification of the motherland , and safeguarding world peace and promoting common development .  
We must hold high the banner of patriotism and socialism , combine the advanced and extensive requirements , and strive to give play to the united front 's positive role in advancing cultural construction ; at the same time , we must strengthen ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural construction within the united front , and promote the firm establishment of common ideals and moral pillars in society as a whole and the improvement of the whole nation 's scientific and cultural qualities .  
When the talks were about to conclude , the SEF representative proposed three more forms of expression and also produced the content of their final expression : " Although in the course of the common efforts of both sides in pursuing national reunification , both sides uphold the one China principle , they have different understanding regarding the meaning of one China .  
Their common goals are : Actively explore China 's enormous market , strive hard to bring China into the world economic and international political systems dominated by the West , use the game rules formulated by Western countries , which are led by the United States , to restrain China , maintain the status quo in the Taiwan Strait , prevent armed conflict in the Taiwan Strait , strengthen ties with regional allies , and step up the efforts to contain and guard against China in the security domain .  
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said today : The Chinese government has pursued a consistent and clear-cut stance on the Kashmir issue .  We welcome and support all efforts conducive to improving Indian-Pakistani ties and alleviating regional tension .  Such efforts conform to the fundamental interests and common aspiration of the peoples of both India and Pakistan , and also are good for peace , stability , and development in south Asia .  
3 .  Both sides stress the importance of exchanging views on international and regional issues of common concern , and express the willingness to promote bilateral and multi-lateral cooperation .  China and Armenia will work for the establishment of a just and reasonable new international political and economic order based on the purpose and principles of the United Nations Charter and other widely recognized norms governing international relations .  
On the one hand , as a socialist country , China upholds the principal role of public ownership in the economic field , adheres to the leading position of the CPC in the political field , and persists in the guiding role of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory in the ideological and cultural fields .  The people 's uniformity has tremendously increased in terms of fundamental interests , common ideals , and target of endeavor .  
[ Wang ] Upon entering the new century , the party 's basic requirements on united front work are : Holding high the banner of patriotism and socialism ; uniting with all the forces that can be united ; mobilizing all positive factors ; turning negative factors into positive ones ; catering to the establishment of socialist economy , politics , and culture with Chinese characteristics ; catering to the political situation of stability and unity ; catering to the realization of the motherland 's complete reunification ; catering to world peace ; and catering to common development .  
Consequently , the common objectives that the two major parties in the United States have been pursuing in recent years as far as China is concerned are : to vigorously exploit the huge market in China , with a view to bringing China into the West-led world economic system and international political system , so as to restrain China with the rules of game laid down by Western countries ;  
Hu Jintao emphasized : In the face of complex , changeable international situation at the turn of the century , the further strengthening and development of PRC-DPRK traditional friendship is not only in line with the common aspirations and fundamental interests of the two parties and two countries , but also conducive to safeguarding peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula , Northeast Asia , and the world as a whole .  
Those attending the forum promised to thoroughly study and implementthe guideline laid down by the National United Front Work Conference , and bring intofull play their own strong points in close connection with their own characteristics.They also pledged to energetically conduct economic , political , and cultural affairs for building socialism with Chinese characteristics and maintain a political situation characterized by stability and unity .  They also promised to serve the complete reunification of the motherland , maintain world peace , and promote common development .  
Hu Yuanshao , the eighth chairman of the European Federation of Overseas Chinese and Ethnic Chinese Mass Organizations and president of the Austrian General Association of Ethnic Chinese , said : An early accomplishment of peaceful reunification by China is the common wish of overseas Chinese and ethnic Chinese . The pursuit of " Taiwan independence " is not tolerable to the international community , much less to the sentiment of fellow countrymen living abroad .

They not only encouraged other Western fast food businesses to set up shop here , but also set the pace for local fast food outlets such as Chicken House , Ting Kua Kua and Han Hua , whose common features are based on McDonald 's example of clean , bright surroundings , hygienic food and speedy service with a smile .  
" The age of the solo aerial combat hero is over , the tendency in the modern air force is towards group tactics requiring a high level of coordination between friendly aircraft . " Commandant Chuang Chung-i goes on to explain that the students ' most common mistake is not giving clear enough instructions , so that an advantage only ten seconds away is lost through delay . " In a real combat situation , that would mean being shot down and killed . "  
But overseas surveys have shown baldness is spreading " up top " in highly civilized countries among high-density urban populations and overstressed workers . It 's more and more common for people talented and handsome in their youth to be struck by baldness with the onset of middle age , and growing numbers of people are worried about hair loss once they turn 25 .  
What they shared in common was in showing new problems brought about by social development , such as conflicts between development and traditional ways of thinking or the adverse health effects of pollution and the fast pace of contemporary life brought about by industrialization . I feel the articles have a lot of reference value , because these situations are ones that the mainland is encountering or is going to encounter in the course of opening up .  
But one can discover from many popular stories that the Jade Emperor is buy no means beyond anger and fury , completely impersonal and objective , or able to see all the fine points clearly . On the contrary , He is quite " human , " and often becomes angry so that the common people suffer through no fault of their own , or listens to rumors and half-truths .  
Thinking back to the dictatorial imperial system , " worshipping Heaven " was a special privilege reserved for the Son of Heaven ( the Emperor ) . in the Ching dynasty , there was still the regulation that any ordinary person caught worshipping Heaven directly would be punished with 80 strokes of the rod , so that common folk had no choice but to worship in secret .  
What disturbed the Mexican people was the presence of another group who had entered the Northern Territory as common laborers on the newly opening land but who through their mutual aid and commercial savvy were able to shed their status as slaves and emerge as a class of " small capitalists " in little more than ten years . Starting with restaurants , laundry shops , and grocery stores and moving on to shoe factories , and garment factories , the Chinese carved out a definite niche for themselves in the economy of northern Mexico .  
Thus when the fifteenth day of the seventh month rolls around , the common people in turn extend a hand to lost , roaming souls of the dead who are commonly called " the good fellows . " Those temples which perform special rituals will erect a twenty-or thirty-foot-high lantern pole , and stick on bamboo leaves , and inscriptions honoring the Three Magistrates are written on the lanterns . The higher the lantern tower and the more lost souls attracted , the greater the merit accrued .  
The faculty report issued under Day thus stated that the purpose of the university " is not to teach that which is peculiar to any one of our professions , but to lay the foundation which is common to them all . . . . The advantages furnished by residence in college can do little more than stimulate and aid the personal efforts " of the individual student . The report remained influential through the Civil War , and moderated the speed of the introduction of a utilitarian curriculum into US universities .  
Exercise : The Stepping Stone to Rehabilitation : Taking sufferers from infantile paralysis as an example , Wu says that if no rehabilitation treatment is administered , lower limbs are too weak to support the body and normal walking is impossible . Excessive joint friction , ineffectual muscles , and numbness are common consequences , resulting in " second-degree disability . " Some cerebral palsy victims sometimes reach the point where their entire bodies need rehabilitative treatment , Wu explains .  
The museum enables employees to gain a concrete idea of just how we built up our corporate reputation and an understanding of what each department does , " explains the museum 's director , Wu Mu-hsiang . Learning about the past gives them common memories and produces a sense of cohesion , he says , citing an example . When they discovered a refrigerator made 30 years ago still being used in one family 's kitchen , their hearts lit up with pride .  
Head librarian Wu Wen-chin says : " The work of the library is comprehensive . When we arranged all our common Chinese and Japanese books , we edited a catalog of 72 volumes , which was a huge process that was only finished eight years ago . After that we began an automatic system , which requires a very big budget . "  
This group of new directors , called the fifth generation , includes such figures as Chen Kai-ge and Tian Zhuang-zhuang . They share some things in common . Because of the cultural revolution , they all lost the chance to study . Among those 20 million intellectual youths dispersed to the remote regions to live with the peasants , they know about these places ' odd customs .  
The main characters in these dramas were mostly country girls , women vendors , or actresses in dramatic troupes . The trademark Hsinhua film was a common love story built around these leading characters . Production was simple , and performance techniques were based on traditional Chinese opera or the singing techniques of folk songs . To these were added clever , catchy songs by the basic team of Yao Min , who wrote the music , Chen Tieh-yi , who composed the lyrics , and Yao Li , who sang the vocals offstage .  
Probably the most common type of amulet is a lion 's head carved on a wooden panel , hung on the lintel over the front door . Its simple , mottled colors and stern features stand guard over the entrance day and night , keeping evil at bay .  
Entertaining at home will become more and more common in Taiwan in the future , " says Li Tao , the director of external affairs at Ford Lio Ho Motors , who will occasionally whip up a few steaks for special guests . The is play of personal care , the warm atmosphere and the savings all make entertaining at home a good choice .  
Many public officials are a step ahead of these laws , publicly declaring their assets before they go into effect . " Snails without a shell , " those too poor to afford to buy a house , have grabbed the opportunity to show their moral incorruptibility . But under-reporting was common . It seemed as if everyone was deeply afraid of being wealthy , worried that they would be deemed a " gold bull . "  
Perhaps a philosophy of life and death can be free from objectivity , formality , and rigidity , but it has the opposite critical problem of becoming personalized , and freely verified only in one 's own mind , so it is impossible to come to a common spiritual consensus .  
His eldest daughter Chung Yu-ching retorts that there is less and less field work to be done , and at home appliances have taken over many tasks formerly done by hand , so it 's impossible to insist that modern women live like those in the past . In Taiwan , young people share a common backdrop to their upbringings , a common language , and a great deal of information . The impact of traditional family education is waning , and can not overcome social values , schooling , and peer interactions .  
Taking this theme a step farther , Chu Chia-hua 's cloth of abundantly colorful flowers and dried roses uses common objects to show the consumer manipulation people are subject to in modern urban life , where the flow of information is unchecked .  
" This is because in the past in every medium of communication , the listener 's role was the smallest , " says " Nation United " host Ling Er-hsiang . Every time a major incident takes place , the media hurriedly interview government officials and expert scholars or elected representatives . " But really , the people are most important , not to mention the fact that the opinions of some common citizens are more outstanding and cut closer to reality . "  
Although Taiwan practices democratic politics , bureaucratic corruption also exists ; Taiwan 's economy is relatively advanced , but suffers the vital weaknesses of scarce resources and over-reliance on others ; the people of Taiwan have quite a high standard of living , yet there are still classes which rely on welfare payments to make ends meet ; Taiwan has been quite deeply influenced by Western culture , yet still maintains traditional Chinese culture and traditional Confucian thinking , family values and even our ancient culinary culture , all of which spring from a common source .  
But what they have in common is a deep love of the photographic image , which leads them to choose photography for their creative work . When their works appear , they almost always break with accepted ideas that a photograph creates a record , is decided in an instant , is immutable and is capable of unlimited reproduction .  
Under the assimilation policy , the Japanese issued the Taiwan education law , eliminated differential education , implemented the common study system , recognized improperly documented marriages , set basic principles for internal governance , and more .  
But other textbooks do give a thoroughly positive view of Emperor Yu 's achievement in taming the waters : one first-year secondary school textbook describes how through 13 years of ceaseless effort , Yu finally brought the flood waters under control , and how " while he was taming the waters , he would often pass by his own door without going in . This spirit of selflessness and working for the common good aroused people 's deep admiration . " How do textbooks from the three areas handle lessons on moral character and proper behavior ?  
And once they have been admitted , it is difficult to discharge them . Chronic illness includes stroke-induced paralysis , pathological changes to the liver and kidney , and rheumatoid arthritis . Patients with those afflictions can not possibly get well and leave the hospital within a short period of time . As a result , those patients who are actually in urgent need of hospitalization can not find a bed covered by insurance ( ie . , in common rooms with three or more beds ) .  
The notion of female chastity began to be reinforced . Previously it had been common for widows to remarry , but from the Song onwards remarriage was seen as " unchaste , " and was not tolerated by the society of the time . Stories such as " The widow cutting off her arm " ( after it had been accidentally touched by a man ) and " An injured breast left untreated " ( because exposure to the doctor 's gaze would have been worse than death ) were taken as models and ideals and widely promoted .  
In fact , the real cause of power rationing and blackouts can be seen from even a superficial glance : Because of rapid economic growth with a corresponding increase in national wealth , commercial and industrial demand for electricity has risen while consumer electric products have become common . On top of these , Taipower has run into land-acquisition problems and local resistance for plants it planned to develop , so these plants have not been able to come on line in a timely manner .  
The common saying goes , " Mild in the south , salty in the north , sour in the east , and spicy in the west . " The food of Fujian , which lies in the south of China , is best known for its light , fresh flavor .  
Traditional dwellings used very direct methods to deal with these problems : " first avoid , then block . " Professor Lin Sheng-feng explains that the most common method was for traditional courtyard farmhouses to be surrounded by a " green wall " of bamboo planted as a windbreak . Later , " typhoon shutters " were developed : thick wooden boards or metal plates which could be hung up over windows .  
Knowledge vs . philosophy of lifeThe classics were attacked as part of the old civil service exams , but the exams , which were graded irrespective of social rank and made it possible for men of common background to serve the nation , were bad only for having set questions and standards for grading . Particularly near the end , people were selected based on how they wrote " the eight-legged essay , " which imposed great restrictions on form and wiped out originality of thought .  
For a while now , Li Wen-ling , an elementary school teacher , has led her entire class in reading the classics during activity period . Because this was n't common in schools when she started , she had to play the hard and lonely role of pioneer . In addition to a few parents who looked askance on the activity , her students would ask why they had to recite when other kids did n't and would use the classical Chinese they had learned in class to attack her in their essay books .  
Contrary to the common impression that expatriates have little contact with their native land , more than 80% of the respondents had been back in Taiwan within the past three years . More than half had been in Taiwan within the previous year . This suggests that they have maintained close ties with Taiwan . In terms of provincial origin , a plurality of our respondents - - more than 40% - - were second generation mainlanders ( that is , children of fathers who left mainland China before 1949 ) .  
In regard to this problem , Paolaban believes that each indigenous group has its own distinct naming method ; recovering the names is not the action of individuals , but should be based on information from a detailed survey . From common discussions among the nine groups and linguistic scholars , a single universal system should be derived .  
A food supply is the most basic of human needs , and farm produce is the last bastion of protectionism in the ROC ; it is also the segment most prone to sensitive price fluctuations . This situation is not unique to Taiwan , but is common throughout the world . Fortunately , except for agricultural produce , most household items , domestic appliances , cosmetics and so on were thrown open to free competition earlier , and so have already entered an era of more stable prices in line with those in advanced countries worldwide .  
Second , because the members of these societies do n't have a high level of education , the clubs are very much a part of local Taiwanese culture - - virtual reflections of common Taiwanese society . " These poetry societies were not established in the modern academic era , and so they are representative of local temple fair society , " Chien says .  
Fifty years of a common destiny forged in fortune and misfortune have united us all into a closely bound and interdependent community . The first-ever popular presidential election has reconfirmed our collective consciousness that we in Taiwan have to work together as one . How to make this land of ours more beautiful and how to make its inhabitants feel safer and live a happier and more harmonious life is the common responsibility of our 21.3 million people !  
Han Pao-te , who now heads the preparatory office to set up the Tainan National College of the Arts , says that the Chinese were skilled in the use of water , which was the most common source of motive power . An example is the water wheels used to raise water for irrigation . " The astronomical clock tower represents Chinese water culture , and from the celestial globe and armillary sphere we can see the Chinese conception of the heavens , so they are an expression of the Chinese soul . "  
Of late , members of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly , the highest publicly elected body at the provincial level , have been embroiled in numerous scandals involving election bribery , libel charges , financial disputes and various lawsuits . In an effort to clean itself up and drive out malevolent forces , the Assembly conducted a prayer session in honor of the " good brothers , " thereby resorting to ghosts instead of turning to the common people .  
Against this background , Huang advises that it is inappropriate for students , lacking experience in society and with immature minds , to be allowed to participate in long-termed , closed activities like the summer camp . Moreover , he suggests , the government should regulate all religious activities that do not follow general practice or common sense . Otherwise , it is not impossible that similar crises of family and social ethics will again occur .  
Li describes a six-hour procedure in which he participated : The patient was suffering from a malignant tumor on the common bile duct , which connects to the hepatic duct , bile duct , and pancreatic duct . Because it affected so many organs , the surgery was extremely difficult . Seven persons-the assistant chief of the hospital , a chief resident , a resident , an anesthe-siologist , and three nurses-labored for those six hours to complete the job .  
One of the more extreme examples often cited is that of the nearby Philippines , where university education is very common . Nevertheless , even the Filipina maids who come to work in Taiwan have university diplomas , thus wasting the talented manpower of that nation . How should the quality of human labor be synchronized with economic development ?  
Its functions were similar to that of a small-scale city government . Besides managing the affairs of businessmen , it also handled the affairs of a municipal government , such as ferry services , night watchman duties and relief for the poor during the winter months . In the past , the imperial government did almost nothing at all . They only handled taking taxes and spanking the common people 's bottoms ( keeping public order ) , so business organizations joined together to manage city government on their own .  
Vegetarian food in the US is less than exemplary . Besides salad bars , the most common offerings are tasteless , squishy boiled vegetables . And canned foods are even less appetizing . No wonder the only way they could persuade kids to consume veggies was to show Popeye saving the damsel-in-distress by eating spinach .  
Anyone who has eaten kimche before might have an idea what to expect in Korean vegetarian cooking . The variety of vegetables is simple ; and steaming , boiling , and scalding are the most common cooking techniques . Oil is not often used , with sugar , soy sauce , sesame oil , hot peppers , and garlic-all ( save sugar ) powerful acrid flavorings-being preferred . Jung really enjoys this style , and feels that these are simple vegetarian recipes that people can use for a long time without getting tired of them .  
In Western music , perhaps it 's only the composer who is creative , while all the rest are interpreters . In Chinese music , the creators are at every level , and the performers are especially important creators . It is " homogeneous evolution , " " looking for difference in homogeneity , looking for similarity in difference , " " common appreciation of the elite and the popular , stressing commonality over difference . " These seem to be simple , ordinary descriptions , but this is its real nature .  
Q : As you have said , the intellectuals threw out the most refined part of traditional music , and ordinarily people talk about aesthetic values in social terms , in terms of elite or common values , so they belittle folk music . In an era such as this , when traditional music is becoming more and more distant from modern life , what use does it have , and how do we obtain access to it ?  
After a trip abroad , he discovered that Chinese Muslims had little understanding of their own religion 's doctrines , and were in dire need of an accurate Qur'an and other materials for interpreting it . He thus spent more than 20 years translating three Chinese texts altogether : one in classical Chinese , one in jingtangwen ( an old form with specific religious terms left in their original form , that is , not translated into a common equivalent ) , and one in the vernacular .  
Currently , the problem is that " there are no rules of the game . Just looking at circulation tricks to expand or maintain sales , apart from giving discounts , giving papers away for free is also common , " suggests mass communications scholar Hsu Chia-shih . There is no mutual trust in the newspaper industry , and there is no objective standard to determine " number of newspapers sold . " That is why they are so chilly toward the ABC .  
Although the traditional robe-and-vest has virtually disappeared , the comfortable Tang suit has survived , and remains a formal wear choice for a select few . Originally , the Tang suit was a term foreigners used , in a sweeping way , to describe all Chinese fashion . In fact , what people have over time come to define as the Tang suit is something that was created in the late Qing and early Republican era among the common people .  
The desire of " civilized " humanity for material goods is insatiable . Man is also the only animal to have developed commerce . Ivory has been a common raw material since the earliest days of markets , and its consumption has grown continuously .  
Although under the pens of literati since the Tang and Song , this fairy visitor among flowers had been washed clean of all connection with the vulgar mortal world , for the common people the osmanthus symbolized gold and jade , fame and fortune , and success at every level in the imperial examinations . So in the end even the literati could not escape the mundane .  
Furthermore , public electricity service in Nicaragua was unreliable , and brown-outs were common . The electric generator which the hotel used had insufficient wattage , so embarrassing episodes of guests with heads full of soap suds wrapped in bath robes screaming complaints were all too common .  
Taiwan composer Ma Shui-lung affirms Wong 's heartfelt efforts . But , purely from a musical point of view , he feels that the arrangements could be broader and deeper . Though it is great that popular tunes can be arranged to be more edifying without losing their common touch , it is also worth performing truly original works ; after all , the space for Chinese music is broad .  
The ROC government had been established on Taiwan for 20 years and the fruits of land reform had provided a basis for the greater prosperity of the common people . Economic activity , primarily from public investment , was flourishing . However , the island was still under martial law , political prohibitions such as those outlawing the establishment of political parties had not yet been repealed , and the social atmosphere was tense .  
This recognition returned me again to thinking about that tension experienced by the expatriate between the nagging desire to retreat back to one 's own country and the dogged intention to stay where one is . And it suggested some common ground between the fear and fascination I see written on the face of the two-year-old who comes upon me in the mall and my own fascination with the specter , every day repeated , on sidewalks all around me filled with " foreign " Asian faces .  
Jan Jyh-horng responded that although Taipei has never sought to avoid political negotiations aimed at eventual reunification , both Beijing and Taipei would first have to approach such negotiations with a common understanding that " the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are ruled by separate and equal entities . "  
Not conceding defeat , she filed a final appeal for a constitutional ruling . According to statistics in the yearbook of the Judicial Yuan , intentional abandonment is the most common grounds for divorce , accounting for more than half of all cases , many of which hinge upon the wife not living at her husband 's official residence .  
" I keep mulling over this thought : Has this natural , simple , non-calculating character of the common man been lost under the capitalist system with its private ownership of property ? When these three people begin to specialize , they will become more adept at running the restaurant and become more calculating . Will the three of them be as happy then as they are now ? "  
In recent years organically grown vegetables have become increasingly popular . " Wild " veggies , grown without depending on man-made fertilizers and not using pesticides , fit right in with this trend . Add to this the common belief that bitter tasting foods have medicinal value , and wild vegetables have become a new favorite for health-minded modern people .  
The fairy realms portrayed in literature have many established features . A common plot element is that if a visitor to fairyland stays there , he can live there as an immortal forever . But usually the hero is stricken with homesickness and leaves ; once back among the distracting , vulgar pleasures of the mortal world , he never finds his way into fairyland again .  
All the women who volunteer their services at Hsing Tien Temple understand that they can not go to the temple during their menstrual period . A common sight at temple festivals in Taiwan is the jitong , or spirit medium , who defies nature by piercing his body and walking over hot coals without bleeding or blistering .  
Laozi and Confucius both emerged late in the Spring and Autumn period , in a time of frequent warfare when the system of moral education through ritual and music of the Zhou dynasty ( 11th century-256 BC ) had collapsed , and the nobility had abandoned themselves to a life of wanton extravagance supported by ruthless exploitation of the common people .  
Fan also wrote China 's first fish farming manual , thus paving the way for the aquaculture industry of later generations . From the Tang dynasty onwards , it became common practice to raise such fish as common carp , mud carp , blunt snout bream , black carp and grass carp together , with the different species-some carnivorous and some herbivorous-occupying different niches within the waters of the same pond . " From a modern perspective this was very scientific , and consistent with maintaining an ecological balance , " says aquaculture nutritionist Chuang Chien-lung .  
These included " fish souls , " made from the lips cut from live sturgeon ; " Xi Shi 's bosom , " made with white fat from pufferfish bellies and named after a famous beauty ; and the " gold soup and jade slices " served by Mrs . Song outside Qiantang Gate , which comprised a thick wild rice stem soup and sliced raw common carp and crucian carp .  
" This is something that both sexes want , " avers Wang Hao-wei , psychiatrist and author of the book Taiwan Men . Women , he notes , are experiencing rising self-consciousness , and want equal status and a fairer division of labor . Men , meanwhile , are hoping to escape rigid traditional roles and to have the chance to be more relaxed , more free to express their true selves . Men and women together have built up and share a common image of a new man .  
Firstly , there is strong support among Taiwan 's population of 22 million people , regardless of ethnic group or provincial ancestry , for the concept of " new Taiwanese . " We share a common life and our interests fully coincide , and as we confront the latest round of threats from communist China it is vital that we rally together to protect our own national security .  
People in their prime years ( 30s and 40s ) have always been considered the elite of the employment structure , positioned as they are between inexperienced workers and aging seniors . But in recent years , there have been dramatic structural changes in the employment market . Unemployment and forced career changes have become increasingly common among workers in their prime .  
Because past surveys of Taiwan faults were mostly limited to examinations of surface geology , with no money to obtain more precise results by digging or drilling under the surface , major mistakes were common . Particularly in metropolitan areas where high real estate prices mean that all the land is covered by buildings , ruptures are impossible to see .  
The Han dynasty and the Roman Empire were unified imperial states facing complex problems , and as a result shared much in common . In particular , their legal systems were extremely pragmatic and concrete , with the focus on day-to-day governance .  
Rather this kind of thing is a " trademark " that has become attached to Taiwanese drama over the course of its history . As a result , even though " nativist drama " has escaped the stereotypical setting of the Taiwanese countryside of the past and increasingly focuses on contemporary urban life , such provocative scenes-playing to elemental emotions to pull on the heart-strings-are still common .  
Lu Hsiao-fen , a film star who has won numerous awards at the Golden Horse and Asia-Pacific film festivals and who has recently jumped into prime time as the female lead in Fortune , explains : " They have a special name for shows that are being broadcast episode by episode as each one is shot : ' ON programming . ' It is common for an episode finished today to be shown two days later . "  
At the door between the living room and dining room , there 's a tall ceramic cylinder suitable for storing scrolls , with a design that features the bright red canna blossom-a common sight in the countryside-around which bees are buzzing . Above are the words : " Busy Bees at Work . " The hardworking artist himself , who spends all day at his labors , is perhaps not unlike those bees .  
On the subject of cross-strait relations , Chen stressed that the people of Taiwan and mainland China share a common ancestral , cultural , and historical background , and he stated his belief that the leaders on both sides have the wisdom and creativity to jointly deal with the question of a future " one China . "  
When these become common , you will be able to go online through television , wireless application protocol ( WAP ) - standard phones , personal digital assistants ( PDAs ) , and even digital watches . Moreover , you 'll be able to stay connected 24 hours a day . It will be just like TV today-flip it on and you are ready to go .  
Many non-flowering aquatic plants propagate through asexual reproduction , which is arguably more efficient than the process employed by terrestrial plants . It is common to think of flowering plants as more advanced , but in Yen 's view , " Maybe plants that can reproduce without going through that process are actually the most advanced from an evolutionary standpoint . "  
In traditional China , single-fold eyelids were favored . But modern people are inclined to want large , bright , expressive eyes . For many years now , making of double-fold eyelids has been the most common procedure among cosmetic surgeons .  
As for gangs and secret societies , these are organizations which have existed among the common people in China since ancient times . They began to grow more widespread in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties , and particularly after the Yongzheng and Qianlong reigns [ 1723-1795 ] , they spread all over China like a cancer . I call them " local armed fighting groups , " and in fact what they did was to fight and grab territory .  
Not the first time Each of these emerging bands has a style of its own , but they also have in common a way of combining homegrown and western styles of music . For example , Luan Tan 's beiguan-derived music alludes to the communal rural spirit of earlier times , something which is being rediscovered in the extra-curricular life of today 's students . It is a collective , pluralist mode of creation which contrasts starkly with the staleness of mainstream pop and illuminates new possibilities for music in Taiwan .  
With simple common sense , a basic level of awareness and proper personal hygiene , the public has very little to fear from infectious diseases .  
The story is much the same when it comes to birds . Surveys of foreign starlings and mynas , also by TESRI , identified 13 non-native members of the family Sturnidae living wild in Taiwan , mainly escaped or released pets and their offspring . " White-vented mynas and common mynas have been recorded in over a third of Taiwan 's 361 urban townships , rural townships and city districts , " says a survey report by Lin Ruey-shing of TESRI .  
While there are few examples of knights-errant with an overriding interest in justice , our recollection of one or two positive attributes dominates our image of these figures . The way we remember selfless Guo Jie and forget his more ruthless contemporaries is a case in point . When people feel oppressed , such idealization is still more common , and whenever China has been in decline the image of knight-errants has waxed bright in the popular mind .  
In such times , people naturally honor a wandering knight who kills on behalf of the powerless . Yuan Jiegang , a scholar of the early Republican era , described the waxing and waning of the knight-errant 's image as follows : Knights-errant were common people who had usurped the power to kill . This could not be tolerated by the imperial authorities . At its height , the Han dynasty sought to eliminate the knights-errant , and their fighting spirit was quickly broken .  
Lin Pao-chun says , " Before Historical Records , Chinese military strategy had absorbed the idea of ruling with compassion , and the highest objective of the student of the martial arts was to eliminate the violence in his own heart . Lin expands on this point , stating that in the ethos of the knight-errant , magnanimity was more important than fighting skill . Moreover , knights-errant were expected to be ethical , moral , honorable , decorous and patriotic , as well as protecting the common folk .  
Red team scholars typically argue that the US and PRC share many long-term interests in common and that a cooperative relationship can be built and maintained . The Clinton administration 's policy of an " active strategic partnership " was based on suggestions made by so-called red team scholars .  
The ITRI 's fever chip applies similar principles . Oligonucleotides from 25 of the most common fever-causing pathogens are arranged on the chip , and infection with any of them can be detected from a single drop of a patient 's blood , urine or cerebrospinal fluid . The fever chip too is currently in clinical trials at National Taiwan University Hospital .  
In fact it is not unusual for a change of seasons to occasionally come early or late and upset the sequence of nature , and it is quite common for plants to be fooled by the weather . In ancient times farmers were aware that " if a fruit tree that normally flowers in spring blossoms in autumn , it will not set fruit . "  
In addition , Taiwan 's background as a former Japanese colony and the many Taiwanese who have studied and worked in the US give the island a human network of international dimensions . Add in the fact that the island shares a common language and culture with China and with ethnic Chinese in Southeast Asia , and the tight ties between its own business , political and academic circles , and Taiwan looks to be very well positioned here at the beginning of the era of globalization .  
In order to protect Penghu 's precious basalt formations , as well as the countless sea birds that pass by here , in 1993 the Council of Agriculture , acting on suggestions from academics , declared a group of islands in the southeast part of Penghu which rarely see human activity to be the Penghu Columnar Basalt Nature Preserve . The basalt islands , like black pearls across the Western Pacific , are glittering assets of the common heritage of mankind .  
Take , for instance , The Myriad Poses of Ants . The large black ants common to Taiwanese fields are seen scurrying on top of a piece of bamboo , transporting food . Every ant has a different pose , and the dark green sheen of Taiwan jade gives the bamboo a great vibrancy . When you look close , the ants almost appear to be breathing .  
At left are pictured conventional ( above ) and " earth bull " ( below ) tops . Though different in shape ( the former are conical and solid , the latter tubular ) , they share one thing in common : it 's not that easy to use them well !  
The emergence of the cross-platform " central editorial desk " has also created a trend for convergence of various personnel previously scattered in different fields such as the visual media , print media and technology firms . Phenomena such as magazine editors operating web sites and publishing their own electronic newspapers , or the China Times investing in Power TV to enable readers of the paper 's electronic edition to watch direct transmissions of the station 's world news online at any time , are becoming more and more common .  
The applications for refined CHM can be extended considerably . Already a number of manufacturers in Taiwan are adding raw materials from Kingstone to all kinds of products , including yogurt and ice cream . These raw materials can also be put to use in natural colorings and flavorings , edible fibers , cosmetic masks , bandages , and more . These uses are already common overseas , with the production value of such products increasing year in and year out , but in Taiwan there is still vast room for R &amp; D and promotion .  
M . Samuel Noordhoff , a doctor from the United States , had been in Taiwan for decades when he founded the NCF in 1990 , and he began taking teams of Taiwan-trained craniofacial surgery experts to other countries in 1998 . Whereas the most common formula adopted to explain overseas aid is " giving something back to international society , " Rebecca Wang says that it would be more accurate to say that they are driven by " a missionary spirit , " with their religious-based concern for others naturally knowing no national boundaries .

Building on the established consensus and taking full advantage of the present political climate , which is conducive to more meaningful international cooperation , States should specify the activities that need to be undertaken for implementation , agree on the pace of such implementation and devote their energies and undivided attention towards achieving the common goals identified in the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan .  
Where it is itself directly concerned , the Russian Federation is firmly guided by the principles of the sovereign equality of States , non-interference in their internal affairs and the freedom of international trade and navigation as mentioned in resolution 49 / 9 , and continues to support normal trade and economic relations with Cuba based on common interest and mutual benefit .  
Aware of the difficulties often involved in travelling or moving goods within the region , Forum members have agreed that their ministers responsible for transport , including shipping and civil aviation , should meet in order to discuss common problems and to identify areas where enhanced cooperation might provide solutions .

My country believes that all Members of the Organization should rise above their differences and shoulder their responsibilities in order to show their true intentions and stand for a common peace that will take the United Nations into the twenty-first century , in which sustainable development will become integral to all nations in the search for a peaceful , secure and bright future for succeeding generations .  
NULLThe conferences took the form of discussions based upon papers and commentaries written by selected individuals , of many differing nationalities and intellectual backgrounds but with one thing in common : that they were all outstanding experts in their various fields ( international law , international relations and relevant social and cultural areas ) .  
Similarity of regulatory and prudential framework may also be desirable , however , even for countries not forming part of a common monetary area , in order to avoid " competitive " inducements for the entry of foreign banks , as well as to permit a greater intercountry / interbank flow of funds conducive to the emergence of geographically wider financial markets in Africa .  
Requirements were outlined in a 1992 guidance document and IAEA provides a standard basis of reference with the International Nuclear Event Scale , which allows a common understanding of nuclear events among the technical community involved , the media and the public .  
Technical institutions and other forms of professional interest groups have a valuable role to play , particularly at the regional level , in articulating commonly held concerns or requirements of countries that are exposed to similar types of hazards or share common geographical or cultural attributes .  
In my view , however , the balance has been very positive - while each step taken by the Committee might have appeared to be modest , the cumulative result is that , in a mere three years , the international community managed to create a framework for concrete action to be taken in response to the common concern with the adverse effects of climate change .  
NULLUNFPA is continuing to play a catalytic role in assisting the member States of OIC to develop common projects using the technical cooperation among developing countries ( TCDC ) model of cooperation and strengthening its collaboration with regional institutions and the specialized institutions of OIC in areas of mutual interest .  
Strongly support United Nations , regional and national efforts on arms control , limitation and disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , in all aspects , and other weapons of mass destruction , including biological and chemical weapons and other forms of particularly excessively injurious or indiscriminate weapons , in pursuit of our common commitment to a world free of all these weapons ;  
NULLWe recognize that our common work will be the more successful if it is supported by all concerned actors of the international community , including non-governmental organizations , multilateral financial institutions , regional organizations and all actors of civil society .  
The root cause of global environmental degradation lay in the unsustainable patterns of production and consumption pursued by developed countries and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change had , quite rightly , set forth common but differentiated responsibilities for change . 
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
The relative success of the Federation in protecting the international civil servant against gross political interference by one member country did not mean that , overnight , FICSA became a respected interlocutor of the management in the common system organizations .  
Initially , i.e . , before the establishment of ICSC 20 years ago , these relationship agreements tying the specialized agencies to the United Nations through adherence to " a single unified international civil service " ( later termed " United Nations common system " ) were intended to be between equals .  
The Group of 77 and China were unable to share the view that the current cash-flow problem was somehow linked to the existing systems of assessment , which were the incremental result of shared experience and common understanding .  
Strongly support United Nations , regional and national efforts on arms control , limitation and disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , in all aspects , and other weapons of mass destruction , including biological and chemical weapons and other forms of particularly excessively injurious or indiscriminate weapons , in pursuit of our common commitment to a world free of all these weapons ;  
For their part , Member States will pursue and take responsibility for reforming that system .  NULLWe recognize that our common work will be the more successful if it is supported by all concerned actors of the international community , including non-governmental organizations , multilateral financial institutions , regional organizations and all actors of civil society .

Conscious of the forthcoming tenth anniversary of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which became the largest technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
We recognize that our common work will be the more successful if it is supported by all concerned actors of the international community , including non-governmental organizations , multilateral financial institutions , regional organizations and all actors of civil society . 
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to cooperate more closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue cooperation in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation ;

their field of activity - telecommunications , atomic energy , patent law , education , agriculture , health , aviation , postal services or trade - the shared concern of the organizations of the common system was loss of competitiveness in relation to other international organizations and national civil services .  
delegation considered that decision unjustified , since it linked the basic level of remuneration in the common system to non-representative remuneration levels in selected subsectors of the United States federal civil service .  
By its resolution 48 / 75 F of 16 December 1993 , the General Assembly recognized that illicit arms trafficking is a disturbing , dangerous and increasingly common phenomenon and that , with the technical sophistication and destructive capability of conventional weapons , the destabilizing effects of illicit arms trafficking increase .  
The Board 's analysis of country offices in the biennium established the common causes of unsatisfactory implementation as political instability , frequent changes in the leadership of implementing partners , delayed delivery of supplies , unrealistic project targets and late receipt of funds .  
The various protagonists must understand that only a new political agreement , based on ordinary common sense , with respect for the intangible principles of democracy , human rights and fundamental freedoms , will contribute to an acceptable solution to all .  
Therefore , assistance to promote economic development in African countries that are committed to the democratization of their institutions will result in the emergence of new political classes that are protected from need and that will be more likely to regard politics as a means of governing a community of men and women who are bound by a territory and a common destiny than as the only means to get ahead in an economically poor environment .  
Nevertheless , just as we understand that the world has changed , that there is a new international agenda governed by the common concerns of all peoples over environment preservation , population growth , respect for human rights , strengthening of democratic systems , recognition of women 's rights , and the social and economic development of nations , we also understand that this Organization must be renewed and readapted to the new world circumstances . 
This interrelatedness of interests has formed a sort of common culture among nations and has created a favourable climate for the exchange of ideas and the tools of knowledge , thus enabling cultural and intellectual interaction among peoples of the world and enhancing a deeper understanding of the bases of world peace and security , an objective which the United Nations has sought to achieve over the past five decades .  
The main purposes of the United Nations , as outlined in Chapter I of the Charter , include the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and also to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends .  
I am confident that the United Nations will continue to do its best to act as a catalyst in the achievement of peaceful coexistence among States , and to reinforce the notion of the interdependence of national aspirations and the common welfare of humanity , thus creating conditions conducive to the political stability and sustainable economic development of States .  
The goals of sustained economic growth , social development , environmental protection and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms set in the plans of action of several international conferences have sustainable development as their common denominator .  
In the meantime , we are pleased that the five major international summits organized by the United Nations , ranging from the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 to Habitat II in Istanbul earlier this year , have proved to be useful in enabling Member States to focus on the various aspects of development and to cultivate a common vision and a comprehensive strategy for cooperation among themselves .  
At the conclusion of the series of high-level world Conferences organized under the auspices of the United Nations in the course of the 1990s , we noted that their common denominator was the promotion of economic and social justice , with the fundamental objective of approaching the structural causes of poverty in a concerted manner .  
In this context , we believe that the current session of the General Assembly must approach with daring and political resolve all current issues of common concern , including those in the areas of international peacekeeping and security and the healing of the economic and social crisis that afflicts the developing world .  
The evident behavioural characteristics of this menace , disguised behind appealing facades , can be summarized in the following manner : first , there is unilateralism , which means a total lack of commitment to mutual cooperation and common solutions , and complete reliance on unilateral measures in various fields .  
Turbay ( Colombia ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : As stated in the draft resolution before us today , the United Nations must be the centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of common ends such as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
In conclusion , convinced that effective , ongoing cooperation between the United Nations and the IPU is fundamental to the achievement of the foregoing common objectives , my delegation looks forward to the annual inclusion of this item in the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly .  
This is because of the close interrelationship and joint interests among members of the international community and the common destiny that binds us together once we recognize that we live in a global village in which geographic borders can not protect others from the physical or mental effects of those problems .  
The report of the Secretary-General on this item ( A / 51 / 381 ) is especially helpful in that it recalls the need to continue cooperation in their common search for solutions to global problems relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation .  
It clearly portrays the endeavours of the United Nations system in implementing General Assembly resolution 50 / 17 of 20 November 1995 , which requested the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation , as well as to continue to expand the parameters of this cooperation in response to the growing needs of our common member States . 
A common understanding of shared objectives by the agencies involved and a willingness to support the Emergency Relief Coordinator and the Department of Humanitarian Affairs are crucial to ensuring an effective , timely and coordinated response to emergencies .  
We should study that document in depth in order to determine the extent to which the mandates established by Member States have been carried out and to enable Member States to establish common priorities in the context of the major political , economic , social administrative and financial issues on the agenda of the Organization .  
This is because their genuine efforts to achieve a just and lasting peace in the region have in recent months met with grave and hostile incidents provoked by the occupying Power with an aggressive and dangerous policy that threatens the course of the peace process in the region .  It is common knowledge that all of this is possible thanks to the support Israel continues to receive from the United States , which has never concealed its determination to veto in the Security Council any resolution that contains firm statements against Israel 's conduct in the Middle East .  
Peace should have prevailed in the post-cold-war world , in which equal members of the international community should respect each other 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , refrain from invading each other or interfering in each other 's internal affairs , and live in harmony with each other , in a spirit of seeking common ground and putting aside differences .  
From the plundering of the oceans , the common heritage of mankind , by unsustainable fishing to the destruction of forests , the poisoning of air and water in disregard for environmental sustainability ; the destruction of communities , marginalization of whole segments of societies and eventually , civil unrest attributable to social unsustainability ; the world has seen the importance of pursuing sustainable development , whether in developed or developing countries or the economies in transition .  
There may be no other single individual who has been as instrumental or as effective in leading the world community in recent years in the difficult search for common ground , particularly on issues relating to environmentally sustainable development .  
After 14 years of consideration of this item in this Committee , my delegation is gratified that the international community now has a better understanding of this remote and pristine continent and of the need for collective efforts to protect this fragile and vulnerable environment for the common benefit of humankind . 
The Working Group entrusted with this issue should also strive to reach an understanding on the possibility of harmonizing legal norms and existing national administrative procedures in the area of domestic control of weapons and in the import and export of arms , in order to establish a common and effective international arms control system that would make it impossible for arms to be diverted through clandestine or illicit channels .  
Themes found in both the guidelines and the common advocacy statement include putting people first ; promoting sustainable human development ; reducing gender inequality and inequity ; fostering accountability and transparency ; developing common indicators that are critical to the monitoring of programme impact ; strengthening country-level collaboration ; enhancing national capacity-building ; and facilitating dialogue between and among the United Nations resident coordinator system , Governments , non-governmental organizations , the private sector and civil society . 
Whereas in the past , neighbouring States had been wary of South Africa 's military strength , South Africa 's current deliberate policy of transparency and the concerted use of common resources to ensure regional stability should form the basis for fruitful cooperation between States in the future .  
At its second regular session of 1982 , the Council decided to identify , at its annual organizational session , a subject relating to interregional cooperation , of common interest to all regions , for detailed consideration under the agenda item on regional cooperation and to request the executive secretaries of the regional commissions to submit their joint recommendations in this regard to the Council at its annual organizational session ( decision 1982 / 174 ) .  
It established the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities of industrialized and developing countries in achieving sustainable development and made clear the responsibility of the developed countries for examining and changing their own consumption and production levels . 
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
Following a technical consultation involving India and Pakistan that had been held at Vienna in July 1994 under the auspices of UNDCP , the Governments of those two States had agreed to meet at regular intervals at the policy and operational levels to review and determine common approaches on drug-related problems affecting their common borders , such as the movement of precursors and trafficking in heroin and other drugs , as well as to establish systems for the regular and systematic exchange of operational information .  
Conscious of the forthcoming tenth anniversary of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which became the largest technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
This has been a common phenomenon in forest history where the movement of unused species , in both temperate and tropical forests , moved from rejected to accepted and even to preferred status in the markets , without any assistance from trade policy measures .  
This initiative , supported by the Government of Jordan , is designed to create a community of potential future leaders who have shared a common training experience in global issues .  
While the largest proportion of activities fall into the traditional areas of administrative reform , training and financial systems improvement , it is increasingly common to receive requests from the field in emerging areas such as transparency , accountability , judicial and legislative administration , disaster management , electoral administration and result-oriented management based on productivity improvement .  
In seeking a common standard of achievement for all people and all countries in the area of human rights , the World Conference on Human Rights , held at Vienna from 14 to 25 June 1993 , called upon all nations , regions and the international community to create favourable conditions for and effective enjoyment of basic human rights .  
In addition to the common staff costs for international and local staff which were calculated based on standard scales , provision is also made for the repatriation of 80 international staff at the end of the Mission at the rate of $ 1,400 per person inclusive an allowance for 100 kilograms of unaccompanied excess baggage ( $ 112,000 ) . 
In this regard , they endorse the commitment made at the seventh meeting of the Andean Presidential Council to strengthen existing ties of cooperation with a view to developing common policies and actions to promote closer cooperation with other countries and regional groupings in order to pursue a concerted , comprehensive effort to combat all of the crimes related to the phenomenon of drugs and illicit substances , including their production , distribution and consumption ; money-laundering ; the diversion of chemical precursors ; and illegal trade in light arms .  
In the same resolution , the Secretary-General was requested to seek cooperation and to join efforts with other international , global and regional organizations and mechanisms that have played an active role in combating money-laundering in order to reinforce common regulatory and enforcement strategies in that area .  
Stress the need to develop a greater range of more attractive positive measures , such as effective instruments to facilitate financial and technology transfers to developing countries in order to assist them to meet multilaterally agreed targets , in keeping with the principle of common but differentiated responsibility ; and recommend that positive measures are preferable to the threat of the use of trade restrictions to secure compliance with the objectives of the MEA .  
48 Argentina has pointed out the merits of common regional strategies and measures against organized transnational crime , while Australia , Canada , Philippines , Republic of Korea and Turkey have drawn attention to the growing number of their bilateral agreements on extradition and mutual assistance in criminal matters .  
Cuban legislation has made association with criminal intent an offence and has proscribed as punishable offences those types of behaviour associated with the most common forms of organized transnational crime , but has made no provision for controlled deliveries and electronic surveillance .  
Japan is of the view that , although it is necessary to consider the formulation of extensive and comprehensive measures , including the preparation of legal norms , in order to standardize the systems of Member States against organized crime , it hardly appears that there is currently an adequate common understanding among Member States regarding the actual pattern of illegal activity in question .  
It emphasized that the principle of a common but differentiated responsibility for developing and developed countries , as outlined in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development , should be applied in any development of measures to protect the atmosphere on a global scale .  
We have always held the view that the progress achieved jointly by the Israelis and the Palestinians for the peace and common prosperity of the region is undeniable proof that any regional dispute , no matter how deep-seated and complex , can eventually be solved through dialogue between the parties directly concerned .  
Those who considered that the question deserved prompt consideration by the Commission stressed that rules concerning the nationality of legal persons might be more common in State practice and customary law , thus lending themselves more easily to systematization , in contrast to the striking absence of specific provisions on the nationality of natural persons in the context of State succession in the legislation of the majority of States .  
Croatia reported a total of 2,064 offences committed involving firearms in 1994 , including 135 murders or attempted murders , 28 cases resulting in serious physical injuries , 375 cases involving crime against common safety , 352 aggravated robberies , 420 cases involving illegal possession of weapons and 30 cases involving concealment of weapons .  
" The relevant provisions of General Assembly resolutions relating to common premises and services in the field should be further submitted by the specialized agencies to their respective governing bodies , which should provide more precise legislative authority to their secretariats on the subject of this report in fulfilment of their treaty obligations under the relationship agreements they have concluded and ratified with the United Nations . "  
ACC members shared the position expressed by the Secretary-General in his report on the triennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system , cited in paragraph 1 above . a / The General Assembly in paragraph 42 of resolution 47 / 199 , recognized the cost factor and indicated that common premises and the consolidation of administrative infrastructures should be achieved without increasing the costs for the United Nations system or for developing countries .  
These include unwanted and unsafe sex ( giving rise to teenage pregnancy , HIV infection and other sexually transmitted diseases ) ; psychoactive substance use , including tobacco and alcohol ; violence and accidents ; and poor nutrition and certain common endemic diseases .  
In developing further the orientation and objectives of national strategies , the Commission may wish to focus on the identification of characteristics of poverty which could be common to most countries , regardless of their definition of poverty and which could be used to measure progress ; the identification of elements for elaborating national strategies comprising macroeconomic , structural , distributional and regulatory policies , together with specific short - and long-term objectives ; and the further identification of specific international actions .  
The regional integration process reveals the simultaneous rise of unidimensional or limited integration agreements , the aim of which is to free markets for goods , services and factors of production ( with the exception of the work force ) , and multidimensional or broad integration agreements , which have already reached the stage of customs unions and which aim at common markets and economic unions and at coordinated , harmonized and even joint policies .

Although at times difficult political , economic and technical problems had to be solved , common sense and the two sides ' commitment to their international obligations always won out .  
The paramount task in the settlement of conflicts is the formation of a common economic area , the all-round development of trade and economic and scientific and technical cooperation , the implementation of joint projects in the field of telecommunications , construction , transport , fuel and energy and environmental protection , and the encouragement of investment and trade on the basis of the universally recognized principles of international law , bearing in mind cultural and historical ties .  
At the same time , the financial benefits of common premises are not evident in all cases , particularly if a move into joint premises can not fully accommodate all operational requirements , or if various current premises are provided by the Government free of charge as part of its in-kind contribution to the organizations , or if opportunities for appropriate premises are scarce and initial costs of moving are significant .  
As we move into the twenty-first century , we offer a positive vision of sustainable human settlements , a sense of hope for our common future and an exhortation to join a truly worthwhile and engaging challenge , that of building together a world where everyone can live in a safe home with a promise of a decent life of dignity , good health , safety , happiness and hope .

Ethnic and religious tensions between Timorese and Indonesians had increased ; mass immigration of Indonesians into the territory of East Timor was continuing ; cases of torture , arbitrary detention , attacks , summary executions , disappearances and killings were becoming increasingly common ; the numbers and violence of the military and police forces were increasing , and many Timorese , especially young people , had become strangers in their own land and had been forced to seek asylum . 
We fully believe that through mutual good will , realism and observance of international commitments , the tendencies aiming at the maintenance of tension in the region will be defeated and a sound political decision in favour of peace and stability and our good multi-purpose relations with the fraternal Republic of Tajikistan will prevail , and no place will be left for the exchange of such notes where wisdom and common sense stand firm .  
Non-environmental related activities in plans of work for exploration .  With regard to the non-environment parameters of the contents of a plan of work for exploration , the review also revealed that , based on considerations such as annual periodic reports of the registered pioneer investors , it would be very useful to come to a common understanding on their achievements and to establish reasonable performance targets during the 15-year period of an approved plan of work for exploration .  
In Brazil , for example , the National Confederation of Health-care Cooperatives ( Unimed do Brasil ) has grown from a single cooperative set up in 1967 to a business complex now comprising 304 provider-owned health cooperatives , many owning hospitals , organized in 17 State-level networks , and a national holding company that owns subsidiaries in insurance and provides bulk purchasing and common services for members ' hospitals and clinics ; data management and communications ; and training , research and development .  
The cooperative movement believes that democratic procedures applied to economic activities are feasible , desirable and efficient , and that democratically elected economic organizations make a contribution to the common good .  
A cooperative is an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic , social and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise .  
Accordingly , with the aim of reconciling potential or actual conflicts in the event of the development of multiple uses and of providing for the optimum rational development of a common source to the benefit of each State in whose territory any part of the system is situated , it has become necessary to focus on the question of the concept of the drainage basin .  
Ensuring common measurement and assessment standards and methods worldwide is part of the framework of the preparation of FRA 2000 , and some of the parameters to be assessed are directly related to indicators of sustainable forest management at the national level identified in the four main international processes .  
If sustainable forest management as conceptualized at the international level is to be widely implemented at the national level on a lasting basis , international solidarity in the sharing of technologies , know-how and information and in making resources available to meet common needs must receive increased attention .  
This initiative , supported by the Government of Jordan , is designed to create a community of potential future leaders who have shared a common training experience in global issues .  
Moreover , since there were wide variations in the actual vacancy rates in different duty stations , and the standard cost of each post differed in terms of post adjustment and the percentage attributable to common staff costs , the Board considered that the adoption of a uniform vacancy rate for formulation of budgetary proposals for staff costs was likely to give rise to significant inaccuracies ( A / 51 / 5 ( Vol . I ) , sect .  
Alternative intellectual property rights regimes suitable for the needs of local communities that collectively possess TFRK have been proposed , taking into account the way in which traditional knowledge is acquired as the common property of a people and hence constitutes an integral and inalienable feature of its culture .  
Holders of TFRK will need to feel secure in their land tenure arrangements ; reassured that they have been accorded status equal to that of the other members of the partnerships ; convinced of a common purpose compatible with their cultural and ecological values .  
If two adjoining countries do not agree on a set of common rules on how goods passing through each other 's territory will be treated , then national law will prevail in each case , and a motor vehicle , for example , might be subject to multiple unnecessary inspections , might require different insurance coverage , might be subject to special license requirements , etc .  
We agree to support ongoing and new creative partnerships , recognizing that indigenous people , youth and other disadvantaged and vulnerable groups possess in common the potential for diverse realization of full human development .  
The pool of non-retirees , particularly for specific language combinations and / or functions , is limited for two reasons : first , the Organization must ensure that the freelancers it recruits meet the same high standards required of established language staff ; and , second , the United Nations must compete on the freelance market with other organizations both within and outside the common system who in some cases can be more stable or financially advantageous sources of employment .  
No one fully knows how deep and friendly are the relations that link the Egyptian people with the Sudanese people : their ties are as old as the Nile , are enhanced by geographical proximity , neighbourly relations , a common language , the similarity of their social customs and the human relations between the two peoples in the Nile valley since time immemorial .  
Regarding the proposed United Nations humanitarian programme for Somalia , the United Nations agencies at the country level have embarked on an inter-agency analytical and consultative process with a view to defining and reaching consensus on the role of the United Nations in the country over the medium-term , reflecting a common system-wide vision and outlining a set of broad objectives and strategies .  
The objective should be , therefore , to develop a common methodology that could be used by the affected States in preparing the explanatory material for their requests for assistance , as well as by the United Nations system , the international financial institutions and the donor community in considering how their assistance activities may be helpful to mitigate the special economic problems of those States .  
Urges the funds and programmes of the United Nations system to finalize work on the harmonization of their budget presentations in time for a final decision to be made by their respective executive boards in advance of the biennium 1998-1999 , and to include in this work a common presentational framework for the budget based on agreed definitions and usage of budget terms and the identification of additional steps required for further harmonization and improved transparency ;  
Reaffirms the need to raise the target for common premises on a case-by-case basis , taking into account cost-benefit analysis and operational sustainability , using lessons learned during the implementation of this request and avoiding an increased burden on host countries ; requests the funds and programmes of the United Nations system to develop a plan of action , administrative arrangements and a time-frame for the implementation of this request ; and encourages the United Nations specialized agencies and regional offices to share those common premises where practicable ;  
The programme on education for peace , human rights , democracy and international understanding provided a meaningful contribution to the struggle against terrorism inasmuch as it promoted thinking and behaviour based on common humanistic and cultural values .

The High Commissioner 's participation in the sixth extraordinary session of the Islamic Conference on Bosnia and Herzegovina and her subsequent visit to OIC headquarters at Jeddah constituted a step forward in the two organizations ' common search for humanitarian solutions to the increasingly complex refugee situation in the OIC member States . 
The majority of the Expert Group concluded that while changes in the direction of harmonization with the 1993 SNA and BPM5 may be introduced , radical and rapid change is not possible because of expected continued reliance on customs-based documents that record the movement of goods across borders as the most common source of data .  Such harmonization should , however , be treated as a longer-term objective .  
Danish development policy is an integral part of Danish foreign policy , in which the main objectives are , inter alia : promotion of common security , promotion of democratic government and human rights , creation of economic and social development and ensuring ecologically sustainable development .  
The Council , in its resolution 1995 / 11 of 24 July 1995 , requested the Secretary-General to seek cooperation and to join efforts with other international , global and regional organizations and mechanisms that have played an active role in combating money laundering in order to reinforce common regulatory and enforcement strategies in that area .  
In order to facilitate the proper initial functioning of the common institutions , my Office , in collaboration with a number of international organizations , is preparing a quick start package comprising the minimal legislative basis for the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina to operate .  
The political leadership now has the opportunity to ensure that , in particular through the functioning of common institutions at the national level , all three communities can work towards the consolidation of a sovereign and united Bosnia and Herzegovina based on the rule of law , respect for the human rights of all peoples and the development of a representative democracy .  
The goal of the Peace Agreement has been commonly understood by the international community as being to restore peace and stability to Bosnia and Herzegovina as a sovereign , unified country composed of two entities with unprecedented autonomy , united through common governing institutions resulting from free and fair elections .  
The information received recently by the Special Rapporteur hardly suggests any improvement in the treatment of detainees in prisons and detention centres , which he described in earlier reports .  11 / Those reports give an account of the overcrowding , terrible sanitary conditions , inadequate and substandard food , limited medical care , beatings , restrictions on family visits , the problems of having common criminals share living quarters with political prisoners , and the jailing of many political prisoners far from their home towns , which makes contact with their families extremely difficult .  
In that connection , based on the updated deployment table contained in annex V , the inclusion of 8 additional international staff and 25 local staff for six months , the application of the Zagreb salary scales for local staff as at 1 July 1996 and the inclusion under common staff costs of provision for contributions to the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund for local staff , the net reduction to civilian staff costs is only $ 642,000 .  
The Government of Mauritius stated that the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities were guaranteed through a combination of constitutional provisions , which were fully compatible with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , statutory legislation and common law .  
It was emphasized that the establishment and maintenance of unimpeded contacts among persons belonging to a national minority , as well as contacts across frontiers by persons belonging to a national minority with persons with whom they share a common ethnic or national origin , cultural heritage or religious belief , contributes to mutual understanding and promotes good neighbourly relations .  
Recalling that the purposes of the United Nations are , inter alia , to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , and to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends ,  
Since many questions and misunderstandings surround the definitions and content of the terminologies of sects , new religious movements and even formal religion and since in international practice confusion reigns and States may have diametrically opposed attitudes to the same group , raising it to formal religious status or pejoratively classifying it as a sect , the Special Rapporteur feels that an international high-level governmental conference should be held to study and decide upon a common approach to sects and religions that respects human rights . 
Recalling that the purposes of the United Nations are , inter alia , to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , and to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends ,  
It is important that an effective mechanism be established , so that international actors and the authorities can discuss issues of common concern on a regular basis , share information on current activities and take joint decisions , especially on how best to meet the needs of vulnerable groups .  
Our ultimate objective in pursuing these reforms is to bring about a democratic , representative , dynamic and revitalized Security Council which will be more relevant to the common problems we all face .  
Recalling also that , in view of the different contributions to global environmental degradation , States have common but differentiated responsibilities , and standards applied by some countries may be inappropriate or of unwarranted economic and social cost to other countries ,  
Calls upon the international community to apply , where necessary , the principle of common but differentiated responsibility in ongoing international cooperation on the protection of the environment and in efforts to implement existing instruments of international environmental law and the elaboration of new instruments , and to continue to take fully into account specific circumstances and requirements , in particular , those of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , thus facilitating their compliance with their obligations under international agreements ;  
We hope that the effective cooperation between the two organizations in the field of the gradual development and codification of international law and in other areas of common concern can be further enhanced so that a positive contribution can be made to the promotion of friendly cooperation among countries , the maintenance of world peace and security , common prosperity for all societies , and the achievement of a just and sound new international order based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence and the spirit of the Bandung Conference .  
While the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s ( UN-NADAF ) , which was adopted by the General Assembly by resolution 46 / 151 of 18 December 1991 , represented a global compact between African countries on the one hand and the international community on the other , the conclusions and recommendations of the Ad Hoc Committee submitted for adoption at this session constitute a set of common and complementary objectives and targets to be implemented in an integrated manner and in a spirit of full partnership .  
Also recognizing the critical problems common to human settlements in the developing countries , including poverty , unemployment , social disintegration , inadequate shelter and lack of proper maintenance of urban and infrastructure and services ,  
Recalling that the purposes of the United Nations are , inter alia , to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends ,  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue cooperation in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation ;  
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
It supported proposals which allowed the Secretariat to have a greater capacity to conduct feasibility studies of options for the consideration of the Security Council ; translate mandates into achievable concepts of operations ; provide timely advice and support to the field and meaningful feedback to the Security Council ; and develop doctrines and operational concepts , standing operational procedures and related common terminology for United Nations peacekeeping operations .  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,

Recommendations and decisions of ICSC or resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly concerning the conditions of service of common system staff were not automatically binding , for the following reasons : the organizations were in different financial and budgetary situations ; staff recruitment and retention difficulties varied ; and each common system organization was an independent and sovereign intergovernmental organization and should have the final word regarding the conditions of service of its staff .  
In order to implement Agenda 21 in a satisfactory manner , it was imperative to create conditions for environmental protection and sustainable development at both the national and international levels and ensure compliance with common but differentiated responsibilities .  
Calls upon the Government of Myanmar and other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully the obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , [ 117 ] to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population and to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law , and to avail itself of such services as may be offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;

It had emphasized that the special needs and concerns of participating organizations should be addressed within the framework of the common system , and had stressed the importance of maintaining a coherent and unified system . 
Europe possesses what is essential for achieving this - a space with a single world-view extending from Vancouver to Vladivostok , where the bipolar world no longer exists and a common value system based on the philosophy of democratic liberalism and respect for human rights is being established . 
This Declaration reflected the central goals of a common , comprehensive , indivisible security zone free from demarcation lines ; security ; cooperation between the OSCE and other international organizations to achieve these goals ; recognition that no single organization , State or group can bear the predominant responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and stability in the OSCE region ; and recognition of the importance of States complying with their obligations regarding national minorities .  
Our common goal is to ensure that , while keeping and promoting this positive trend , we are vigilant and active in order to contribute together to the maintenance of peace , the establishment and consolidation of democratic societies based on the rule of law and respect for human and minority rights , social development and the promotion of international cooperation .  
Underlines the responsibility of the parties to fully , and in good faith , cooperate in the prompt formation and functioning of all the new common institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and in establishing the necessary conditions for holding free and fair democratic local elections in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Peace Agreement ;  
Regional cooperation should be encouraged through the development of a common strategic framework for the exploitation of opportunities involving space technologies to meet regional needs , including the networking of existing and planned national and regional centres of excellence .  
CARICOM countries had assumed primary responsibility , while fully conscious that the ultimate success of their efforts could only be guaranteed within a framework of international cooperation and partnership based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibility .

Invites the executive heads of the organizations of the common system to develop and submit proposals , as a matter of priority , to their relevant intergovernmental bodies on the possibility of introducing performance awards or bonuses to a limited number of staff in recognition of their outstanding performance and specific achievements in a given year , and to coordinate , to the extent possible , these proposals with those developed by the Secretary-General ;  
Requests the Commission to take the lead in analysing new approaches in the human resources management field so as to develop standards , methods and arrangements that will respond to the specific needs , especially regarding future staffing , of the organizations of the common system including , inter alia , consideration of flexible contractual arrangements , performance-based pay and the introduction of special occupational pay rates , and to report to the General Assembly thereon at its fifty-third session .  Replace the tables in paragraph ( b ) ( i ) by the following :

While today 's major challenges are undeniably global in character , it is at the local level where their impact is felt most directly , which is why local authorities , such as mayors and metropolitan officials , have become notably more active on global issues and , in some cases , collectively organized across countries on matters of common concern .  
The Committee will continue , especially during the transitional period and until a fair , satisfactory solution is achieved , to strive to achieve maximum effectiveness in the implementation of its mandate and to adjust its work programme in the light of developments in order to continue to contribute , to the extent possible , to the realization of the common United Nations objective of achieving a just and lasting solution to the question of Palestine .  
The paradigm of sustainable development , based on economic growth that is sustained , socially equitable and ecologically viable , constitutes the common denominator on which the international community now agrees in order to give new direction to the collective search for the economic and social well-being of our peoples .  
The agreement expands cooperation to new fields , such as preventive diplomacy , the maintenance and consolidation of peace and , pursuant to paragraph 4 of resolution 50 / 3 , all subjects of common interest in the political , economic , social , scientific and cultural fields .  
Many times during the biennial conferences held since 1986 the Heads of State and Government of countries that use French as a common language one country out of four in the world have recognized the role of multilateralism in the new international context and confirmed their will to help find a solution to global political and economic problems .  
It describes the endeavours of the United Nations system in implementing General Assembly resolution 51 / 18 of 14 November 1996 , which requested the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue cooperation in their common search for solutions to global problems relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation , as well as to continue to expand the parameters of this cooperation in response to the growing needs of our common member States .  
However , be they federal or unitary , presidential or parliamentary , they all embody a set of essential common values , inter alia , the freedom of citizens to express themselves through free and transparent elections , and the active development and strengthening of civil society .  
All countries should increase their mutually beneficial cooperation in the economic field , eliminate unequal practices in trade and economic relations , and do away with discriminatory policies with a view to gradually narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor and achieving common prosperity .  
I am certain that the First Committee can make a significant contribution towards the attainment of our common objective : a world free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and a greatly reduced level of conventional weapons .  
The conditions that prevailed prior to the establishment of the zones included , inter alia , peaceful relations and mutual confidence , economic cooperation and a general belief in the enhancement of common interests through institutional regional frameworks .  
Let the message go back to the various capitals , to non-governmental organizations and to all stakeholders that the achievement of sustainable development requires nothing less than action that integrates economic , environmental and social components into decision-making and programmes , and the resurgence of a true global partnership based on common but differentiated responsibilities .  
The process for elaborating a common vision , as outlined in document E / CN . 16 / 1997 / CRP . 2 , should be anchored in effective international cooperation , with a recognized role and responsibility for the United Nations system ; should bridge conceptual and practical issues ; and should combine both global and regional dimensions .  
A useful model for developing improved partnerships with non-governmental organizations is the PARinAC initiative of UNHCR , which emphasizes the formulation of common principles and goals and the creation of an umbrella framework for action and extensive consultative processes involving non-governmental organizations at the country , regional and international levels .  
Whereas the Constitution in force since 1986 sets forth the responsibility of the State , as the expression of the legal and political organization of society , for promoting the common good and the consolidation of the rule of legality , security , justice , equality , freedom and peace , and defines as a central concern the promotion of the full enjoyment of human rights within a stable , permanent and popular institutional order in which governed and government act with absolute adherence to the law ,  
Also in relation to the clause mentioned in paragraph 20 , the National Reconciliation Act shall extinguish criminal liability for related common crimes committed in the armed conflict , such crimes being defined as those which are directly , objectively , intentionally and causally related to the commission of the political crimes referred to in the preceding paragraph and which can not be shown to be motivated by personal goals .  
In respect of persons who were involved in the internal armed conflict owing to institutional mandates , the National Reconciliation Act shall contain specific provisions equivalent to those previously mentioned , in that they shall extinguish criminal liability for common crimes perpetrated with the aim of preventing , thwarting , suppressing or punishing the commission of political crimes and related common crimes , where such crimes were directly , objectively , intentionally and causally related to that aim , unless it is demonstrated that there is no relationship between the criminal act and the stated aim .  
None of the parties to the conflict has fulfilled the obligations arising from article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions , and serious violations of its provisions have occurred , including attempts on life and physical integrity , homicide , torture , taking of hostages , outrages upon personal dignity and arbitrary arrests , including arrests of wounded and sick people , without the justification of military necessity .  
Improving these pragmatic arrangements appears to be less costly and more effective for the time being than undertaking a radical reform of common services , unless convincing proof is offered to the contrary .  
Also recognizing the critical problems common to human settlements in the developing countries , including poverty , unemployment , social disintegration , inadequate shelter and lack of proper maintenance of urban and rural infrastructure and services ,  
This acknowledgement is given concrete meaning through the incorporation of the legal principle of common but differentiated responsibility in paragraph 4 of article 20 , which makes the obligations and commitments of developing countries contingent upon the effective implementation by developed country Parties of their commitments under the Convention related to financial resources and transfer of technology .  This overriding priority is apparent in every aspect of the development and implementation of the Convention 's principles .  
Underlines the responsibility of the parties to cooperate fully and in good faith in the prompt formation and functioning of all the new common institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and in establishing the necessary conditions for holding democratic , free and fair democratic local elections in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Peace Agreement ;  
This should include appropriate delegation of authority , enhancement of the capacity of the staff through training and the provision of a stable resource base to ensure the continuous presence of an institutional critical mass .  A first step in that direction would be for Headquarters to provide urgent assistance by assigning to Nairobi for one month a senior administrator with proven experience in the establishment and functioning of United Nations common services outputs ( SP-96-001-19 ) .  
This Government is necessary not just because it will symbolize the participation of all political parties represented in the Parliament , but because it establishes an important starting point for efforts to strengthen still fragile balances and constitutes a special forum for joint action that can help the taking of decisions devoted to the common management of national affairs .  
The new UNDP structure will reflect an effort to recognize three distinct components or functions : headquarters , being those units whose functions concentrate on organizational policy , global advocacy , management oversight and quality control and global resource mobilization ; operating units , comprising the country offices and the regional bureaux ; and common administrative and financial services .  
Calls upon the Government of Myanmar and other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully the obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , [ 8 ] to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law and to avail itself of such services as may be offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
Holders of TFRK will need to be represented by their own representatives ; to feel secure in their land tenure arrangements ; to be reassured that they have been accorded status equal to that of the other members of the agreements ; and to be convinced of a common purpose compatible with their cultural and ecological values .  
Among the questions emerging on multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) , he referred to the range of policy instruments for achieving their objectives , their economic and developmental effects and the participation of developing countries in MEAs , taking into account the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities .  
Calls upon all parties to the hostilities to respect fully the applicable provisions of international humanitarian law including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , to halt the use of weapons , including landmines , against the civilian population and to protect all civilians , especially women , members of minorities and children , from violations of human rights and humanitarian law , including forcible displacement , arbitrary detention , ill _ treatment , torture and summary executions ;  
As a result of this initiative by Ethiopia , leaders of 26 Somali political organizations were able to meet for a high-level consultation in Sodere , Ethiopia , and after eight weeks of intensive , frank and responsible negotiations , agreed on a common course of action to resolve the crisis in their country and to put an end to the misery and suffering of their people .  
Several resident coordinators believe that a more effective collaboration in country operations should be encouraged both by Bretton Woods institutions and the United Nations system organizations at headquarters level , while another group of resident coordinators suggests that the Bretton Woods institutions be associated in the joint programming consultation of the United Nations system , through common participation in periodic meetings on programming and coordination , and regular consultation on planning and strategy issues .  
The entities within the United Nations system have an important role to play in developing a reference framework for the energy-related activities of the United Nations system based on a common understanding of a sustainable energy future , and thereby providing synergies to the activities . 3 Such a framework would promote a balanced and mutually reinforcing approach to economic , social and environmental aspects of sustainable energy development and foster partnerships for sustainable energy development with relevant actors outside the United Nations system , particularly with non-United Nations intergovernmental organizations dealing with energy and the private sector . 
These agreements constitute a starting point for a hemisphere-wide position on sustainable development - the cornerstone of a cooperative alliance among the States of the Americas in their common search for a better quality of life for their peoples , based on integrated , mutually reinforcing economic , social and environmental objectives .  
The Conference has been recognized as a forum for technical cooperation , technology transfer and programme coordination for the countries of the Americas region , providing government officials , planners , scientists and experts from the Americas and elsewhere with an opportunity to address common needs , problems and experiences in the field of surveying and mapping , cartography , hydrography , remote sensing , and land and geographical information systems , including educational and training aspects , scientific and technological requirements , implementation issues and benefits . 
A relatively intense internal armed conflict ( where it is assumed that the intensity of hostilities and the level of organization of the combatants is below that required by the above Protocol ) , in which case the provisions set forth in article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions apply .  
Given the complementary and non _ exclusive nature of the protective norms of international law , it is extremely important to consider the positive linkage that exists with international humanitarian law and , in particular , at what point article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions , which also establishes fundamental guarantees during internal armed conflicts , enters into force .  
The Special Rapporteur has drawn the attention of the Commission and the Sub-Commission to the incompatibility with international law and with the concurrent criteria established by it of some legislations _ generally inspired by common law and based on national security _ that authorize the adoption of exceptional measures ( such as prolonged administrative detentions , severe restrictions of freedom of expression , freedom of assembly and freedom to demonstrate , and which lay down severe penalties for any breach of them ) without the need to proclaim a state of emergency .  
In such cases , it is also common for the majority of the members of the judiciary to be removed from office and for the ordinary courts to be replaced by military courts to try people for alleged political offences , culminating in a Supreme Court of Justice that legalizes institutional acts or their equivalent , or confers a supra _ constitutional status on emergency rules adopted by the regime .  
An appeal by the special session to the Governments of the Russian Federation and the United States of America to consider the rational employment of their missile and nuclear potential as a contribution of these two countries to common efforts to ensure sustainable development and preservation of the natural environment of this earth ; to start - should the response of the two Governments be positive - developing relevant international programmes and projects ensuring respect for the regime of non-proliferation of nuclear and missile technologies and for intellectual property rights ;  
Having due regard to all relevant definitions of the practice of forced evictions under international human rights provisions and instruments , the present Guidelines apply to instances of forced evictions in which there are acts and / or omissions involving the coerced and involuntary removal of individuals , groups and communities from their homes and / or lands and common property resources they occupy or are dependent upon , thus eliminating or limiting the possibility of an individual , group or community residing or working in a particular dwelling , residence or place .  
The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung elucidated in an all-round way the questions on the founding of the DCRK , including the problem of forming a supreme national confederal assembly with an equal number of representatives from the north and the south and an appropriate number of representatives of overseas nationals under which a confederal standing committee is organized to discuss and decide on common issues related to the overall interests of the country and nation . 
Many of the overall civilian implementation tasks coordinated by my Office , such as the building of common institutions , supporting economic reconstruction , creating communications and transport links between the entities , and providing a basis for a functioning civil society are fundamental to creating the necessary conditions for the return of displaced persons and refugees .  
Deeply concerned at the continuing unstable and tense security conditions in the Gali region , characterized by acts of violence by armed groups , by armed robbery , and other common crime and , most seriously , by the laying of mines , including new types of mines , and deeply concerned also at the resulting lack of safety and security for the local populations , for the refugees and displaced persons returning to the region and for the personnel of UNOMIG and of the CIS peacekeeping force ,  
Deeply concerned at the continuing unstable and tense security conditions in the Gali region , characterized by acts of violence by armed groups , by armed robbery , and other common crime and , most seriously , by the laying of mines , including new types of mines , and deeply concerned also at the resulting lack of safety and security for the local populations , for the refugees and displaced persons returning to the region and for the personnel of UNOMIG and of the CIS peacekeeping force ,  
At a broad level , technical assistance , complemented by adequate financial support , should be provided to the least developed countries through the common and coordinated efforts of all donors , including international organizations such as WTO , UNCTAD , ITC , UNDP , the World Bank and IMF .  
She emphasized the importance of the work of the Ad Hoc Intergovernmental Panel on Forests , which would lay the foundations for building on the Intergovernmental Panel 's activities in five key areas : provision of clear and comprehensive directions to international organizations and instruments dealing with forests ; setting of common priorities ; regular measuring of collective progress towards sustainable forest management ; creation of an independent high-level political forum to provide governance on forest issues ; and participation of all interested parties .  
The High Contracting Parties , attaching importance to stable development and the effective exploitation of the economic potential of both States , shall cooperate in implementing the ongoing economic reforms on the basis of market relations , promote the intensification of economic integration between the two States , and create conditions for the establishment of a common economic space in accordance with their obligations under bilateral and multilateral treaties and agreements concluded by the High Contracting Parties within the framework of the Commonwealth of Independent States .  
The Member State also noted that the Secretary-Generals report categorized violence into economic exploitation , social / psychological violence , physical / sexual violence and violence resulting from operation of the legal system and pointed out that non-payment or delay in the payment of wages and / or violation of wages agreed to under contract had been highlighted as a common type of economic exploitation in receiving countries . 
Progress has been made in incorporating the principles contained in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development - including the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities , which embodies the important concept of and basis for international partnership ; the precautionary principle ; the polluter pays principle ; and the environmental impact assessment principle - in a variety of international and national legal instruments .  
While it is the primary responsibility of national Governments to achieve the economic , social and environmental objectives of Agenda 21 , it is essential that international cooperation be reactivated and intensified , recognizing , inter alia , the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities as set forth in Principle 7 of the Rio Declaration .  
Moreover , issues , including environmental issues , that bear on the international economic environment can be approached effectively only through a constructive dialogue and genuine partnership on the basis of mutuality of interests and benefits , taking into account that , in view of the different contributions to global environmental degradation , States have common but differentiated responsibilities . 
The General Assembly also invited the executive heads of the organizations of the common system to develop and submit proposals , to their relevant intergovernmental bodies , as a matter of priority , on the possibility of introducing performance awards or bonuses to a limited number of staff in recognition of their outstanding performance and specific achievements in a given year , and to coordinate , to the extent possible , those proposals with those developed by the Secretary-General .  
VIII . 177 .  The Advisory Committee was informed that the arrangements for common and joint services in Vienna that had been in place since 1979 and were based on a tripartite agreement between IAEA , UNIDO and the United Nations , have changed to the extent that certain programmes have become increasingly difficult to maintain at the previous levels .  
As the economic basis of security , all countries and regions should , on the basis of equality and mutual benefit , promote trade , economic and technological cooperation and scientific and cultural exchanges among themselves , with a view to narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor and achieving common prosperity and development .  
While the formulation of common standards for prudential oversight and management of risk situations and efforts to involve developing countries and countries with transition economies were welcome , States remained responsible for the establishment of a stable and predictable national environment for foreign investment .  
The factors for promoting an international environment conducive to development included the creation and maintenance of peaceful and stable economic conditions , democratization and the establishment of open , common , fair and transparent rules that offered equal opportunities for all .  
It is therefore our common task and responsibility to seize this historic opportunity , provided by the present international environment , to work together for the total elimination of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and for the regulation and control of other conventional tools of killing .  
He indicated that in support of the devolution of responsibility to the most effective managerial level , in some carefully defined areas , consolidation provided considerable cost saving and other administrative benefits and could also result in more effective services , including those provided through the establishment of a common services facility , an area in which work was already proceeding . 
Those organizations had been in general agreement that an accurate and transparent impact assessment , based on a common approach to or understanding of the issues involved , was essential both to design the appropriate domestic policy response and to seek adequate external assistance .  
These were further compounded by growing hunger , sickness , unemployment , illiteracy , the eruption of violence and terrorism , illicit drug and arms trafficking , environmental degradation , and continued violations of human rights which gravely imperil our common future .  
Throughout the session , intensive consultations , both formal and informal , were held under the authority of the successive Presidents with a view to clarifying positions and developing a minimum common ground which would allow the Conference to discharge its mandate as the sole multilateral negotiating forum of the international community in the field of disarmament .  
These national services , working collaboratively in real time , provide the unique operational capabilities of the World Weather Watch of the World Meteorological Organisation ( WMO ) , a coordinated international system of national meteorological and hydrological services that is based on the common acceptance of protocols and standard terminology .  
The fact that the texts bearing on procedural matters contained fewer alternatives and brackets indicated that decisions were easier where political considerations were not so prominent , but also that the harmonization of elements of civil law and common law systems was not insuperable when there was a genuine will to go forward .  
Success in the thematic area of environment and development will be measured by : ( a ) the relevance of the new knowledge and methods produced for policy decision ; ( b ) the actual participation of pertinent decision makers in considering the proposed alternatives ; and ( c ) the extent of involvement of interested parties in consensus-building for policy decisions and of partnerships forged , joint initiatives funded and programmes launched relating to the management of common natural resources .  
Expected results in the thematic area of gender include : ( a ) four regional networks established and a common agenda developed ; ( b ) a programme implemented on violence against women , including the promotion of inter-agency activities , the creation of a directory of organizations and resources available , the production of messages and the promotion of national debates and support to organizations ; and ( c ) tools developed to monitor gender-mainstreaming , directories established best practices documented , and national surveys conducted on issues related to gender themes .  
Success in the thematic area of gender will be measured by : ( a ) the extent to which a viable , common regional agenda is established in the area of leadership and women ; ( b ) the extent to which public awareness about violence against women is raised in specific target groups on violence ; ( c ) the extent to which mainstreaming tools are utilized by target groups and disseminated in the region .  
All RCF programmes for Asia and the Pacific are based on one or more of the following regional criteria : sharing and / or pooling resources ( including intellectual and natural resources ) ; addressing trans-boundary issues ; addressing a common need or common problem ; and developing or promoting agreed upon regional regimes , norms or policies .  
But it goes beyond a mere series of defined activities , combining political , economic , legal , social and environmental measures within a common framework .  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,

In most cases , however , the growth processes remain fragile and the outlook is surrounded by considerable uncertainty . 4 While high inflation rates have been largely reduced to more manageable levels , prices still do not guide economic activity to the degree common in most market economies , as enterprise governance and institutional frameworks for business decision-making are still in transition . 
While it is relatively common that States envisage in their legislation universal jurisdiction in respect of certain gross violations of human rights , even if such jurisdiction is not expressly required by relevant international instruments , it should be noted that in respect of the rules of international humanitarian law the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and Additional Protocol I of 1977 provide for universal jurisdiction over grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and the Protocol .

The destiny of mankind , however contradictory and diverse , and the interests of nations and States may become more amenable to one common denominator , are increasingly concerned with the well-being of humanity , and display numerous convergent features which make it possible now to discuss the opportunity for a new international order .  
We must therefore urgently find an effective response to this threat by defining a common objective based on a united stand and coherent action , by establishing or strengthening cooperation for exchanging experience and knowledge , by increasing our exchange of information and , above all , by actively promoting and supporting cooperation with international or regional forums so as to provide institutional technical assistance and logistical support .  
These reform proposals as a whole represent a timely and welcome initiative , given the fact that in today 's world the need has progressively increased for global common action on a number of pressing problems , such as the eradication of poverty , humanitarian emergencies , refugee problems , climate change and desertification , diminishing official development assistance funding , drugs , nuclear disarmament , the implementation of Agenda 21 , democracy and the maintenance of peace and security in various regions of the world .

There is a common thread running through the preceding statements that makes unequivocally clear one of the characteristics of the recent armed conflicts that have led to political or military action by this Organization : the fact that their first and principal target has been the civilian population , in particular its most vulnerable sectors children , women , the elderly , the sick , refugees and internally displaced persons .  
The success of these programmes would not have been possible without the respect for international humanitarian law and the direct and indirect cooperation of the parties to the conflict , which in practice shared common areas of mutual respect , to the benefit of the civilian population and the national and international non-governmental humanitarian assistance organizations , particularly the International Committee of the Red Cross .  
It had been observed , for example , that Governments should have been more involved from the very beginning of the process , including in the preparation of the common country assessments ; that a way must be found to involve civil society and non-governmental organizations ; and that UNDAF should be introduced gradually , so that experience could be absorbed as the process unfolded , and the lessons learned could be applied to the planning of future activities .

Mention should be made of the social problems existing in EPZs : local landlords take advantage of the accommodation shortage to charge enormous rents for sub _ standard accommodation ; transport services and social infrastructure ( especially child _ care facilities ) are often non-existent ; friction between the EPZ workers and local residents is common and real integration of workers in local communities is difficult to achieve , in particular because of the high turnover in many Zones .  
By making its withdrawal from the rest of the occupied Ethiopian territory conditional on demilitarization along the common border and on mutual redeployment , Eritrea is simply confirming that its declared acceptance of the Framework Agreement is bogus and , as Ethiopia has already insisted , is tactical and designed to buy time .  
We believe that the establishment of a reliable system for European security and stability is possible only on a common European basis with unswerving observance of international law and by making use of the potential of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) as the most representative and universal common European organization capable of dealing with all the challenges of the twenty-first century - political , economic , military and humanitarian ones .  
As an initial matter , we note that such a limitation is arbitrary in two senses : it ignores the principle that criminal culpability should be linked with the degree of personal responsibility of an individual and not partisan political factors - that justice is blind ; and it imparts to the notion of " leaders " a meaning that is at odds with the common understanding of the term .  
Mr . Nesho ( Albania ) : The moment that we are going through is a historic moment for the future of the Balkans , as the international community is intervening in order to stop the humanitarian catastrophe and the tragedy of a nation whose people have been tortured , killed and buried in common graves , a nation that is justly demanding its legitimate rights to freedom and to its very existence undeniable rights for all peoples .  
It works for international understanding , for improved social and economic conditions and for basic human rights for all people ; and acts in cooperation with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations in matters of common concern .  
The view was expressed that any legal principles of a possible future legal regime of the geostationary orbit , which was a part of outer space , should be consistent with the principles and rules of the Outer Space Treaty , which was the common legal framework for all activities in outer space and that , therefore , the future legal regime of the geostationary orbit should not be described in advance as a sui generis regime , since that status would depend on the rules and principles agreed upon .  
The European Union has supranational competition rules ( relating to RBPs , to public undertakings and undertakings granted special or exclusive rights , and to subsidies ) , which are linked by the Treaty of Rome to the fundamental objective of establishing a common market .  
The Set also provides for work aimed at achieving common approaches in national policies relating to RBPs compatible with the Set ( article F . 1 ) , and continued work on the elaboration of a model law or laws on RBPs in order to assist developing countries in devising appropriate legislation ( article F . 2 ) ; the OECD instruments do not have such provisions , but the 1998 OECD recommendation recommends convergence in ( as well as effective enforcement of ) laws prohibiting hardcore cartels .  
It takes place primarily between developed countries in the application of bilateral enforcement agreements , mutual legal assistance treates ( limited to criminal action aginst cartels ) , free trade , customs union or common market agreements , and the relevant OECD instruments . 
In some common law jurisdictions , arbitrators may enjoy a high level of immunity more akin to a judge , while in others a distinction is drawn between those acts of an arbitrator which are adjudicatory , and thus entitled to this high standard of immunity , and those acts which are unrelated to any adjudicatory function and thus subject to civil liability .  
In addition , sample surveys and qualitative studies , such as the rapid assessment approach , are common sources for data on a large number of economic , social and demographic issues ; but they are not always large enough to provide reliable estimates on indicators for smaller population groups , such as indigenous populations , or on characteristics such as disability that affect a very small proportion of the population ;  
The core programmatic actions which will be supported include youth education and mobilization , voluntary counselling and testing , interventions to prevent mother-to-child transmission , strengthened action to prevent and treat sexually transmitted diseases , distribution of condoms , improved community standards of care , treatment of common opportunistic infections , and special services for families with orphans .  
The Law on Social Care and Provision of Social Security of Serbia defines the family in the following manner : for the purposes of exercising the right to material support the family is understood to mean the spouses or two people of different sexes , children ( born in and out of wedlock , adopted or foster ) and kinsmen in the direct line and in the lateral line up to the second degree of kinship , provided they live in a common household .  
And all other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully their obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law and to avail themselves of services offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
In the case of TCDC programmes initiated or coordinated by the Special Unit or by other bodies of the United Nations system , the involvement of multiple players in single TCDC interventions , which has now become common practice , would seem to indicate that the system is successfully adopting the mandate set out in the new directions strategy - i.e . , that TCDC activities should be designed to have the maximum impact on a large number of developing countries .  
Additionally , the lack of effective and cohesive institutional leadership of the United Nations Office at Geneva ( UNOG ) common services has weakened its central role in Geneva and deprived it of visibility and identity , leading to its current performance problems .  
And all other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully their obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law and to avail themselves of services offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;

During the biennium 20002001 , the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs will focus on further promoting and coordinating the development of a common principled policy on humanitarian issues and on improving the management and practice of operational and strategic coordination through the development of practical tools for field and headquarters coordination , based on lessons learned and accountability reviews .  
The need for greater understanding of the genesis of conflicts was stressed , and while it was recognized that unique circumstances might differentiate conflicts , certain causes dearth of visionary leadership ; absence of good governance , especially transparency and accountability ; neglect of human rights ; pervasive poverty ; inequitable distribution of wealth and resources ; and social and cultural exclusion which breeds ethnic clashes are common to all .  
In this regard , it is instructive to note that the international organizations and public or private sector entities that have studied electronic commerce from a variety of perspectives have tended to focus on certain common elements that would be present in any favourable legal environment .  
Moreover , although related costs for international salaries and common staff costs were calculated on the basis of 50 per cent of staff on appointments of limited duration , mission appointees ranged from 75 to 80 per cent of the total , contributing to additional savings under civilian personnel costs .

In examining the wide range of issues under this theme , ACC will seek to reach a shared definition of the main challenges ahead for the United Nations system , the key common objectives around which Member States should be engaged on a priority basis , and the new or strengthened partnerships that the system needs to respond to those challenges .  
In Nairobi , the Special Rapporteur was encouraged by his meeting with Sudanese women of various ethnic , religious and political backgrounds who , within their respective organizations and through the implementation of different projects involving and empowering women at the grass-roots level , are making their own valuable contribution towards the common goal of peace-making and building in the Sudan .  
In addition , a wealth of knowledge can be tapped through a participatory process and strategic partnerships forged at the common country assessment stage , not only among the United Nations system partners , including the Bretton Woods institutions , but foremost with relevant government entities , civil society , including NGOs , and the private sector , as well as other multilateral and bilateral development partners .  
In particular , the introduction and implementation of common country assessments and UNDAFs , by providing a framework for a consistent and coordinated interaction among national priorities and international objectives as identified by global conferences and possible United Nations system response , is expected to contribute to more integrated United Nations system support for conference follow-up and to redefine and enhance the work of thematic groups accordingly .  
The Council may also wish to recommend that the executive boards of the funds and programmes consider the subject of further progress to achieving common premises and shared services , possibly at upcoming joint session of the boards , and consider a practical joint programme of action , including appropriate cost-sharing and adequate financing .  
A common theme in each report is the need for a comprehensive approach , elaborated jointly with national authorities , other United Nations agencies , the Bretton Woods institutions and major donors , and linking the political , humanitarian , human rights and development concerns .  
An increased dialogue among the governing bodies is in response to the need for high-level discussions on policies at the national and global levels , development cooperation , and commitment to issues of common concern such as poverty , financial stability and economic and social sustainability .

Important progress has been made during the last year by the United Nations system at the country level , especially through a greater and more effective use of thematic groups as instruments to support national efforts for the coordinated follow-up to major global conferences in accordance with General Assembly resolution 53 / 192 , and through the use of such frameworks as the common country assessment and UNDAF .

The inspection covered two aspects : first on the basis of the reasoning that sound central services provide a logical staging ground for common services , the inspection examined how the central support services in areas included in the Secretary-Generals plan to strengthen common services had improved or otherwise effected changes in the work approaches that would enhance cost-effectiveness , quality of services delivered and timeliness .  
The Inter-Agency Procurement Services Office is currently analysing the data to identify pilot or other opportunities for common arrangements to be carried out under memoranda of understanding among participating agencies ; identifying existing umbrella-type or joint contracting agreements that may be further utilized and developed under such memoranda ; and proposing for signature a standard inter-agency memorandum of understanding that provides the basis for common procurement arrangements .

The Cairo Programme of Action , which was the outcome of a delicate compromise made in the face of diverse and even diverging cultural , religious and philosophical values , is the expression of our common will to go beyond diversity and seek together relevant responses to the challenges of sustainable development from the perspective of population , which is certainly the most powerful factor determining the economic and social progress of nations . 
However , I am of the firm belief that with our strong conviction and commitment , coupled with the wide and constructive participation of all relevant actors and with the support of the international community , we will be able to achieve our common objectives , as set out in the ICPD recommendations .

The policies and laws of economic , commercial and financial blockade and embargo of the United States of America imposed on the Republic of Cuba in the last decades violate the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law , and run counter to the common trends of our world today , namely cooperation for development on the basis of equality amongst sovereign States and non-discrimination of political systems .  
This demonstrates not only the unanimous agreement of the international community on the urgency for the abolition of these obsolete policies , which have been imposed on the Cuban people for so long , but also the common desire for the development of healthy international political relations , the strengthening of international cooperation for the development of all nations , an irreversible trend of the twenty-first century .

The stated purpose of the report prepared by the Joint Inspection Unit on common services of the United Nations system at Geneva was to provide a coherent framework for the creation and strengthening of a unified , comprehensive and centralized common services entity among United Nations organizations located at Geneva in order to enable them to rationalize their overhead structures and costs and to concentrate diminishing resources on their constitutional mandates .  
The issue becomes even more complicated when common procurement , personnel and budgetary services covering all organizations and specialized agencies at Geneva are considered , since those entities have , inter alia , different mandates , funding sources and modalities , varying budgetary and financial rules , and divergent personnel policies and procedures .  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development and of the need for comprehensive , coherent and effective policies on international migration based on the spirit of genuine partnership and common understanding ,

As a representative had once said , the work of the Committee was the hardest of all , because it did not consist in merely discussing practical issues , reconciling interests or solving technical problems , but rather in something as basic as deciding what exactly was a society for all and achieving consensus among the different viewpoints of States on a single definition , based on a common concept of humanity . 
At its sixth session , the Ad Hoc Committee decided to devote the informal consultations to be held from Tuesday , 18 January , to Friday , 21 January 2000 , to the consideration of the additional international legal instrument against trafficking in persons , especially women and children , and the common provisions of that instrument with the additional international legal instrument against illegal trafficking in and transporting of migrants .

For areas considered non-core ( i.e . , not essential for regulation at the central common system level ) , guidelines set by ICSC could be desirable .  
During the biennium 20002001 , the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs will focus on further promoting and coordinating the development of a common principled policy on humanitarian issues and on improving the management and practice of operational and strategic coordination through the development of practical tools for field and headquarters coordination , based on lessons learned and accountability reviews .  
The Republic of China a democratic country concerned with safeguarding and promoting human rights , a world economic Power recognized by nations , and , last but not least , a nation that maintains trade relations through commercial delegations shares with deep conviction our common faith in the noble ideals of peace , solidarity and cooperation enshrined in the Charter .  
However , along with these common interests , the following point must be made clear : A democratic country like Israel can not accept a precondition to beginning the talks that requires a prior acceptance of the final outcome as dictated by the extreme and dogged formulas of the opposing side .  
There must , therefore , be a constructive dialogue between developing and developed countries , a dialogue based on common interests , genuine interrelations and mutual responsibilities aimed at ensuring sustainable development and social justice .  
By actively participating in the preparatory process for the special session on the implementation of the outcome of the Summit , my Government would like to contribute to achieving our common goals in fighting poverty , creating productive jobs and making a stable , safe and just society for all .

There is no doubt that this report assumes special importance at a time when we are experiencing an increasing need to deepen and enhance cooperation between the two organizations in development , social , economic , military , political , diplomatic and other fields , all of which aim at serving the common interests of the African continent in general , and at upgrading the structure and institutional capacities of the OAU , in particular . 
The Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement held at Durban in September 1998 stressed that the expansion and reform of the Security Council must be an indivisible part of a common and complementary process that takes into account the principles of sovereign equality among States and equitable geographic distribution , as well as the need for transparency , accountability and democracy in the working methods of the Security Council , including decision-making therein .  
The five principles of peaceful coexistence make up the political foundation underpinning world peace ; mutually beneficial cooperation and common prosperity constitute the economic guarantee for world peace ; dialogue , consultations and negotiations between the parties concerned on an equal footing represent the correct approach to resolving disputes and safeguarding peace.In this context , we call on the international community to take this new security concept as a guideline .  
Mr . Ahmed ( India ) stated that the adoption of the treaty by the General Assembly would ensure the exploitation of natural resources of the Moon and other celestial bodies in an orderly and rational manner through the creation of an international regime to ensure that such resources , as the common heritage of mankind , were exploited for the benefit of all mankind .  
Taking place on the threshold of a new millennium , the Congress will serve as an unprecedented global forum to exchange and enhance innovative ideas from various relevant disciplines , demonstrate practical solutions and formulate common strategies to fight emerging crime issues , especially transnational crime .  
And all those conferences aimed to reach that goal through an organized , yet voluntary effort : a collective effort on a global scale ; an effort by sovereign States and civil society working together ; an effort guided by a common approach based on universal values and principles which we all could accept.So Cairo was not just a population conference .  
What we all have in common is the wish and the request of peoples to have a better standard of living than they had in the past , real sustainable development and sustained growth in their countries and for their human rights and freedoms to be fully protected and observed .  
We view that in the present era of diversity and change and of challenge of traditional concepts , the rule calculated to promote the widest possible acceptance of common agreement and expressed in a multilateral instrument may be the one better suited to the immediate needs of the international community which allows for qualified permissibility and maintains progressive development towards the eventual elimination of compelling conditions that rendered reservations on the national level .  
It was recognized that the industrialized countries should take the lead in changing consumption and production patterns , based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities , since consumption and production in developing countries were often driven by the patterns in developed countries .  
In addition , the design and development are lacking of a common strategy for energy-related activities in the system aimed at promoting a balanced and mutually reinforcing approach to the economic , social and environmental aspects of sustainable energy development and of fostering partnership for sustainable energy development with relevant actors outside the United Nations system .  
It reviewed the scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of key interventions for adolescent health , highlighted the essential factors and strategies needed to establish , implement and sustain programmes for adolescent health , developed a common framework for country programming and recommended priority actions to accelerate and strengthen programming for adolescent health , including the global and regional support needed for country-level programming . 
The universal ratification of the six core human rights treaties , including the optional protocols thereto , within the next five years , would not only serve as a decisive step towards a shared international legal commitment to the implementation of all human rights but would also symbolize the international communitys willingness to work in a true spirit of partnership to reach common goals .  
Meet the needs of SNA , the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual ( BPM5 ) , statistics of international merchandise trade and the newly emerging statistics of international trade in services by ( i ) maintaining conceptual consistency between these systems , and ( ii ) providing common aggregates for trade , industry and national accounts to facilitate the production of comparable national and international statistics suitable for economic analysis of trade , industry and national accounts ;  
Although there were average monthly vacancy rates of 4.9 per cent for international staff and 6.9 per cent for local staff ( see annex III to the present report ) , additional requirements under local staff salaries and common staff costs were necessary due to the unforeseen retroactive increase of 12.5 per cent in local staff salaries effective from 1 January 1997 .

School curricula , with the exception of those of monastic schools , make no provision for religious instruction or practice ; however , a prayer common to Buddhism and Hinduism is recited daily in all schools , and prayers are said in boarding schools at the secondary level ; no problems are raised by these prayers.The Bhutanese authorities have stated that : 
With these understandings , the process of substantive talks provided for in the Itamaraty Declaration of Peace of 17 February 1995 has been completed and a comprehensive and lasting end has been put to the differences between the two republics , so that , on the basis of their common roots , the two nations can advance towards a promising future based on cooperation and mutual benefit .  
In what could well prove to be an exemplary effort to meet the challenges of post-conflict reconstruction and resettlement in war-torn areas , international humanitarian and development agencies , and financial institutions have forged partnerships amongst themselves and with the Government with the common aim of assisting the Government in creating possibilities for return as a durable solution .  
Accordingly , it would appear timely to convene a meeting between government officials and representatives of the international community for the purpose of devising a common strategy for addressing not only the present , and very pressing , needs of the internally displaced for continued humanitarian assistance , but also their own expressed desire to become more self-reliant through increased access to opportunities for employment and other means of income-generation .  
The inundation of coastal areas can result in : ( a ) loss of agricultural land , a common concern because agriculture is still the primary source of income in many small island developing States , and most agricultural land lies along the coastline , increasing its vulnerability to sea level rise ; ( b ) loss of exclusive economic zone ( EEZ ) , a common concern because sea level rise will also reduce the exclusive economic zone , thereby reducing the resource base .  
Welcomes the implementation since 1994 by the Paris Club of the Naples terms , as well as the decision to go beyond the Naples terms to provide debt reduction for eligible countries , in particular the poorest and most heavily indebted countries , and invites all other bilateral , multilateral and commercial creditors to make an appropriate and consistent contribution to the common objective of debt sustainability ;  
The key to this success was the fact that ( 1 ) the Summit was organized around a number of very concrete developmental problems which affected major aspects of the development process and ( 2 ) a common interest between UNCTAD and non-governmental actors had been clearly identified in advance .  
It was vital that the international community should reach a greater understanding of the moral implications of genetic engineering and continue its efforts to arrive at a common response , built on consensus , to the ethical problems raised by scientific progress .  
The draft should use as its starting point the preamble common to the two international Covenants of 1966 , as well as other relevant instruments which recognize that the ideal of the free individual , delivered from fear and poverty , can not be achieved without the creation of conditions allowing each person to enjoy all human rights .  
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
The Division will be engaged in formulating guidelines and common understandings within the United Nations system to provide guidance as to the implementation of relevant resolutions of the Assembly and the Council , and will conduct system-wide impact evaluations that will focus on both the analytic normative and evolving operational dimensions of United Nations system activities in the economic and social fields . 
In turn , directing international assistance to support decentralized and locally owned activities on behalf of all affected parties can help in regenerating war-torn communities and in promoting national reconciliation by inducing beneficiaries from different ethnic groups to work together towards a common future .  
The unified international approach was the determining factor for making faster progress at local , national , regional and hemispheric levels because it was helping establish a common institutional framework for focusing efforts and enhancing the distribution and utilization of the human and financial resources involved .  
Increased efforts are needed by the United Nations system , with support from the international community , to develop and agree upon common key indicators on reproductive health programmes , including , inter alia , family planning , maternal health , sexual health , sexually transmitted diseases , HIV AIDS , and information , education and communication for appropriate consideration in the relevant intergovernmental process .  
Therefore , what is proposed is a decentralized technical , administrative and budgetary approach to a globally coordinated collaborative facilities management based on information exchange and common operational practices is therefore proposed .  
Included under this heading are : ( a ) differences between actual average salary and common staff costs compared with the standards included in the revised appropriations ; ( b ) differences between realized vacancy rates compared with those assumed in the revised appropriations ; and ( c ) adjustments to objects of expenditure other than posts based on actual and anticipated requirements to the end of the biennium .  
The estimates are based on the 1999 and 2000 standard salary costs for New York and the local salary scale applicable to the mission area and reflect the application of a projected vacancy rate of 20 per cent for international and local staff , as well as salary and common staff cost adjustments for 70 per cent of international staff classified as mission appointees .  
Finally , the active involvement of the Bretton Woods institutions both in the final event and in the preparatory process was crucial : only through the coordinated efforts of the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions would the common objective of poverty reduction and sustainable development be achieved .  
A crucial component common to most of these principal and supporting functions is that any future international arrangement and mechanism should also make provisions for an open and transparent participatory process that includes all stakeholders .

It was recognized that building an effective reporting system , with an analytical focus on actual results achieved against planned objectives , required a gradual process and presented a common challenge shared by other agencies .  
The historical and , alas , still actual misuse of religions and moral philosophies with a universal intent for purposes of domination and control should not obscure the evidence that the sharing of a common humanity is fundamental to the human race .  
Monitoring is the process of comparing common selected indicators or targets against actual performance , whereas surveillance is not only the organized exchange of information but also the means of encouraging remedial policy action at the national level .

The work of the Committee also addressed technical issues dealing with the content of SDI , including the definition of a common geodetic reference frame , the necessity of integrating cadastral and topographical data bases , the development of metadata and clearinghouse sites , and the employment of international standards ( ISO / TC 211 ) in the implementation of national and regional SDI .  
The net additional requirements of $ 900 under this heading were attributable to additional requirements under mission subsistence allowance ( $ 354,200 ) and other official travel costs ( $ 435,100 ) , as well as to unforeseen expenditure under the consultants budget line item ( $ 74,400 ) , offset by savings under the international and local staff salaries ( $ 104,700 and $ 171,500 , respectively ) and common staff costs ( $ 589,000 ) .  
This will also include coordinating the development of common policies on humanitarian issues ; improving the management and practice of humanitarian coordination through the enhancement of practical tools for field and headquarters coordination , based on lessons learned ; ensuring that gender-sensitive strategies are incorporated in humanitarian action plans ; increasing support for and awareness of humanitarian assistance issues and international humanitarian law in the work of the United Nations and its Member States ; and intensifying resource mobilization .

This will require the operationalization by all relevant actors of common policy goals set out in the international development targets and the Millennium Declaration agreed to by all United Nations Member States , and , when possible , common country approaches and strategies based on developing countries national priorities and development plans , including strategies for sustainable development .  
At the national level , this will require ministries / government agencies and central banks responsible for different international and regional organizations and involved in their norm-setting / policy-making to become more coordinated and to increase coherence among themselves when discussing and deciding on such common goals and approaches in the governing bodies of the United Nations , IFIs and other international and regional organizations .  
It will also be important to receive proposals from CPF on streamlining national reporting formats required by various forest-related international organizations and instruments , taking also into account the streamlining work on reporting in other relevant forums . 13 UNFF may wish to focus on advancing the common understanding and use of those key concepts , definitions and terms that could benefit greatly the implementation at a practical level , as well as the monitoring of progress . 
In this context , human resources directors meet prior to the sessions of the International Civil Service Commission to review matters under consideration by the Commission , appoint spokespersons to represent the executive heads of the participating organizations at the Commission sessions and put forward common positions on the relevant issues under consideration .  
During the biennium 2002-2003 , in the personnel and general administration areas the High-level Committee on Management will place emphasis on human resources management and reform of the common system by continuing specific studies covering the role and function of the international civil service and its underpinnings , the development of a senior management cadre , the further development of system-wide standards on contractual patterns and employment conditions and the implications of other management reforms , such as downsizing and outsourcing , for the participating organizations .  
As to the form that work might take , while a model law might be more desirable from the point of view of completeness and uniformity , to the extent that it would need to reflect certain fundamental guiding principles that would not be common ground to all legal systems , it would represent a significant change from current law in many countries and might , as a result , not meet with sufficient acceptance .  
Deeply convinced of the need to create a new spirit of international cooperation based on the principle of achieving shared benefits , but also based on common but differentiated responsibilities , between the developing and industrialized countries ,

Based on common international understandings that respect diversity and specific country circumstances , these national efforts should be supported by an enabling international environment , including good international financial and trade governance and adequate external resources mobilization .  
The stated purpose of the report is to provide a coherent framework for the creation and strengthening of a unified , comprehensive and centralized common services entity for United Nations organizations located at Geneva to enable them to rationalize their overhead structures and costs and to concentrate diminishing resources on their constitutional mandates .  
As recommended in part I of the report , Overview of administrative cooperation and coordination ( JIU / REP / 98 / 4 ) ( A / 53 / 787 ) , the objective of part II , Case studies , is to identify key strengths and constraints of some existing services in order to derive lessons that can be applied to the expanded sharing of support services in accordance with the plan of action for Geneva common services , 2000-2010 .  
Since 1993 , however , secondary-level institutions have been undergoing extensive restructuring through the Reform of Secondary Education ( ROSE ) project which is aimed at improving the quality and equity of educational provisions at the secondary level through the establishment of a common national curriculum for grades 7 to 9 .  
Donors and some recipient countries consulted for the present triennial comprehensive policy review confirmed the high relevance of this effect of UNDAF as a means to enhance the internal dialogue within the system on country-level cooperation38 and in the promotion of a common understanding of strategic directions . 39 Decentralization and delegation of authority by most organizations have strengthened this team-building effect . 
They especially appreciated the fact that the concept put forward by the Secretary-General that we must put people at the centre of everything we do was strongly reflected in the United Nations Millennium Declaration ; the Summits reference to the United Nations as the indispensable common house of the entire human family ; and its wish to make the United Nations system a more vital and effective tool in the hands of all the worlds peoples .  
In this respect , it was felt that the role of the United Nations within the system would be effective to the extent that participatory approaches were pursued , and the United Nations built on its role as a forum where the competencies of different agencies could be drawn together and where their respective constituencies were engaged in a dialogue towards common , overriding objectives .  
ACCs contribution to policy coherence and overall progress should not be limited to the elaboration of common , comprehensive approaches to development and the development of a common framework for country level action , but should extend to the identification of global public goods and of the balances and synergies that need to be created among them to strengthen international governance , further policy coherence and advance the goals set at the Summit .  
During the discussion held in the Commission in 2000 , it was concluded that common rules could be elaborated relating to certain issues concerning unilateral acts , but not relating to all aspects , which led to the earlier exercise on the classification of unilateral acts on which the draft articles to be prepared by the Commission on this subject would be based .  
The objectives of third-country training , which takes place in a particular region where developing countries have a common base in terms of natural , social and cultural factors , are to transfer the technology and know-how of Japan in a form that is compatible with local conditions , and to promote TCDC .  
To contribute to the search for a common denominator based on the peace agreements that would win the support of broad sectors of the population , MINUGUA , at the request of the parties , held an extensive round of consultations through which it discovered that there was some readiness on the part of sectors of society to work together on specific issues .  
Apart from the shared feature that their host countries were not involved in a violent internal or international conflict , the common features included the possibility , or even the likelihood , of armed conflict , consent of the States concerned to the peacekeeping operations as the form of prevention , and the authorization of the operation by the Security Council .  
FAO also assists in the development of institutions for the management of common pool natural resources oriented towards reconciling conflicting interests in watersheds between upstream and downstream water users or in fish-producing areas between artisanal and commercial fishermen . 
A salient feature of that programme was organizing periodic seminars / symposia to focus attention on specific issues falling within the framework of disarmament and development in the context of current international relations , as well as providing a forum where relevant United Nations bodies , non-governmental organizations and other international agencies could share their experience in areas of common or overlapping concerns .  
Thus , only through broad and sustained efforts to create a shared future , based upon our common humanity in all its diversity , can globalization be made fully inclusive and equitable ;  
Allow me to briefly reiterate some of these proposals : enhanced coordination ; a regular flow of information ; the exchange of liaison officers ; joint training of staff in the field of early warning and prevention ; joint expert meetings on specific areas of early warning and prevention ; the development of common indicators for early warning ; and the establishment of a database on the conflict prevention capabilities of both the United Nations and the regional organizations . 
Because of common purposes and objectives ( education and training ) , similar geographic and human target areas , similar operational modes and strategies and a common institutional location , there are large areas of synergetic opportunity between the programmes : funding , management and execution , cost rationalization - let alone the added value of a comprehensive and integrated approach to commercial and logistic manpower requirements .  
We hope that you will enjoy your stay here as you experience the proverbial hospitality of our country and , at the same time , that your time here will be fruitful and useful and will contribute to the achievement of our common objective , the international communitys target of eradicating colonialism , and that the Committee will leave Havana with renewed motivation to continue its noble and praiseworthy endeavours .  
It is , however , without prejudice to the right of any State identified in article 48 ( 1 ) to take lawful measures against a responsible State to ensure cessation of the breach and reparation in the interests of the victims ( article 54 ) .  ( 9 ) In common with other chapters of these Articles , the provisions on countermeasures are residual and may be excluded or modified by a special rule to the contrary ( see article 55 ) .  
Although experts had expressed diverse views in the report , which demonstrated the difficulty in finding common solutions , the report and the Meeting had clearly indicated that UNCTADs analytical work in this area should continue and contribute to future multilateral trade negotiations , as well as to the definition of the national trade policy of individual countries .  
I would therefore like to recall the prohibition against targeting civilians and conducting indiscriminate attacks on civilians , enshrined in customary international humanitarian law , which is binding not only on States and their Governments but equally and directly so on armed groups that are parties to the conflict , as stated in article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 . 
The representative of Benin stated that a project to adopt a competition law in his country had been stopped when the West African Economic and Monetary Union , of which Benin was a member , decided on the adoption of a common competition regulation that would supersede competition laws at the national level .  
Finally , in cooperation with OHCHR , UNEP is organizing a seminar on environment and human rights to discuss interlinkages , common protection approaches , the special role played by some groups and their vulnerability , and proposals for future courses of action at the national and international level .  
He also stressed that the technology transfer provisions analysed in the secretariat = s issues note related to specific circumstances , as indicated in the note , where a common good was at stake ( such as the global ozone layer in the Montreal Protocol and the deep sea-bed in UNCLOS ) and it was only to this extent that there was a politically and legally persuasive case for asking developed country addressees to give additional incentives for transfer of technology .  
This exercise will require further hard work and considerable negotiating skills in search of a delicate balance between the respective national interests and our common responsibilities as the sole negotiating body with a universal task in the field of international security and disarmament .  
To this end , it is essential to secure universal participation in the common endeavour , which requires an approach of cooperation rather than confrontation , and a uniform standard rather than double or even multiple standards .  
Recognizing the importance , from an analytical and operational point of view , of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development and of the need for comprehensive , coherent and effective policies on international migration based on the spirit of genuine partnership and common understanding ,  
To this end , an annual meeting at the level of permanent missions in New York , to exchange views , coordinate strategies and adopt a common regional position among member States would be an important forum in which similar experiences can be shared and solutions sought to common problems .  
Through the efforts of UNOA and in particular of my Adviser for Special Assignments in Africa , as well as my Representative in Angola , broad contacts have been established with the Government , political parties , civil society , and the church which could provide a strong support base in the common search for a peaceful resolution of the conflict . 
But central to its success has been an organic sense of common purpose around which most operational and organizational questions revolve , and are resolved , with a minimum of fuss , by multilateral standards .  
As I had told you at Salzburg , Austria , Greek Cypriot policy , actions and finally their reactions and unanimous rejection of your statement of 12 September 2000 ( which we had received as formulating , in the most neutral and simple way , a framework for the talks ) had left nothing , no common ground whatsoever from which to engage in invigorated meaningful talks .  
The panellists suggested that less reliance on private capital flows should be a common goal for all developing countries , because of ( i ) the volatility of such flows , ( ii ) the likelihood that financial flows to developing countries would decline in reaction to the less optimistic outlook for the global economy and to the falling profitability of FDI in major recipient countries , and ( iii ) the lack of meaningful international financial reforms .  
While bilateral cooperation , especially in regard to technical cooperation , remains a prevalent form of South-South cooperation , conscious efforts are being made by developing countries to pool their resources and capacities institutional , intellectual , technical and financial to address issues of common concern or specific development problems that affect a large number of people and countries .  
Our objective observation of these approaches and situations which can under no circumstances be dealt with separately from an understanding of the common framework of their causes and motives prompts us to call upon the international community to set a binding international strategy for security cooperation among all States , whose components are based on the principles of international law , the Charter , resolutions , agreements , conventions and protocols of the United Nations that do not discriminate between States and peoples .  
The Task Force is responsible for : ( a ) recommending initiatives or actions which will lead to the establishment of a common service or the reinforcement of an existing one ; ( b ) reviewing proposals and recommendations put forward by the working groups on common services ; and ( c ) defining the degree of commitment of cooperation , participation and human and financial resources required from participating organizations .  
The working groups are responsible for : ( a ) assessment of critical existing central , shared or common services with a view to identifying areas of possible improvement in quality and cost-effectiveness ; ( b ) review of the potential for expansion of central , shared or common services ; and ( c ) recommendation of the specific actions to be taken , together with the timetable , estimate of resources required and definition of accountability for their implementation , including the identification of a lead agency or organization , where appropriate .  
The International Labour Organization ( ILO ) maintained close cooperation with the League of Arab States and particularly with its specialized agency , the Arab Labour Organization ( ALO ) , by conducting joint activities and coordinating work pertaining to issues of common interest to both organizations .  With a view to strengthening cooperation with the League of Arab States , the two organizations signed a memorandum of understanding in March 2000 , with respect to employment in the occupied Palestinian territory .  
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting and expanding the exploration and use of outer space , as the province of all mankind , for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
It was important to cooperate to find common solutions that would make it possible to reduce the vulnerability of the economies of the developing countries which was linked to the instability of external resources and inequitable access to private capital markets and to strengthen the world financial system so that it would serve the interests of all and lead to the attainment of the development goals established by the international community .  
It was therefore the urgent duty of the international community to combat two current threats to development and common security poverty and HIV / AIDS . Governments themselves must be the driving force in pursuing a policy that would embrace the economic and social factors affecting development . 
Due to the increased harmonization and simplification of procedures , the reports of UNDP , UNFPA , UNICEF and WFP to their respective Executive Boards had a common format and were very similar in content ; the four agencies were therefore suggesting that reporting on the implementation of the triennial policy review and on United Nations reforms to the legislative bodies should be streamlined ; they looked forward to the Committees advice on that .  
It had applied a model unique of its kind based on a number of common policies with regard to asylum and migration providing , inter alia , for criteria for the granting of refugee status , minimum standards regarding reception , minimum standards regarding the status of long-term residents from third countries , and the establishment of analytical and descriptive statistics by the Statistical Office of the European Communities ( EUROSTAT ) .
