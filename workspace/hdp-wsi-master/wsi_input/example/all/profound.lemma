We should carry out and implement the Program from the heightened perspective of strategy and the overall situation , should understand at a profound level the important significance of emphasizing the construction of command automation for accelerating our military 's modernization construction and for winning high-tech wars , should strengthen our sense of mission and sense of urgency , should conscientiously follow the principle that local interests are subordinate to overall interests and current interests are subordinate to future interests , and should improve the construction 's overall effectiveness and benefit .  
The important concept of " three represents " put forward by General Secretary Jiang is an in-depth summing-up of historical experiences in the building of our party , a scientific generalization of the party 's nature , aims , and tasks , and new requirements set for party building in the new period .  It embodies the distinct characteristics of the times and is of profound ideological and scientific guiding significance .  
Strengthening the Party 's and the military 's aims should be taken as the basic requirement for such study programs as Party committees ' central groups , the Party 's life , theoretical learning programs for cadres and ideological education periodically held in the military .  We should devote unswerving , profound and permanent efforts , brand it and root it through periodic and repeated and effectively find answers from the bottom of their heart for the questions of " Why did we join the Party ?  What do we work for ?  
Firepower warfare has lasted a long period in the history of modern wars .  As people have entered into the period of high technologies , brand new contents and characteristics have been added to firepower warfare .

The complexity of ideological and political work is determined by the fact that we are improving and developing the self-reform of the socialist system and the world is undergoing a profound change .  Against this background , people 's thinking has become lively ;  
advance toward the target of turning ourselves into well-disciplined young people who have a lofty ideal , a sound moral integrity , and a profound cultural knowledge ; come together to form a mighty contingent of young talents ; and compose a more magnificent song of youth in the new century .  
The people are now seeking the enhancement of their life quality after they achieved quantitative satisfaction .

The " opinions " are based on profound research and scientific proof and on repeated discussions and revisions at the all-military conference on ideological and political work that was held not long ago at colleges and universities .  
This requires that we , through profound and solid good work in the grassroots and in close association with the military 's reality , carry out the detailed implementation of the requirement of the " three represents " through a comprehensive improvement of the military 's fighting strength .  Only in this way can we lay down a solid foundation for our military to win modern wars based on technology , especially high technology .

Since the beginning of the new stage , especially since the 14th National Party Congress , and facing the complex international situation and profound social change , our military can live through all tests with ideological and political education serving as an important guarantee .

In modern history , almost all debates on major issues concerning the country 's development orientation occurred against a background of domestic chaos or external threats or when the nation was facing profound crises .

The 20th century saw a series of major events that affected the course of the world history , but what had the greatest impact on the changes in human society and induced the most profound speculations is the transformation of the socialist ideal into practice , from practice into system , from the practice of a single country into the practice of numerous countries , and again from a triumphant march into a tortuous journey .  
With the curtain of the 21st century slowly opening , the incoming tide of economic globalization is surging into every corner of the world .  Economic globalization is sure to have widespread and profound effects on tomorrow 's world , including the economic , social , cultural , and military spheres .  
In the current international circumstances which are undergoing profound changes , while concentrating our strength on advancing the modernization drive and continuing to open up to the outside world , we must keep ourselves sober-headed against the infiltration of the Western ideology .  An important thing we should do is to persistently apply the dialectical materialist and historical materialist point of view to observe the complicated social phenomena .

Jiang Zemin pointed out : Although the international situation has seen profound changes , China will continue to unswervingly pursue the independent and peaceful foreign policy , develop friendly cooperation with all countries in the world on the basis of adhering to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , and make joint efforts with other countries to build a just and rational new international political and economic order .

At present the world situation is experiencing important and profound changes ; as two major developing countries , China and Iran are facing many common tasks and challenges , and share the same or similar views on many international and regional issues .
