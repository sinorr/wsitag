Since countries each have different relative strengths and all have limited financial means , considerable benefit can be realized from sharing international efforts to develop resource and environmental accounting concepts and methods .  
Although there are numerous examples of good practices by business and industry , the number of companies that are making strides in becoming sustainable development enterprises is small relative to the global total , a disappointing trend given that business and industry is the single most dominant factor influencing the direction of investments and financial flows , as well as the type of products produced and the processes with which they are made . 
Reaffirms that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , is applicable to the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967 , including Jerusalem , and considers any change in the geographic and demographic status of the city of Jerusalem from its situation prior to the June 1967 war to be illegal and void ;

Given the relative stabilization of the volume of parliamentary documentation received for translation and the steady use of contractual translation in this operation ( roughly 15 per cent of the material processed ) , it can be said that established staff resources at their current level , supplemented as necessary by temporary assistance during peak workload periods , are appropriate to ensure proper translation of all documentation in the six official languages .  
Human rights monitoring has a developed expertise regarding violations committed in a context of political conflict and repression but relative security ; it is not intended to monitor violations of international humanitarian standards in the course of full-scale armed conflict .  
In pursuing this objective , however , it must be remembered that the proceedings of intergovernmental organs and bodies make it imperative to research , write , edit , translate , print and distribute parliamentary documentation for meetings on specific dates , and almost always within short deadlines .  Fulfilling this requirement as efficiently as possible makes it necessary to give higher relative priority to the preparation and processing of documents than of publications , except those that are themselves required for meetings .  
By engendering social and racial harmony based on a political compact , we have been spared many of the traumas experienced by less fortunate countries and we were thus able to achieve our development goals in relative peace and tranquillity .  
Projections regarding future water demand and availability are highly uncertain , being dependent on assumptions about population and economic growth , investment in additional water supply , relative demand from different consuming sectors , the development and adoption of new technologies and the extent to which existing supplies become contaminated .  
Those objectives are set out relative to the following five programme areas : ( a ) increasing the availability of food , feed and renewable raw materials ; ( b ) improving human health ; ( c ) enhancing protection of the environment ; ( d ) enhancing safety and developing international mechanisms for cooperation ; and ( e ) establishing enabling mechanisms for the development and environmentally sound application of biotechnology .  
In addition , it is often argued that minimum wages in developing countries are distortionary , because they are set too high relative to the average income , thus raising production costs in the formal sector and discouraging employment .  
First , once they are fully implemented , the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture , market access reforms in manufactured and industrial products , and the phasing out of the Multifibre Agreement in textiles trade are projected to raise global income substantially ( estimates range from an increase of US $ 40-billion to one of US $ 215-billion relative to the 1992 base period gross domestic product of approximately US $ 23-trillion ) .

When authorities at the national , regional or local levels faced a sufficiently high number of individuals whose primary language was a minority language , States had come to accept that they must provide a level of service appropriate to the relative number of individuals involved .  
Nevertheless , such indicators were of relative significance ; they did not reflect the trend in all regions of the South , where the general economic situation of most countries continued to be very troubling , as evidenced by the long list of least developed countries and countries in which poverty , hunger and disease continued to wreak havoc among broad segments of the population , particularly in Africa and small island developing States .  
As a result , the Organizations financial situation today is characterized by continuing arrearage levels in absolute terms ; mounting arrearage levels in relative terms ; continuing shortages and persistent intervals of regular budget cash deficits ; prolonged periods and increasing levels of borrowing from peacekeeping cash for regular budget purposes ; and persistent levels of debt to Member States for troops and equipment .

In the years to come , for economies with a relative average development , the subject of employment , which was included as a commitment in Copenhagen , will be essential to overcoming the link between poverty , low productivity and insufficient levels of skilled human capital .  
The Committee considered that , since the EVI could give only a partial and approximate measure of the relative level of vulnerability of a country , a document to be called a country vulnerability profile should be prepared , for some countries , to provide a more detailed assessment of the impact of external economic and natural shocks on their economic performance and economic structure .

Taiwan 's multi-party system and the very lacking and fantastically complex political-economic system including the spiritual state of her social , economic , political fronts , are the results of a relatively developed economy rather than relative backsliding .  
Second , we should bring the role of universities and scientific research institutes into full play , make great efforts to carry out strategic advanced technology research and creative and basic research .  We should enhance our sustained innovation capability in science and technology .  We should strive to realize rapid development in technology in the domain that we have relative advantages or in the domain that is strategically important .

In later years , although Taiwan had made tremendous progress relative to its situation 25 years before , the difficulties it faced in raising funds overseas were proportional to those it faced in surviving internationally , and this created more problems for the center . Moreover , domestically , the island was entering the democratic era . Most citizens , including the legislators who held the purse-strings , did n't understand the importance of the center and its contribution to the world . Consequently , the budget was cut repeatedly .  
For being and nonbeing give rise to each other , difficulty and ease complete each other , long and short reveal each other . . . . " This too displays Laozi 's characteristic way of thinking : everything in the manifest world comes in relative and complementary pairs , and human value judgements are mostly born of relativity .  
Many victims who had already escaped from a dangerous structure went back inside when they heard the telephone ringing . They were concerned that a relative calling might be worried if no one answered the phone . After the earthquake , love for family members actually posed a danger to them .

A look at the political configuration of the United Nations reveals a strange paradox : at a time when hotbeds of tension are concentrated in Africa , at a time when poverty there has broken every record and at a time when natural and man-made disasters are proliferating , many international forums are seeking to reduce our continent to the status of a poor relative .  
On the contrary , despite our smallness and our relative lack of resources , we have been a consistent and active contributor of troops to various peace-keeping missions .  Fiji has paid a heavy human and financial price for contributing troops , but it has done so gladly and willingly and will continue to do so .  
At that time , the United Nations will have to play an active and decisive role so as to maintain the social , economic and political balance among the nations that make it up , with the understanding that all have the same rights and obligations now that we are enjoying a relative peace and that titanic efforts are under way to resolve the conflicts that persist .  
Unfortunately , we are forced to state that despite the relative calm there , Somalia has become a country where national reconciliation and the establishment of a Government based on broad consensus are still hypothetical owing to fluctuating allegiances among the clans .  
We believe that , without prejudice to the current institutional arrangements of duration and venue of the substantive session , consideration could be given to regularizing the holding of short sessions throughout the year , in accordance with the Charter 's provisions relative to the Council , including sessions to address critical developments and / or specific issues in the economic , social , environmental and human rights fields .

One can not emphasize enough the importance of debtor countries ' adherence to policies that will correct macroeconomic disequilibria , maintain a stable economic environment and make relative prices reflect real resource costs .  But these policies are not sufficient in themselves to promote fast and sustainable growth in the countries concerned , and that is the key to any strategy - as for middle-income countries - that envisions growing out from under a debt overhang .  
The progress achieved in the extent of its use has been uneven , reflecting its optional nature and varying perceptions of its utility relative to existing processes and national mechanisms .  
The negative economic impact on the target State depends on a variety of factors , such as the magnitude and scope of the imposed coercive economic measures , the relative size of the target vis - - vis the sender State ( i.e . , the degree of economic autonomy of the target State ) , and the availability of alternative economic options for the target State in terms of access to markets , capital , technology and investments .  
The war in southern Sudan , which began four decades ago and which , with the exception of the relative calm between 1972 and 1983 , has continued unabated , has claimed the lives of well over 1-million persons and has hindered , if not completely thwarted , efforts to move the country along a path of meaningful and lasting progress .

The greatest relative potential for improving efficiency exists in the developing countries , followed by the transitional economies , because of the prevalence of traditional economic patterns and inefficient energy end-use technologies in those areas .  
It may be noted that , at this stage , the average for the first four months of the biennium shows no variance between the actual and budgeted exchange rates for the largest currency involved ( Swiss franc ) vis - - vis the United States dollar but , as at the current date , that currency has significantly weakened relative to the dollar , a situation which , if it continues during the remaining course of the biennium , would be a positive factor .  
The political and professional debate has in recent years focused , and is likely to continue to focus , on a number of major questions : the relationship between a high level of social provision and individual incentives to work and national competitiveness ; the extent to which individual and family responsibility might be undermined by social provision ; the relative efficiency of public and private provision and of various mixes of the two ; how to divide responsibility among different levels of government ; and how to keep costs in check .

Given the relative stabilization of the volume of parliamentary documentation received for translation and the steady use of contractual translation in this operation ( roughly 15 per cent of the material processed ) , it can be said that established staff resources at their current level , supplemented as necessary by temporary assistance during peak workload periods , are appropriate to ensure proper translation of all documentation in the six official languages .  
Human rights monitoring has a developed expertise regarding violations committed in a context of political conflict and repression but relative security ; it is not intended to monitor violations of international humanitarian standards in the course of full-scale armed conflict .  
In pursuing this objective , however , it must be remembered that the proceedings of intergovernmental organs and bodies make it imperative to research , write , edit , translate , print and distribute parliamentary documentation for meetings on specific dates , and almost always within short deadlines .  Fulfilling this requirement as efficiently as possible makes it necessary to give higher relative priority to the preparation and processing of documents than of publications , except those that are themselves required for meetings .

Nevertheless , such indicators were of relative significance ; they did not reflect the trend in all regions of the South , where the general economic situation of most countries continued to be very troubling , as evidenced by the long list of least developed countries and countries in which poverty , hunger and disease continued to wreak havoc among broad segments of the population , particularly in Africa and small island developing States .  
As a result , the Organizations financial situation today is characterized by continuing arrearage levels in absolute terms ; mounting arrearage levels in relative terms ; continuing shortages and persistent intervals of regular budget cash deficits ; prolonged periods and increasing levels of borrowing from peacekeeping cash for regular budget purposes ; and persistent levels of debt to Member States for troops and equipment .  
As a result of that practice , the Organization 's financial situation was characterized by continuing levels of arrears in absolute terms and mounting levels of arrears in relative terms ; continuing shortages and persistent intervals of regular budget cash deficits ; prolonged periods and increasing levels of borrowing from peacekeeping cash for regular budget purposes ; and persistent levels of debt to Member States for troops and equipment .  3 .
