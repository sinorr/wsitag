This has given great impetus to the political , ideological and theoretical development of the ranks of NPC cadres and improved their vocational quality , and is an important contribution to the work of the NPC in the new period .

invoking the data from the reports of the previous Special Rapporteur , with whom the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia severed all relations because of his proven partiality , the authors of draft resolution A / C . 3 / 50 / L . 46 wish to portray that in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia there are " massive and systematic violations of human rights and international humanitarian law " .

The imperatives of reducing budget deficits and the desire to achieve operational efficiency shared by us all could not possibly be the basis for a universal conclusion favouring the diminishment of the State or the systematic dismantling of public administration at the cost of inviting the disruption of networks that provide structure and sustenance to economic and social life in many developing countries .  
Secondly , at the policy level there is a systematic programme to make public administrators aware of the profound economic and technological changes sweeping the world , and of their implications for the country 's development .  
There is need for further systematic and progressive effort in order to achieve our ultimate goal of the elimination of nuclear weapons and of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
Let me recall in this context that Ambassador Somav \ x { 71f0 } of Chile , in his statement earlier this morning , spoke about the great international consensus formulated at Copenhagen . The Summit articulated , in a systematic and coherent manner , a set of basic and very demanding commitments and an ambitious Programme which has the potential to be a major contribution to the shaping of world economic and social policies in the decades to come .  
The systematic efforts to annihilate 20-million Iraqis were contrary to all international instruments , which must lead the international community to consider economic sanctions as an internationally prohibited weapon of mass destruction , since the application of sanctions against Iraq had caused significantly more victims than the atomic bomb at Hiroshima , which was ironic in the extreme given the degree of interest currently evinced in human rights . 
The Security Council strongly condemns the violations of international humanitarian law and human rights in the former sectors North and South in the Republic of Croatia , as described in the report of the Secretary-General , including killings of several hundreds of civilians , systematic and widespread looting and arson and other forms of destruction of property .  The Council expresses its deep concern that there is a considerable discrepancy between the number of perpetrators that have so far been brought to justice and the number of reported violations of international humanitarian law and human rights .  
The symposium identified the main reasons for the lack of a systematic strategy for the provision of comprehensive health care in refugee situations : the low priority accorded to it by organizations specialized in emergency response ; insufficient field staff with appropriate training ; limited funding and resource allocation ; insufficient coordination among national authorities , non-governmental organizations and United Nations organizations and agencies in the country of asylum ; and consideration of family planning as a sensitive issue in post-conflict situations without seeking the views and support of refugee women .  
The determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,

Appreciating also the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 9 / and acknowledging the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
KAMAL ( Pakistan ) , speaking on agenda item 112 ( c ) , said that , while there were many types of human rights violations , the primary concern of the United Nations was the systematic violation of human rights committed by States and persons in authority and that the United Nations could influence Member States to take legislative , administrative and judicial measures to promote and protect human rights .  
Conduct a strategic needs analysis in the area of supply of goods and services for the Organization and specifically , for field missions , including the related contracting procedures , determining distinctive characteristics of the required procurement action , in particular in support of rapid deployment of new operations and major expansion of existing ones ; ( b ) Undertake a systematic in-depth review of :  
Genocide , aggression , systematic or mass violations of human rights , exceptionally serious war crimes , international terrorism and illicit traffic in narcotic drugs were covered in the draft ; those crimes represented the most serious breaches of the peace and security of mankind .  
Following a technical consultation involving India and Pakistan that had been held at Vienna in July 1994 under the auspices of UNDCP , the Governments of those two States had agreed to meet at regular intervals at the policy and operational levels to review and determine common approaches on drug-related problems affecting their common borders , such as the movement of precursors and trafficking in heroin and other drugs , as well as to establish systems for the regular and systematic exchange of operational information .  
There are still many areas in which research has to provide additional tools to enhance reforestation activities , including ( i ) systematic evaluation of reforestation needs ; ( ii ) better matching of the site and types of reforestation ; ( iii ) improvement of technologies designed for arid regions , greater international scientific cooperation between the countries concerned being of particular importance ; ( iv ) taking into account and using local knowledge and technologies .  
Experience seems to recommend , however , on the one hand , the systematic designation , for all operations of whatever size , of a special representative of the Secretary-General having complete authority over the various components of the operation and , on the other hand , at least for peace-restoration and conflict-moderation operations , which almost inextricably link military tasks ( even including combat ) with negotiation and humanitarian aid activities , an integrated structure involving close cooperation between civilians and military personnel at all levels of command , including logistics .  
Expresses its outrage at the instances of massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur , including ethnic cleansing , killings , disappearances , torture , rape , detentions , beatings , arbitrary searches , destruction of houses , illegal evictions and other acts of violence aimed at forcing individuals from their homes ;

The new criminal provisions against money-laundering were based on the assumption that money-laundering could be defined as the systematic disguising of illegal assets , using the scope offered by the legal financial market , with a view to shielding them from seizure by the criminal prosecution authorities and preserving their economic value .  
50 To this definition , the Platform for Action additionally includes the violation of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , in particular , murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ; forced sterilization and forced abortion , coercive / forced use of contraceptives , female infanticide and prenatal sex selection .  
It was agreed that the best means of conducting a systematic and methodologically sound comparative analysis of the question of firearms regulation in selected Member States would be by preparing and disseminating a well-constructed questionnaire , one that would be neutral in essence , accompanied by guidelines for the respondents .  
While unnecessary , wanton humiliations of the law-breaking State would surely be inappropriate , one finds it difficult to see - for example - how a State guilty of such a crime as a deliberate armed attack and invasion , or deliberate , systematic , massive violations of human rights or self-determination should not be required to offer guarantees that , while preserving its independent statehood and territorial integrity , could be viewed as incompatible with such a formal attribute of a State as its " dignity " .  
A more systematic and sustained process of building and nurturing national human and institutional capacities is required , tailored to each country 's strengths and weaknesses , to help integrate the different dimensions of development , including that of economic and social rights , and to design , manage and execute complex programmes and projects .  
To urge donors and international organizations to support the establishment of regional and national institutional systems dedicated to undertaking systematic studies on TFRK and to promote its wide understanding and use .  
It will be recalled that , following the first United Nations Conference on Human Settlements , held in Vancouver , British Columbia , in 1976 , and deriving from its recommendations , a consensus developed on the need for institutional arrangements to provide a focal point within the United Nations system to promote and support a concerted and systematic effort by the international community for human settlements development .  
In any case , the Special Rapporteur has raised questions and issues which need to be resolved in the light of improved knowledge of the facts and specific reports and following a systematic analysis that will produce suggestions and proposals for the adoption of political , legal and operational criteria concerning mercenary activities .

UNESCO 's policy in the area of indigenous issues is a long-term task based on regular and progressive consultation with indigenous partners .  
The Serbian authorities are continuing their campaign of State terror through , to mention only a few forms , killing and torturing of Albanians , raids of homes throughout Kosova , illegal arrests and systematic persecution and maltreatment of political and human rights activists , imprisonment of people because of their political convictions , systematic and continued campaigns to destroy the Albanian cultural heritage , including by halting education in Albanian and crushing the efforts of the Albanians to preserve their identity in Kosova .  
At its fifty-second session , the Commission , in its resolution 1996 / 71 , of 23 April 1996 expressed its outrage that the abominable , deliberate and systematic practice of rape had been used as a weapon of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina , recognized that rape in the context of armed conflict constituted a war crime and called for the protection and care of rape victims , respect for the special needs of victims of sexual violence in the investigation and prosecution of alleged violations and punishment of those responsible . 
This mandate is underlined by paragraph 11 of the Secretary-General 's report in response to paragraph 2 of Security Council resolution 808 ( 1993 ) ( S / 25704 ) , in which the Secretary-General recalled that the Security Council had condemned " the practice of ' ethnic cleansing ' and the massive , organized and systematic detention and rape of women , and reaffirmed that those who commit or have committed or order or have ordered the commission of such acts will be held individually responsible in respect of such acts " .  
The determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control , and invites them to keep States Members of the United Nations duly informed of the progress and efforts made ;  
Appreciating also the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [ 2 ] / and acknowledging the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
The Committee also recommends that further measures be taken to gather systematic quantitative and qualitative data , disaggregated , inter alia , by age , gender , colour , rural / urban and social origin , on all areas covered by the Convention and in relation to all groups of children , particularly the most disadvantaged groups .  
Such issues had to be resolved in the light of a better knowledge of the facts and a systematic analysis of political , legal and operational criteria applicable to mercenary activities .  
Subject to those qualifications , his delegation supported the gist of the draft articles , in particular the dual criteria of " systematic " and " large - scale " for the crimes covered by articles 18 and 20 , the two separate jurisdictional regimes established in article 8 , and an exclusive regime for the crime of aggression ( article 16 ) subject to a limited exception of the national jurisdiction of a State committing aggression against its nationals .

The design of the mobility element attempted to strike a balance between different needs : ( a ) for organizations without rotation policies , and / or with a large proportion of their staff at headquarters , it recognized that the first move was the most difficult to effect ; ( b ) for staff with extensive field networks , which consequently had systematic rotation policies , it made provision for the additional toll exacted by frequent moves , more often than not without a home base .  
Firstly , Costa Rica wishes to express its satisfaction at the initiation of the consultative process for the formulation of the medium-term plan , agreed in General Assembly resolution 41 / 213 of 19 December 1986 , which , with the initiation of systematic consultations with sectoral and technical bodies of the United Nations , will allow the experts directly involved in programme implementation to give constructive expression to their views and for these views to be considered when making budgetary allocations .  
As regards the Greek Cypriot side 's self-portrayal as the victimized party in the Cyprus question , I wish to underline that there is ample graphic evidence in the form of reports by the Secretary-General and the international press that during the years between 1963 and 1974 a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing was directed by the Greek Cypriots against their former Turkish Cypriot partners in Cyprus .  
The measures taken to ensure the systematic gathering of data on children and their fundamental rights and to assess existing trends at the national , regional and local levels , and where appropriate at the federal and provincial levels , as well as the steps taken to develop mechanisms for the identification and gathering of appropriate indicators , statistics , relevant research and other relevant information as a basis for policy _ making in the field of children 's rights ;  
Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights and of the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda that genocide and systematic and widespread violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
At the World Food Summit recently held in Rome , which it would have been more appropriate to call the " World Hunger Summit " , the rich countries had harped shamelessly on human rights , while destroying food surpluses in order to keep prices high , despite the fact that satisfying one 's hunger was a fundamental human right and that the starvation of millions was the most flagrant , massive and systematic violation of the right to life .  
Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights and of the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda that genocide and systematic and widespread violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
The General Assembly could not remain silent at the gross and systematic violations of the economic , social and cultural rights of the populations of developing countries caused by such measures , which were in flagrant violation of international law .  
The determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control , and invites them to keep States Members of the United Nations duly informed of the progress and efforts made ;  
Appreciating also the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , 23 and acknowledging the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
The milestones reported were the following : ( a ) Economic Commission for Africa ( ECA ) : the enhancement of the capability to generate reliable and timely environmental statistics and indicators ; ( b ) Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean ( ECLAC ) : the development and strengthening of the national capabilities of the statistical offices in the region so that the regular and systematic collection of a minimum set of environmental statistics and indicators for a selected group of countries in the region could be achieved ;  
" Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights and of the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda that genocide and systematic and widespread violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
The odious practice of trafficking involves consistent and systematic violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms and requires concerted national and international action .  
In its resolution 1996 / 71 , the Commission expressed very deep concern at information on rape and abuse of women in the areas of armed conflict in the former Yugoslavia , in particular in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , and considered outrageous the abominable , deliberate and systematic practice of rape used as a weapon of war which , in this context , constituted a war crime .  
Unfortunately , these gains were nullified by subsequent events , characterized by the ominous statements made by the Israeli Prime Minister and members of his Government and backed by continued military occupation ; land confiscation and settlement in the occupied territories ; construction of housing units in the settlement of Givat Zeev ; demolition of Palestinian houses in the occupied territories ; confiscation of identity documents of Palestinians ; imposition of closures to drain the Palestinian economy , resulting in the loss of potential income ; and systematic change in the physical character and demographic composition of Jerusalem .  
From the very start of the negotiations , the main objective of many non-nuclear-weapon States was to build into the architecture of the Treaty a renewed commitment by all States , and particularly the nuclear-weapon States , to a progressive and more systematic process leading to complete I repeat , complete nuclear disarmament .  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control , and invites them to keep States Members of the United Nations duly informed of the progress and efforts made ;  
Appreciating also the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , 27 and acknowledging the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
While the international community was watching without taking proper action , the systematic policy of " ethnic cleansing " operations , planned and carried out by nationalistic politicians , military and paramilitary groups as well as civilians who were themselves victims of racist propaganda , resulted in the mass exodus of more than 2-million refugees and internally displaced persons , in the death of more than 200,000 human beings , in the economic destruction of vast areas of the region , and in the most horrendous acts of torture , systematic rape and similar expressions of barbarity .  
At a time of universal consensus that the international protection of human beings against gross and systematic violations of their basic human rights is no longer considered as interference with the sovereignty and internal affairs of the State , we also have to recognize the legal , moral and political responsibility of the international community , above all the powerful States in the region , to prevent acts of genocide and to protect the population against other gross and systematic violations of human rights .  
Whereas , given a situation where there is social and economic injustice , including discriminatory practices against indigenous peoples , and the systematic denial of individual and collective rights and safeguards , the peoples concerned have the right to seek the necessary democratic change ,  
The Committee is concerned at the lack of an integrated and systematic approach by the national machinery to all areas covered by the Convention , in particular with regard to women in rural areas , vulnerable groups such as ethnic minorities , young women and women in prisons .  
Violence against women , especially domestic violence , appears to be pervasive , and systematic and serious efforts are required to address this problem , at the legislative level and through practical measures such as a comprehensive awareness-raising and education campaign for the public in general , and in particular for law enforcement agencies such as the police , lawyers and judges .  
The report of the Special Rapporteur of the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , from which the relevant provisions of resolution 1995 / 34 derived , identified grave violations of human rights as involving the following : genocide , slavery , summary executions , torture , enforced disappearances , arbitrary and prolonged detention , deportation or forcible transfer of population or systematic discrimination .  
Affirmation of the economic , social , environmental and cultural principles inherent in the concept of sustainable development would be enhanced by more systematic consideration of the follow-up to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and related major United Nations conferences .  
With respect to the release of women and children taken hostage during armed conflicts and imprisoned , an important step for improving the situation would be for the Governments concerned to ratify without delay and to implement all relevant international instruments and Conventions , and for practical and cost-effective measures to be taken to collect information on women and children hostages on a systematic basis .  Non-governmental organizations working in the field might also contribute to that effort .  
Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights and of the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda that genocide and systematic and widespread violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
Also condemns all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , recognizes them to be violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and calls for a particularly effective response to violations of this kind , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ;  
Also condemns all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , recognizes them to be violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and calls for a particularly effective response to violations of this kind , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ;  
Expresses its deep concern at continued serious human rights violations by the Government of the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , slavery and slavery _ like practices , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly , and emphasizes that it is essential to put an end to violations of human rights in the Sudan ;  
Regarding crimes against humanity , article 3 of the statute of the International Tribunal for Rwanda stresses the prosecution of persons responsible for crimes " when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population on national , political , ethnic , racial or religious grounds " , that is , it does not associate those crimes primarily with armed conflicts .  
From all the above , the relevant changes in the demographic situation in Abkhazia may be clearly observed , as a result of the systematic genocide and ethnic cleansing carried out by the Ardzinba regime in the occupied territories - and still continuing - directed primarily against the Georgian population .  * A / 52 / 50 .  
When the Organization had assumed the responsibility of establishing the Tribunal , it had also assumed the responsibility of ensuring that it was able to operate effectively , bearing in mind the purpose of the Tribunal which was to bring to justice those individuals responsible for genocide and other systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law in Rwanda .  
Repression by the serbian authorities had involved the killing of ethnic Albanians , the systematic use of torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , mistreatment of political and human rights activists and the suppression of efforts to promote education in the Albanian language .  
A reign of terror has been let loose , characterized by extrajudicial executions , indiscriminate killings , random and mass arrests for political reasons , forced relocation of the population , gang rapes of women and systematic efforts to obliterate the ethnic , social and cultural identity of the Kashmiri people .  
Affirming that all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy , are flagrant violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ,  
These are the latest in a long series of grave and recurrent cases of systematic pillaging and obliteration of the island 's archaeological , historic and religious monuments for which Turkey , as the occupying Power , must be held fully and exclusively accountable .  
It is hypocritical that the Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations should level false accusations against the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus on the subject of protection of cultural heritage , when it is a well-known fact that Greece itself is engaged in a policy of forcible assimilation of the Turkish minority in western Thrace , coupled with systematic pillaging and obliteration of Turkish monuments .  
There was a general atmosphere of insecurity , in which the population suffered from the arbitrariness and brazen arrogance of the Zairian armed forces ; an inefficient judiciary ; severe repression of freedom of expression and opinion , although within the margin of freedom tolerated since the National Sovereign Conference ; systematic torture and deplorable prison conditions ; and the absence of measures to ensure economic , social and cultural rights .  
That mandate is underlined by the Secretary-General in paragraph 11 of his report submitted pursuant to paragraph 2 of Security Council resolution 808 ( 1993 ) ( S / 25704 ) , in which he recalled that the Council had condemned the practice of ethnic cleansing and the massive , organized and systematic detention and rape of women , and reaffirmed that those who commit or have committed or order or have ordered the commission of such acts will be held individually responsible in respect of such acts .  
Furthermore , it recognized the existence of systematic and technological causes of environmental degradation in rural areas of the LDCs , and supported institutional and social programmes for sustainable development in those countries .  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control , and invites them to keep States Members of the United Nations duly informed of the progress and efforts made ;  
Even recent advances in the scientific understanding of these complex events leave much to speculation or , at best , any systematic patterns observed may be highly opportunistic to specific events or individual examples .  
Appreciating also the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and acknowledging the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
It is to serve as a continuing reminder to the international community of the solemn obligation set out in article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , in which the States parties pledged their commitment to pursue in good faith negotiations on effective measures relating to nuclear disarmament , and of their determined pursuit of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons .  
Crimes against humanity require that certain capital crimes ( such as murder , extermination , imprisonment , torture , rape or persecution on political , racial and religious grounds ) are committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack against any civilian population on national , political , ethnical , racial or religious grounds .  
Noting with deep concern the human rights violations and breaches of international humanitarian law outlined in Commission on Human Rights resolution 1997 / 59 , including the aerial bombardment of civilians , slavery , slave trade , extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly ,  
For an intergovernmental organization such as IOM , which works in a field with clear links to the issues dealt with by a number of United Nations organizations and bodies , timely , systematic interchanges and close working relationships with our partners promote the sorts of innovative , practical , cost effective initiatives required to address contemporary migration issues .  
Even with the passing years , we can not forget how the international community erred in addressing this crisis by involuntarily encouraging those who , over the course of time , felt increasingly comfortable in giving free rein to their ethnocentric and inhumane aspirations , coldly established as systematic theory .  
The third measure in the programme of action for implementing article VI of the NPT contained in the decision on principles and objectives relates to the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons as a whole and eventually to eliminate them , and the desire of all States to work for general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
The European Union underlines the importance , as acknowledged in the Principles and Objectives for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament agreed at last year \ x { e5b8 } NPT Review Conference , of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
The Union also continues to attach great importance to the third and last measure of the action programme contained in the principles and objectives of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , namely , the determined pursuit by nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce and eventually eliminate all nuclear weapons and to the desire of all States to work for general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
The denial of basic human rights , the confiscation of one 's rightful property and ancestral home , the denial of free movement , the obstruction of necessary economic activity , the importation of thousands of foreigners to be settled in confiscated land in occupied territory , the systematic and deliberate splitting of the West Bank through streams of bypass highways and indiscriminately placed settlements all these , in our view , amount to a clear record of violence against the Palestinians by the Israeli authorities .  
In addition to these illegal Israeli settlement activities , numerous reports and documents of the United Nations provide ample description of the systematic inhumane practices of the Zionist regime , including arbitrary mass arrests , detention and shooting of Palestinians , sealing or demolition of homes and internal closure of the territories .  
As in previous years , the responses indicated that the major causal factors of mass exoduses are international and internal conflicts , as well as systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law .  
Fortunately the 1995 Conference of NPT States parties has helped to identify the way forward by adopting the Principles and objectives for non _ proliferation and disarmament , in which the section on Nuclear disarmament sets out the importance to the international community of three specific objectives : the completion of negotiations for a comprehensive test _ ban treaty no later than 1996 ; the immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a fissile material cut _ off treaty ; and systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally .  
This brings me to the third item in the Nuclear disarmament section of the Principles and objectives _ the determined pursuit by the nuclear _ weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goals [ sic ] of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
The people of Cuba as a whole are called upon to continue the profound and systematic examination of the annexationist and colonialist plans of the Government of the United States of America included in the Helms-Burton Act as a means of ensuring that in every territory , community , workplace , educational institution and military unit there is full knowledge of the specific consequences that the execution of these plans would entail for each and every citizen , and to guarantee everyone 's active and conscientious participation in the measures needed to defeat them .  
Although the Special Rapporteur notes that there presently does not appear to exist an explicit or systematic government policy of encouraging summary executions , he is greatly concerned by the frequent allegations of arbitrary killings of civilians and insurgents by members of the Tatmadaw under a variety of circumstances , in violation of the right to life contained in article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .  
Reference is made to the sequential listing therein of three objectives under a Nuclear disarmament heading : the CTBT , the fissile materials convention , and the determined pursuit by the nuclear _ weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control . upon the prior attainment of the fissile materials production ban ? 
However , it is something that the Commission on Human Rights must not overlook and it has to be solved on the basis of more in _ depth knowledge of the facts , specific references and a systematic analysis concluding with suggestions and proposals for the adoption of political , legal and operational standards relating to mercenary activities and to companies which sell security internationally . 
Considering that the question of restitution , compensation and rehabilitation of victims of grave violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms has received insufficient atttention and should continue to be addressed in a more systematic and thorough way at the national and international levels ,  
Expresses its deep concern at continued serious human rights violations by the Government of the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , slavery and slavery _ like practices , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly , and emphasizes that it is essential to put an end to violations of human rights in the Sudan ;  
Considering that the question of restitution , compensation and rehabilitation of victims of grave violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms has received insufficient attention and should continue to be addressed in a more systematic and thorough way at the national and international levels ,  
The immediate objectives of the Programme are : to enhance national capacities and strengthen legal and institutional frameworks for providing more and better jobs for women in the participating countries ; and to sharpen global concern for womens employment issues and promote a comprehensive and integrated approach to improving the quantity and quality of employment for women , based on the systematic accumulation and dissemination of information and experiences between countries and regions .

In view of the massive and systematic violations of which the third-world peoples have been victims in the recent past , such as slavery , colonization and cultural looting , it is obvious that there could only be a global remedy , the purpose of which is to re-establish these peoples in their communal rights by returning to them the goods of which they have been unlawfully dispossessed .  
The release of a small number of detainees and the parental visits which were conceded by the occupying force are but mere palliatives , which have only served to highlight the appalling conditions of their detention and to make our demands for their release even more pressing in view of the first-hand reports brought back by the released detainees of the horrific conditions of internment in Khiam , and the systematic and barbaric torture practised behind its walls .

It is imperative that we should not wait for the end of negotiations on a fissile material treaty , the duration of which is hardly predictable at this stage , to start considering the next steps pursuant to article VI and its corollary , that is , the third commitment in the Principles and objectives document , which foresees systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons .

The absence of a consolidated text of the various provisions tends to inhibit focused and systematic attention to migrants as a specific vulnerable social group , and makes the tasks of the relevant advocacy bodies more difficult .  
With regard to conduct forbidden by international humanitarian law , there were numerous cases of murders of protected persons , torture , taking of hostages , attacks on the civilian population and forced displacements , which followed a systematic pattern .  
The 1998 report and the 1998 interim report ( memorandum ) of the previous Special Rapporteur referred to alleged massacres and summary executions , to outbursts of ethnic violence and other violations of human rights ranging from the infliction of inhuman and degrading punishment to systematic gender discrimination , including denial to women of access to medical care and employment .

While we fully understand the desire of the Member States and the Secretariat of the United Nations to save funds by reducing the number and the size of its documents , it has been always recognized that this general 32-page limit can not be applied to thematic mechanisms of the Commission on Human Rights , the annual reports of which should adequately reflect the situation of gross and systematic human rights violations on a country-by-country basis throughout the world .  
These included the lack of a systematic data-collection mechanism , inadequacies pertaining to the birth registration system , the continuing use of corporal punishment by parents and teachers , insufficient awareness and lack of information about ill-treatment and abuse , including sexual abuse , both within and outside of the family , as well as insufficient legal protection measures , appropriate resources and adequately trained personnel to prevent and combat such abuse .

In May 1995 this bargain was renewed ; indeed , a second trade-off was made when , in exchange for the indefinite extension of the NPT without a vote , the nuclear-weapon States reaffirmed their commitments as stated in article VI of the Treaty to pursue in good faith negotiations on effective measures relating to nuclear disarmament and their determined pursuit of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons .

This gruesome event , which has not resulted in a massive massacre of innocent and defenceless Serbian civilians only through a very fortunate concourse of circumstances , shows that the alleged completion of the demilitarization of the KLA and its illegitimate transformation into the Kosovo Protection Force have put no brakes at all on KLA systematic terror against the Serbs , aimed at driving out their last remnants from this Serbian province .  
In addition , UNDP has fielded a mission to assess the feasibility of , and host government interest in , the creation of an early warning mechanism that would monitor , at the subregional level , key economic , social , political , ethnic and religious variables , carry out systematic trend analysis to track changes and potential tensions and provide , in a timely fashion , much-needed signals of forthcoming crises or emergencies .

In the case of an emerging widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population , the intent clause of the last element indicates that this mental element is satisfied if the perpetrator intended to further such an attack .  
In the case of an emerging widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population , the intent clause of the last element indicates that this mental element is satisfied if the perpetrator intended to further such an attack .

The proximate cause of conflict may be an outbreak of public disorder or a protest over a particular incident , but the root causes are more likely to be found in socio-economic inequities , systematic ethnic discrimination , denial of human rights , disputes over political participation or longstanding grievances over the allocation of land , water and other resources .  
Given that most of the conflicts on the Security Councils present agenda do not relate to conventional territorial disputes , but rather to ethnic reasons , religious intolerance , abject poverty , control over natural resources or systematic violations of human rights , an opportunity is created for the Economic and Social Council to cooperate with the Security Council through recommendations conducive to conflict prevention , an area which traditionally had seemed to be outside its sphere of competence .  
We note with interest the remark contained in paragraph 10 of the report that the history of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , regardless of the political system or governing authority in place , has been one of systematic abuse of its natural and human resources , such that a country noted for its vast natural resources was reduced to being one of the poorest and debt-ridden by the early 1990s .

His delegation was therefore pleased that the Commission had decided to refer to the Drafting Committee only the articles concerned with aggression , genocide , systematic or mass violations of human rights , and exceptionally serious war crimes ; that decision demonstrated that the Commission was directing its work towards a realistic , rather than a political concept of crimes against the peace and security of mankind .  
It should be obvious from the above that the Greek Cypriots are among the least qualified people to talk of respect for " human rights " when successive reports of the Secretary-General and international press reports attest to the fact that during the period 1963-1974 there was a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing directed against the Turkish Cypriot people by the Greek Cypriot side .  
It also welcomed the call in the Plan of Action for more systematic coordination among specialized agencies , regional organizations , national institutions and NGOs , and the assignment of that responsibility to the High Commissioner ; coordinated international action in the area of human rights education would result in more effective assistance to individual countries without weakening their sense of " ownership " of curricula reforms .

The imperatives of reducing budget deficits and the desire to achieve operational efficiency shared by us all could not possibly be the basis for a universal conclusion favouring the diminishment of the State or the systematic dismantling of public administration at the cost of inviting the disruption of networks that provide structure and sustenance to economic and social life in many developing countries .  
Secondly , at the policy level there is a systematic programme to make public administrators aware of the profound economic and technological changes sweeping the world , and of their implications for the country 's development .

The systematic efforts to annihilate 20-million Iraqis were contrary to all international instruments , which must lead the international community to consider economic sanctions as an internationally prohibited weapon of mass destruction , since the application of sanctions against Iraq had caused significantly more victims than the atomic bomb at Hiroshima , which was ironic in the extreme given the degree of interest currently evinced in human rights .

Expresses its outrage at the instances of massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur , including ethnic cleansing , killings , disappearances , torture , rape , detentions , beatings , arbitrary searches , destruction of houses , illegal evictions and other acts of violence aimed at forcing individuals from their homes ;

While unnecessary , wanton humiliations of the law-breaking State would surely be inappropriate , one finds it difficult to see - for example - how a State guilty of such a crime as a deliberate armed attack and invasion , or deliberate , systematic , massive violations of human rights or self-determination should not be required to offer guarantees that , while preserving its independent statehood and territorial integrity , could be viewed as incompatible with such a formal attribute of a State as its " dignity " .  
A more systematic and sustained process of building and nurturing national human and institutional capacities is required , tailored to each country 's strengths and weaknesses , to help integrate the different dimensions of development , including that of economic and social rights , and to design , manage and execute complex programmes and projects .

The Committee also recommends that further measures be taken to gather systematic quantitative and qualitative data , disaggregated , inter alia , by age , gender , colour , rural / urban and social origin , on all areas covered by the Convention and in relation to all groups of children , particularly the most disadvantaged groups .  
Such issues had to be resolved in the light of a better knowledge of the facts and a systematic analysis of political , legal and operational criteria applicable to mercenary activities .

As regards the Greek Cypriot side 's self-portrayal as the victimized party in the Cyprus question , I wish to underline that there is ample graphic evidence in the form of reports by the Secretary-General and the international press that during the years between 1963 and 1974 a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing was directed by the Greek Cypriots against their former Turkish Cypriot partners in Cyprus .  
The measures taken to ensure the systematic gathering of data on children and their fundamental rights and to assess existing trends at the national , regional and local levels , and where appropriate at the federal and provincial levels , as well as the steps taken to develop mechanisms for the identification and gathering of appropriate indicators , statistics , relevant research and other relevant information as a basis for policy _ making in the field of children 's rights ;

In its resolution 1996 / 71 , the Commission expressed very deep concern at information on rape and abuse of women in the areas of armed conflict in the former Yugoslavia , in particular in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , and considered outrageous the abominable , deliberate and systematic practice of rape used as a weapon of war which , in this context , constituted a war crime .  
Unfortunately , these gains were nullified by subsequent events , characterized by the ominous statements made by the Israeli Prime Minister and members of his Government and backed by continued military occupation ; land confiscation and settlement in the occupied territories ; construction of housing units in the settlement of Givat Zeev ; demolition of Palestinian houses in the occupied territories ; confiscation of identity documents of Palestinians ; imposition of closures to drain the Palestinian economy , resulting in the loss of potential income ; and systematic change in the physical character and demographic composition of Jerusalem .

While the international community was watching without taking proper action , the systematic policy of " ethnic cleansing " operations , planned and carried out by nationalistic politicians , military and paramilitary groups as well as civilians who were themselves victims of racist propaganda , resulted in the mass exodus of more than 2-million refugees and internally displaced persons , in the death of more than 200,000 human beings , in the economic destruction of vast areas of the region , and in the most horrendous acts of torture , systematic rape and similar expressions of barbarity .  
At a time of universal consensus that the international protection of human beings against gross and systematic violations of their basic human rights is no longer considered as interference with the sovereignty and internal affairs of the State , we also have to recognize the legal , moral and political responsibility of the international community , above all the powerful States in the region , to prevent acts of genocide and to protect the population against other gross and systematic violations of human rights .  
Whereas , given a situation where there is social and economic injustice , including discriminatory practices against indigenous peoples , and the systematic denial of individual and collective rights and safeguards , the peoples concerned have the right to seek the necessary democratic change ,  
The Committee is concerned at the lack of an integrated and systematic approach by the national machinery to all areas covered by the Convention , in particular with regard to women in rural areas , vulnerable groups such as ethnic minorities , young women and women in prisons .  
Violence against women , especially domestic violence , appears to be pervasive , and systematic and serious efforts are required to address this problem , at the legislative level and through practical measures such as a comprehensive awareness-raising and education campaign for the public in general , and in particular for law enforcement agencies such as the police , lawyers and judges .  
The report of the Special Rapporteur of the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , from which the relevant provisions of resolution 1995 / 34 derived , identified grave violations of human rights as involving the following : genocide , slavery , summary executions , torture , enforced disappearances , arbitrary and prolonged detention , deportation or forcible transfer of population or systematic discrimination .  
Affirmation of the economic , social , environmental and cultural principles inherent in the concept of sustainable development would be enhanced by more systematic consideration of the follow-up to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and related major United Nations conferences .  
With respect to the release of women and children taken hostage during armed conflicts and imprisoned , an important step for improving the situation would be for the Governments concerned to ratify without delay and to implement all relevant international instruments and Conventions , and for practical and cost-effective measures to be taken to collect information on women and children hostages on a systematic basis .  Non-governmental organizations working in the field might also contribute to that effort .  
Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights and of the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda that genocide and systematic and widespread violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
Also condemns all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , recognizes them to be violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and calls for a particularly effective response to violations of this kind , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ;

Expresses its deep concern at continued serious human rights violations by the Government of the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , slavery and slavery _ like practices , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly , and emphasizes that it is essential to put an end to violations of human rights in the Sudan ;  
Regarding crimes against humanity , article 3 of the statute of the International Tribunal for Rwanda stresses the prosecution of persons responsible for crimes " when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population on national , political , ethnic , racial or religious grounds " , that is , it does not associate those crimes primarily with armed conflicts .  
From all the above , the relevant changes in the demographic situation in Abkhazia may be clearly observed , as a result of the systematic genocide and ethnic cleansing carried out by the Ardzinba regime in the occupied territories - and still continuing - directed primarily against the Georgian population .  * A / 52 / 50 .  
When the Organization had assumed the responsibility of establishing the Tribunal , it had also assumed the responsibility of ensuring that it was able to operate effectively , bearing in mind the purpose of the Tribunal which was to bring to justice those individuals responsible for genocide and other systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law in Rwanda .  
Repression by the serbian authorities had involved the killing of ethnic Albanians , the systematic use of torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , mistreatment of political and human rights activists and the suppression of efforts to promote education in the Albanian language .  
A reign of terror has been let loose , characterized by extrajudicial executions , indiscriminate killings , random and mass arrests for political reasons , forced relocation of the population , gang rapes of women and systematic efforts to obliterate the ethnic , social and cultural identity of the Kashmiri people .  
Affirming that all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy , are flagrant violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ,  
These are the latest in a long series of grave and recurrent cases of systematic pillaging and obliteration of the island 's archaeological , historic and religious monuments for which Turkey , as the occupying Power , must be held fully and exclusively accountable .  
It is hypocritical that the Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations should level false accusations against the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus on the subject of protection of cultural heritage , when it is a well-known fact that Greece itself is engaged in a policy of forcible assimilation of the Turkish minority in western Thrace , coupled with systematic pillaging and obliteration of Turkish monuments .  
There was a general atmosphere of insecurity , in which the population suffered from the arbitrariness and brazen arrogance of the Zairian armed forces ; an inefficient judiciary ; severe repression of freedom of expression and opinion , although within the margin of freedom tolerated since the National Sovereign Conference ; systematic torture and deplorable prison conditions ; and the absence of measures to ensure economic , social and cultural rights .  
That mandate is underlined by the Secretary-General in paragraph 11 of his report submitted pursuant to paragraph 2 of Security Council resolution 808 ( 1993 ) ( S / 25704 ) , in which he recalled that the Council had condemned the practice of ethnic cleansing and the massive , organized and systematic detention and rape of women , and reaffirmed that those who commit or have committed or order or have ordered the commission of such acts will be held individually responsible in respect of such acts .  
Furthermore , it recognized the existence of systematic and technological causes of environmental degradation in rural areas of the LDCs , and supported institutional and social programmes for sustainable development in those countries .  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control , and invites them to keep States Members of the United Nations duly informed of the progress and efforts made ;  
Even recent advances in the scientific understanding of these complex events leave much to speculation or , at best , any systematic patterns observed may be highly opportunistic to specific events or individual examples .  
Appreciating also the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and acknowledging the importance of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ,  
It is to serve as a continuing reminder to the international community of the solemn obligation set out in article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , in which the States parties pledged their commitment to pursue in good faith negotiations on effective measures relating to nuclear disarmament , and of their determined pursuit of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons .  
Crimes against humanity require that certain capital crimes ( such as murder , extermination , imprisonment , torture , rape or persecution on political , racial and religious grounds ) are committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack against any civilian population on national , political , ethnical , racial or religious grounds .  
Noting with deep concern the human rights violations and breaches of international humanitarian law outlined in Commission on Human Rights resolution 1997 / 59 , including the aerial bombardment of civilians , slavery , slave trade , extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly ,  
For an intergovernmental organization such as IOM , which works in a field with clear links to the issues dealt with by a number of United Nations organizations and bodies , timely , systematic interchanges and close working relationships with our partners promote the sorts of innovative , practical , cost effective initiatives required to address contemporary migration issues .  
Even with the passing years , we can not forget how the international community erred in addressing this crisis by involuntarily encouraging those who , over the course of time , felt increasingly comfortable in giving free rein to their ethnocentric and inhumane aspirations , coldly established as systematic theory .  
The third measure in the programme of action for implementing article VI of the NPT contained in the decision on principles and objectives relates to the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons as a whole and eventually to eliminate them , and the desire of all States to work for general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
The European Union underlines the importance , as acknowledged in the Principles and Objectives for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament agreed at last year \ x { e5b8 } NPT Review Conference , of the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
The Union also continues to attach great importance to the third and last measure of the action programme contained in the principles and objectives of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , namely , the determined pursuit by nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce and eventually eliminate all nuclear weapons and to the desire of all States to work for general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
The denial of basic human rights , the confiscation of one 's rightful property and ancestral home , the denial of free movement , the obstruction of necessary economic activity , the importation of thousands of foreigners to be settled in confiscated land in occupied territory , the systematic and deliberate splitting of the West Bank through streams of bypass highways and indiscriminately placed settlements all these , in our view , amount to a clear record of violence against the Palestinians by the Israeli authorities .  
In addition to these illegal Israeli settlement activities , numerous reports and documents of the United Nations provide ample description of the systematic inhumane practices of the Zionist regime , including arbitrary mass arrests , detention and shooting of Palestinians , sealing or demolition of homes and internal closure of the territories .  
As in previous years , the responses indicated that the major causal factors of mass exoduses are international and internal conflicts , as well as systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law .  
Fortunately the 1995 Conference of NPT States parties has helped to identify the way forward by adopting the Principles and objectives for non _ proliferation and disarmament , in which the section on Nuclear disarmament sets out the importance to the international community of three specific objectives : the completion of negotiations for a comprehensive test _ ban treaty no later than 1996 ; the immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a fissile material cut _ off treaty ; and systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally .  
This brings me to the third item in the Nuclear disarmament section of the Principles and objectives _ the determined pursuit by the nuclear _ weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goals [ sic ] of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
The people of Cuba as a whole are called upon to continue the profound and systematic examination of the annexationist and colonialist plans of the Government of the United States of America included in the Helms-Burton Act as a means of ensuring that in every territory , community , workplace , educational institution and military unit there is full knowledge of the specific consequences that the execution of these plans would entail for each and every citizen , and to guarantee everyone 's active and conscientious participation in the measures needed to defeat them .  
Although the Special Rapporteur notes that there presently does not appear to exist an explicit or systematic government policy of encouraging summary executions , he is greatly concerned by the frequent allegations of arbitrary killings of civilians and insurgents by members of the Tatmadaw under a variety of circumstances , in violation of the right to life contained in article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .  
Reference is made to the sequential listing therein of three objectives under a Nuclear disarmament heading : the CTBT , the fissile materials convention , and the determined pursuit by the nuclear _ weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control . upon the prior attainment of the fissile materials production ban ? 
However , it is something that the Commission on Human Rights must not overlook and it has to be solved on the basis of more in _ depth knowledge of the facts , specific references and a systematic analysis concluding with suggestions and proposals for the adoption of political , legal and operational standards relating to mercenary activities and to companies which sell security internationally . 
Considering that the question of restitution , compensation and rehabilitation of victims of grave violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms has received insufficient atttention and should continue to be addressed in a more systematic and thorough way at the national and international levels ,  
Expresses its deep concern at continued serious human rights violations by the Government of the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , slavery and slavery _ like practices , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly , and emphasizes that it is essential to put an end to violations of human rights in the Sudan ;  
Considering that the question of restitution , compensation and rehabilitation of victims of grave violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms has received insufficient attention and should continue to be addressed in a more systematic and thorough way at the national and international levels ,  
The immediate objectives of the Programme are : to enhance national capacities and strengthen legal and institutional frameworks for providing more and better jobs for women in the participating countries ; and to sharpen global concern for womens employment issues and promote a comprehensive and integrated approach to improving the quantity and quality of employment for women , based on the systematic accumulation and dissemination of information and experiences between countries and regions .  
The Committee was concerned at the lack of an integrated and systematic approach by the national machinery and the relevant ministries to all areas covered by the Convention , in particular with regard to women in rural areas , vulnerable groups such as ethnic minorities , young women and women in prisons .  
In view of the massive and systematic violations of which the third-world peoples have been victims in the recent past , such as slavery , colonization and cultural looting , it is obvious that there could only be a global remedy , the purpose of which is to re-establish these peoples in their communal rights by returning to them the goods of which they have been unlawfully dispossessed .  
The release of a small number of detainees and the parental visits which were conceded by the occupying force are but mere palliatives , which have only served to highlight the appalling conditions of their detention and to make our demands for their release even more pressing in view of the first-hand reports brought back by the released detainees of the horrific conditions of internment in Khiam , and the systematic and barbaric torture practised behind its walls .  
Affirming that all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy , are flagrant violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ,  
Over the next five years , Malta planned to further strengthen the administrative and legislative means available to it to combat drug trafficking , sustain its opposition to the legalization of drugs , both hard and soft , involve all the actors of civil society in a coordinated strategy of prevention and education , enhance the drug-related services available for the family and the community , if necessary calling on the voluntary sector for assistance , and establish a continuous systematic evaluation exercise of the services offered in the preventive and therapeutic field .  
When the Organization assumed the responsibility of establishing the Tribunal , it also assumed the responsibility of ensuring that it was able to operate effectively , bearing in mind the purpose of the Tribunal , which is to bring to justice those individuals responsible for the genocide and other systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian laws committed in Rwanda and neighbouring States .  
Co-operate in developing at the national and , where appropriate , regional level , systematic observation and data archives , scientific and technical research , and support for improving endogenous capacities and capabilities to participate in international and intergovernmental programmes , conferences , meetings and seminars related to the climate system , and the enhancement of access to , and exchange of , data and analyses thereof , obtained from areas beyond national jurisdiction , taking into account the particular concerns and needs of developing country Parties in implementing Article 5 of the Convention .  
The systematic and planned killing , deportation , rape , summary execution , abduction , arbitrary detention and looting was perpetrated by the Taliban while Pakistani military personnel accompanied and assisted the Taliban .  
Despite the progress achieved , the increasing tragedies and the escalation of massive and systematic violations are brutal reminders of the ease and frequency with which the noble ideal of defending human rights can be compromised .  
The statute also specifies that for rape to be considered a crime against humanity , it must be a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population on national , political , ethnic , racial or religious grounds .  
Regrettably , he was bound to report that the situation of human rights in Iraq had not improved during the previous year , and that the Iraqi Government continued to commit massive and systematic violations of the basic rights of the population .  
The periodic reports of the Secretary-General and of the international press provide ample graphic evidence of a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing directed against the Turkish Cypriot people during that period .  
In the chapeau , her delegation was in favour of the words widespread and systematic and the words on political , philosophical , racial , ethnic or religious grounds or any other arbitrarily defined grounds .  
It is valid only until nuclear disarmament is achieved , and resolute , systematic and progressive efforts towards the final objective of eliminating nuclear weapons worldwide are of crucial importance to it .  
What is being sought is for the international community , represented by the Conference on Disarmament and the NPT , to have focused deliberations on the practical steps for systematic and progressive efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons .  
In the light of the above recommendations , the Special Representative urges the international community to adopt a comprehensive and systematic approach to providing financial and technical assistance to Rwanda , bearing in mind both the requirements of long-term development and the fact that the country has experienced a genocide combined with a continuing determination by the perpetrators to pursue their efforts at extermination .  
With a view to harmonizing the guidelines with existing forms of remedy , the expert considers it necessary to conduct a systematic review of forms of rights and remedies as they pertain to the mandate , the ways and means of the individual right of access by nationals and aliens before national legal bodies , and finally , the question of international legal consequences for failure to provide substantive redress for such right of procedural access to judicial and administrative bodies .  
It is imperative that we should not wait for the end of negotiations on a fissile material treaty , the duration of which is hardly predictable at this stage , to start considering the next steps pursuant to article VI and its corollary , that is , the third commitment in the Principles and objectives document , which foresees systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons .  
Upon instructions from my Government and further to my previous letters , the latest dated 5 October 1998 ( A / 53 / 460-S / 1998 / 917 ) I have the honour to bring to your attention the following additional documented information regarding the continuous and systematic plundering of the religious , historical and cultural identity of the Turkish-occupied part of Cyprus .  
Noting with grave concern the content of the report of the Commission of Inquiry of the International Labour Organization , [ 5 ] appointed in March 1997 in accordance with article 26 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organization , regarding the observance by Myanmar of the Forced Labour Convention , 1930 ( No .  29 ) , which indicates a widespread and systematic use of forced labour imposed by the military on the civilian population ,  
Gravely concerned about the systematic terrorization of ethnic Albanians , as demonstrated in the many reports , inter alia , of torture of ethnic Albanians , through indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanian citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) by the police and military ,  
The Committee is still concerned , however , that the current data _ collection mechanism is insufficient to afford the systematic and comprehensive collection of disaggregated quantitative and qualitative data for all areas covered by the Convention in relation to all groups of children in order to monitor and evaluate progress achieved and assess the impact of policies adopted with respect to children .  
The absence of a consolidated text of the various provisions tends to inhibit focused and systematic attention to migrants as a specific vulnerable social group , and makes the tasks of the relevant advocacy bodies more difficult .  
With regard to conduct forbidden by international humanitarian law , there were numerous cases of murders of protected persons , torture , taking of hostages , attacks on the civilian population and forced displacements , which followed a systematic pattern .  
The 1998 report and the 1998 interim report ( memorandum ) of the previous Special Rapporteur referred to alleged massacres and summary executions , to outbursts of ethnic violence and other violations of human rights ranging from the infliction of inhuman and degrading punishment to systematic gender discrimination , including denial to women of access to medical care and employment .  
The primary objective of the unit will be to promote respect for human rights and compliance with minimum humanitarian standards , and to deter massive and systematic violations of human rights in the future .  
The intensified terror tactics and military assaults by the Yugoslav forces against the ethnic Albanian community in many parts of the province represent the continuation of a systematic repression by the Yugoslav authorities to drive innocent civilians , especially women and children , out of Kosovo , reminiscent of the policy of ethnic cleansing that was carried out during the dark days of the Bosnian crisis .

Reaffirmation , in this context by the nuclear-weapons States , of their faithful commitment to the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons , and their means of delivery , and to that end , agreement to pursue vigorously systematic and progressive efforts to further reduce nuclear weapons , globally and regionally . ( delete - Declaration of commitment to the achievement of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ) .

d ) Establishment of a subsidiary body to Main Committee I of Review Conferences , and the provision of specific time at all future meetings of Preparatory Committees , for a structured opportunity to deliberate on the practical steps for systematic and progressive efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons .  
It is neither new nor extraordinary for the Commission on Human Rights to be manipulated , but it is serious that that Commission has not stated that the aerial campaign is a massive , flagrant , delirious and systematic violation of human rights .  
Refugees who have arrived in neighbouring countries have given consistent accounts of civilians being subjected to systematic and extreme human rights violations by security forces , of executions , of forced eviction from their homes , deportations , arbitrary detention , acts of sexual violence and burning of homes .  
Their primary objective should be to seek , through their presence and contacts with the local authorities , to promote respect for minimum humanitarian standards and deter massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law in the future .

The Committee is concerned that the current data collection mechanism is insufficient to afford the systematic and comprehensive collection of disaggregated quantitative and qualitative data for all areas covered by the Convention in relation to all groups of children in order to monitor and evaluate progress achieved and assess the impact of policies adopted with respect to children .  
Concern is expressed at the lack of a systematic , comprehensive and disaggregated quantitative and qualitative data _ collection mechanism for all areas covered by the Convention , especially the most sensitive , such as child abuse or ill _ treatment , but also in relation to all vulnerable groups of children , especially girls , children with disabilities , children living in rural areas , children living in poverty and refugee children .

Inspections provide the High Commissioner with comprehensive and systematic assessments of UNHCR operations , focusing on those factors , both internal and external to UNHCR , considered most relevant to the effective and efficient discharge of UNHCRs responsibilities .  
There can be no doubt that the atrocities committed against the civilian population of Sierra Leone , including widespread systematic killings , rapes and amputations , constitute massive violations of international human rights and humanitarian law .  
It found that sexual assault formed an integral part of the process of destroying the Tutsi ethnic group and that the rape was systematic and had been perpetrated against Tutsi women only , manifesting the specific intent required for those acts to constitute genocide .  
Based on information gathered , the Prosecutor believes that sexual crimes were planned , systematic and generalized and that they were committed with the active participation of the soldiers , the Interahamwe and government and administrative authorities at both local and national levels .  
Expressing its concern at reports indicating that systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law have been committed in East Timor , and stressing that persons committing such violations bear individual responsibility ,  
This is true both because of the increased demand that we do something when gross and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law occur , and also because the new international security environment makes it more feasible to do so .  
We are therefore grateful to the Secretary-General for his ideas expressed in the report and for his bold approach to the issues of political and military action in cases of systematic and widespread violations of international law , especially those ideas expressed in paragraph 67 of his report .

The Special Rapporteur has observed , in most cases , systematic selection of individual victims or groups of victims , based on what appears to be intelligence on their career or backgrounds : university professors , medical personnel , persons who replaced Albanian workers fired in 1991 / 92 , even elderly spouses of former minor politicians or business executives have been targeted . 
A critical task was joint determination of critical milestones for conceptual designs , for delivery of content by the concerned substantive specialists , for coordination with the concerned technical services and for systematic feedback on design options from beta testers representative of the specialized constituencies for the global social development programme of the United Nations .  
Strongly deplores the serious breaches of internationally recognized rights of refugees , asylum-seekers and other persons of concern over the past year , and remains particularly preoccupied that systematic violations of human rights , blatant disregard of international humanitarian law , and policies of wholesale expulsions of populations and ethnic cleansing have caused significant displacement both internally and across borders in many regions of the world ;

These ignominious acts of terror , the glaring few in a multitude , provide abundant evidence that , despite the contrary pronouncements of the United Nations civil and security presences , the KLA has not been demilitarized and disarmed and that UNMIK and KFOR continue to countenance ethnic Albanian terrorism and systematic ethnic cleansing of the Serbs and other non-Albanians of Kosovo and Metohija .  
This Office provides dedicated substantive and technical support to ACC itself and its subsidiary bodies , and aims to facilitate the consultative processes and the systematic exchange of information that are so vital for a coherent and harmonious system .

While we fully understand the desire of the Member States and the Secretariat of the United Nations to save funds by reducing the number and the size of its documents , it has been always recognized that this general 32-page limit can not be applied to thematic mechanisms of the Commission on Human Rights , the annual reports of which should adequately reflect the situation of gross and systematic human rights violations on a country-by-country basis throughout the world .  
These included the lack of a systematic data-collection mechanism , inadequacies pertaining to the birth registration system , the continuing use of corporal punishment by parents and teachers , insufficient awareness and lack of information about ill-treatment and abuse , including sexual abuse , both within and outside of the family , as well as insufficient legal protection measures , appropriate resources and adequately trained personnel to prevent and combat such abuse .  
Over the last 50 years , and especially since the end of the cold war , the decrease in the number of international armed conflicts has been offset by an increase in the number of civil wars and other situations of internal violence , which are characterized by massive and systematic violations of human rights .  
The results of the discussions held in The Hague and St . Petersburg not only significantly advanced the themes of the first Peace Conference , but also helped energize a vital global debate on the role of the United Nations in preventing conflict and halting gross and systematic violations of human rights .

The programme of action set out in that decision identified a comprehensive nuclear test _ ban treaty , a convention banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , and the determined pursuit by the nuclear _ weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate aim of eliminating those weapons .  
Development of a policy and adoption of effective methods for the sustainable development of EEZs ; the small land area of small island developing States has resulted in efforts to extend their activities towards the sea ( for example , reclamation of land , marine-based tourism , exploitation of minerals and oil ) ; these plans will have significant impacts on the fragile and vulnerable marine ecosystems of these States if not implemented with the utmost precaution , based on a systematic approach .  
In May 1995 this bargain was renewed ; indeed , a second trade-off was made when , in exchange for the indefinite extension of the NPT without a vote , the nuclear-weapon States reaffirmed their commitments as stated in article VI of the Treaty to pursue in good faith negotiations on effective measures relating to nuclear disarmament and their determined pursuit of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons .  
We think that current international circumstances are conducive to the systematic and gradual attainment of this objective , which will require bilateral measures , measures involving various States and multilateral measures .  
The PRESIDENT : On the second issue , I would like to recall that the representative of South Africa made a proposal at the first plenary meeting on 19 January 1999 to establish an ad hoc committee on nuclear disarmament to deliberate upon practical steps for systematic and progressive efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons as well as to identify if and when one or more such steps should be subject to negotiations in the Conference .  
The action to be taken by Governments includes a range of practical and systematic measures directed at the full implementation of human rights instruments , the promotion of human rights education , the creation of national institutions for promoting women ' s rights , the promotion of the human rights of indigenous women , and the adoption of strategies for the mainstreaming of gender perspectives through increased and strengthened efforts and cooperation .

This gruesome event , which has not resulted in a massive massacre of innocent and defenceless Serbian civilians only through a very fortunate concourse of circumstances , shows that the alleged completion of the demilitarization of the KLA and its illegitimate transformation into the Kosovo Protection Force have put no brakes at all on KLA systematic terror against the Serbs , aimed at driving out their last remnants from this Serbian province .  
In addition , UNDP has fielded a mission to assess the feasibility of , and host government interest in , the creation of an early warning mechanism that would monitor , at the subregional level , key economic , social , political , ethnic and religious variables , carry out systematic trend analysis to track changes and potential tensions and provide , in a timely fashion , much-needed signals of forthcoming crises or emergencies .  
Calls for the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ;
