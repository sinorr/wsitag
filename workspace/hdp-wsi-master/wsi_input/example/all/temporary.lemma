In the area of backstopping of peacekeeping operations ( financed by the peacekeeping support account ) or the start-up of the international tribunals , for instance , the General Assembly had , until recently , agreed only to ad hoc and temporary financial arrangements under which it has been difficult for the Secretariat to recruit staff in a planned and orderly manner .  
Recalling the importance of preserving the independence of the Secretariat , the Open-ended High-level Working Group on the Strengthening of the United Nations System , in its report to the General Assembly at its fiftieth session ( A / 50 / 24 ) , stated that positions funded from extrabudgetary resources or personnel on loan from Member States were only acceptable on a temporary basis for specific short-term projects or pending a transition , which should be accomplished promptly , to budgetary posts funded from assessed contributions .

The formal removal of barriers and the introduction of temporary special measures to encourage the equal participation of both men and women in the public life of their societies are essential prerequisites to true equality in political life .

Children 's Welfare Foundation studied examples overseas and introduced to Taiwan the foster care system , in which families volunteer to take in foster children on a temporary basis .  
The stone flagpole stand erected in the front courtyard to symbolize the family 's glory has , jammed in amongst delivery trucks , sedans , and motorcycles , long lost the position of veneration it once had . Entering the ancestral worship room , the sound of a printing machine assails the ears like thunder , and even the ancestral hall has become a temporary storage area . In the well courtyard , there is no sign of greenery , only scattered garbage .  
But with the present lack of an overall system of control , conservationists agree with the Department of Health 's extreme step of a temporary complete ban on medicinal ingredients taken from protected animals ; otherwise the situation will arise where legal behavior will obscure illegal behavior .  
Even as the NA experiences the growing pains of competitive politics , the era of rule by the Chiang family has been receding farther back into memory . Recently Chiang Wei-kuo proposed moving the temporary graves of the two Chiang presidents ( Kai-shek and Ching-kuo ) to mainland China . This proposal launched the Chiang family back into the public eye and sparked turbulence on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and in ruling and opposition parties in Taiwan .  
When the Kaohsiung Museum of Science opened last year , it experienced disaster in the form of crowds which damaged exhibits .

FPG moved quickly to clarify the situation , and later stated that there had indeed been deficiencies in the selection of the company to which it had contracted disposal of the waste . It also assumed responsibility for shipping the waste back to Taiwan , where it is now stored on a temporary site near Kaohsiung harbor . But despite these actions , FPG 's image as a pragmatic and responsible company has been severely tarnished .  
The function of the garden , where you can chat and exchange ideas , is kind of like the role a museum plays as it attempts to communicate its message to society . The paper museum has already weathered one serious storm in its short existence , and it has proved to be a hardy survivor , organizing a number of outstanding temporary exhibits . There truly is something special about the Su-Ho Memorial Paper Museum . Expect this beautiful gem to be a fixture on Changan East Road for a long time to come !  
Misery and suffering left in the wake of the 21 September Chichi earthquake are still apparent over a wide area , but rebuilding continues non-stop , and appraisal of damage to buildings in the disaster areas has been completed . The government has been busy distributing financial help and contributions sent by sympathetic onlookers , and temporary housing for 4,500 families will be completed by the middle of November . These are just the first steps in post-disaster relief efforts however ; full-scale recovery still has a long way to go .  
The introduction of foreign labor has been a mixed blessing for Taiwanese society . While helping to provide temporary relief for the labor shortage , keeping the island 's products competitive and easing pressure for firms to move offshore , the policy has also had unwelcome side-effects . Foreign labor has been blamed for undermining the local job market , putting a brake on the pace of industrial upgrading and triggering social problems .  
A temporary outdoor stage has been set up immediately opposite an Earth God temple . The purpose of hiring a drama troupe is to thank the gods for their benevolence and supplicate them for their continued good graces , but the audience is sparse , and the performers look rather uninspired .

Apart from the language , probably most people in Taiwan ca n't tell the difference between tea-picking opera and the ubiquitous Taiwanese opera .  
The day after the quake , while watching TV , their son Li Chien-ho saw the familiar sign from the family hair-stylist shop collapsed on the road side , and rushed off to get a temporary leave from his military unit to go home .

Accordingly , the proposal to give temporary work to the long-term unemployed is designed to maintain their hope for future employment . This valuable investment would assist them in gradually becoming more productive and finding suitable work . The intangible " social capital " that would accumulate is not something readily measured by GNP .  
According to Wu , schools ought to try to find the underlying reasons why " problem students " have problems . They should be less concerned with a wayward appearance than with trying to understand and deal with underlying causes , because once these are taken care of the rest will follow . If schools spend all their time trying to control outward appearances without exploring what is going on inside students , all they will achieve is a temporary stifling of emotions , which will sooner or later explode in a much more destructive way .  
noting that russia is rich in natural and human resources , li said he believed that the russian people will overcome the temporary difficulties china wishes to see a stable russia with a growing economy , he added

In reply to a question on the comparative costs of the various ways of providing translation , the Committee was informed that , in the absence of an accurate cost-accounting system , these could be listed at this stage as follows in the order of ascending costs : contractual translation ; local temporary assistance staff ; regular in-house translators ; and non-local temporary assistance staff .  
But it is clearly a temporary stimulant that must be tied to gradually increasing efficiency in our ability to build our economic institutions , our taxation and customs systems , to utilize our natural resources in reconstructing our economic infrastructure , and to encourage Palestinian and foreign capital investment in our economy so that we may be able to build an open and strong economy . 
Members asked for concrete examples of temporary special measures , and whether any such measures were foreseen to correct the high illiteracy rate , the low employment rate of women and the low rate of participation of women in political decision-making or to protect indigenous and rural women .  
Ms . AYKOR , referring to the special temporary measures outlined in paragraph 90 of the report , made the general observation that despite those measures of positive discrimination , the status of individual women continued to be determined by traditional and cultural attitudes .  
Although there were guard posts at all gates and entry into the compound was limited to those who either held a regular pass or were given temporary passes , bogus passes , which were indistinguishable from the genuine ones , could easily be bought at the Bakara market of the city .

Hence , to try to ostracize or marginalize a political leader of Mr . Mobutu 's stature a leader who , furthermore , heads so vast a country blessed with such exceptional resources , despite its temporary problems is both unrealistic and contrary to the norms of international law .  
Some mechanisms are temporary , established for the specific purpose of preparing a long-term strategy ; some have been set up within existing ministries , where coordination is developed around the preparation of periodic national strategies ; some are interdepartmental committees at the national level only ; some are consultative councils , established at both national and regional or local levels , connected institutionally ; some have both an intergovernmental committee to coordinate among regions , provinces and States , and a ministerial committee to provide a more political focus .  
In view of the pattern of meetings and conference-servicing requirements in 1994-1995 , it is expected that any requirements of the Conference of the Parties and its subsidiary bodies that can not be absorbed from within permanent capacity would require an additional appropriation and could not be met from within the reduced budgeted resources for temporary assistance in the approved programme budget for 1996-1997 .

In the area of backstopping of peacekeeping operations ( financed by the peacekeeping support account ) or the start-up of the international tribunals , for instance , the General Assembly had , until recently , agreed only to ad hoc and temporary financial arrangements under which it has been difficult for the Secretariat to recruit staff in a planned and orderly manner .  
Recalling the importance of preserving the independence of the Secretariat , the Open-ended High-level Working Group on the Strengthening of the United Nations System , in its report to the General Assembly at its fiftieth session ( A / 50 / 24 ) , stated that positions funded from extrabudgetary resources or personnel on loan from Member States were only acceptable on a temporary basis for specific short-term projects or pending a transition , which should be accomplished promptly , to budgetary posts funded from assessed contributions .

Given the relative stabilization of the volume of parliamentary documentation received for translation and the steady use of contractual translation in this operation ( roughly 15 per cent of the material processed ) , it can be said that established staff resources at their current level , supplemented as necessary by temporary assistance during peak workload periods , are appropriate to ensure proper translation of all documentation in the six official languages .  
In this way , we can avoid the arbitrary use of the veto power in matters that are irrelevant to such interests , but affect narrow regional calculations or temporary political gains unrelated to issues of international peace and security .

The worsening of the debt situation of middle-income and some lower-middle-income countries was due not only to the incapacity to pay debt obligations owing to temporary shortfalls in revenues but also to the more structural problem of raising sufficient revenue , particularly hard currency , in the long term to service their debts , while preserving their sustained economic growth and development .  
Acutely aware of its ad hoc and temporary nature , the Mission has been pursuing a three-pronged exit strategy : strengthening the state institutions responsible for ensuring respect for human rights , reinforcing the capacity of civil society organizations and the media in the area of human rights monitoring and investigation and developing a body of documents , studies and data on key institutions and human rights issues which have been made public .  
The Advisory Committee notes the statement , in paragraph 4 of the note by the Secretary-General , that general temporary assistance , in addition to being used to replace staff on maternity or sick leave or to ensure adequate staffing during peak workload periods , is used to fund specific positions which are associated with some degree of uncertainty as to the need for them to be retained in the definite future , either at their current level or in their current pattern of grades and categories . 
In this connection , the Committee recalls paragraph 7 ( c ) of its first report on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001 , in which it stated that the budget line other staff costs should be broken down by component , that is , into amounts requested for : temporary assistance for meetings ; temporary assistance to cover maternity and extended sick leave ; supplementary staff for peak workloads or unforeseen special requirements ; and overtime .  
Through such interim decisions , the treaty bodies ( as well as some of the Commissions special procedures mechanisms such as the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention ) have obtained temporary or permanent relief for countless potential victims in cases concerning , for example , stays of imminent execution , commutation of death sentences , or deferrals of extradition , expulsion or deportation orders .  
Principle 1 : Any asylum-seeker or immigrant , when held for questioning at the border , or inside national territory in the case of illegal entry , must be informed at least orally , and in a language which he or she understands , of the nature of and grounds for the decision refusing entry at the border , or permission for temporary residence in the territory , that is being contemplated with respect to the person concerned .  
The Government of our Republic has consistently maintained a policy of providing jobs , free medical treatment and free education to all people , even amid serious temporary economic difficulties created by economic blockades of foreign forces and natural disasters which have recurred over a number of consecutive years .  
The primary reason is that the increase in employment growth has not been matched by quality improvements , since the main sources of their employment have been in the expanding informal sector , as well as in non-standard and precarious forms of employment , including home-based , temporary or casual employment .  
The additional requirement of $ 1 , 991 , 900 under this heading resulted primarily from paying an unbudgeted increase in local staff salaries by 61.8 per cent effective on 1 March 1997 and the delayed termination separation of individual local contractors under special service agreements and local staff hired as general temporary assistance based on their actual contract expiration dates , which were mostly in July or August of 1997 , rather than 30 June 1997 .  
Meanwhile , many of the displaced remain in temporary accomodations , including weather-worn tents , dilapidated railway cars and overcrowded public buildings , left in a legal , social and economic limbo that is nothing short of inhumane .  
A reduced provision of $ 327 , 300 under general temporary assistance ( equivalent to 144 person-months at the local level ) is required to meet the need for additional support during surges in activity at the Logistics Base .  
Mobilizing the skills and other resources of diverse global actors , therefore , may increasingly involve forming loose and temporary global policy networks that cut across national , institutional and disciplinary lines .  
The decrease is the net result of the following adjustments : ( a ) the outward redeployment of six posts ( one-P-2 and five General Service ( Other level ) ) to the Library ( Section 2 , General Assembly affairs and conference services ) following the reorganization of that area of activities as detailed above ; ( b ) the conversion of five posts for sound technicians from general temporary assistance to established posts at the General Service level , given the continuous nature of the function .  
Any approach to combating discrimination against non-citizens should take into account several critical factors including different categories of non-citizens ( e.g . permanent residents , temporary residents , undocumented aliens , etc . ) regarding different categories of rights ( e.g . political rights , civil rights , right to education , social security , other economic rights , etc . ) in countries of different levels of development and offering differing rationales for such distinctions ( e.g . issues of national reciprocity ) .  
It appears that an effective and viable strategy for private sector involvement in financial crises in emerging markets would be to combine voluntary mechanisms designed to facilitate debt restructuring with internationally sanctioned temporary standstills to be used when needed .  
Requests the Secretary-General to present to the General Assembly at its resumed fifty-sixth session , or no later than its fifty-seventh session , through the relevant intergovernmental and expert bodies , specific proposals for the conversion of some of the temporary assistant posts requested in section 2 into established posts wherever that would measurably lead to higher efficiency and better quality of services ;  
A digital recording system for meetings , which is replacing the old analog-based system and has made it possible to use off-site verbatim reporting as a partial replacement of the much more expensive servicing modality based on the use of non-local temporary assistance , thus leading to economies in travel and daily subsistence allowance that can be estimated at US $ 150,000 per year .
