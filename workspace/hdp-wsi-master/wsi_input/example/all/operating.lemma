As regards operating expenditure , if the additional or improved services as planned , the natural increases in such expenditure as on pension , and the fact that the civil service pay can not be adjusted by the original assumed percentage , are taken into account , the total of operating expenditure to be incurred in 2003-04 will exceed the amount estimated in the Medium Range Forecast . 
In order to ensure that the Government 's overall operating expenditure does not go beyond the total amount estimated in the Medium Range Forecast , Directors of Bureaux are required to achieve a saving of 1.8% in the operating expenditure on the existing and new or improved services as planned in 2003-04 , and an additional saving of 1% each year from 2004-05 to 2006-07 .  
These meteorological authorities are responsible for operating the official world-wide weather observing network regulated by the WMO . They are the ones who have first-hand weather information from the front line .  Therefore , they are the most authoritative source of weather forecasts in their regions of responsibility .  
The gross operating surplus of the construction sector , which is equal to gross output less total operating expenditure , decreased by 5% from a year earlier to $ 9.7 billion in 2001 .  
The gross surplus of the transport sector , which is equal to total receipts less operating expenses and compensation of employees , decreased by 19% from a year earlier to $ 33.1 billion in 2001 .  
The current fare adjustment mechanism has been established since December 2000 after consultation with the Legislative Council . We adopt the " Modified Basket of Factors Approach " to handle fare adjustment applications and the factors for consideration include changes in operating costs and revenue of the relevant bus company since its last fare adjustment , forecasts of its future costs , revenue and return , the need to provide the operator with a reasonable rate of return , public acceptability and affordability , and the quality and quantity of service provided .  
* After implementation of the expenditure and revenue measures set out in the 2003-04 Budget Speech plus the remaining $ 6 billion additional revenue to be raised in the next few years , we forecast declining consolidated deficits and operating deficits in the coming years 2003-04 to 2005-06 and a return to fiscal balance from 2006-07 .  
The objective is to develop a more rational and transparent process for fare adjustments which would allow for increase as well as reduction in fares , taking into account relevant factors including public acceptability and affordability of transport fares , the need to allow operators to achieve a reasonable rate of return , the quality of service provided , the operating conditions of the operators and the overall economic situation in Hong Kong . 
In conclusion , despite the financial stringency faced by the Government and the Housing Authority , I am confident that we can make use of our limited resources to implement the three main pillars of our housing policy , namely , helping low-income families gain access to affordable housing , minimising intervention in the market and maintaining a fair and stable operating environment for the healthy development of the private property market .  
Accordingly , we started an internal review in 2001 and , in the light of operating experience , international e-business development and technological advancement , drew up a set of preliminary proposals for public consultation in early 2002 .  
" We have requested SSB operating more than one school to re-deploy surplus teachers to fill available vacancies in member schools , supplemented with additional measures such as disseminating information on teaching vacancies via the Internet , offering a preferential treatment period during which surplus teachers are given the priority to apply directly to schools , arranging group recruitment interviews and encouraging job sharing among teachers .  These are to help those surplus teachers who are genuinely in need of assistance to secure a teaching post as soon as possible . "  
In the September issue of Life Magazine , a five-page feature story attacked the alleged profusion of counterfeit manufacturers operating out of the Republic of China . This article was later followed by two successive stories which appeared in Newsweek and the Asia Magazine respectively . Describing Taiwan as a " haven " for illegal manufacturing piracy , the reports seemed to imply that the nation was the leading culprit in this rampant international affliction .  
Maintenance in the ROC follows the standard operating procedures of the U . S . Federal Aviation Administration adapted for Taiwan 's island climate , in which metals more easily rust . Every plane is thoroughly maintained and inspected by licensed technicians at regular intervals and before takeoff .  
But many new immigrants from Taiwan , despite being proven veterans on the fiercely competitive economic battlefield at home and arriving with full coffers and detailed plans for investment , tend to pull up short and halt the troops when they see the business efficiency , market order , rise of labor consciousness , severe labor shortage ( even worse than Taiwan 's ) and high operating costs they must face . . . even if they do n't beat a hasty retreat .  
However , the ownership of the publishing rights overseas is rather complex . Sometimes the rights belong to the writer , sometimes to the publishing house , and sometimes to an agent . " If you 're not familiar with the terrain , for publishers without any experience negotiating international publishing rights , it is very easy to look in the wrong places for partners , " says Luc Kwanten , executive vice president of the Big Apple Tuttle-Mori Agency , which has been operating for five years .  
" The system of agents has long been in place abroad , and is the long-term trend , " explains Luc Kwanten . For people overseas who have the publishing rights , dealing with a single agent saves a great deal of trouble over negotiating with individual publishers whose operating situations are unclear . For the domestic publishing industry , going through an agency saves even more in expenses than setting up your own publishing rights department or hiring specially trained negotiators . "  
One former national legislator , setting his sights on Lu Tao 's undersea environs , has in vested hundreds of millions of NT dollars to import a submersible and two semi-submersibles . Although the operating license has not yet been approved , the three vividly colored submarines are already parked in Nanliao Harbor , and the captains and maintenance crews are in Green Island just waiting for the word .  
At the beach play ground at Mashakou in Tainan , a half-storey tall dike was built right on the golden beach . Those operating the recreational area figured they might as well put up a swimming pool inside the dike - - and there ended up being more people playing in the pool than on the beach .  
Insecurity follows like a shadowIt is ironic that larger factories often choose to close or move simply because they are large and successful : in order to protect the corporate image , they have to observe the Labor Standards Law and environmental regulations , so they have high operating costs ; also large enterprises occupy much larger - - and more valuable - - amounts of land .  
From family businesses to chain storesHowever , with changing social structures in Taiwan , the number of people eating out has increased , and this has led businessmen to change their way of operating . They want to banish the stereotyped image which family-run beef noodle houses have acquired as dark , dirty places , and copy the bright and hygienic style of the fast food chains with their standardized products and decor ; and they have even taken beef noodle soup into international grade hotels .  
The challenge inside the systemPerhaps in Taiwan the democratic climate has not reached maturity , yet the administrative system , originally closed and operating from the top downward , has opened a door to the outside . In the past two or three years , reform groups have been commissioned by the government in some areas , and more and more have begun to be incorporated within the parameters of the system .  
It is the dangers posed to juvenile deer by wild dogs that causes concern . Nevertheless , today with human footsteps covering every stretch of the land , it is impossible to let the deer go completely wild . Not wanting to put all their eggs in one basket , project personnel hope to select repopulation locales in northern , eastern and southern Taiwan . Since they have been operating in Kenting ( in the south ) for 12 years now , Yangming-shan National Park ( in the north ) is being considered as the second locale .  
Thus , the expectant mother is put in a strange , frigid and sterile environment , lies supine on the operating table with both legs stretched out , has her private portions examined , receives an enema , and has her pubic hair shaved . This kind of clinical birthing experience often makes women feel embarrassed , pained or uneasy , and they naturally wish to avoid it at all costs .  
In order to gain market share , UMC has not only built a third factory , which was finished just last year , but has also set up joint ventures with 11 foreign companies to simultaneously build three eight-inch wafer plants in the Hsinchu Science Park ; the plants are to do contract work for these companies . With shareholdings of 25% in the three new joint-venture companies acquired with cash investments and another 15% for technical input , UMC will also have operating control of them .  
The US plays the leading role under the newly issued Guidelines , while Japan will support the US in any military conflict around Japan . When there is a crisis involving a " regional " issue , the US is required to take responsibility for restoring peace and security in the " region . " Japan , meanwhile , is obliged to keep open its base facilities , airfields , and ports , and provide support to US forces in operating in international waters and airspace .  
" The places society leaves out in the cold are precisely the places a church hospital should bring its warmth to . " Chou Tien-hung says that because National Health Insurance payments for long-stay beds are rather low , most hospitals are unwilling to provide them , since they operate at a loss . Therefore the Mennonite Hospital planned to expand its original 300 beds to 500 , with the additional 200 beds all being long-stay beds ; the shortfall in finance for long-stay care would be covered by the operating surplus from the acute outpatients department .  
When World War II broke out and the major dance companies of Europe stopped operating , Ishii Midori and Ishii Baku left for Southeast Asia on a tour of Burma , Vietnam , Malaysia and Singapore . Tsai Jui-yueh , learning modern Western dance techniques and concepts all the while , went with them . The trip gave her invaluable performing experience but even more importantly expanded her dance horizons , allowing her to absorb the dance styles of various nations .  
As of the end of 1997 , the Catholic church in Taiwan was operating 46 middle and primary schools , two universities , one technical college , 17 homes for the elderly , and seven halfway houses for troubled youth . In addition , various parishes include centers to assist aboriginal people , foreign laborers working in Taiwan ( including many Filipino Catholics ) , and those on the fringes of society .  
" Having aboriginal people , who have always been the subjects of anthropological study , operating the camera themselves is a revolution in the history of documentary film making , " exclaims Wang . It is of course a separate issue whether or not documentaries based on their own subjective points of view will be " better , " but from a human rights point of view , granting the subjects of research the right to speak for themselves is definitely to be encouraged .  
But the long-term problems caused by recreational facilities are not going to go away . These private facilities , in fact , existed long before the park was established . Many of them , such as Sun Moon Ranch , are known far and wide . They break the law in various ways , including using national land , building illegal structures , and operating without proper permits .  
It emerged that the Rey Lee Resort Hotel , which suffered severe structural damage in the quake , is actually an illegal structure , and its business license was revoked long ago . However , the owner had continued operating the hotel , leading to many guests being injured by earth and rock falls set off by the quake .  
NHI was initially intended to use a global budgeting system , but this system has proved to be too difficult to implement . However , according to Yang Han-chuan , the BNHI is now working on a pilot program to be tested with dental care in the near future . Chuang Yi-chou says , " The mechanism is a good one , but the system was designed with the whole nation operating off of one budget .  
Chu notes in her research that after they captured the city of Haikou on Hainan Island in 1939 , the Japanese military ( operating through the Government-General of Taiwan ) ordered Taiwan Development to carry out economic development on the island . The company was given a wide range of tasks , and construction of buildings urgently needed by the occupying forces received top priority . Facilities built included administrative quarters , a mess hall , barracks , and a naval comfort station .  
Looking to the future , as DSL and other broadband technology matures , large amounts of visual and audio information can also be transmitted through high-speed fiber-optic cable . As WAP equipment becomes widely available , you will be able to get important Internet information anywhere , condensed by transcoding technology into a form suitable for display on small devices . The open-source Linux operating system , which has appeared in the last several years , will make it easy for all types of platforms to be conveniently connected to one another .  
It does n't seem to require any great wisdom to have a bright and clean store with fast-food service , but when you link this simple product together with a trademark , powerful name recognition , and high quality control , the result has swept the globe . Now over 20,000 franchises worldwide work to expand the company 's territory while the headquarters takes 0.5% of operating revenues as its share for as long as the franchise lasts .  
Although the political gulf between family members was perhaps not as wide as it had been in previous decades , he was worried that a scholar like himself might not have what it took to do a good job as principal after a lifetime of operating within a socialist system and enjoying powerful political backing .  
As Kung analyzes the situation , traditionally banks made their income from the differential between the interest paid on deposits and interest earned on loans ( this is called the " interest rate margin " ) . However , with competition as intense as it is today , banks have had to offer higher interest on deposits and lower-interest loans , so that over the last three years the differential has been , on average , only about two percent . It is virtually impossible for a bank to cover its operating costs with such a narrow margin .  
The advert stressed that the " Chinese 2000 " operating system is Linux-based , highly stable , and compatible with Microsoft 's office software , and that one can use the included modem dial-up or broadband functions to go online and exchange instant messages or email with Microsoft Windows users .  
Among other things , the draft Political Party Law stipulates that in the future all political parties will be prohibited from operating or investing in profit-making enterprises or non-print mass media , and they must periodically report their financial holdings .

The emergence of the cross-platform " central editorial desk " has also created a trend for convergence of various personnel previously scattered in different fields such as the visual media , print media and technology firms . Phenomena such as magazine editors operating web sites and publishing their own electronic newspapers , or the China Times investing in Power TV to enable readers of the paper 's electronic edition to watch direct transmissions of the station 's world news online at any time , are becoming more and more common .  
The participants were managers of publishing companies from Europe , the United States , and Japan . Speaking from direct experience , they emphasized that company size was not relevant to survival .

In the innermost chamber is the surgical theater , divided into three sections-hernia , cleft lip and palate , and tumors . While family members patiently wait under the tent outside , inside , where air conditioners ( hastily set up only a couple of days before ) clank away noisily , patients in various stages of surgery are laid out on ten provisional operating tables made up out of desks and chairs . Amazingly , their expressions do not show the least fear ; on the contrary , they appear to be looking forward to treatment .  
WHO experts assisted us in devising standard operating procedures and in inspecting the management and control measures in place in 17 major teaching hospitals , including staff training , protective equipment , proper setup of negative pressure rooms , transportation of patients , and so forth .

It is at least arguable that the reason why incorrect and seemingly perverse resource allocation , management or land conversion decisions are made in forestry is not that those involved in the decision-making process are unaware of the correct valuation techniques or incapable of applying them , but rather that vested interests operating in the sector are simply unwilling to consider the alternatives such analysis might put forward .  
The continuing convenience of these traditional rail connections stems from the fact that the Central Asian rail lines had been part of the single rail system of the former Soviet Union ( which , in many operating respects , such as scheduling of through trains and the setting of tariffs , continues to function as a coordinated system ) and the fact that the use of some alternative routes has been constricted because of political unrest and because other newer options are only beginning to come on line .

The current rules on equitable representation are based on two criteria , the first being the base figure of posts subject to geographical distribution , the second being the notion of a midpoint or number of posts attributable to each member State , which itself is exclusively governed by two factors : membership in the Organization , which automatically entitles a State to a minimum quota , and the size of a member State 's contribution to the operating budget .  NULLThe base figure is the number of posts theoretically subject to geographical distribution .

The Slovak authorities , concerned that illicit drug trafficking , terrorism , arms trafficking , fraud , money-laundering and other criminal activities being carried out by criminal groups with international connections might have a negative impact on the still relatively young national institutions and society in general , had taken steps to strengthen the law enforcement capacity of the national agencies , to create a better understanding among the population of the risks posed by organized crime and to reinforce international cooperation with a view to fighting internationally operating criminal groups .  
The new UNDP structure will reflect an effort to recognize three distinct components or functions : headquarters , being those units whose functions concentrate on organizational policy , global advocacy , management oversight and quality control and global resource mobilization ; operating units , comprising the country offices and the regional bureaux ; and common administrative and financial services .  
With regard to the financial management of resources devoted to NGOs , ACC members agree with the need for a better accounting and reporting procedure , however they are not convinced that the resulting ability to produce comparative statistics will be particularly useful , since the operating budgets of organizations and agencies are very different and their individual needs in terms of cooperation with NGOs are fully adapted to their respective roles and mandates .  
It had therefore recommended that more economical and efficient methods should be found to carry out the mandate of UNPA ; that , in order to ensure that the strategic decisions of senior management were based on accurate information , the full cost of operating UNPA should be disclosed , including the cost of services which were currently provided by the United Nations to UNPA for free ; and that the internal control systems of UNPA should be strengthened .  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit an in-depth evaluation and subsequent budgetary proposals that reflect as closely as possible the overall evolution of peacekeeping trends , including any relevant restructuring of the various divisions and units involved in backstopping activities , taking into account the lessons learned from previous years ' experience of operating the support account and the workload relating to closed and completed missions ;  
The keystone to an effective legal system is an independent judiciary operating in an environment in which judicial personnel are well trained and the general public is educated and knowledgeable about the law and judicial processes .  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit an in-depth evaluation and subsequent budgetary proposals that reflect as closely as possible the overall evolution of peacekeeping trends , including any relevant restructuring of the various divisions and units involved in backstopping activities , taking into account the lessons learned from previous years ' experience of operating the support account and the workload relating to closed and completed missions ;

Because of the sharp annual increase in the elementary and preparatory school population , and the lack of funds to build new schools or classrooms to accommodate the additional pupils , the Agency resorted to renting buildings not originally designed as schools , or to operating some schools on double shifts - that is , two administrative schools in one building .  
As concerns general operating expenses , the significant reduction is attributable in large part to several energy-saving measures undertaken , such as shutting down the internal air-conditioning fan supply after certain hours ; reduced communications requirements from favourable rates negotiated with and paid to commercial carriers ; and lower requirements for rental and maintenance of premises as a result of release of space , for new cleaning and other contracts and for rental and maintenance of furniture and equipment arising from such action as the move of the mainframe to the International Computing Centre in Geneva .  
Based on relatively little actual experience to draw upon at that time , the updated budget , amounting to $ 276,898,300 gross ( $ 267,676,300 net ) , reflected only minor changes in monthly operating costs with new requirements for non-recurrent cost items that had been identified since the formulation of the original requirements in early 1996 .

Accordingly , Israel is unable at this juncture to commit itself to a total ban on the use of anti-personnel landmines until effective alternative measures are available to ensure the protection of civilians threatened on a daily basis by terrorists and of Israeli Defence Forces operating in areas of armed conflict .  
At the dawn of a new millennium we are all indignant witnesses to a rebirth and recrudescence of racist propaganda , incitement to ethnic hatred , and practices betraying feelings of racial and xenophobic superiority and exclusivity while at the same time extreme _ rightist political organizations and neo _ Nazi parties are emerging in developed societies and operating with complete impunity .  
The special courts , such as the one in Kibungo , have begun operating , like the ordinary courts , which had already been functioning for several months and trying ordinary civil and criminal cases , including current violations of human rights .

One issue that warrants special attention relates to the new firms which have been operating in several countries and whose formal lawfulness , in the light of the relevant national and international legislation , is not open to question , as they are covered by the gaps and loopholes that would prevent their activities from being classified as mercenary stricto sensu . 
The integrated follow-up on United Nations conferences provided an opportunity to coordinate United Nations activities at three levels , i.e . , at global level , through the Administrative Committee on Coordination ( ACC ) and its inter-agency task forces ; at regional level , through regional meetings of agencies members of ACC , chaired by the Executive Secretaries of the regional economic commissions ; and at country level , through task forces operating within the resident coordinator system .  
The President of the Republic , the Prime Minister and all the political parties addressed a formal request to the Western European Union , for a group of countries to assist in restoring and maintaining law and order , resolving the security situation , guaranteeing distribution of humanitarian aid , and protecting lines of communication , and for international community missions to start operating in the country through a multinational police protection force .  
It is also of concern that problems such as the slow and erratic pace at which humanitarian inputs arrive in Iraq , the operating difficulties of the distribution system , and the deteriorating basic infrastructure in the various key sectors responsible for providing social services continue to hamper the implementation process .  
As the growing operating deficits of inefficient public enterprises compounded the decline in real fiscal revenues during the recession of the early 1990s in many developing countries , disillusionment with their performance became increasingly common .  
The top-down approach seeks to create an enabling or " fostering " environment , which provides the right incentives for small firms , together with enough positive support and protection ( e.g . against unfair practices of larger competitors ) to allow such firms to make the best of their potential . 4 The top-down approach seeks to improve the business environment by operating on macroeconomic variables such as prices , government regulations and policies , by providing legislation and enforcement , and by building up the physical infrastructure .

It must be mentioned , however , that even when Trade Points have not been prevented from operating in the private sector , they sometimes had to face an unfriendly environment : since one of the most immediate practical impacts of Trade Points is to diminish the importance of intermediaries by bringing local enterprises a step closer to their markets and their customers and suppliers , Trade Points sometimes had to face direct or indirect opposition from such intermediaries ; this opposition should not be expected to diminish in the future .  
After years of living under centrally planned regimes where the private sector hardly existed as in the countries of eastern and central Europe and the former Soviet Union most fledgling entrepreneurs lacked financial and business experience and the facilities were not available for them to start operating .  
The administrative instructions require that an operating reserve maintained at the level of 20 per cent of the estimated annual programme support income be held in a separate account at all times to protect against unforeseen requirements .  
Russia , and most of the other countries with transition economies , possessed a developed industrial , scientific and technological base , now operating under difficult transitional conditions .  
The operating model utilized depends mainly upon the technological sophistication of the local exporter and trade services communities which in turn depends on the general development stage , geographical size and logistical constraints of the local market .  
In order to consider adequately the financial feasibility of the proposals and the likelihood of subsequent increases in the proposed prices , additional criteria may need to be considered , such as the costs for design and construction activities ; annual operation and maintenance costs ; present value of capital costs and operating costs ; and the amount of subsidy , if any , expected from the Government .  
By contrast , the responsibility of RDMHQ would be to convert the concept and operational plans into usable theatre - and tactical-level plans and operational orders ; to prepare associated standard operating procedures ( SOPs ) ; and to act as an advance headquarters within a mission area during the initial months when swift deployment may be crucial to long-term success .

However , the ownership of the publishing rights overseas is rather complex . Sometimes the rights belong to the writer , sometimes to the publishing house , and sometimes to an agent . " If you 're not familiar with the terrain , for publishers without any experience negotiating international publishing rights , it is very easy to look in the wrong places for partners , " says Luc Kwanten , executive vice president of the Big Apple Tuttle-Mori Agency , which has been operating for five years .  
" The system of agents has long been in place abroad , and is the long-term trend , " explains Luc Kwanten .

For the domestic publishing industry , going through an agency saves even more in expenses than setting up your own publishing rights department or hiring specially trained negotiators . "

From family businesses to chain storesHowever , with changing social structures in Taiwan , the number of people eating out has increased , and this has led businessmen to change their way of operating . They want to banish the stereotyped image which family-run beef noodle houses have acquired as dark , dirty places , and copy the bright and hygienic style of the fast food chains with their standardized products and decor ; and they have even taken beef noodle soup into international grade hotels .  
The challenge inside the systemPerhaps in Taiwan the democratic climate has not reached maturity , yet the administrative system , originally closed and operating from the top downward , has opened a door to the outside . In the past two or three years , reform groups have been commissioned by the government in some areas , and more and more have begun to be incorporated within the parameters of the system .  
It is the dangers posed to juvenile deer by wild dogs that causes concern . Nevertheless , today with human footsteps covering every stretch of the land , it is impossible to let the deer go completely wild . Not wanting to put all their eggs in one basket , project personnel hope to select repopulation locales in northern , eastern and southern Taiwan . Since they have been operating in Kenting ( in the south ) for 12 years now , Yangming-shan National Park ( in the north ) is being considered as the second locale .  
Thus , the expectant mother is put in a strange , frigid and sterile environment , lies supine on the operating table with both legs stretched out , has her private portions examined , receives an enema , and has her pubic hair shaved . This kind of clinical birthing experience often makes women feel embarrassed , pained or uneasy , and they naturally wish to avoid it at all costs .  
In order to gain market share , UMC has not only built a third factory , which was finished just last year , but has also set up joint ventures with 11 foreign companies to simultaneously build three eight-inch wafer plants in the Hsinchu Science Park ; the plants are to do contract work for these companies . With shareholdings of 25% in the three new joint-venture companies acquired with cash investments and another 15% for technical input , UMC will also have operating control of them .  
The US plays the leading role under the newly issued Guidelines , while Japan will support the US in any military conflict around Japan . When there is a crisis involving a " regional " issue , the US is required to take responsibility for restoring peace and security in the " region . " Japan , meanwhile , is obliged to keep open its base facilities , airfields , and ports , and provide support to US forces in operating in international waters and airspace .  
" The places society leaves out in the cold are precisely the places a church hospital should bring its warmth to . " Chou Tien-hung says that because National Health Insurance payments for long-stay beds are rather low , most hospitals are unwilling to provide them , since they operate at a loss . Therefore the Mennonite Hospital planned to expand its original 300 beds to 500 , with the additional 200 beds all being long-stay beds ; the shortfall in finance for long-stay care would be covered by the operating surplus from the acute outpatients department .  
When World War II broke out and the major dance companies of Europe stopped operating , Ishii Midori and Ishii Baku left for Southeast Asia on a tour of Burma , Vietnam , Malaysia and Singapore . Tsai Jui-yueh , learning modern Western dance techniques and concepts all the while , went with them . The trip gave her invaluable performing experience but even more importantly expanded her dance horizons , allowing her to absorb the dance styles of various nations .  
As of the end of 1997 , the Catholic church in Taiwan was operating 46 middle and primary schools , two universities , one technical college , 17 homes for the elderly , and seven halfway houses for troubled youth . In addition , various parishes include centers to assist aboriginal people , foreign laborers working in Taiwan ( including many Filipino Catholics ) , and those on the fringes of society .  
" Having aboriginal people , who have always been the subjects of anthropological study , operating the camera themselves is a revolution in the history of documentary film making , " exclaims Wang . It is of course a separate issue whether or not documentaries based on their own subjective points of view will be " better , " but from a human rights point of view , granting the subjects of research the right to speak for themselves is definitely to be encouraged .  
But the long-term problems caused by recreational facilities are not going to go away . These private facilities , in fact , existed long before the park was established . Many of them , such as Sun Moon Ranch , are known far and wide . They break the law in various ways , including using national land , building illegal structures , and operating without proper permits .  
It emerged that the Rey Lee Resort Hotel , which suffered severe structural damage in the quake , is actually an illegal structure , and its business license was revoked long ago . However , the owner had continued operating the hotel , leading to many guests being injured by earth and rock falls set off by the quake .  
NHI was initially intended to use a global budgeting system , but this system has proved to be too difficult to implement . However , according to Yang Han-chuan , the BNHI is now working on a pilot program to be tested with dental care in the near future . Chuang Yi-chou says , " The mechanism is a good one , but the system was designed with the whole nation operating off of one budget .  
Chu notes in her research that after they captured the city of Haikou on Hainan Island in 1939 , the Japanese military ( operating through the Government-General of Taiwan ) ordered Taiwan Development to carry out economic development on the island . The company was given a wide range of tasks , and construction of buildings urgently needed by the occupying forces received top priority . Facilities built included administrative quarters , a mess hall , barracks , and a naval comfort station .  
Looking to the future , as DSL and other broadband technology matures , large amounts of visual and audio information can also be transmitted through high-speed fiber-optic cable . As WAP equipment becomes widely available , you will be able to get important Internet information anywhere , condensed by transcoding technology into a form suitable for display on small devices . The open-source Linux operating system , which has appeared in the last several years , will make it easy for all types of platforms to be conveniently connected to one another .  
It does n't seem to require any great wisdom to have a bright and clean store with fast-food service , but when you link this simple product together with a trademark , powerful name recognition , and high quality control , the result has swept the globe . Now over 20,000 franchises worldwide work to expand the company 's territory while the headquarters takes 0.5% of operating revenues as its share for as long as the franchise lasts .  
Although the political gulf between family members was perhaps not as wide as it had been in previous decades , he was worried that a scholar like himself might not have what it took to do a good job as principal after a lifetime of operating within a socialist system and enjoying powerful political backing .  
As Kung analyzes the situation , traditionally banks made their income from the differential between the interest paid on deposits and interest earned on loans ( this is called the " interest rate margin " ) . However , with competition as intense as it is today , banks have had to offer higher interest on deposits and lower-interest loans , so that over the last three years the differential has been , on average , only about two percent . It is virtually impossible for a bank to cover its operating costs with such a narrow margin .  
The advert stressed that the " Chinese 2000 " operating system is Linux-based , highly stable , and compatible with Microsoft 's office software , and that one can use the included modem dial-up or broadband functions to go online and exchange instant messages or email with Microsoft Windows users .  
Among other things , the draft Political Party Law stipulates that in the future all political parties will be prohibited from operating or investing in profit-making enterprises or non-print mass media , and they must periodically report their financial holdings . The law further specifies that parties ' existing commercial assets must either be sold off or placed in a blind trust within two years of the law 's promulgation .  
The emergence of the cross-platform " central editorial desk " has also created a trend for convergence of various personnel previously scattered in different fields such as the visual media , print media and technology firms . Phenomena such as magazine editors operating web sites and publishing their own electronic newspapers , or the China Times investing in Power TV to enable readers of the paper 's electronic edition to watch direct transmissions of the station 's world news online at any time , are becoming more and more common .  
The participants were managers of publishing companies from Europe , the United States , and Japan . Speaking from direct experience , they emphasized that company size was not relevant to survival . Small companies have much greater room to publish creative publications . The operating principles that will always hold true for publishing houses are selecting the right works for publication and producing high quality books .  
In the innermost chamber is the surgical theater , divided into three sections-hernia , cleft lip and palate , and tumors . While family members patiently wait under the tent outside , inside , where air conditioners ( hastily set up only a couple of days before ) clank away noisily , patients in various stages of surgery are laid out on ten provisional operating tables made up out of desks and chairs . Amazingly , their expressions do not show the least fear ; on the contrary , they appear to be looking forward to treatment .  
WHO experts assisted us in devising standard operating procedures and in inspecting the management and control measures in place in 17 major teaching hospitals , including staff training , protective equipment , proper setup of negative pressure rooms , transportation of patients , and so forth . The teaching hospitals then inspected 69 regional hospitals , which , in turn , inspected 400 local hospitals . In this way , hundreds of hospitals throughout Taiwan were inspected in less than three weeks .  
This has been especially noteworthy since the former state-run telephone company became Chung Hwa Telecom and began operating as a private enterprise , driving competition in the broadband Internet access market . This market has become very competitive , with operators offering special deals and unlimited access , thereby greatly contributing to the increase in e-commerce activity .  
On April 26 of this year , while Taiwanese society was reeling from the shock of the sudden SARS outbreak , Yeh Chin-chuan , a professor at Tzu Chi University , Hualien , received a letter asking for help from the staff of Taipei 's Ho-ping Hospital . Stirred by a physician 's urge to help others , the following day he rushed to the hospital , which had already been sealed off , to investigate the infection foci and to set up standard operating procedures to combat the epidemic .  
As the maritime point of entry and exit for northern Taiwan , Keelung was able ( thanks in part to intense lobbying by local government and elected officials ) to gain central government approval despite its currently having only 68 hectares of available land . The FTZ there is set to begin operating in late September this year .

The development of the human and technical resources that are indispensable for the improvement of information and communication systems in developing countries and support for the continuation and strengthening of practical training programmes , such as those already operating under both public and private auspices throughout the developing world ;  
The establishment of a strategy calling for a supple and coherent approach in relationships of partnership between NATO , the European Union , the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the United Nations , where each has its own responsibilities , powers and ways of operating , is of vital importance to the entire matter of Euro-Atlantic security , with beneficial effects for the entire collective security system based on the United Nations Charter .  
Also condemns in the strongest terms the kidnapping and killing of military peace-keeping personnel attached to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda , the killing of personnel attached to humanitarian organizations operating in the country , the wanton killing of innocent civilians and the destruction of property during the conflict , which constitute a blatant violation of international humanitarian law ;  
In addition , ongoing technological innovations over the years have imposed an extraordinary burden on the mechanical and electrical support systems , which are now operating at full capacity , making them inadequate and inefficient and resulting in higher energy consumption and increased utility costs .  
In this difficult moment , I wish to express my Government 's full solidarity with the UNPROFOR forces , particularly with the courageous Dutch soldiers operating in the Srebrenica territory , sharing the hardships of the civilian population they are protecting and facing overwhelmingly superior forces .  
A proposal be considered by the General Assembly to reimburse the actual cost of inland transportation of major equipment from its normal operating location to an agreed port of embarkation , subject to the presentation of validated claims ;  
No country could be expected to stand idle when its own territorial integrity is incessantly threatened by blatant cross-border attacks of a terrorist organization based and operating from a neighbouring country , if that country is unable to put an end to such attacks .  
Among the points of discussion were the recruitment of students to central or local mine-clearance training schools ; the need for expatriate staff or technical advisers to stay on after the initial establishment of a national demining programme ; a recommendation that the United Nations provide pre-tailored material for new demining operations , including standard operating procedures , training and materials .  
Thus , the data and information management component of the Division of Environment Assessment is operating a computerized catalogue ( " meta-database " ) on environmental data and information , developing critical datasets for assessments and assisting and supporting national Governments , regional data networks and other programmes in their efforts to improve access to and management of relevant and meaningful data and information on the environment .  
The Croatian Army , which is operating in the territory of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the express request of the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina , and consistent with international law and within the framework of the bilateral agreement signed between the two respective Governments , will end its limited military activities in the area in the shortest time possible .  
Other obstacles to the development of businesses owned by women include an adverse economic and regulatory environment , inadequate physical infrastructure and marketing , poor access to new technology , and a lack of vocational and managerial training .  Rigid social and cultural norms and lack of sharing of domestic responsibilities exacerbate the problems women face when operating businesses .

The mechanism , an open-ended interdisciplinary and inter-agency working process , would provide a collective operating framework to direct a credible and effective application of early warning within disaster management at all levels , in particular in support of local communities at risk from natural and similar disasters ;  
The revised annex 6 was amended , limiting the testing of the system to include only the functional and performance tests and deleting the final acceptance tests originally provided for ( i.e . to run the system under actual operating conditions for a minimum of 60 days ) ;  
He has provided dedicated leadership at a particularly difficult time in the history of the United Nations , enduring often unwarranted personal criticism even as he was operating in a situation of diminishing resources on the one hand , and escalating , often conflicting , expectations on the other hand .  
The same could be said of the International Council on Social Welfare , one of whose major initiatives had to do with a group of organizations which have constituted something termed Social Watch , an interregional effort by grass-roots and research groups operating in many countries which are developing national case studies and also compiling information at the global level on the specific purposes of the Summit . As can be seen , there is an enormous list . 
A much-needed increase in productivity of rural areas of developing countries , in terms of agricultural output and processing , would require supplies of efficient , modern fuels for mechanized agriculture , rural transport and operating of essential tools and machineries . 
The proper way to respond to attitudes of reservation regarding religious freedom was through patient and resolute dialogue , based on facts and the participation of all parties concerned , operating in the framework of internationally established norms and seeking to determine possible action and to plan for the longer term .  
The liaison offices will maintain contacts with their respective host Governments on issues relevant to the missions ; relay relevant information ( including media reports ) to United Nations Headquarters and to the three missions ; undertake liaison tasks on behalf of the missions ; provide assessments and advice to other United Nations agencies operating in the region ; and provide timely and accurate public information on United Nations activities to local and international media .  
The ideal is complementarity ; as stated in one of the NFAP operating principles , by complementing and reinforcing existing and planned national and international initiatives , NFAPs will contribute to effective , comprehensive and coordinated action .  
The task of pursuing the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development , in the face of increasing global economic interaction , necessitates international cooperation of public and private institutions operating in the areas of human settlement development , whereby resources , information and capacities are pooled for a more effective response to human settlements problems . 156 bis .

The Committee may wish to consider these new approaches and perhaps recommend additional paths to pursue as regards the environmentally sound development of mineral resources for the purposes of implementing activities in the area of mineral resources , given the current budgetary constraints under which United Nations organizations are operating and pursuant to their specific mandates . 
Canada has reported that the five major groupings of criminal organizations operating in the country are outlaw motorcycle groups and Aboriginal , Asian , eastern European and Italian organized crime groups , while there is evidence that Colombian drug cartels and the Jamaican " posses " are also active . 
The closed nature of ethnic communal groups , enhanced by language barriers and an often imported distrust of the police , make immigrant communities in many countries ideal recruiting and operating grounds for criminal organizations .  
Strategic alliances , however , have several qualities that set them apart from other linkages : they are long-term , they involve " tight operating linkages " , they are based on some kind of formal or tacit agreement and they are underpinned by mutual expectations of continued cooperation .  
To that end , the co-sponsors invited individuals from specific governmental agencies and private industries to attend and , in order to receive the full benefit of the programme , the co-sponsors also requested that each participating organization or company wishing to attend the Conference should send both the chief operating officer or the equivalent and the senior technical officer .  
I should like to inform you that United States warplanes operating from bases in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are continuing to violate the airspace of the Republic of Iraq and are engaging in acts of reconnaissance , breaking the sound barrier and dropping heat flares over public and private property in the north and south of Iraq , causing damage and spreading alarm among the civilian population .  
In any event , this objective will have to be pursued while preserving the current capacity of the text-processing units to ensure the timely issuance of documentation in all languages simultaneously , working with generally very short deadlines and operating within the present framework of reduced staff resources and drastic limitations in the use of overtime .  
On 4 July 1995 , UNDP , which since 1994 has been operating a project to support a solution to this problem with input from various bilateral and multilateral sources , organized , in association with former President Carter of the United States of America , a meeting of all the Nicaraguan actors involved : branches of Government , beneficiaries of agrarian and urban reform , owners of confiscated lands , holders of indemnification bonds , agricultural associations and political parties .  
While there appears to be general agreement on sustainability criteria , it has become increasingly clear that indicators , through which progress is monitored over time , must be tailored to meet specified economic , environmental , social and cultural conditions , operating within institutional , legal and policy frameworks specific to individual countries .  
It is at least arguable that the reason why incorrect and seemingly perverse resource allocation , management or land conversion decisions are made in forestry is not that those involved in the decision-making process are unaware of the correct valuation techniques or incapable of applying them , but rather that vested interests operating in the sector are simply unwilling to consider the alternatives such analysis might put forward .  
The continuing convenience of these traditional rail connections stems from the fact that the Central Asian rail lines had been part of the single rail system of the former Soviet Union ( which , in many operating respects , such as scheduling of through trains and the setting of tariffs , continues to function as a coordinated system ) and the fact that the use of some alternative routes has been constricted because of political unrest and because other newer options are only beginning to come on line .  
I am pleased to report that the efforts to focus attention on this issue bore fruit and on 8 August the Government of Croatia and UNTAES signed an agreement by which the former committed itself to contribute to the regular monthly financing of public services in the region , including health and social welfare , education , police , administration , operating costs and related administrative expenses , in the amount of 4.5-million kunas ( approx . $ 860,000 ) ( see S / 1996 / 648 ) . 
INFOTERRA , the Global Environmental Information Exchange Network , is operating through 171 government-designated national focal points ; a network of 8,000 sources of information , including national and international institutions , non-governmental organizations , industrial and commercial enterprises , academic institutions and experts ; 34 special sectoral sources , and 10 regional service centres .  
Impediments to training programmes abroad , which are of the highest importance in replacing expatriate personnel with local technical personnel trained in operating and managing high-technology production units ; this means depriving Libyan experts of the possibility of learning the advanced techniques required to follow the technological changes in the industrial sector of the industrialized countries ;  
" Despite the proximity of Panamanian territory to jungle areas of Colombia where organized armed groups are operating , Panama has so far not experienced any acts that would fall into the category of international terrorism , aside from threats received through anonymous calls that bombs have been planted in various public buildings and places .  
Later , some mercenaries established ties with paramilitary forces of the resistance groups and extreme right-wing groups , while others are said to be operating in other countries ; finally , the company which reportedly serves as a model for companies offering , on the worldwide free market , security services which hitherto were the exclusive responsibility of the internal security forces of each State is registered in South Africa .  
The purpose of OBN , funded by a wide variety of international donors and currently operating under the authority of the PEC in the absence of relevant legislation , is to create a strong independent television sector in Bosnia , building on existing stations and drawing on talents from both entities .  
Those constraints included the numerous changes in its mandate , as well as other uncertainties in its operating environment , delays in budgetary authorization , cumbersome and inflexible procurement practices and procedures , a lack of experienced United Nations staff , the frequent rotation of personnel , the difficulty of integrating military and civilian components , and the intractability of some local authorities with respect to their obligations under the various status-of-forces agreements .  
Non-Annex I Parties are thus encouraged to formulate cost-effective national , and where appropriate regional , programmes aiming at the improvement of the quality of local emission factors and appropriate data gathering , and to submit requests for financial and technical assistance to the interim operating entity of the financial mechanism of the Convention in addition to their request for support for the preparation of their initial communications .  
The draft rules reflected a number of proposals to take into account the distinctive features of the Fund as compared to the regular budget , including : the budget approval process ; a system of continuous programming based on annual funding ; a distinction between commitment and obligation ; the establishment of an operating reserve ; and decentralization in administrative matters in the interest of efficient operations .  
It is acknowledged that the Fund of UNDCP requires an operating reserve to ensure the financial viability and integrity of the Fund and to cover : downward fluctuations or shortfalls in resources ; uneven cash flows ; increases in actual costs as compared with planning estimates or fluctuations in delivery ; and contingencies such as final expenditure ( including liquidating liabilities ) and unforeseen needs which may arise .  
UNMIBH was established pursuant to annex 11 of the Peace Agreement to assist the parties in their obligations of providing a safe and secure environment for all persons in their respective jurisdictions , by maintaining civilian law enforcement agencies operating in accordance with internationally recognized standards and with respect for internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The current rules on equitable representation are based on two criteria , the first being the base figure of posts subject to geographical distribution , the second being the notion of a midpoint or number of posts attributable to each member State , which itself is exclusively governed by two factors : membership in the Organization , which automatically entitles a State to a minimum quota , and the size of a member State 's contribution to the operating budget .  NULLThe base figure is the number of posts theoretically subject to geographical distribution .  
The required data included the entire cross-border activity of firms , including trade in goods and services ; investment , both outbound and inbound ; and an indication of the relationship of the firms involved in such activity , such as affiliated firms operating as part of a global production network versus arms-length transactors .  
Given the rates of urbanization in developing countries and subsequent new needs for services and infrastructure in human settlements , it is somewhat alarming to note that not much progress has been made on developing new mechanisms for sustained financing , on the scale required for the building , operating and maintaining of basic services and infrastructure ( see table ) . 
The World Bank has estimated that electric power delivered to end-users equals only about 40 per cent of installed capacity in developing countries , compared to over 80 per cent of installed capacity in developed countries . 19 Establishing the principle of full ( or nearly full ) cost-recovery would permit much greater recourse to foreign financing as bond financing for either public or private national enterprises operating on fully commercial principles within an adequate regulatory environment . 
Taking into consideration the overall needs of the country , the expected core resources of the United Nations agencies and the unique operating environment , the United Nations , together with non-governmental organizations spent the latter half of 1996 developing a joint strategy for efficient and targeted assistance in four main areas : emergencies , reintegration , rehabilitation and governance .  
The characteristics of those criminal groups , which closely resemble those of groups operating in other countries , their hierarchical structure , internal code of conduct , resources available and ability to penetrate the market , make local organized crime a highly dangerous feature for the newly established social and economic setting of Belarus .  
The Estonian criminal code considered as organized crime groups those criminal associations composed of three or more members who , on a constant basis and with identified functions , committed serious criminal offences ; using that definition , the Estonian authorities reported that in the last decade more than 10 criminal associations had been identified in the country , 8 of them operating permanently since their formation in the mid-1980s .  
Greece indicated that although no legal provisions had been enacted that dealt with organized transnational crime in particular , its law enforcement agencies were operating against organized crime and making use of criminal legislation designed to tackle illicit drug trafficking , crimes related to firearms , money-laundering , trafficking in illegal migrants and other offences typically committed by organized crime groups , and that a number of characteristics of organized crime had been identified within the framework of EU and were being applied by national authorities to classify an illegal action as a form of organized crime .  
The Slovak authorities , concerned that illicit drug trafficking , terrorism , arms trafficking , fraud , money-laundering and other criminal activities being carried out by criminal groups with international connections might have a negative impact on the still relatively young national institutions and society in general , had taken steps to strengthen the law enforcement capacity of the national agencies , to create a better understanding among the population of the risks posed by organized crime and to reinforce international cooperation with a view to fighting internationally operating criminal groups .  
The new UNDP structure will reflect an effort to recognize three distinct components or functions : headquarters , being those units whose functions concentrate on organizational policy , global advocacy , management oversight and quality control and global resource mobilization ; operating units , comprising the country offices and the regional bureaux ; and common administrative and financial services .  
With regard to the financial management of resources devoted to NGOs , ACC members agree with the need for a better accounting and reporting procedure , however they are not convinced that the resulting ability to produce comparative statistics will be particularly useful , since the operating budgets of organizations and agencies are very different and their individual needs in terms of cooperation with NGOs are fully adapted to their respective roles and mandates .  
It had therefore recommended that more economical and efficient methods should be found to carry out the mandate of UNPA ; that , in order to ensure that the strategic decisions of senior management were based on accurate information , the full cost of operating UNPA should be disclosed , including the cost of services which were currently provided by the United Nations to UNPA for free ; and that the internal control systems of UNPA should be strengthened .  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit an in-depth evaluation and subsequent budgetary proposals that reflect as closely as possible the overall evolution of peacekeeping trends , including any relevant restructuring of the various divisions and units involved in backstopping activities , taking into account the lessons learned from previous years ' experience of operating the support account and the workload relating to closed and completed missions ;  
The keystone to an effective legal system is an independent judiciary operating in an environment in which judicial personnel are well trained and the general public is educated and knowledgeable about the law and judicial processes .  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit an in-depth evaluation and subsequent budgetary proposals that reflect as closely as possible the overall evolution of peacekeeping trends , including any relevant restructuring of the various divisions and units involved in backstopping activities , taking into account the lessons learned from previous years ' experience of operating the support account and the workload relating to closed and completed missions ;  
An indigenous participant from Northern Europe made a statement on behalf of several organizations about the drafting of some preliminary global guidelines on the working policies , practices and directives of transnational corporations operating in indigenous areas .

Because of the sharp annual increase in the elementary and preparatory school population , and the lack of funds to build new schools or classrooms to accommodate the additional pupils , the Agency resorted to renting buildings not originally designed as schools , or to operating some schools on double shifts - that is , two administrative schools in one building .  
As concerns general operating expenses , the significant reduction is attributable in large part to several energy-saving measures undertaken , such as shutting down the internal air-conditioning fan supply after certain hours ; reduced communications requirements from favourable rates negotiated with and paid to commercial carriers ; and lower requirements for rental and maintenance of premises as a result of release of space , for new cleaning and other contracts and for rental and maintenance of furniture and equipment arising from such action as the move of the mainframe to the International Computing Centre in Geneva .  
Based on relatively little actual experience to draw upon at that time , the updated budget , amounting to $ 276,898,300 gross ( $ 267,676,300 net ) , reflected only minor changes in monthly operating costs with new requirements for non-recurrent cost items that had been identified since the formulation of the original requirements in early 1996 .  
Calls upon all Governments and parties in complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in countries where humanitarian personnel are operating , in conformity with the relevant provisions of international law and national laws , to cooperate fully with the United Nations and other humanitarian agencies and organizations and to ensure the safe and unhindered access of humanitarian personnel in order to allow them to perform efficiently their task of assisting the affected civilian population , including refugees and internally displaced persons ;  
A typical user terminal , operating at an uplink bit rate of between 128 and 768 Kbps , would employ a small-aperture antenna with a diameter of 66 cm and a solid-state power amplifier ( SSPA ) of 1-3 W . All radio frequency components ( SSPA , low noise amplifier , and up / down-converters ) would be integrated into a small outdoor unit mounted on the reflector . 
Another significant event in the international community 's quest to apply the rule of law in relations between States in marine affairs was the successful completion by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea of its judicial organizational phase , despite operating with a modest budget and a tiny staff under its President , Thomas Mensah .  
Accordingly , Israel is unable at this juncture to commit itself to a total ban on the use of anti-personnel landmines until effective alternative measures are available to ensure the protection of civilians threatened on a daily basis by terrorists and of Israeli Defence Forces operating in areas of armed conflict .  
At the dawn of a new millennium we are all indignant witnesses to a rebirth and recrudescence of racist propaganda , incitement to ethnic hatred , and practices betraying feelings of racial and xenophobic superiority and exclusivity while at the same time extreme _ rightist political organizations and neo _ Nazi parties are emerging in developed societies and operating with complete impunity .  
The special courts , such as the one in Kibungo , have begun operating , like the ordinary courts , which had already been functioning for several months and trying ordinary civil and criminal cases , including current violations of human rights .

One issue that warrants special attention relates to the new firms which have been operating in several countries and whose formal lawfulness , in the light of the relevant national and international legislation , is not open to question , as they are covered by the gaps and loopholes that would prevent their activities from being classified as mercenary stricto sensu . 
The integrated follow-up on United Nations conferences provided an opportunity to coordinate United Nations activities at three levels , i.e . , at global level , through the Administrative Committee on Coordination ( ACC ) and its inter-agency task forces ; at regional level , through regional meetings of agencies members of ACC , chaired by the Executive Secretaries of the regional economic commissions ; and at country level , through task forces operating within the resident coordinator system .  
The President of the Republic , the Prime Minister and all the political parties addressed a formal request to the Western European Union , for a group of countries to assist in restoring and maintaining law and order , resolving the security situation , guaranteeing distribution of humanitarian aid , and protecting lines of communication , and for international community missions to start operating in the country through a multinational police protection force .

It must be mentioned , however , that even when Trade Points have not been prevented from operating in the private sector , they sometimes had to face an unfriendly environment : since one of the most immediate practical impacts of Trade Points is to diminish the importance of intermediaries by bringing local enterprises a step closer to their markets and their customers and suppliers , Trade Points sometimes had to face direct or indirect opposition from such intermediaries ; this opposition should not be expected to diminish in the future .  
After years of living under centrally planned regimes where the private sector hardly existed as in the countries of eastern and central Europe and the former Soviet Union most fledgling entrepreneurs lacked financial and business experience and the facilities were not available for them to start operating .  
The administrative instructions require that an operating reserve maintained at the level of 20 per cent of the estimated annual programme support income be held in a separate account at all times to protect against unforeseen requirements .  
Russia , and most of the other countries with transition economies , possessed a developed industrial , scientific and technological base , now operating under difficult transitional conditions .  
The operating model utilized depends mainly upon the technological sophistication of the local exporter and trade services communities which in turn depends on the general development stage , geographical size and logistical constraints of the local market .  
In order to consider adequately the financial feasibility of the proposals and the likelihood of subsequent increases in the proposed prices , additional criteria may need to be considered , such as the costs for design and construction activities ; annual operation and maintenance costs ; present value of capital costs and operating costs ; and the amount of subsidy , if any , expected from the Government .  
By contrast , the responsibility of RDMHQ would be to convert the concept and operational plans into usable theatre - and tactical-level plans and operational orders ; to prepare associated standard operating procedures ( SOPs ) ; and to act as an advance headquarters within a mission area during the initial months when swift deployment may be crucial to long-term success .
