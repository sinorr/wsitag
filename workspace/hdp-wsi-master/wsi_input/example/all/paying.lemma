The method of citing examples as a proof and the functional method are both scientific methods for studying a problem .

Since its inauguration , the new US administration has refused to engage in self-examination to discover its errors , become more unscrupulous , refused to implement the Kyoto Protocol , persistently intended to develop its national missile defense system , and delayed without proper reasons in paying UN membership fees for a long time .

while in Japan , the three-party ruling coalition is divided in opinion , 21 mass organizations have staged demonstrations in protest , and another 14 religious bodies have issued objection statements .  However Koizumi turned a deaf ear to all this , and was bent on having his own way on the issue of paying homage to the Yasukuni Shrine ; and his thickheaded performance has made him excel all his predecessors .

Any historical assessment of Japan 's war of aggression has been subjected to rigorous historical examination by every successive postwar Japanese government , but their annual statements marking the " Day the War Ended " ( they dare not call it the " Day of Surrender " ) have all been disappointing .  Disregarding strong domestic and foreign opposition , Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi insisted on paying his respects at Yasukuni Shrine , where a large group of war criminals is enshrined .  
The Japanese prime minister 's brazenly paying his respects shows that Yakusuni Shrine is a symbol of aggressive war ; it has overtones of a public and official provocation , and indicates contempt for the people of those countries which suffered from that aggression .

It goes without saying that our foreign policy should be a steady one , and we should conceal our true features and gain mastery by striking only after the enemy has struck .

Today , Chinese Ambassador to Japan Wu Dawei said here that in the past few months of this year , with the occurrence of such events as the historical issue , Lee Teng-hui 's visit to Japan , and the Japanese prime minister 's action of paying homage at Yasukuni Shrine , Sino-Japanese relations have been bogged down in the most difficult condition over the past 30 years since the normalization of diplomatic relations .

In fact , progressive figures in Japanese society have consistently exposed the reactionary essence of the Yasukuni Shrine , and the families of some of the " war dead " who clearly understand the essence of the evil of the war have also expressed that their dear ones were victims misled by the spirit of the Yasukuni Shrine , and some of these people have taken part in recent street processions opposing Koizumi 's paying respects there .  
while in Japan , the three-party ruling coalition is divided in opinion , 21 mass organizations have staged demonstrations in protest , and another 14 religious bodies have issued objection statements .  However Koizumi turned a deaf ear to all this , and was bent on having his own way on the issue of paying homage to the Yasukuni Shrine ; and his thickheaded performance has made him excel all his predecessors .

Any historical assessment of Japan 's war of aggression has been subjected to rigorous historical examination by every successive postwar Japanese government , but their annual statements marking the " Day the War Ended " ( they dare not call it the " Day of Surrender " ) have all been disappointing .  Disregarding strong domestic and foreign opposition , Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi insisted on paying his respects at Yasukuni Shrine , where a large group of war criminals is enshrined .  
The Japanese prime minister 's brazenly paying his respects shows that Yakusuni Shrine is a symbol of aggressive war ; it has overtones of a public and official provocation , and indicates contempt for the people of those countries which suffered from that aggression .  It recalls for those people the pain they suffered , so is it not something natural , a matter of course , for the Chinese people to express their strong indignation and firm opposition ?  
According to information , the Chinese Foreign Ministry explicitly stated in its reply to the Japanese Foreign Ministry that in deliberately paying respects to the Yasukuni Shrine which enshrines the tablets of 14 class-A war criminals of World War II , Prime Minister Koizumi has damaged the political basis of Sino-Japanese relations and hurt the feelings of the Chinese people and the peoples of Asian countries that fell victim , and this is bound to affect the healthy development of Sino-Japanese relations .  
It goes without saying that our foreign policy should be a steady one , and we should conceal our true features and gain mastery by striking only after the enemy has struck .  However , Japanese authorities have behaved with unbearable insolence for a long time ; their unfriendly attitude towards China has been clearly showed by a series of incidents , such as the Diaoyutai incident , the incident of altering textbooks , the incident of paying homage to Yasukuni Shrine , and the incident of imposing punitive tariffs on imported Chinese farm products .

Today , Chinese Ambassador to Japan Wu Dawei said here that in the past few months of this year , with the occurrence of such events as the historical issue , Lee Teng-hui 's visit to Japan , and the Japanese prime minister 's action of paying homage at Yasukuni Shrine , Sino-Japanese relations have been bogged down in the most difficult condition over the past 30 years since the normalization of diplomatic relations .  The Japanese side should create favorable conditions for getting Sino-Japanese relations out of this predicament by resolving the current existing problems .

Despite the low completion rate for advance sales of new housing , the fact that the land was often bought at a time when prices were booming , together with high advertising costs , have meant that construction companies have only limited capacity to absorb the development costs themselves .

On the other hand , Lenin , who had finished off the age of tsarist feudalism , stressed the need to industrialize and modernize the nation .
