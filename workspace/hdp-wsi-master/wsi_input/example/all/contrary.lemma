Insightful people in Taiwan held that though the new leader of Taiwan authorities verbally expressed his " goodwill intentions " and " sincerity " in improving the cross-strait relations , his actual deeds ran contrary to what he said .  Presently , he wants to hinder even the exchanges between cities on both sides of the strait .  This man-made obstacle will make the cross-strait relations more strained .  
On the contrary , the gap between weaponry based on new scientific principles and old-fashioned weaponry can not be readily bridged with tactics .  Examples are the gaps between hot weapons and cold weapons , between mechanized weapons and human power , between nuclear weapons and conventional weapons .  These days developed countries are researching and developing " new concept weapons " such as kinetic energy weapons , directional energy weapons , meteorological weapons , subsonic weapons , and artificial intelligence weapons , which may lead to a breakthrough in the nature of weaponry .  
On the contrary , we must be clearly aware that once the economically and culturally backward nations establish a capitalist system , they must spend appropriately long time to complete the tasks that must be completed during the capitalist stage : socialization , commercialization , industrialization , and modernization of production , as well as the establishing of appropriate democratic legal system , science and culture .  
He said , international law applies to every country , and this US plane we are speaking of is not an ordinary plane but a military reconnaisance plane which entered China 's airspace without permission after colliding with and destroying a Chinese plane due to carrying out maneuvers contrary to regulations over China 's coastal waters , and landed at a Chinese military airfield .  
A vast ocean separates China and the United States . China has never sent a single soldier to areas near the US continent , nor has China dispatched a reconnaissance plane to US coastal areas .  The United States , on the contrary , has never stopped conducting hostile surveillance , probing flights and harassing activities toward China since the founding of New China .  
It has not only failed to make progress in formulating policies or in implementing practical measures for enhancing cross-strait political mutual trust .  On the contrary , it has regressed in this regard .  In particular , let us take as examples some recent events including the " Chin Mei-ling incident , " the " incident of Yoshinori Kobayashi 's entry to Taiwan , " and the " incident where Japan revised a textbook on historic facts on Japan 's invasion into China . "  
Practice has proven that firmly embracing the ideal of working hard for the motherland and people and persistently and dauntlessly working to translate this ideal into reality will not limit the development of the individuality and ability of outstanding talented people ; on the contrary , it is only in these fiery struggles that the ability and wisdom of outstanding talented people can be fully displayed and can the value of their life be expressed still more fully .  
On the contrary , the sustained economic growth on the mainland side and the booming cross-strait economic exchanges just played a more and more important positive role for Taiwan 's economy .  This not only guaranteed that Taiwan still maintained a foreign trade surplus and thus alleviated the difficulties that the Taiwan enterprises were facing , but also provided a broader room for maneuver and development prospects for Taiwan 's economic development .  
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi commented today at a press conference that China is carrying out a peaceful policy of foreign diplomacy in which independence and initiative is maintained .  This will aid in protecting and advancing peace and stability in the Asia Pacific region as well as in the world .  No matter how military planning is strengthened , advocacy of containment of China is contrary to the historical trend and is entirely wrong and will get nowhere .  
It is worth pondering that after this multinational joint exercise , this naval task fleet of India did not leave the region , but on the contrary continued to stay there .  Moreover , it was joined by one more " Kilo " class submarine and several antisubmarine patrol aircrafts to continue their unilateral naval exercise .  
However , contrary to what the author expects , it is entirely legal and logical for the National People 's Congress to interpret laws in accordance with the principle of " one country , two systems " .  Further , the interpretation of the law has helped safeguard the dignity of the Basic Law and laid a foundation for Hong Kong 's long-term prosperity and stability .  It is entirely in the fundamental interests of the Hong Kong people , and it has won the understanding and support of the vast number of Hong Kong citizens .  
It is not a special case .  With the many favorable conditions , the Chen Shui-bian administration has speedily entered a stage of good diplomatic relations with the United States . On the contrary , the new politically powerful in Washington had a poor opinion of the Chinese Communists , which greatly deteriorated further after the Chinese Communists ' handling of the military plane collision incident caused ill feelings among the American people .  
But contrary to his expectations , the " green " regime got off to a rough start , the chaotic political and economic situation has worsened on the island , the stalemate in the cross-strait relations continues , and the popular anger boils over .  
So far India has not decided to shrink back from its nuclear weapons development program ; on the contrary it is stepping up the development of various missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads , including ICBM 's with a range exceeding 20,000 km , and three months ago it carried out a major nuclear war exercise close to the India-Pakistan border ; why then has the United States decided to lift the sanctions at this time ?  
On the contrary , since the new economies , which have knowledge as the basis , are mainly grouped in the developed countries , and the people of most developing countries are still living in poverty without any chances at all of getting in contact with the revolution of information technology , the differences between the south and north have been further expanded instead due to the " digital gap , " which has thrown a gloom over the prospects of common development and prosperity for the mankind .  
More than five months have passed since the Democratic Progressive Party [ DPP ] became the ruling party in Taiwan . During this period , Taiwan 's situation has not improved as the general public expected .  On the contrary , there have been continuous political storms , chaos , and contradictions , as well as a growing feeling of insecurity among the public .  
While their own countries carry out massive activities aimed at prohibiting smoking , developed countries on the contrary encourage sales of tobacco products to developing countries .  The majority of developed countries not only have not kept to their own promises regarding increasing official developmental support in international society , but have attempted through technological monopoly and trade barriers to conduct a " new economic colonialism " .  
Chang Lin-cheng said : Though this shows that the Taiwan side has unilaterally legalized the existing small-amount trade between the two shores , which had been previously banned by its law , and has lifted to a limited extent its ban on the Kinmen and Matsu residents visiting the mainland , since it has refused to make a positive response to one China , the introduction of the " mini three links " may on the contrary create more obstacles and will thus have only a limited impact on any substantial improvement in relations between the two shores .  
It has been learned that , despite that poverty relief and development efforts made over the last few years have noticeably alleviated the poverty and backward situations in the vast poor rural areas and noticeably increased incomes of the poverty population , the average income of the poorest population in rural areas is still less than one third of the per capita income of peasants of the country .  Besides , the gap of incomes of peasants in developed and poor regions not only has not narrowed , but , on the contrary , has further widened .  
However , it is now unrealistic to place our hope on the WTO because mainland China is in no hurry to join the WTO . On the contrary , the Chinese communist authorities believe that so long as they can maintain an annual inflow of $ 40 billion of foreign capital into mainland China , they can attain the same results in improving the economy and state-owned undertakings as joining the WTO .  
It has been proven by facts in the entire process , chief executive Tung Chee-hwa , the SAR government , central institutions stationed in Hong Kong , and people from all circles have never doubted and criticized the nature and activities of other religions .  On the contrary , they have recommended upright religious activities as positive forces for stabilizing the society and guiding people toward benevolence .  
There is no regression in the service standard and , to the contrary , a response time indicator is generally accepted as more effective and comprehensive for measuring the performance of the EAS . I believe that there has been general understanding and acceptance of the revised indicator by the public .  
Where corroboration is required as a matter of law , a lack of corroborative evidence must lead mechanically to an acquittal even where the judge or the jury is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of the alleged crime .  This is considered to be a glaring anomaly and contrary to the interests of justice .  
This followed the common law principle that particular acts of a government that is not recognised either in law or in fact may , in the interests of justice and common sense and for the preservation of law and order , be recognized by domestic courts where private rights are concerned and where no consideration of public policy to the contrary has to prevail .  
To do so would set a very bad precedent by giving a special group preferential treatment , contrary to the cardinal principle that all men ( and women ) are equal before the law .  
On the contrary , developments in both areas can go hand-in-hand .  Both areas depend on our future lawyers being adequately educated and trained ; both areas depend upon our civil justice system being cost-effective and speedy ; and both areas depend upon our ability to identify and meet the needs of those with legal problems .  
On the contrary , thanks to the relentless efforts of the industry to improve product design and comfort , you have successfully transformed the image of optical products from a mere sight-corrective tool to an exquisite accessory reflecting personal taste and character . 
In the contrary , the Han emperors had in the early years of their governance implemented the " Rehabilitation Policy " , which resulted in a more stable society with wealth and strength .  These account for the restful and graceful facial expressions of the Han pottery figurines as well as the huge number of pottery animals , which demonstrate the affluence and social stability of the period .  
These are the verses I have found . Pondering them , we can find that Christian love is pure , bright , just , selfless , hateless and for all . On the contrary , anything that is biased , narrow , distorted and bears a specific purpose can not be considered " love " but rather will contaminate the word of God .  
I have had quite a long experience of arguing with members of the Chinese Communist Party and I have found that , if one concentrates on the points where Communist doctrine or practice is inconsistent or clearly contrary to well-established evidence , one can almost always produce a situation in which the Communist either persists in some assertion that everyone except a fully committed Communist would judge to be ridiculous , or takes refuge in complete philosophical relativism ( proletarian truth is different from bourgeois truth ) , or else refuses to continue the discussion .  
This is especially true for mid-level officials , who do n't get so much ' value-added ' - - chauffeured automobiles , high social status , power , a sense of accomplishment - - as high level officials . On the contrary , they have complex duties , low pay , and slow advancement . It is easy for business to steal away these mid-level officials who have vast administrative experience , " says one civil servant . In recent years , the turnover rate for this type of person has been quite high .  
But one can discover from many popular stories that the Jade Emperor is buy no means beyond anger and fury , completely impersonal and objective , or able to see all the fine points clearly . On the contrary , He is quite " human , " and often becomes angry so that the common people suffer through no fault of their own , or listens to rumors and half-truths .  
The amount and scale of temple festivals today and the number of believers taking part is very unlike what happened during the " modern scientism " of the 1960s and ' 70s , when people expected there to be no trace of them in the metropolis and hardly anything in the countryside . On the contrary , pilgrimages , foundation services , festivals and religious activities to ward off disasters have all been encouraged by officials and public alike , so that there is now a flourishing in both cities and villages .  
Today it is seen as backward . You could say this is a product of a capitalist society . But the price will be paid for by future generations who will rely on the earth for survival , " says Chang Kuo-lung . He does not believe that a simple , conservationist lifestyle is necessarily uninteresting or dry ; on the contrary it is full of the fun of creativity .  
But placing so much importance on marriage and the family has n't made modern Chinese more willing to cleave together as couples . On the contrary , with the change from an agricultural society to a commercial and industrial one with an international orientation , more and more couples are living apart for the sake of pursuing a better future .  
On the contrary , installation is very volatile and highly inviting of the audience 's active participation . Plus it is very hard to preserve , and thus it is inherently anti-market and by nature given to protest . He selected the form since it suits his sarcastic and critical works of art .  
However , the Japanese scholar " did not have any commercial interest , but on the contrary brought respect and affirmation to aboriginal culture . But the fact that Enigma earned huge profits from record sales-the album with Difag 's singing on it sold five million copies-has caused virtually everyone in Taiwan to think only in terms of what profit there is to be had . This seems to reflect some special feature of Taiwan 's culture , " Ming says , his voice tinged with regret . Return to innocence  
One noteworthy , and rather unexpected thing , is that this clean-room air which is " 1000 times more pure than outside air " - in which even filtrable viruses find it hard to survive-does not make one feel refreshed and energetic . On the contrary , after a short period you feel stifled and dizzy . You really have to admire those women production line workers who spend 12 hours a day in there .  
" There does not need to be a conflict between the needs of urban development and historical building preservation , " says Tseng Shu-cheng , an assistant professor in Tamkang University 's Architecture Department . Preserving historic buildings or spaces is not intended to stop time and halt development . On the contrary it is intended to use their historical essence to make a new and creative use of the space .  
On the contrary : birdwatchers have discovered that ever since accumulating soil from construction work upstream and an ever-decreasing flow of water caused sandbars to appear in the stretch of river near Huachiang Bridge , more and more ducks and geese have gathered there , and they have gradually extended their domain upriver to the Kuangfu , Huachung , Chungcheng and Yungfu bridges , so that the goose and duck park has had to be enlarged and its name changed .  
In its appraisal of the color of cats ' fur , China 's classic reference on cats , Xiang Mao Jing , offers no such indication . On the contrary , cats whose backs are black ( or brown ) and whose abdomens , legs , feet and claws are all white it considers the quintessential form of multicolored cat , giving them the sobriquet " ebony clouds covering the snow . "  
He illustrates his point by mentioning Straight Ahead with a Rifle , in which Dong continually returns to the image of a bombing range , communicating how it feels to live next to such a place . It is a factor always on the minds of local residents . This repeated use of a single image is a very unusual technique , but it does n't bore the viewer ; on the contrary , it leaves one feeling that he has gained new insight into the subject of the documentary .  
" Passage for myself and several of the students on board a junk loaded with planks was engaged from Tamsui . We set out , but the winds were contrary , and after two days of tossing and seasickness we rounded the northern point of Formosa and ran into Kim-pau-li , on the northeast . Here we got water and food , for our supply was well-nigh exhausted .  
A returnee to Taiwan after 20 years in Spain , where she rose to international fame as a flamenco dancer , Flor de Loto sports a deep tan and gregarious personality . There is a flamboyance about her , but not an intimidating sort . On the contrary , she has a way of putting absolutely everyone at ease , as if she were the nice lady next door . With ease and grace , she manages to combine the hearty , unrestrained spirit of the Spaniards with the traditional virtues of the Chinese .  
In the innermost chamber is the surgical theater , divided into three sections-hernia , cleft lip and palate , and tumors . While family members patiently wait under the tent outside , inside , where air conditioners ( hastily set up only a couple of days before ) clank away noisily , patients in various stages of surgery are laid out on ten provisional operating tables made up out of desks and chairs . Amazingly , their expressions do not show the least fear ; on the contrary , they appear to be looking forward to treatment .  
Chang Tien-fu says : " Schools chose to focus on transforming themselves and in the process forgot their own position and character . " Although many schools did change their name , their relative position in the educational hierarchy was not improved . On the contrary , having reorganized themselves many technical and vocational schools began to turn their back on earlier achievements . In other words , they stopped focusing on the need for practical work and started to emphasize theory and R &amp; D .  
" A truly professional art therapist will not show off her ability to interpret paintings .

Although most people think that physicians who perform abortions encourage abortions or benefit from them , according to Jeng Cherng-jye most obstetric gynecologists do not urge their patients to get an abortion . On the contrary , most physicians urge pregnant underage women , be they married or not , to give serious consideration to carrying their pregnancy to term . Sometimes , a doctor will actually succeed in getting through to his patient on an emotional level and persuading her to keep the child .  
The book explains in vivid terms various styles , like " high-tech , " " deconstructionist , " " minimalist , " and " post-modern . " The practiced and critical eye of the traveler prevents Chen Shih-liang from being swallowed up in insignificance beneath the towering works of the great architects-quite the contrary . He frequently offers earnest critiques of what he sees . Although the failings of the great architects may be minute , they can not escape the pen of Chen Shih-liang .

First , France has not announced its intention to continue its nuclear testing indefinitely ; on the contrary , we have stated our decision to complete it by engaging in a final series limited to a few tests , which will be concluded before 31 May 1996 .

None the less , reality has shown that these aspirations have not been met and that , on the contrary , changes in the international system created conditions that have unleashed forces that had long been held in check , giving rise to new conflicts and rivalries , not only as a result of resurgent nationalism but also as a cause of serious ethnic , religious , social and cultural differences which have jeopardized peace and international security . 
In this connection , in the opinion of the Ukrainian delegation , international cooperation between the United Nations and the new democracies should not die out , but , on the contrary , should be reinforced , bearing in mind that every positive process , unfortunately , also has negative consequences , which must be neutralized and eliminated ; this can be achieved only through the united efforts of representatives of the world community . 
Nuclear tests pose a potential risk to the health and security of the people of coastal States and to their natural resources and environment , contrary to the precautionary principle on international environmental law contained in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development , the Convention on Biological Diversity , the United Nations Framework Convention on Climatic Change , the Treaty of Maastricht and other international instruments .  
First , it would be very useful if each committee responsible for ensuring the implementation of an international human rights instrument , in cooperation with the Centre for Human Rights and the necessary experts , issued a document specifying , on the one hand , those legislative norms which were contrary to the provisions of the instrument in question and , on the other hand , those which were most conducive to its implementation at the national level .

The Greek attitude and its reluctance in cooperation against terrorism ; the illegal Greek claim for 10-mile airspace beyond its 6-mile territorial sea , which is not recognized by the international community ; and the militarization of certain islands in the Aegean contrary to its contractual obligations under international treaties that placed these islands under demilitarized status are outstanding examples of the ostensible Greek claim for respect for international law and legality .  
As a result , the same activity can be performed in different countries by a public corporation or by the private sector ; it can be considered as a public utility or public service subject to extensive public regulation or , on the contrary , left to pure market economy , only subject ( for example ) to the law of competition and public order .  
To the contrary , recent developments in eastern and western Bosnia and Herzegovina offer ample proof that the Belgrade Government and , specifically Mr .

Although true , Mr . van der Stoel 's words are intentionally misleading in that he claims to feel sorry for the children of Iraq , yet at the same time fails to request the lifting of the embargo against them ; on the contrary , he holds the Government of Iraq responsible for such human suffering on account of its non-implementation of Security Council resolutions 706 ( 1991 ) and 712 ( 1991 ) , despite being satisfied as to their political objectives .  
Consequently , the United States could not accept the Human Rights Committee 's views in its General Comment No . 24 ( 52 ) , since it did not believe that the classic rules on reservations were inadequate for human rights treaties .

when ratifying a convention , a State declared under the terms of its reservation that it was bound by the instrument only in so far as it was not contrary to domestic legislation , then in real terms it had not accepted any international obligation , and the appearance of its name on the list of signatories was irrelevant .  
Furthermore , the continuing measures against Cuba , contrary to the letter and spirit of General Assembly resolutions , are most definitely incompatible with the position and stature of a permanent member of the Security Council In the absence of any move by the United States to repeal the relevant Act , Member States may be justified in concluding that the United States has adopted a negative attitude by ignoring the will and expressed wishes of members of the General Assembly .

The remaining operative part calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to the objectives and to relevant existing treaties , and urges them to keep the Conference on Disarmament informed of the progress of any bilateral or multilateral negotiations relating to the prevention of such arms races so as to facilitate its work .  
The systematic efforts to annihilate 20-million Iraqis were contrary to all international instruments , which must lead the international community to consider economic sanctions as an internationally prohibited weapon of mass destruction , since the application of sanctions against Iraq had caused significantly more victims than the atomic bomb at Hiroshima , which was ironic in the extreme given the degree of interest currently evinced in human rights . 
In conclusion , since the Security Council has already decided that the UNCRO mandate in Croatia has ended effective 15 January , and thereby the United Nations mandate on the Prevlaka peninsula as well , and in view of the above-mentioned fact that the Prevlaka peninsula is an integral part of Croatia , the Croatian Government considers any and all requests designed and aimed at creating legal uncertainty and ambiguity regarding the status of parts of sovereign Croatian territory to be unacceptable , and contrary to the interest of peace and security in the region .

As an official and categorical denial of the shameless accusations that have been made against the Burundian army , which certain circles have all too gratuitously and tendentiously blamed for the recent deaths in Cibitoke province , the Minister for Foreign Affairs states that , on the contrary , the forces of order have rescued many other citizens threatened by armed terrorist groups that have infiltrated into Burundi from abroad .

On the contrary , it means adjusting these lofty aims to the new realities of a multifaceted world and also making the Organization no matter how different its separate parts are the mainstream of human development , where the economic well-being of people brings to an end age-old ills such as starvation and epidemic diseases , as well as huge environmental threats , and which helps to achieve multilateral understanding between those participating in this development .

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi commented today at a press conference that China is carrying out a peaceful policy of foreign diplomacy in which independence and initiative is maintained .  This will aid in protecting and advancing peace and stability in the Asia Pacific region as well as in the world .  No matter how military planning is strengthened , advocacy of containment of China is contrary to the historical trend and is entirely wrong and will get nowhere .  
It is worth pondering that after this multinational joint exercise , this naval task fleet of India did not leave the region , but on the contrary continued to stay there .  Moreover , it was joined by one more " Kilo " class submarine and several antisubmarine patrol aircrafts to continue their unilateral naval exercise .  
However , contrary to what the author expects , it is entirely legal and logical for the National People 's Congress to interpret laws in accordance with the principle of " one country , two systems " .  Further , the interpretation of the law has helped safeguard the dignity of the Basic Law and laid a foundation for Hong Kong 's long-term prosperity and stability .  It is entirely in the fundamental interests of the Hong Kong people , and it has won the understanding and support of the vast number of Hong Kong citizens .  
It is not a special case .  With the many favorable conditions , the Chen Shui-bian administration has speedily entered a stage of good diplomatic relations with the United States . On the contrary , the new politically powerful in Washington had a poor opinion of the Chinese Communists , which greatly deteriorated further after the Chinese Communists ' handling of the military plane collision incident caused ill feelings among the American people .  
But contrary to his expectations , the " green " regime got off to a rough start , the chaotic political and economic situation has worsened on the island , the stalemate in the cross-strait relations continues , and the popular anger boils over .  
So far India has not decided to shrink back from its nuclear weapons development program ; on the contrary it is stepping up the development of various missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads , including ICBM 's with a range exceeding 20,000 km , and three months ago it carried out a major nuclear war exercise close to the India-Pakistan border ; why then has the United States decided to lift the sanctions at this time ?  
On the contrary , since the new economies , which have knowledge as the basis , are mainly grouped in the developed countries , and the people of most developing countries are still living in poverty without any chances at all of getting in contact with the revolution of information technology , the differences between the south and north have been further expanded instead due to the " digital gap , " which has thrown a gloom over the prospects of common development and prosperity for the mankind .  
More than five months have passed since the Democratic Progressive Party [ DPP ] became the ruling party in Taiwan . During this period , Taiwan 's situation has not improved as the general public expected .  On the contrary , there have been continuous political storms , chaos , and contradictions , as well as a growing feeling of insecurity among the public .  
While their own countries carry out massive activities aimed at prohibiting smoking , developed countries on the contrary encourage sales of tobacco products to developing countries .  The majority of developed countries not only have not kept to their own promises regarding increasing official developmental support in international society , but have attempted through technological monopoly and trade barriers to conduct a " new economic colonialism " .  
Chang Lin-cheng said : Though this shows that the Taiwan side has unilaterally legalized the existing small-amount trade between the two shores , which had been previously banned by its law , and has lifted to a limited extent its ban on the Kinmen and Matsu residents visiting the mainland , since it has refused to make a positive response to one China , the introduction of the " mini three links " may on the contrary create more obstacles and will thus have only a limited impact on any substantial improvement in relations between the two shores .  
It has been learned that , despite that poverty relief and development efforts made over the last few years have noticeably alleviated the poverty and backward situations in the vast poor rural areas and noticeably increased incomes of the poverty population , the average income of the poorest population in rural areas is still less than one third of the per capita income of peasants of the country .  Besides , the gap of incomes of peasants in developed and poor regions not only has not narrowed , but , on the contrary , has further widened .  
However , it is now unrealistic to place our hope on the WTO because mainland China is in no hurry to join the WTO . On the contrary , the Chinese communist authorities believe that so long as they can maintain an annual inflow of $ 40 billion of foreign capital into mainland China , they can attain the same results in improving the economy and state-owned undertakings as joining the WTO .  
It has been proven by facts in the entire process , chief executive Tung Chee-hwa , the SAR government , central institutions stationed in Hong Kong , and people from all circles have never doubted and criticized the nature and activities of other religions .  On the contrary , they have recommended upright religious activities as positive forces for stabilizing the society and guiding people toward benevolence .  
There is no regression in the service standard and , to the contrary , a response time indicator is generally accepted as more effective and comprehensive for measuring the performance of the EAS . I believe that there has been general understanding and acceptance of the revised indicator by the public .  
Where corroboration is required as a matter of law , a lack of corroborative evidence must lead mechanically to an acquittal even where the judge or the jury is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of the alleged crime .  This is considered to be a glaring anomaly and contrary to the interests of justice .  
This followed the common law principle that particular acts of a government that is not recognised either in law or in fact may , in the interests of justice and common sense and for the preservation of law and order , be recognized by domestic courts where private rights are concerned and where no consideration of public policy to the contrary has to prevail .  
To do so would set a very bad precedent by giving a special group preferential treatment , contrary to the cardinal principle that all men ( and women ) are equal before the law .  
On the contrary , developments in both areas can go hand-in-hand .  Both areas depend on our future lawyers being adequately educated and trained ; both areas depend upon our civil justice system being cost-effective and speedy ; and both areas depend upon our ability to identify and meet the needs of those with legal problems .  
On the contrary , thanks to the relentless efforts of the industry to improve product design and comfort , you have successfully transformed the image of optical products from a mere sight-corrective tool to an exquisite accessory reflecting personal taste and character . 
In the contrary , the Han emperors had in the early years of their governance implemented the " Rehabilitation Policy " , which resulted in a more stable society with wealth and strength .  These account for the restful and graceful facial expressions of the Han pottery figurines as well as the huge number of pottery animals , which demonstrate the affluence and social stability of the period .  
These are the verses I have found . Pondering them , we can find that Christian love is pure , bright , just , selfless , hateless and for all . On the contrary , anything that is biased , narrow , distorted and bears a specific purpose can not be considered " love " but rather will contaminate the word of God .  
I have had quite a long experience of arguing with members of the Chinese Communist Party and I have found that , if one concentrates on the points where Communist doctrine or practice is inconsistent or clearly contrary to well-established evidence , one can almost always produce a situation in which the Communist either persists in some assertion that everyone except a fully committed Communist would judge to be ridiculous , or takes refuge in complete philosophical relativism ( proletarian truth is different from bourgeois truth ) , or else refuses to continue the discussion .  
This is especially true for mid-level officials , who do n't get so much ' value-added ' - - chauffeured automobiles , high social status , power , a sense of accomplishment - - as high level officials . On the contrary , they have complex duties , low pay , and slow advancement . It is easy for business to steal away these mid-level officials who have vast administrative experience , " says one civil servant . In recent years , the turnover rate for this type of person has been quite high .  
But one can discover from many popular stories that the Jade Emperor is buy no means beyond anger and fury , completely impersonal and objective , or able to see all the fine points clearly . On the contrary , He is quite " human , " and often becomes angry so that the common people suffer through no fault of their own , or listens to rumors and half-truths .  
The amount and scale of temple festivals today and the number of believers taking part is very unlike what happened during the " modern scientism " of the 1960s and ' 70s , when people expected there to be no trace of them in the metropolis and hardly anything in the countryside . On the contrary , pilgrimages , foundation services , festivals and religious activities to ward off disasters have all been encouraged by officials and public alike , so that there is now a flourishing in both cities and villages .  
Today it is seen as backward . You could say this is a product of a capitalist society . But the price will be paid for by future generations who will rely on the earth for survival , " says Chang Kuo-lung . He does not believe that a simple , conservationist lifestyle is necessarily uninteresting or dry ; on the contrary it is full of the fun of creativity .  
But placing so much importance on marriage and the family has n't made modern Chinese more willing to cleave together as couples . On the contrary , with the change from an agricultural society to a commercial and industrial one with an international orientation , more and more couples are living apart for the sake of pursuing a better future .  
On the contrary , installation is very volatile and highly inviting of the audience 's active participation . Plus it is very hard to preserve , and thus it is inherently anti-market and by nature given to protest . He selected the form since it suits his sarcastic and critical works of art .  
However , the Japanese scholar " did not have any commercial interest , but on the contrary brought respect and affirmation to aboriginal culture . But the fact that Enigma earned huge profits from record sales-the album with Difag 's singing on it sold five million copies-has caused virtually everyone in Taiwan to think only in terms of what profit there is to be had . This seems to reflect some special feature of Taiwan 's culture , " Ming says , his voice tinged with regret . Return to innocence  
One noteworthy , and rather unexpected thing , is that this clean-room air which is " 1000 times more pure than outside air " - in which even filtrable viruses find it hard to survive-does not make one feel refreshed and energetic . On the contrary , after a short period you feel stifled and dizzy . You really have to admire those women production line workers who spend 12 hours a day in there .  
" There does not need to be a conflict between the needs of urban development and historical building preservation , " says Tseng Shu-cheng , an assistant professor in Tamkang University 's Architecture Department . Preserving historic buildings or spaces is not intended to stop time and halt development . On the contrary it is intended to use their historical essence to make a new and creative use of the space .  
On the contrary : birdwatchers have discovered that ever since accumulating soil from construction work upstream and an ever-decreasing flow of water caused sandbars to appear in the stretch of river near Huachiang Bridge , more and more ducks and geese have gathered there , and they have gradually extended their domain upriver to the Kuangfu , Huachung , Chungcheng and Yungfu bridges , so that the goose and duck park has had to be enlarged and its name changed .  
In its appraisal of the color of cats ' fur , China 's classic reference on cats , Xiang Mao Jing , offers no such indication . On the contrary , cats whose backs are black ( or brown ) and whose abdomens , legs , feet and claws are all white it considers the quintessential form of multicolored cat , giving them the sobriquet " ebony clouds covering the snow . "  
He illustrates his point by mentioning Straight Ahead with a Rifle , in which Dong continually returns to the image of a bombing range , communicating how it feels to live next to such a place . It is a factor always on the minds of local residents . This repeated use of a single image is a very unusual technique , but it does n't bore the viewer ; on the contrary , it leaves one feeling that he has gained new insight into the subject of the documentary .  
" Passage for myself and several of the students on board a junk loaded with planks was engaged from Tamsui . We set out , but the winds were contrary , and after two days of tossing and seasickness we rounded the northern point of Formosa and ran into Kim-pau-li , on the northeast . Here we got water and food , for our supply was well-nigh exhausted .  
A returnee to Taiwan after 20 years in Spain , where she rose to international fame as a flamenco dancer , Flor de Loto sports a deep tan and gregarious personality . There is a flamboyance about her , but not an intimidating sort . On the contrary , she has a way of putting absolutely everyone at ease , as if she were the nice lady next door . With ease and grace , she manages to combine the hearty , unrestrained spirit of the Spaniards with the traditional virtues of the Chinese .  
In the innermost chamber is the surgical theater , divided into three sections-hernia , cleft lip and palate , and tumors . While family members patiently wait under the tent outside , inside , where air conditioners ( hastily set up only a couple of days before ) clank away noisily , patients in various stages of surgery are laid out on ten provisional operating tables made up out of desks and chairs . Amazingly , their expressions do not show the least fear ; on the contrary , they appear to be looking forward to treatment .  
Chang Tien-fu says : " Schools chose to focus on transforming themselves and in the process forgot their own position and character . " Although many schools did change their name , their relative position in the educational hierarchy was not improved . On the contrary , having reorganized themselves many technical and vocational schools began to turn their back on earlier achievements . In other words , they stopped focusing on the need for practical work and started to emphasize theory and R &amp; D .  
" A truly professional art therapist will not show off her ability to interpret paintings .

Although most people think that physicians who perform abortions encourage abortions or benefit from them , according to Jeng Cherng-jye most obstetric gynecologists do not urge their patients to get an abortion .

Sometimes , a doctor will actually succeed in getting through to his patient on an emotional level and persuading her to keep the child .  
The book explains in vivid terms various styles , like " high-tech , " " deconstructionist , " " minimalist , " and " post-modern .

None the less , reality has shown that these aspirations have not been met and that , on the contrary , changes in the international system created conditions that have unleashed forces that had long been held in check , giving rise to new conflicts and rivalries , not only as a result of resurgent nationalism but also as a cause of serious ethnic , religious , social and cultural differences which have jeopardized peace and international security . 
In this connection , in the opinion of the Ukrainian delegation , international cooperation between the United Nations and the new democracies should not die out , but , on the contrary , should be reinforced , bearing in mind that every positive process , unfortunately , also has negative consequences , which must be neutralized and eliminated ; this can be achieved only through the united efforts of representatives of the world community . 
Nuclear tests pose a potential risk to the health and security of the people of coastal States and to their natural resources and environment , contrary to the precautionary principle on international environmental law contained in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development , the Convention on Biological Diversity , the United Nations Framework Convention on Climatic Change , the Treaty of Maastricht and other international instruments .  
First , it would be very useful if each committee responsible for ensuring the implementation of an international human rights instrument , in cooperation with the Centre for Human Rights and the necessary experts , issued a document specifying , on the one hand , those legislative norms which were contrary to the provisions of the instrument in question and , on the other hand , those which were most conducive to its implementation at the national level .

The Greek attitude and its reluctance in cooperation against terrorism ; the illegal Greek claim for 10-mile airspace beyond its 6-mile territorial sea , which is not recognized by the international community ; and the militarization of certain islands in the Aegean contrary to its contractual obligations under international treaties that placed these islands under demilitarized status are outstanding examples of the ostensible Greek claim for respect for international law and legality .  
As a result , the same activity can be performed in different countries by a public corporation or by the private sector ; it can be considered as a public utility or public service subject to extensive public regulation or , on the contrary , left to pure market economy , only subject ( for example ) to the law of competition and public order .  
To the contrary , recent developments in eastern and western Bosnia and Herzegovina offer ample proof that the Belgrade Government and , specifically Mr .

Although true , Mr . van der Stoel 's words are intentionally misleading in that he claims to feel sorry for the children of Iraq , yet at the same time fails to request the lifting of the embargo against them ; on the contrary , he holds the Government of Iraq responsible for such human suffering on account of its non-implementation of Security Council resolutions 706 ( 1991 ) and 712 ( 1991 ) , despite being satisfied as to their political objectives .  
Consequently , the United States could not accept the Human Rights Committee 's views in its General Comment No . 24 ( 52 ) , since it did not believe that the classic rules on reservations were inadequate for human rights treaties .

when ratifying a convention , a State declared under the terms of its reservation that it was bound by the instrument only in so far as it was not contrary to domestic legislation , then in real terms it had not accepted any international obligation , and the appearance of its name on the list of signatories was irrelevant .  
Furthermore , the continuing measures against Cuba , contrary to the letter and spirit of General Assembly resolutions , are most definitely incompatible with the position and stature of a permanent member of the Security Council In the absence of any move by the United States to repeal the relevant Act , Member States may be justified in concluding that the United States has adopted a negative attitude by ignoring the will and expressed wishes of members of the General Assembly .

The systematic efforts to annihilate 20-million Iraqis were contrary to all international instruments , which must lead the international community to consider economic sanctions as an internationally prohibited weapon of mass destruction , since the application of sanctions against Iraq had caused significantly more victims than the atomic bomb at Hiroshima , which was ironic in the extreme given the degree of interest currently evinced in human rights . 
In conclusion , since the Security Council has already decided that the UNCRO mandate in Croatia has ended effective 15 January , and thereby the United Nations mandate on the Prevlaka peninsula as well , and in view of the above-mentioned fact that the Prevlaka peninsula is an integral part of Croatia , the Croatian Government considers any and all requests designed and aimed at creating legal uncertainty and ambiguity regarding the status of parts of sovereign Croatian territory to be unacceptable , and contrary to the interest of peace and security in the region .

As an official and categorical denial of the shameless accusations that have been made against the Burundian army , which certain circles have all too gratuitously and tendentiously blamed for the recent deaths in Cibitoke province , the Minister for Foreign Affairs states that , on the contrary , the forces of order have rescued many other citizens threatened by armed terrorist groups that have infiltrated into Burundi from abroad .
