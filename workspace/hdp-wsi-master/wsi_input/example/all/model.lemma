In the course of studying the " three represents , " party committees of the armed forces and armed police units at and above the army level felt that party committees and leading cadres not only should act as model practitioners of the " three represents " but they should also shoulder the responsibility of guiding the party committees of subordinate military units in meeting the " three represents " requirements and advance party building in the military units in an all-round way .  
As the new model aircraft had very powerful mechanical functions and was installed with video camera and laser display equipment , it was capable of appraising the tactics and firepower response of the artillery unit .  It also had the function of simulated missile launch , thereby creating conditions for raising the quality of training in " three attacks and three defenses . "  
The ossified " Soviet model " took the experience and development course of socialist construction under a special historical condition as something absolute and sacred without regard to the need to make continuous innovations inside socialism across different stages of development .  As a result , this seriously hindered the development of productivity , made it impossible to improve the people 's living conditions over a long time , and went against the requirements determined by the nature of socialism .

Before joining the war in Korea , our armed forces already had artillery , armored , and engineering units , but such units accounted for an extremely small portion of the military as a whole , with the force structure model based on the dominant position of infantry forces remaining unchanged .  
In the course of economic development , we have long been accustomed to the traditional model of economic growth , so that the situation of blind investment , redundant construction , " large and all-embracing " , and " small and self-contained " was very serious , and many industries had enormous excess production capacity .  
Xiamen has risen and turned into one of the 10 big and medium-sized cities with strongest comprehensive economic strength and one of the eight big model cities in the field of environmental protection in the whole country .  Xiamen has been awarded one honorary title after another , including " national sanitation city , " " national garden city , " " China 's outstanding tourism city , " and so on , and has maintained coordinated economic , social , and environmental development as well .  
To impose one 's own favored undiversified model on others can only artificially destroy social and political ecological equilibrium , a course of action which is neither rational not feasible .  
Practice has proven that since the actual foundations on which individual countries establish socialism vary , their methods of gaining political power vary , and their ethnic and national conditions vary , there can be no single model of development that fits every country .

We have discussed , from a theoretical and historical perspective , the great importance of social and intellectual differentiation resulting from China 's economic reform led by the political authorities to China 's future political democratization ; however , it must also be pointed out that the inherent defects in a post-totalitarian system and reformist model have also created a series of difficulties .

The fact that radar antenna occupies huge space , radar includes many parts , and radar equipment has limited functions will bring problems to the task of mobilization and transfer .  In order to overcome the problems , the unit has organized a small group for technological innovation , and fully applied more than 20 innovation achievements to this model of radar .  As a result , the unit has resolved such problems as below-standard transmitting power of the radar launcher and weak signals received by the receiver .

Countries differ in many ways , in their social systems , historical backgrounds , cultural heritage , economic development , standard of living , religious beliefs , and values .  Therefore , it is not possible to expect all countries to develop after a single model or system .  
The Taiwan independent forces have attempted to use the two-Korea model to solve the cross-strait relations .  Some of them spread the " two-state theory " and others spread the theory that the " status of Taiwan has not yet been determined . "  The 1.2 billion Chinese people resolutely oppose their plot to split our national territory and sovereignty .  
A strong and stable China is the firm guarantee for a continued success of the principle of " one country , two systems , " whereas Hong Kong as a successful example will make increasing influence on the solution to the Taiwan issue according to the principle of " peaceful reunification based on the model of one country , two system . "  
As the social systems , historical backgrounds , cultural traditions , economic levels , living quality , religious beliefs , senses of value , and so on of all countries in the world differ in thousands of ways and it is impossible to ask every country to indiscriminately copy one model and one system .  
They should extensively carry out the guiding spirit of the national rally for naming double-support model cities ( and counties ) .

They should further consolidate and develop the great situation of the unity between the military and the government as well as the unity between the military units and the people .  
In the last eight years since the two countries established diplomatic relations , in despite of an ever changing international situation , China and Belarus have always trusted , understood , and supported each other because of the following main reasons : First , the two sides obey the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and other international norms , respect the other 's choice of the road and model of development in the light of its own national condition , and do not intervene in the other 's internal affairs .

Although the United States calls ethnic Chinese a " model ethnic minority , " quite a number of whites still look down on ethnic Chinese in their heart of hearts .  Faced with the outstanding achievements of ethnic Chinese in the academic , science and technological , and industrial and commercial fields , they have suffered from a psychological unbalance , and the subconscious attitude of repressing and discriminating against ethnic Chinese has been waiting for the right time to break out .  
Despite the changing international environment , the two countries have understood and supported each other since the establishment of diplomatic relations more than 40 years ago .  The two countries have had fruitful cooperation in political , economic , military , and other areas , setting a model for South-South cooperation among developing countries .

At the last aviation fair held also in Zhuhai , the Chinese-made Flying Midge surface-to-air guided missile caused a sensation .  Its improved model is not on display .  It has been learned that the greatest changes are in the improvement of its navigation and aiming systems and in its addition of another infrared tracking system to the radar truck [ sentence as published ] .  
In another development , the Chinese put on display for the first time an advanced guided missile whose name remains unknown .

At present , financial departments at all levels should foster the idea of managing the public finance in a conscientious way and change their financial management model from the old tradition of laying more weight on distribution than on management , more weight on examination and approval than on supervision , and more weight on microeconomy than on macroeconomy to the practice of intensifying macroeconomic regulation and control , macroscopic management , and financial supervision .

He urged the new Bush administration to make vigorous efforts to get both sides of the strait to resume talks so as to avoid the potential crisis that might arise from suspended cross-strait interactions .  
Thus , in order to achieve the strategic target for the new century , Hubei can not adopt the " strategy of following others " in its choice of development model .  Instead , it must adopt a strategy of developing by leaps and bounds .  What this means is that in the process of industrialization , it must persist in using an information-based economy to boost industrialization , fully bring into play its advantage in having a late start , and rely on technological leaps to boost leaps in social productivity from a high starting point .  
He said that since the two countries established diplomatic relations 45 years ago , the friendly cooperative relationship that has been established on the basis of mutual respect , equality , and mutual benefit has made long strides and that the Sino-Syrian relations , having withstood historical upheavals , have become a model of unity and cooperation between the developing countries .

In that case , what do such marks and placings really represent ? In addition , newspaper opinion polls often do n't follow social science principles . Things like sampling procedure , model size , content of the questions and margin of error are vital indicators when deciding whether a poll is trustworthy . But polls can be distorted by neglecting certain aspects , either by cutting them out altogether or by burying them away in a brief comment near the end of the article .  
A new peak is only reached after years of economic growth when the shares of quoted companies have really reached that value ; or else , as in the case of Japan this last time , when share prices are sustained by an inflow of hot money on the international market . " Between its initial establishment and reaching full maturity , any stock market must pass through the phases of manipulation and market fragility , " Frank Yeh observes on the basis of the normal market development model .  
But unless some major revisions are made to this promising star of tomorrow - - so you can fold it like an umbrella and store it away when not in use - - the electric car will provide no solution for traffic jams and parking hassles . Going to work electronically : Therefore , some people are casting aside the model of thinking wherein motion necessarily involves people , vehicles and roads to look for a substitute for vehicles .  
Alliance case study number five - - high definition television ( HDTV ) . The palmtop alliance is built on existing technology , to be used in specially designated products . The cost is extremely low ( the whole project has run up only an NT $ 20 million tab ) , and there have been no major technological break-throughs to speak of . In comparison , the " high definition television technology development plan , " a five-year , NT $ 3 billion project set up by the government , requires a completely different alliance model .  
We saw old women who were living proof of the traditional model , mature women caught at the crossroads of tradition and contemporary society , and women who have crossed the historical divide and are actively creating their own space for the " new generation . "  
In a photograph , a concrete model animal , of a kind which can be seen anywhere in Taiwan , is pictured in the most natural , realistic style ; it looks so false - - and yet so real .  
Chang Chin-un , a designer and consultant for several large hospitals and president of the Hospital Association of the Republic of China , points out a direction which is concrete . Group-practice clinics should be established to draw in patients with a stronger line-up of physicians and advanced equipment , as well as striking up a cooperative relationship with large hospitals , further strengthening a bi lateral referral system . He also suggests establishing " half-open system hospitals , " along the American model , which specialize in offering equipment and locales for use by licensed physicians .  
The scale model in the ancestral altar roomAfter several consultations , the house which Huang Sheng-yuan designed combines a traditional sloping-roofed courtyard dwelling with a two-storey concrete house in the square box style . " This echoes the style of existing residences in the Lanyang area . " To meet Mother Yu 's requirement of easy access on all sides , the house has a total of seven outside doorways .  
But after some discussion it was concluded that the reason Mother Yu had this " false impression " was perhaps because the model was so small and was not colored , combined with the visual effect of looking down on it from above When Huang Sheng-yuan remade the model at one-fiftieth scale , and , in accordance with Mother Yu 's wishes , pasted up spring couplets in the right places and painted the walls red where they were to be built of bricks , Mother Yu was finally more able to accept the house 's appearance .  
This pragmatic approach may be the model for the future presence in Hong Kong of the countries which maintain diplomatic ties with Taipei . The loss of a major diplomatic partner is a blow to the ROC 's hopes for " dual recognition , " and also reveals the cruel and unsentimental nature of international politics .  
Two years ago on Women 's Day , several hundred wives , mothers and grandmothers left their homes and their kitchens to take to the streets . They carried with them a revised copy of the Family Law provisions of the civil code which they delivered to the Legislative Yuan . They were rejecting having their praises sung yet again as " all-sacrificing model women , " and instead were representing the rights and interests of " three million injured Taiwanese women crying in the dark . "  
Another reason for the PRC 's low-key attitude is that the current model for direct shipping does not have the " domestic " shipping label which PRC officials regard as ideal , meaning that the flagging issue has not been completely resolved . Further , the PRC 's Taiwan policy-making bodies and its Ministry of Transportation and Communications , which is responsible for handling this issue , are at odds with one another .  
A soil researcher , Professor Wu says that the red clay widely distributed in tropical countries is usually barren , and it is difficult to coax a good crop from it . However , Chuang Yu-long has overcome this problem , and could rightly be called a model of success in organic farming . When he has the time , in the future Wu plans to write down Chuang 's unique farming experiences .  
There is a stereotype that says that Central American workers are less dedicated , or at least less malleable , and it is true that strikes often occur . But Chen , who began working at a garment factory doing the most basic work at the age of 17 , has a keen eye for worker quality . He uses different incentives in different places to improve the efficiency of his workers . His high level of productivity is now a model for other garment producers in Nicaragua .  
A : For a long time now , our government has been plainly telling the Communist Chinese authorities that our final goal is a free , democratic , and prosperous reunified China . But before reunification , the ROC must continue to seek survival and development in international society . This is the basic right of survival of the people living in the Taiwan area . And this can create a model for the Chinese on both sides to pursue a better future way of life and system .  
Starting in 1984 , this group was able to harness the collective energies of government and industry to promote and complete more than 10 public works projects , and through corporate self-awareness and community supervision were able to gradually improve the quality of the environment . After 10 years of hard work , the city had completely remade itself and become a model of urban renaissance .  
Huang Chien-yi also reveals that in a future textbook edition which is still at the experimental stage , historical and mythical exemplary personages have almost disappeared , and the few remaining representative persons are all taken from daily life . The old style of teaching loyalty and filial piety by expecting children to model themselves on saints and sages is to disappear .  
The US Federal Drug Administration has accepted the use of herbal drugs , and Medicare and Medicaid now cover it . " While many of its methods still defy explanation , Chinese medicine does provide an entirely different model for modern medicine and thus is a priceless asset , " Chen says . " Yet the scientific method as used in Western medicine shows clearly how individual medicines work and provides Chinese medicine with effective new techniques . "  
The idea of an imaginary miniature world become real is one that seemingly everyone has entertained at one time or another , and it has been represented in art in many ways . China has its bonsai , miniature rock gardens , calligraphy on grains of rice , and jewelry boxes . The West has its eggshell sculpture and model cars . And what could be more representative of miniaturized art than the dollhouses that are so popular in Europe , North America , and Japan ?  
Perhaps these are mere technical problems . Even more important however , is that , in this model in which one exam decided a person 's entire life , the instinct for choice was lost . The prerequisite of choice is thinking , and in an environment where we accepted everything as given , we unwittingly abandoned our ability to think !  
Though Lang witnessed war and brutality in one of China 's most turbulent and tragic eras , these experiences never effaced the love that the traditional Chinese literati always held for the beautiful landscape . Thus , with a product of Western technology in hand , he embarked on an effort-conditioned by his own cultural learning and by the model of the Chinese landscape painting-to create composite images of different landscapes separated by space and time .  
The Western-led model of environmental protection that focused on rescuing a few big creatures , like the panda , rhino , and whale , has failed . Despite huge sums of money spent on these causes , as in the case of the Formosan landlocked salmon , these species remain threatened . Meanwhile , micro-organisms of far greater importance to mankind are given the cold shoulder .  
Moreover , with relations across the Taiwan Strait unstable and the two sides of the strait still seeking a mutually acceptable model for interaction , extreme positions calling for rapid reunification or independence are not beneficial to the vast majority of Taiwan 's people .  
Any performer who got a bit careless might find himself labeled a " saboteur of the model operas . " They took to singing in the very high-pitched falsetto of Peking Opera , while the costumes and makeup were based on Yue Opera . As a result , gezai xi gradually lost its distinctive character , and came more and more to resemble Peking and Yue Opera . There was also the problem of tailoring southern opera for a northern audience .  
Chang Chi-luan , whom the historian Wu Hsiang-hsiang referred to as " the model Chinese newspaper man , " always held onto the spirit of a traditional Chinese man of letters . When he put out the Takungpao , he proclaimed his famous " four ' nevers ' " : " Never serve any political faction , never sell out , never be selfish , and never become blind to the truth . " Strengthening the character of Chinese newspapermen , he created a model of journalistic ethics .  
When teachers produced by these colleges entered campuses , they taught children based on the same model , and , using the uniform textbooks edited and printed by the national government , implemented a system of rote memorization of dead facts . Taiwan education became increasingly rigidified , headed for a dead end .  
With this concept they came up with their 500 cc ice beverage model , which they have since rolled out across all of Taiwan . Their stainless-steel counters , automatic sealers , in-store preparation for take-out , and prominent giant cup sign have changed the face of ice drink retailing in Taiwan .  
Once , Wei came to the main island of Taiwan , and saw that people had nailed coins into the heads of chickens and pigs carved out of wood . He had a sudden inspiration to use NT $ 1 coins to produce a genuine " money turtle . " At that time Wei , already an accomplished model boat maker , created with his own hands a vivid and dazzling money turtle out of stacked coins . As you may have guessed , it was an immediate hit , and temples competed to purchase it .  
Take a model of a fishing boat : The hull is white , with reflective beads attached as fishing lamps . Underneath the boat , transparent light blue acrylic has been cut to simulate ocean waves , and white cotton serves as the foam at the crests of the waves .  
Because of Yu 's clear status as a " friendly critic " of the government , the ruling party always treated Yu with great respect . Yu long held a seat on the KMT 's Central Standing Committee . Many years ago while visiting family in mainland China , Yu was received as a VIP by Jiang Zemin . During their meeting , Yu forcefully expressed his position on the inappropriateness of the " one country , two systems " model , recommending instead a " China confederation " model .  
The recent spread of bad economic times around the globe , like the spread of a plague , can not be divorced from the changing information-era economic model . The dramatic increase in information-intensive industry , and changes in manpower demand , costs , price and market structure all influence the global economic stage .  
And so he often placed his classmates against barren backgrounds for photographs . He sometimes painted half of a model 's face white or had him lie on a rock with a plastic bag over his head and a black cape over his shoulders . Chang tried to make his subjects look alienated and isolated , as if life had given up on them .  
But " back when traditional filial piety was the only model for intergenerational relations , there were also many problems , " argues Chuang Hui-chiu . In the past , everyone held an idealized version of home . When social change exposed problems to the light of day , people started talking about them . This discussion is healthy .  
Each occasion of volunteer clinical services sponsored by Tzu Chi starts with sowing seeds at the local level . Assistance is not limited to medical care , moreover , but uses an integrated-team model that allows Tzu Chi operations to set down local roots , so that people can become independent and help themselves .  
After local people began to gather here in large numbers , the " Fangliao Good Life Society " was established to promote artistic and literary events in the community . A resounding success , in 1998 the site was voted a national model for the improvement of urban landscapes .  
But it 's a model suitable only to authors willing to demean themselves . As a whole , mainland writers are either concerned with popular urban lit or more focused on their own high personal expectations about their work . Few are candidates to write popular motivational books , let alone take long tours around the country to publicize these books .  
These books are regarded as books " by bad kids , for bad kids . " There are numerous young writers on the mainland now attempting to gain a name for themselves by following Han Han 's model . Han himself is rich and famous . Like Taiwan singing idol Lin Chih-ying , Han is fond of racing expensive cars .  
Unexpected was the fact that children very much hoped to live with their elderly parents and conform to the traditional model of filial piety in this regard , while the image they had for themselves in old age was rather untraditional . Future plans for almost half of them tended toward living with their spouses only or living alone ( 43.9% ) , and they also stressed economic independence ( 44.4% ) .  
Scholars of architecture can not bring themselves to write books that appeal to popular taste , while publishers soldier on despite losses , remaining committed to selling what is available . Yet in the uneven balance between the beautiful and the marketplace , some people do produce books that are big sellers . Architectural writer Chen Shih-liang , from his Architecture in Postcard I and Architecture in Postcard II to Hooked on Architectural Travel has produced an excellent model for the marketability of architectural books-and has pioneered a new direction for the genre .  
" Given the inadequate economic scale and lack of material incentives , Taiwan baseball has a tough row to hoe , " says Jackie Shao , an assistant professor in sports science at Taipei Physical Education College . She argues , however , that there is nothing inherently good or bad about any particular path ; rather , this is the model that has evolved by trial and error over many years , and the one most suited to local conditions .  
" Back in the early days , " recalls Lee , " Eslite found itself stuck with huge numbers of foreign-language books in stock . Over time , we refined our business model and learned what we needed to order . We became selective and stopped having to dump books to clear our inventory . "  
The simple absolute ( additive ) model assumes a constant ( dose-related ) excess of induced cancer throughout life , unrelated to the age-dependent spontaneous rate of cancer .  
The simple relative ( multiplicative ) model , assumes that the rate of induced cancers will increase with age as a constant multiple ( dose-related ) of the spontaneous cancer rate .  
The representative of FICSA expressed concern at the rapid change in the New York / Washington costofliving differential and hoped that it did not indicate inherent instability in the model chosen , but represented its sensitivity to real external factors .  
In addition to the external disputes of international organizations , relatively important internal disputes could also arise which did not lend themselves to settlement by reference to the model established by national constitutional or administrative norms .  
Aware that its characteristics are atypical in our region , since its basic goal is to replace a paternalistic , oil-dependent model by an open culture based on work and self-reliance rather than on seeking the understanding of other countries , our Government is proceeding to solve our nation 's problems , which , fortunately , are no match for our diverse and solid economic resources . 
We hope that the Agency will develop more projects that have a direct bearing on improving the quality of life of people in developing countries and that such model projects will provide an impetus to the growth of the peaceful uses of atomic energy .  
The representative and participatory democratic model has been enriched , contributing to overcoming substantial political and social tensions characteristic of the establishment of a state of law and the perfecting of democratic institutions , through economic and social harmonization and the constant search for a political consensus . 
At a time when the international order has lost its regulatory capability and the international community lacks the frames of reference that could help guide its action , it is up to the United Nations to regulate inter-State relations , to promote a stable and equitable order and to foster a model that would be acceptable to all .  
Reaffirms the importance of creating a new model of regional security based on a reasonable balance of forces , the pre-eminence of civil authority , the elimination of extreme poverty , the promotion of sustainable development , the protection of the environment and the eradication of violence , corruption , terrorism and trafficking in drugs and arms , a commitment made at the fifteenth meeting of Central American Presidents ;  
In reply to the concern expressed by members regarding the neo-liberal economic model and as to whether action directed towards the prevention and reduction of its negative effects on women was planned or being taken , she informed the Committee that the Government had opted for a model based on growth with fairness . 
Being of the opinion that the establishment of model legislative provisions on procurement of services that are acceptable to States with different legal , social and economic systems contributes to the development of harmonious international economic relations ,  
Recognizing also that there is no single political system or single model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples , and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
In support of the WH initiative and to meet needs identified in the field , a decentralized model of national participants , which includes information on types of teams ready for deployment and functional areas of expertise , could be envisaged as part of an overall roster system maintained by UNV in accordance with the parameters defined by the Department of Humanitarian Affairs and UNV .  
The second model , the information initiative approach , requires a series of basic steps that generate high quality of information , which then can be utilized to identify ( a ) shortcomings in the current human resources capacities of the public sector ; ( b ) types of professional development programmes needed in order to upgrade the quality of the staff ; and ( c ) the knowledge and skills needed for those who will be recruited into the public sector .  
They should be seen not as omnipotent decision makers and providers , as in the traditional management model , but rather as the focal point of a system that will work more effectively if it is expanded through cooperation with outside organizations and if its efficiency is enhanced through decentralization , giving more power to regional and municipal decision makers .  
The task of transforming disaster into constructive development requires a conceptual model different from the traditional , linear model of economic development which assumes a stable administrative system .  
On 18 July 1995 , Nicaragua and 14 other countries addressed a letter ( A / 50 / 145 ) to you in which they requested the inclusion on the agenda of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly of an item relating to the " Consideration of the exceptional situation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the international context , based on the principle of universality and in accordance with the established model of parallel representation of divided countries at the United Nations " .  
A regional model is a coordinated set of activities in the mental health field in a certain geographic area , each programme consists of training in post traumatic therapy and in assisting victims of sexual violence .  
On the other hand , the memorandum of understanding confirmed the principle of respect for and defence of the democratic model contained in the Constitution , obliging each to recognize the popular will expressed through universal suffrage as the sole and exclusive way to maintain and obtain political power . 
The implementation of the international instruments for mutual assistance in criminal matters and of the model treaties on different aspects of bilateral and multilateral cooperation also requires technical assistance , and efforts have been made to provide this , beginning with the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) countries of western Africa . 
That was to include the provision of technical assistance for the development of bilateral and multilateral agreements , based on the United Nations model treaties and other sources , and the drafting of proposed model legislation or agreements on international cooperation in criminal matters , alternative or complementary articles for existing model treaties , and articles for possible model multilateral instruments .  
With regard to item 158 of the draft agenda ( Consideration of the exceptional situation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the international context , based on the principle of universality and in accordance with the established model of parallel representation of divided countries at the United Nations ) , the General Committee decided not to recommend its inclusion . 
Fads in policy design have repeatedly swept across segments of the community of policy advisers , only to be followed by reassessments after unanticipated difficulties have arisen .  No single model of financial development applies equally well in all institutional , cultural and technological situations .  
The Committee welcomes the financial management model of UNOPS by which administrative expenditures are planned and monitored based on a continuous review of the demand for services , as well as the actual programme delivery figures and resulting support income earned ;  
NULLUNFPA is continuing to play a catalytic role in assisting the member States of OIC to develop common projects using the technical cooperation among developing countries ( TCDC ) model of cooperation and strengthening its collaboration with regional institutions and the specialized institutions of OIC in areas of mutual interest .  
In other words , the prospects for lasting peace in El Salvador will call for sustained expansion of its economy based on a new model , expansion which is stimulated by a modern State apparatus guaranteeing fairness of distribution and presupposing all of the transformations wrought through the new democratic institutions .  
Very often the economic model on which structural adjustment programmes are based has made it impossible to overcome the particularly serious social problems of the countries concerned , especially poverty , and in some cases has increased the concentration of wealth , exclusion and marginalization .  
also that there is no single political system or single universal model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
also that there is no single political system or single universal model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples , and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
In this connection , it is appropriate to take into account the diversity of situations prevailing in each country in economic , social , cultural and political terms to appreciate the effectiveness and efficiency of the administrative apparatus and then perhaps to suggest adjustments , since there can not be just one analytical criterion or just one model for good administration .  
In this manner , we are seeking to include Africa in all its aspects on the international agenda , stressing , on the one hand , the scale and economic potential of the African continent , which is deserving of a new approach and a new model for dialogue , and , on the other hand , encouraging African countries to embark on their own process of development based on the promotion of peace , democracy , stability and economic and social progress .  
We must foster and strengthen democratic participation in the political sphere to develop , through a sharing of responsibility between the State , local government and civil society , a model of unified efforts for social development .  
Under no circumstances would it be politically justifiable not to promote corrective measures in all areas or to move the United Nations , at an appropriate way , closer to the effective promotion of an alternative model of development so as to ensure compatibility between the required social changes and the current opening up of our economies .  
Instead of continuing to be caught up in a log-jam with no solution in sight , the concept of permanent regional representation offers a practical alternative and a viable model for the future structure of the Security Council .  
The outstanding features of this new model have been embodied in the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , which is a national and regional strategy to foster a change in personal and social attitudes to ensure the establishment of a model of sustainable development in the political , economic , social , cultural and environmental fields .  
In view of the conclusions of the Colloquium , it had been decided that it would be worthwhile for UNCITRAL to attempt to provide a legislative framework to limit uncertainty in settlement of cross-border insolvency cases , for example , by drawing up model legal provisions and incorporating provisions on access and recognition in the text that it prepared .  The Commission had therefore decided to assign to a working group the task of developing a model legislative framework for judicial cooperation and for access and recognition .  
Supports the concern of the Central American countries to create a new model of regional security based on a reasonable balance of forces and the pre-eminence of civil authority , urges the Central American Security Commission to pursue negotiations for the preparation of the treaty on democratic security in Central America , which constitutes one of the basic aims of the Central American Integration System , and requests the Secretary-General to provide it with the requisite support in a timely manner ;  
One of the purposes of the Central American Integration System , as set forth in the Tegucigalpa Protocol , is to attain the sustainable development of Central America , which presupposes defining a new , unique , comprehensive and indivisible regional security model inspired by the region 's achievements during its intensive process of pacification and integration ;  
The report , which shall be a classified State and regional document , shall be drawn up in accordance with the format and contents determined by the Security Commission and shall include all naval , air , land and public security data needed for the information provided to be complete , transparent and verifiable , solely and exclusively by the organs of the model established in article 47 of this Treaty or by those designated by them ;  
Recognizing also that there is no single political system or single universal model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples , and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
In addition , the Council recommended that the expert group should , in the light of the discussion at the workshop held during the Ninth Congress , explore ways and means of increasing the efficiency of extradition and related mechanisms of international cooperation in criminal matters , having due regard to the rule of law and the protection of human rights , including where appropriate such measures as : ( a ) the provision of technical assistance in the development of bilateral and multilateral agreements based on the United Nations model treaties and other sources ;  
That could include the development of model legislation dealing with matters such as the exercise of jurisdiction over stateless vessels on the high seas ; providing legal authority for stopping , boarding and searching vessels in accordance with article 17 of the 1988 Convention ; and the collection , translation and distribution of relevant legislation , of bilateral and multilateral agreements , and of national and international memoranda of understanding between States , agencies or other entities such as private companies .  
In areas in which public interest is lacking , there is no requirement of effective and beneficial use , and regulations and planning are disregarded and discouraged , experience shows that the role of markets has not been as relevant as is assumed by the theoretical justification of the model ; ( f ) Such areas are already experiencing problems due to the monopolization of water rights and related public services .  
In Viet Nam , a technical cooperation project was recently completed that assisted the Government in completing a new mining law , together with the implementation of regulations and a model mining agreement , and in establishing an administrative framework for the effective operation of the new legislation and the sustainable development of the mining sector .  
It was also noted that further modalities had to be explored in addition to the existing forms of providing technical assistance , including advisory services aimed at drafting new legislation , at adapting model laws , and at developing comprehensive national criminal legislation , training activities , exchange of information , and assistance provided as part of peace-keeping operations .  
However , in the absence of a general framework or model for international cooperation against organized transnational crime and in view of the diversity of legal systems , as well as the variety of the legislative agenda of countries , while desirable , it might not be appropriate and effective at present to effect world cooperation through such an international convention .  
A major objective of this subprogramme is to provide Governments and legislators with universally acceptable , modern and harmonized treaties and model laws in areas where harmonization of commercial law is desirable and feasible , and also to provide commercial parties with non-legislative texts ( e.g . model clauses , rules and legal guides ) to assist them in implementing international transactions . 
It would be an illusion to think that this innovative model of peace-keeping will be able to succeed in Liberia , especially under current conditions , unless sufficient and reliable sources of funding are provided to ECOMOG , and unless the force is strengthened and structured in a manner that will enable it to carry out its tasks as a professional peace-keeping force .  
The agreement represents a model for national reconciliation ; it offers the prospect of building a pluralistic democratic society with high standards in the sphere of the human rights and equal participation of all political and regional forces in the public life of the country .  
These long-term trends characterizing natality and the rate of marriages result in the following consequences : accelerated exchange of generations ; juvenation of grandparenthood ; gradual stabilization of the two-child model ; reduction of sibling relations and closing of sibling ages ; reduction in the number of family-nucleus members ; and horizontal narrowing and vertical broadening of families ( increasing the number of generations to include great-grandparents ) .  
The legality of the occupancy under these conditions does not , however , exempt the Organization from liability to pay adequate compensation or fair rental for privately owned property , while maintaining its right to seek reimbursement from the Government pursuant to article 16 of the model status-of-forces agreement or the principle reflected therein . 
Later , some mercenaries established ties with paramilitary forces of the resistance groups and extreme right-wing groups , while others are said to be operating in other countries ; finally , the company which reportedly serves as a model for companies offering , on the worldwide free market , security services which hitherto were the exclusive responsibility of the internal security forces of each State is registered in South Africa .  
Furthermore , model legislative provisions constituted a less ambitious and more flexible instrument for legal harmonization and might , therefore , be more effective in a field where conventions had so far failed to achieve the desired objectives .  
Convinced that the establishment of a model law facilitating the use of electronic commerce that is acceptable to States with different legal , social and economic systems could contribute significantly to the development of harmonious international economic relations ,  
ICRC had also been developing a model manual for the armed forces on the law of armed conflicts , designed primarily for use by senior officers with tactical responsibilities , and intended as a reference tool for the military commander without legal background .  
Convinced that the establishment of a model law facilitating the use of electronic commerce that is acceptable to States with different legal , social and economic systems could contribute significantly to the development of harmonious international economic relations ,  
This stage is characterized by the formation of a vision of the place and the role of these two organizations within the framework of the comprehensive security model for the twenty-first century currently being developed ; by an intensification of the process of determining innovative ways effectively to implement the principles and obligations set forth in the United Nations Charter and in the basic documents of the OSCE ; and by the search for new forms of cooperation aimed at finding acceptable formulas for the solution of existing regional problems .  
We think that it is necessary to establish the practice of convening regular meetings between the official representatives of these organizations , in order to exchange opinions on a future security model for Europe , to divide their responsibilities properly within the framework of cooperation in the maintenance of international peace and security in the OSCE region , and to elaborate relevant arrangements for coordinating their activities and decision-making .  
The Office has advanced the view that the lead agency model should be retained among the options available to the Secretary-General and the Emergency Relief Coordinator , as a well-tested and flexible formula for ensuring a coordinated response to complex emergencies .  In the view of UNHCR , the lead agency approach has the advantage of avoiding multiple layers of coordination , minimizing cost and avoiding diffused accountability .  
The Bucharest document identified an almost universal recognition that a democratic system of government is the best model to ensure a framework of liberties for lasting solutions to political , economic and social problems .  
In keeping with this view , the Kingdom of Swaziland believes that democracy is not a model to be copied but a goal to be attained , and the pace at which it can proceed is dependent on a variety of political , economic , social and cultural factors proper to the circumstances of a particular culture and society .  
Mongolia agrees with the conclusion that democracy is not a model to be copied or imposed , but rather a goal to be attained , and that the pace at which democratization can proceed is dependent on a variety of political , economic , social and cultural factors proper to the circumstances of a particular culture or society .  
My predecessor , the late President Cheddi Jagan , challenged the international community on many occasions to strive for a new global human order , a development paradigm which would seek simultaneously to achieve optimal economic growth , social equity , poverty reduction and protection of the environment : a development model rooted in a partnership that seeks a better balance within and among States .  
A policy that is geared towards a sustainable development model is conceivable and feasible only through international political intervention an intervention that implies a spirit of cooperation and solidarity among the industrialized countries , the developing countries and the poorest parts of the world . 
A useful model for developing improved partnerships with non-governmental organizations is the PARinAC initiative of UNHCR , which emphasizes the formulation of common principles and goals and the creation of an umbrella framework for action and extensive consultative processes involving non-governmental organizations at the country , regional and international levels .  
I am firmly convinced that with the final fine tuning of these ultimate requirements , this United Nations compensation operation will pass into history as a model of effectiveness , correction and fairness in the delicate and difficult circumstances that led to its creation , and that its work , its rules and its results will guide and shape the outcome of future compensation operations .  
Convinced that the establishment of a model law facilitating the use of electronic commerce that is acceptable to States with different legal , social and economic systems could contribute significantly to the development of harmonious international economic relations ,  
While some support was expressed for modifying the article as suggested , one view was that the article should be deleted because it either stated what applied anyway or because it was not for a ( model ) national statute to deal with matters that concerned the hierarchy among legislative acts , an issue that had constitutional implications .  
Member States are also urged to rely on the existing United Nations model treaties on extradition , mutual assistance in criminal matters , transfer of proceedings and transfer of prisoners , as necessary , as useful tools in improving international cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of cases of illicit trafficking in motor vehicles ;  
The follow-up to the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan has generated both a focused discussion on the issue of organized transnational crime , as well as a wealth of information that would need systematization and analysis to be transformed into practical tools , in particular model legislation , training for law enforcement and advisory assistance for the reform of the criminal justice system .  
In a second step , during the biennium 1997-1998 , it will be necessary to supplement the new version with a number of new provisions , such as detailed packing instructions for individual substances and other provisions normally found in instruments regulating the transport of dangerous goods by one given mode , so that the model regulation can be directly integrated into national or international instruments , without substantial redrafting .  
The Committee requested the secretariat to prepare the tenth revised edition of the Recommendations on the basis of its work in the biennium 1995-1996 and the texts adopted at its nineteenth session and to publish it in the form of a model regulation , annexed to a basic recommendation , in the most effective manner , without delay , in all official languages of the United Nations and not later than the end of 1997 . 
The Committee decided not to take a position at the current time on future policy regarding the cycle of amendments after 2001 , since several experts thought it preferable to reconsider the question in 1998 in the light of the progress made in the global harmonization of systems of classification and labelling of chemicals and in the process of restructuring the various modal instruments concerned on the basis of the model regulations .  
That framework was built on an innovative model that combined central coordination functions , vested in the mandates of the Administrative Committee on Coordination and the newly established Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development , and decentralized allocation of specific responsibilities to relevant organizations of the United Nations system , based on their comparative strengths , to act as task managers for various programme components of Agenda 21 .  
Consultations and coordination with IMF , the World Bank and other relevant specialized organizations , including UNCTAD and the regional commissions ; provision of improved global on-line access to the LINK model and its analytical databases to other bodies of the United Nations system and to Member States ; external relations with a network of non-governmental research institutes through the exchange of background papers and informal consultations .  
However , although the National Civil Police is a professional public security body with the potential to execute modern and democratic public security policies , the model established by the peace accords has not been consolidated without the occurrence of distortions .  
The revised model Contribution Agreement between the United Nations and participating States contributing resources to United Nations peacekeeping operations contained in the annex to the present note has been submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 51 / 218 E of 17 June 1997 , in which , inter alia , the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to ensure that the Contribution Agreement1 fully reflects the reports of the Phase II and III Working Groups of Reimbursement of Contingent-owned Equipment2 and to issue an appropriate corrigendum to the Agreement .  
In addition to that proposal , various other topics were mentioned with respect to which it might be worthwhile to explore the desirability and feasibility of work at the international level ; those were : legislative treatment of cross-border insolvency in the banking and financial services sector , preparation of model agreements or practices for cross-border cooperation in reorganizations of insolvent enterprises , conflict-of-laws solutions in cross-border insolvency cases , and the effects of insolvency proceedings on arbitration agreements and arbitral proceedings .  
The sponsor stated that the purpose of the draft declaration was to develop a comprehensive United Nations document in the format of a declaration containing a set of model basic principles , agreed by all Member States , to guide peacekeeping and other relevant activities of the Organization .  
But I feel that it is appropriate to repeat the principal characteristic of our development model , which is a harmonious and rational complementary relationship between economic and social policies , which for the first time in many years is enabling us to carry out a realistic strategy for sustainable human development .  
During the Security Council debate of 14 August 1997 on the conclusion of Operation Alba , many delegations described it as a model , including the following aspects : unity of intent by the group of countries involved ; decisive , prompt action taken by the Security Council ; a very clear mandate ; definite limits on the time-frame ; rapid planning and deployment ; and in-depth political coordination and consultation among all the parties involved , with none excluded , through an ad hoc steering committee .  
The international community has acknowledged the extraordinary foresight of the authors of the Tlatelolco Treaty , who responded , in an intelligent and creative manner , to the challenge posed by the danger of nuclear proliferation by drafting an international legal instrument that has become an inspiration and a model for other countries wishing to establish nuclear-weapon-free zones .  
The trend to policy convergence towards the open-economy model derives in part from the demonstrated or perceived successes of that model ; it is also driven by global market actors , in particular developed country Governments and international financial and trade institutions that make such policies a condition for access to resources . 
Also in its resolution 5 / 2 , the Commission reaffirmed the importance of continuing to improve and strengthen the operational activities of the Programme , particularly in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , in order to meet the needs of Member States by undertaking advisory services and training programmes ; by carrying out field studies at the regional , subregional , national and local levels , also drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions ; by developing comprehensive strategic plans for technical cooperation ; and by preparing model assistance projects .  
Future activities envisaged by the resource committee on correctional systems and rights include a model seminar using the Manual for other central and eastern European States , the use of selected parts of the Manual in a seminar on prisoners rights for African participants , a joint initiative with Penal Reform International and an international symposium planned for the third quarter of 1997 .  
The South African political climate is fortunately relaxed and there is no persecution of any sector of opinion ; the rules in force are those of a State subject to the rule of law in which institutions such as the Parliament and the judiciary are respected and one of the main concerns is the solidity of the legal edifice , starting with the new Constitution , on the basis of which democracy is a stable system that is appreciated by all and capable of making South Africa a model country .  
States could also usefully rely on the existing United Nations model treaties on extradition , mutual assistance in criminal matters , transfer of proceedings and transfer of prisoners , as necessary , as tools in improving international cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of cases of illicit trafficking in motor vehicles .  
The same year , the annual party congress of FRELIMO decided to adopt the classical Soviet model for the organization and development of the country , and the Government developed close links with communist and socialist countries .  
Furthermore , the recruitment of children into the armed forces of States or by non _ governmental armed groups deprives them of a normal education and their protective family environment ; this has a direct impact on their development and is at variance with the provisions of article 27 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , which states that States parties recognize the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the child 's physical , mental , spiritual , model and social development . 
The approach represents the satellite as a combination of individual elements and positions these to provide maximum protection to the satellite components .  [ 29 ] The PLATFORM model uses a novel element termed SHIELD [ 30 ] which uses genetic algorithms to determine the optimal configuration of a spacecraft based on the encountered environment and design constraints such as thermal and mass balancing .  
Recognizing also that there is no single political system or single universal model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples , and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
UNHCR has advanced the view that the lead agency model should be retained , amongst the options available to the Secretary-General and the Emergency Relief Coordinator ( ERC ) as a well tested and flexible formula for ensuing a coordinated response to complex emergencies .  In the view of UNHCR , the lead agency approach has the advantage of avoiding multiple layers of coordination , minimizing cost and avoiding diffused accountability .  
It was built on an innovative model that combined central coordination functions , vested in ACC and the newly established Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development , and decentralized allocation of specific responsibilities to relevant organizations of the United Nations system , based on their comparative strengths , to act as task managers for various programme components of Agenda 21 .  
Since countries differed in terms of their living conditions , level of development , geographic characteristics and cultural traditions , there could be no uniform standard or model for solving the problems related to human settlements .  
In its resolution 51 / 202 , the Assembly stressed the importance of encouraging national initiatives for social development , including , inter alia , credit for people living in poverty , particularly women , along the model of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh in connection with self-employment and income generation to address the feminization of poverty , and noted with interest the micro credit summit to be held in Washington , D.C . , in February 1997 .  
Recognizing the importance of prevention in order to achieve demand reduction , his Government had developed a strategy which accorded a major role to the family and also involved teachers , voluntary organizations , youth , media , parents , local councils and the leisure industry .  It had adopted a social model rather than a medical model in the treatment and rehabilitation field and was giving priority to community services .  
First , the new and equitable global partnership must be based on equality and recognize that there was no single model for development that was universally applicable ; since the world was characterized by diversity , there must be respect for the economic and social development model chosen by each country and any attempt to use aid as a leverage for exerting political pressure must be abandoned .  
As a result of the major conferences held during the 1990s , the international community had adopted a development model that encompassed objectives in the areas of economic growth , social progress , environmental protection and respect for human rights , which the member countries of MERCOSUR and Bolivia and Chile had decided to make into reality .  
Consultations and coordination with IMF , the World Bank and other relevant specialized organizations , including UNCTAD and the regional commissions ; provision of improved global on-line access to the LINK model and its analytical databases to other bodies of the United Nations system and to Member States ; and external relations with academic , governmental and non-governmental economic research institutes through the exchange of background papers and consultations .  7A . 8 During the biennium the following activities will be undertaken :  
The model is a good example of successful institutional public / private-sector cooperation involving political , social and economic actors for creating an environment conducive to enterprise development .  
In illustration of a " top-down " method for estimating the impact of coercive economic measures , the expert group referred itself to a recent study that attempts to empirically measure the impact of sanctions on bilateral trade flows , particularly on exports by the United States which is the most frequent sender of unilateral sanctions . 36 But the method used , a common one in economics known as the " gravity model " , also captures the impact on the trade of the target country . 
In order to be operational , however , such a global model should comprise large-scale national models that should be designed to cover domestic economy , external sector and supply-side response to external shocks such as coercive economic measures .  
Similarly , most UNDCP technical and financial resources for alternative development in the Andean region no longer support a wide range of isolated model projects , but rather aim at strengthening the institutional capacities of national alternative development entities and their programmes .  
There is a need in international drug control for internationally accepted standards , methodological knowledge and tested and effective model approaches , all of which would contribute to make national and international drug control efforts more efficient and effective .  
They facilitate the spread of an economic model based on the principles of a market economy , while mass advertising and the global media help shape human aspirations and perceptions of social values .  
The International Committee was currently developing a model manual for use by armed forces , which would serve as a reference tool for military commanders to incorporate the norms of humanitarian law into the operational decision-making process .  
AOUIJ said that , although the extent to which political power was shared between women and men in Denmark constituted a model for developing and developed countries alike , economic power was not shared to the same extent .  
The United Nations had a key role to play in the effective coordination and promotion of multilateral efforts and in the collective examination of lessons learned by countries which had applied the sustainable development model .  
The widely prevailing view had been that a model national statute , or set of legislative provisions , would be appropriate to give judicial cooperation a clearer legal framework .  
Given the results of the sampling projects , the Panel determined that a logistic regression model should be applied to all losses in the target group to predict whether specific losses should be classified as for lost or stolen motor vehicles or for repairs .  
It is for this reason that the logistic regression model was developed from , compared to and tested with the electronic claims for which the type of loss had been ascertained before being applied to the set of claims for which the type of loss was unknown .  
As has been observed even in Europe , which is the most advanced along the road to regional consolidation , and where economic and monetary union have become a reality , in the European Union there is no agreement on the rotational model .  
Applying a common statistical technique , known as ordinary least squares regression analysis , to the gravity model allows the researcher to isolate the direct and indirect effects of sanctions on bilateral trade flows while holding other factors constant .  
The mathematical model for the determination of outer limits from straight baselines on the surface of a geodetic reference ellipsoid is computationally more intensive than the method of envelopes of arcs .  
The operating model utilized depends mainly upon the technological sophistication of the local exporter and trade services communities which in turn depends on the general development stage , geographical size and logistical constraints of the local market .  
For that reason , my delegation believes that we must reflect the cultural , social and religious diversity of all countries as we strive to attain realistic and objective social development , without imposing a single model on everyone . 
IFF may wish to consider the success of CGIAR in mobilizing resources and achieving coherence for international efforts to address a shared global agenda in the field of agriculture and food security and to examine the potential of extending that model to address forest research to ensure sustainable forest management and to maintain adequate cover of all types of forest and other wooded lands to meet a variety of current and future human needs .  
In pursuing a comprehensive model of preventive action , UNPREDEP has also been involved in a wide range of programmes related to good governance and the rule of law , strengthening of national capacity and infrastructure , institution - building and human resources development in the governmental and civil sectors .  
Since certain of the subject matters included in the model curriculum as well as the other guidance will become dated in the long term and other subjects and information may need to be added to enable professional accountants to function in a rapidly changing global environment , the model curriculum should be modified as appropriate .  
Since its foundation , the United Nations has developed a broad range of international standards , guidelines and model treaties in crime prevention and criminal justice that represent internationally agreed upon principles of desirable practice based on the rule of law .  
In 1998 , IPU published a model code of conduct for elections13 which acknowledges that a successful and informed electoral process is the joint responsibility of all involved : political parties and candidates ; supporters and voters ; police and security forces ; Governments and public officials ; media and observers .  
The Set also provides for work aimed at achieving common approaches in national policies relating to RBPs compatible with the Set ( article F . 1 ) , and continued work on the elaboration of a model law or laws on RBPs in order to assist developing countries in devising appropriate legislation ( article F . 2 ) ; the OECD instruments do not have such provisions , but the 1998 OECD recommendation recommends convergence in ( as well as effective enforcement of ) laws prohibiting hardcore cartels .  
To this end , the Section will build on existing legal advice and assistance programmes to expand its capacity to facilitate the exchange of relevant information between countries and relevant entities , including through the use of improved modern technology , promote subregional and regional agreements through meetings , memoranda of understanding and by the provision of model agreements , as well as further develop training programmes for judicial and prosecutorial personnel .  
Two high-level regional seminars on the implementation of the PEDA model ; two seminars on the monitoring of the series of globally agreed upon programmes and conventions that flow from the New Agenda for Development of Africa in the 1990s ; two workshops on developing methodologies and guidelines on sustainable agricultural production systems and environmental rehabilitation programmes in Africa ; two seminars on topical issues on food security and sustainable development ;  
Since certain of the subject matters included in the model curriculum as well as the other guidance will become dated in the long term and other subjects and information may need to be added to enable professional accountants to function in a rapidly changing global environment , the model curriculum should be modified as appropriate .  
Contrary to the textbook model of large numbers of investors making careful independent judgements as to profitable opportunities , the capital markets are subject to bouts of herd behaviour that is , investors follow one another without forming their own judgements or expectations about individual economies .  
No firm decision as regards a possible future four-year periodicity of amendments should be taken during the period of alignment of the format of the various legal instruments concerning modal aspects of the transport of dangerous goods on that of the model regulations , and pending decisions regarding the implementation of the globally harmonized system of classification and labelling of chemicals in accordance with Agenda 21 objectives ;  
Recognizing also that there is no single political system or single universal model of democracy equally suited to all nations and their peoples and that political systems and the electoral processes which guarantee the establishment of democratic governments are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
The model selected will constitute a missing element in the range of tools available at present to the astrophysical community for the exploration of the universe , extending from the near solar environment to the far distant phases of evolution , when the basic building blocks of human life were being created .  
Based on the Empretec model , it operates as a regional network and also as a focal point for coordinating existing and new initiatives sponsored by UNDP , other donor agencies , Governments and NGOs aimed at accelerating the growth , expansion and competitiveness of SMEs in Africa and improving the quality of indigenous African entrepreneurship .  
These included the reviews of technical assistance activities submitted to the annual meetings of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Competition Law and Policy ; analytical studies dealing with economic aspects of restrictive business practices ; practical information papers outlining the basic features of restrictive business practices ; commentaries on a possible model law on restrictive business practices ; and the reports of regional seminars organized by UNCTAD .  
Opinions were sought also from experts in restrictive business practices in some developed countries and international organizations regarding the quality of the analytical studies prepared by the UNCTAD secretariat and the commentaries on the model law , which are revised periodically .  
The objective of the meeting was to formulate an environmental studies model to encourage cooperation among States , national scientific institutions , the registered pioneer investors and potential contractors in research on environmental predictions for deep seabed mining .  
My own country of Saint Lucia , and our Eastern Caribbean sister State of Dominica , share special cultural , economic and social ties with the overseas departments of Guadeloupe , Martinique and French Guyana , which represents the political model of integrated status and whose representatives have been present with us here at this Seminar to discuss the intricacies of that political status .  
A model law would also be appropriate when the purpose of the uniform text is , on the one hand , to establish a standard of a modern law in an area where national systems are widely disparate , undeveloped or outdated and , on the other hand , to provide an incentive for a movement towards unification .  
The studies covered such areas as the update of the Trade Policy Simulation econometric model , assistance in positive agenda formulation for developing countries , assessment of the quantitative impact of multilateral trade negotiations on developing countries , implementation of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and the required improvements thereto .  
For this purpose new course materials were developed ( on the analysis of the effects of international trade policies , using a global model ) , existing material was adapted to distance learning techniques and a new project intended for Portuguese-speaking countries is currently being developed in Brazil and Cape Verde and will be extended to other lusophone countries , with the expertise of consultants specialized in human resources development in those countries .  
Recent calls for such reform were born of a political desire to protect human rights in the context of international consensus , rather than through the unilateral imposition of a single cultural model .  
The Seattle Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization and the tenth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , to be held at Bangkok , should reassert the continuing need for differential treatment for developing countries and , because there was no one valid model of behaviour , the need for national autonomy .  
In 1998 , the Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity had recommended that member States should adopt a draft model legislation on access to biological resources at national level ; initiate a process of negotiation among African countries to adopt an African convention on biological diversity ; and develop a common position to safeguard their sovereign rights and the vital interests of local communities .  
Concerned at the uncertain situation of the Centre for International Crime Prevention , her delegation believed that that body should be provided with adequate resources to provide Member States with the technical assistance needed to ensure the rule of law and juvenile justice , and to elaborate model legislation on mutual assistance in criminal matters .  
A striking differentiation in national paths of systemic and developmental change was another surprise and puzzle for the transition doctrine , with its uniform initial strategy and its underlying notion of convergence towards an idealized normative model of the market economy .  
Conflicts will continue as long as the North continues to impose an imperfect and environmentally and economically unsustainable political model that may , perhaps , work in the North a model reached after centuries of absolute monarchies , without free or just elections , without universal suffrage , without women having the vote , without eight-hour work days , without what today is called good governance , though this concept has yet to be defined or agreed on by anybody .  
The IPU has taken up the cause of the large segment of humanity which is not a beneficiary of globalization and , at the recent conference in Berlin , discussed the need to revise the current global financial and economic model , and adopted a resolution which called for special initiatives for underdeveloped , debt-ridden countries .  
One-thousand-six-hundred representatives from 131 countries came to Berlin and cooperated in the drafting of important resolutions on the promotion of international humanitarian law ; on the peaceful coexistence of ethnic , cultural and religious minorities , including migrant populations within a single State ; and on the need to revise the current global financial and economic model .  
At the Third International Conference of New or Restored Democracies on Democracy and Development , held at Bucharest , Romania , two years ago , the representatives of new or restored democracies noted that a democratic system of government is the best model to ensure a framework of liberties for lasting solutions to the political , economic and social problems that our societies face .  
The activities carried out by UNIAPRAVI are intended to meet the new policy and operational requirements of housing sector institutions with a view to enhancing the role of the housing sector as a factor for economic growth and social development.The central , underlying idea in this regard is that the sectoral development model must be compatible with the overall economic development model .  
Therefore , the public sector can play a catalytic role by helping to promote stable and profitable housing finance systems , the introduction of new products that satisfactorily meet demand , the introduction and adoption of banking regulations and , most of all , by promoting a housing policy model that takes the long-term view and that is based on a partnership between the public and private sectors .  
An initial , simple mathematical model , based on a system of just two differential equations , proved suitable to illustrate the mechanism that can ultimately lead to a chain reaction of orbiting debris .  
Commending the work of the Intergovernmental Expert Group Meeting on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters , held at Arlington , Virginia , United States of America , from 23 to 26 February 1998 , to implement in part resolution 52 88 by proposing complementary provisions for the Model Treaty , elements for inclusion in model legislation on mutual assistance in criminal matters , and training and technical assistance for national officials engaged in that field ,  
The discussion contained in this section is illustrative of different options that have been used in domestic legislative measures to set up a regulatory framework for privately financed infrastructure projects , but the Guide does not thereby advocate the establishment of any particular model or administrative structure .  
This relates to the familiar basic questions of whether the concept is correctly defined and meaningful , whether the statistical methodology identified fits the conceptual definitions and model selected , and whether the statistics collected map both reality and the conceptual and methodological foundations .  
The digital satellite ( hot standby ) terminal is needed to replace the existing main analog terrestrial microwave link on Mount Olympus , which is an obsolete model for which maintenance is not cost-effective , and to extend the field assets control system , installed at UNFICYP headquarters in 1997 , to the three Sectors .  
Consultations and coordination with UNCTAD , the regional commissions , IMF and the World Bank ; provision of improved global on-line access to the Project Link model for other bodies of the United Nations system and to Member States ; and external relations with academic , governmental and non-governmental economic research institutes through the exchange of background papers and consultations .  
Because the diversity of national legal traditions and administrative practices made formulating model legislation difficult , his delegation supported the idea that legislative recommendations should be reviewed with the assistance of experts , subject to the participation of all Member States .  
The discussion contained in this section is illustrative of different options that have been used in domestic legislative measures to set up a regulatory framework for privately financed infrastructure projects , but the Guide does not thereby advocate the establishment of any particular model or administrative structure .  
In particular , the strong State would have to be reinvented applying the decentralized model of organization of the modern global corporation , with the local states taking a proactive role in wealth creation across the territory and the national State acting as strategic leader , consensus-builder and broker between the supranational and subnational levels .  
Tectonic and environmental hazard mapping of the northern segment of the Dead Sea fault system using a digital elevation model ( DEM ) from ESA remote sensing satellite ( ERS ) tandem mission synthetic aperture radar ( SAR ) data ( international ) ;  
While there was no single model to resolve the problem of underdevelopment , international cooperation was increasingly necessary for the strengthening and sharing of the human , institutional , economic and technical capacities of States .  
A deterministic analytical model of debris has also been developed in order to allow computational tracking of the movement of individual large observed space objects with given orbital characteristics .  
The dialogue segments launched in 1998 have since been recognized as a unique participatory model for effectively engaging major groups and Governments in a genuine dialogue on specific sustainable development issues .  
He said India , which had over a-billion inhabitants and constituted a real ethnic , linguistic and religious patchwork , had chosen an economic , social and political model which was unique for a former colony with development problems .  
With regard to public and private resources , we are currently developing a mixed welfareState model that gives public support in the form of financial relief and special subsidies and the like to private institutions providing social services .  
In these countries , a headlong rush to adopt a neoliberal model of state functions and responsibilities has frequently left large populations bereft of any effective institutional structure for delivering social protection and social programmes more broadly .  
However , he stressed that there was no single universal model of democracy ; different models shared common features , but the economic , social and cultural circumstances of each country had evolved differently and needed to be taken into account .  
General support had been expressed in favour of the proposal to prepare a harmonized and widely acceptable model legislative regime governing the enforcement of interim measures of protection ordered by arbitral tribunals .  
No less than some thirty conventions , multilateral agreements , uniform model laws or standard rules relating to international commercial dealings or international carriage are involved .  
Turkmenistan has consistently and insistently supported the establishment in international relations of a more humane , equitable and constructive order , opposed all forms of discrimination , the isolation of States on political or ideological grounds and the imposition of various types of economic sanctions , embargoes and the like , and urged respect for the distinctive characteristics of each country and its chosen model of social and political development .  
[ 16 ] Alongside the absence of a commitment to making primary education free , and uncertainties as to which children will be classified as poor ( or ultra-poor ) to merit bursaries , this model also raises concerns about the administrative costs of collecting school fees ( necessarily minuscule in poor rural Zambia ) and administrating the bursaries ( also minuscule ) . 
Its innovative programmes in the field of sustainable development , for example the BIOTRADE initiative and the greenhouse gas emission trading rights programme , could sow the seeds of a future development model featuring economic growth compatible with life , human values and nature .  
The Council inspected the minutes of the nineteenth meeting of the committee on industrial cooperation , where agreement had been reached on the amended model normative regime for industrial organization in the GCC States , and the minutes of the tenth meeting of the committee on scientific and cultural cooperation .  
After consideration of the various views expressed , the Commission decided that the question of the desirability and feasibility of preparing a model law or model legislative provisions on selected issues covered by the Legislative Guide should be considered by the Commission at its current session . 
The training and technical assistance programme carried out by the Secretariat under the mandate given by the Commission , in particular in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , encompasses two main lines of activity : ( a ) information activities aimed at promoting understanding of international commercial law conventions , model laws and other legal texts ; and ( b ) assistance to Member States with commercial law reform and adoption of UNCITRAL texts .  
As to the form that work might take , while a model law might be more desirable from the point of view of completeness and uniformity , to the extent that it would need to reflect certain fundamental guiding principles that would not be common ground to all legal systems , it would represent a significant change from current law in many countries and might , as a result , not meet with sufficient acceptance .  
The licences authorizing the manufacture of small arms and light weapons could contain obligations to maintain comprehensive records subject to national verification and / or audit ( including qualifications of the licensee , the type model , calibre or gauge , and serial number of each completed firearm manufactured and the name of the purchaser and date of sale ) .  
These assumptions related to the prices of the metals contained in polymetallic nodules , the technical feasibility of mining operations and the need to ensure an adequate rate of return on investment in deep seabed mining and resulted in a model which required each mine site to be capable of sustaining an annual commercial production of 3-million tonnes of dry nodules per year over a period of 20 years . 
The Working Group had had three main objectives : to create a generic model for updating reimbursement rates and , subsequently , to update the rates approved by the General Assembly at the beginning of 1996 ; to review and update the existing standards and to seek new fields in which standards could be applied ; and to consider the methodology underlying the calculation of standard rates for reimbursement of troop costs , including ways of producing timely and more representative data .  
It encourages [ political parties to take concrete steps to promote solidarity , tolerance and respect , inter alia by developing [ model ] voluntary code [ s ] of conduct as well as penal measures for members of such parties that engage in statements and actions that could encourage or incite racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and racist sentiment among the public ] ;  
Clearly economic , social , cultural and hence nutritional situations tend to be extremely varied from one country to another and a model law would fail to address the problems experienced by people in their everyday lives and produce legislative solutions ill-adapted to legal and political systems in different countries .  
Furthermore , it was reported that the relevant authorities were revising labour legislation governing the private sector with a view to producing model legislation conducive to the implementation of a policy of economic and social development .  
Based on these principles , a set of new concepts has emerged and started to take form : a new security concept which consists in mutual trust , disarmament and cooperative security ; a new type of international relationship which centres on partnership and non-alignment ; and a new model of regional cooperation in which all countries , large or small , jointly take the initiative in promoting mutually beneficial cooperation .  
In preparing and adopting model legislative provisions on international commercial conciliation , the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law ( UNCITRAL or the Commission ) was mindful that such provisions would be a more effective tool for States modernizing their legislation if accompanied by background and explanatory information .  
In that connection he stressed the need for an open , equitable , predictable , non-discriminatory and rule-based multilateral trading system and expressed the hope that the forthcoming International Conference on Financing for Development would achieve a new consensus model that took into account the needs and priorities of the developing world . 
Austria congratulated the Commission secretariat on organizing a Colloquium on Privately Financed Infrastructure in Vienna in July and endorsed the initiative to establish a Working Group to draft a core model law , because a legislative and regulatory framework for infrastructure projects would send a reassuring signal to all potential private investors and might help to attract private investment for infrastructure projects in developing States .  
The EU had undertaken to modernize the European social model in order to create a dynamic Union of active social States and had set itself the objectives of improving the quality of employment promoting social inclusion , encouraging participation of the social partners in managing change , ensuring the responsibility of enterprises and designing social-protection systems , including reliable retirement schemes .  
While reaffirming its importance for the purpose of making legislators aware of the implications of their policy choices in the field of privately financed infrastructure , the Working Group agreed that the recommendation had an educational rather than a prescriptive character and therefore was not suitable to be transformed into a model legislative provision .  
While that view attracted some support , a concern was that mentioning governmental financial or economic support in a model legislative provision would be tantamount to recommending that support be given by the Government , a result that was considered inappropriate in respect of those Governments whose policy was not to grant any support for privately financed infrastructure projects .  
Against that background , the Working Group held an extensive exchange of views on whether it would be desirable to formulate a model legislative provision that listed essential issues that needed to be addressed in the project agreement .  
Having considered the various views that were expressed , the Working Group agreed that it would be useful to formulate a model legislative provision that listed essential issues that needed to be addressed in the project agreement .  
The view was expressed that model legislative provisions in respect of recommendations 46-48 should be drafted , since the issue of both collection of fees and other payments to be made to the concessionaire was crucial in respect of the financial balance of the project and the very notion of concession agreement and therefore needed to be addressed at a legislative rather than at a contractual level .  
Accordingly , it was agreed that it would be useful to draft a model legislative provision reflecting the recommendation , for the purpose of either eliminating existing legal obstacles or to overcoming possible contrary practices of judicial or administrative authorities .  
It had applied a model unique of its kind based on a number of common policies with regard to asylum and migration providing , inter alia , for criteria for the granting of refugee status , minimum standards regarding reception , minimum standards regarding the status of long-term residents from third countries , and the establishment of analytical and descriptive statistics by the Statistical Office of the European Communities ( EUROSTAT ) .  
Being of the opinion that the establishment of model legislation to facilitate the use of electronic signatures in a manner acceptable to States with different legal , social and economic systems could contribute to the development of harmonious international economic relations ,  
Disseminate internationally agreed materials such as guidelines , legal and technical manuals , minimum standards , proven practices and model legislation to assist legislators and law enforcement and other authorities in the development , adoption and application of effective measures against high-technology and computer-related crime and offenders both in general and in specific cases ;  
Xinhua News Agency , Shenzhen , September 12 ( Reporter : He Guanghuai ) - Shenzhen will adopt the franchise method to attract more capital from the society and overseas to participate in the development and operation of public service industries .  This will include sewage water treatment , living garbage treatment , environment / sanitary service and medical garbage processing etc .  The objective is to accelerate the migration of municipal and public service industries to a market economy model .  The process can also improve the development level of Shenzhen as an international city .  
- - Operate in real accordance with international practices .  Take the internationally prevailing " Free Trade Zone " as a reference objective .  Adopt " inside the territory but outside the customs " as the jurisdiction model .  Gradually realize the free circulation of personnel , goods , funds between the zone and overseas , and realize full coupling with international markets .  
Laiwu City of Shandong Province has established a cell structure cultivation center inside the agricultural new high level technology development and model zones , to introduce and tame improved breeds of nurseries , flowers and vegetables from home and abroad .  
A government official of Shandong Province told this reporter that this province established agricultural new high level technology development and model zones beginning in 1992 , whose main purpose is to accelerate the transformation of agricultural new high level technology achievements through introducing agricultural new high level technologies from home and abroad to carry out development in order to provide effective models for agricultural production and rural economy development to promote the transformation of traditional agriculture into modern agriculture .  
In the agricultural new high level technology development and model zone of Zibo City in the Zhangdian District , plan to establish a agricultural scientific research training institute , a breeding area for improved agricultural varieties , an organic vegetable area , a quality orchard , the fine stock breeding farm , etc .  
Traditional industries are still the principal bodies in Liaoning , which is an old industrial base , and to a great extent , state-owned industries manifest the model of speed and efficiency .

In a war exercise recently held at a certain place in the northwest , a certain division under the Lanzhou Military Region successfully intercepted a simulated cruise missile using an air defense missile of a certain model , accomplishing for the first time a new operational method for striking extreme low-altitude , high-speed targets with one-man portable air defense missiles and receiving favorable comments from senior officers of the general headquarters who were there watching .  
In the course of studying the " three represents , " party committees of the armed forces and armed police units at and above the army level felt that party committees and leading cadres not only should act as model practitioners of the " three represents " but they should also shoulder the responsibility of guiding the party committees of subordinate military units in meeting the " three represents " requirements and advance party building in the military units in an all-round way .  
As the new model aircraft had very powerful mechanical functions and was installed with video camera and laser display equipment , it was capable of appraising the tactics and firepower response of the artillery unit .  It also had the function of simulated missile launch , thereby creating conditions for raising the quality of training in " three attacks and three defenses . "  
The ossified " Soviet model " took the experience and development course of socialist construction under a special historical condition as something absolute and sacred without regard to the need to make continuous innovations inside socialism across different stages of development .  As a result , this seriously hindered the development of productivity , made it impossible to improve the people 's living conditions over a long time , and went against the requirements determined by the nature of socialism .

The great development of the industrial revolution early in this century made the organization of the military move away from the traditional model of having the infantry ( cavalry ) forces as the dominant forces , with the structure of the military coming to encompass such elements as artillery , armed , engineering , air defense , and naval forces ; the availability and quantities of the new services and arms of the military , characterized by high technological contents , became important indicators of the level of modernization and combat effectiveness of the military .  
Before joining the war in Korea , our armed forces already had artillery , armored , and engineering units , but such units accounted for an extremely small portion of the military as a whole , with the force structure model based on the dominant position of infantry forces remaining unchanged .  
In the course of economic development , we have long been accustomed to the traditional model of economic growth , so that the situation of blind investment , redundant construction , " large and all-embracing " , and " small and self-contained " was very serious , and many industries had enormous excess production capacity .  
Xiamen has risen and turned into one of the 10 big and medium-sized cities with strongest comprehensive economic strength and one of the eight big model cities in the field of environmental protection in the whole country .  Xiamen has been awarded one honorary title after another , including " national sanitation city , " " national garden city , " " China 's outstanding tourism city , " and so on , and has maintained coordinated economic , social , and environmental development as well .  
To impose one 's own favored undiversified model on others can only artificially destroy social and political ecological equilibrium , a course of action which is neither rational not feasible .  
Practice has proven that since the actual foundations on which individual countries establish socialism vary , their methods of gaining political power vary , and their ethnic and national conditions vary , there can be no single model of development that fits every country .  
These Interim Procedures have replaced the non-selection resettlement model based on assignment with a model that combines assignment with self-assignment .

We have discussed , from a theoretical and historical perspective , the great importance of social and intellectual differentiation resulting from China 's economic reform led by the political authorities to China 's future political democratization ; however , it must also be pointed out that the inherent defects in a post-totalitarian system and reformist model have also created a series of difficulties .  
Tang Jiaxuan said : Countries in East Asia and Latin American are mostly developing countries .  They have common interests and tasks .  They are all exploring a path of development commensurate with their own national conditions and seeking a regional cooperation model in conformity with their own actual conditions , and striving to usher in a more stable , equal , and fair world .  We have a common wish to use each other 's experience as reference , learn from each other , and cooperate with each other .

"  
Different countries differ not only in their geographical location but also in their level of economic development and historical and cultural traditions .  Thus , they are bound to have different political , economic and social systems , and it is unrealistic to achieve unification using one and the same model .

The fact that radar antenna occupies huge space , radar includes many parts , and radar equipment has limited functions will bring problems to the task of mobilization and transfer .  In order to overcome the problems , the unit has organized a small group for technological innovation , and fully applied more than 20 innovation achievements to this model of radar .  As a result , the unit has resolved such problems as below-standard transmitting power of the radar launcher and weak signals received by the receiver .

Countries differ in many ways , in their social systems , historical backgrounds , cultural heritage , economic development , standard of living , religious beliefs , and values .  Therefore , it is not possible to expect all countries to develop after a single model or system .  
The Taiwan independent forces have attempted to use the two-Korea model to solve the cross-strait relations .  Some of them spread the " two-state theory " and others spread the theory that the " status of Taiwan has not yet been determined . "  The 1.2 billion Chinese people resolutely oppose their plot to split our national territory and sovereignty .  
A strong and stable China is the firm guarantee for a continued success of the principle of " one country , two systems , " whereas Hong Kong as a successful example will make increasing influence on the solution to the Taiwan issue according to the principle of " peaceful reunification based on the model of one country , two system . "  
As the social systems , historical backgrounds , cultural traditions , economic levels , living quality , religious beliefs , senses of value , and so on of all countries in the world differ in thousands of ways and it is impossible to ask every country to indiscriminately copy one model and one system .  
They should extensively carry out the guiding spirit of the national rally for naming double-support model cities ( and counties ) .  In light of promoting the reform , development , and stability of the state as well as army building , they should carry out various activities in a thoroughgoing and effective manner .  They should further consolidate and develop the great situation of the unity between the military and the government as well as the unity between the military units and the people .  
In the last eight years since the two countries established diplomatic relations , in despite of an ever changing international situation , China and Belarus have always trusted , understood , and supported each other because of the following main reasons : First , the two sides obey the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and other international norms , respect the other 's choice of the road and model of development in the light of its own national condition , and do not intervene in the other 's internal affairs .

Although the United States calls ethnic Chinese a " model ethnic minority , " quite a number of whites still look down on ethnic Chinese in their heart of hearts .  Faced with the outstanding achievements of ethnic Chinese in the academic , science and technological , and industrial and commercial fields , they have suffered from a psychological unbalance , and the subconscious attitude of repressing and discriminating against ethnic Chinese has been waiting for the right time to break out .  
Despite the changing international environment , the two countries have understood and supported each other since the establishment of diplomatic relations more than 40 years ago .  The two countries have had fruitful cooperation in political , economic , military , and other areas , setting a model for South-South cooperation among developing countries .

At the last aviation fair held also in Zhuhai , the Chinese-made Flying Midge surface-to-air guided missile caused a sensation .  Its improved model is not on display .  It has been learned that the greatest changes are in the improvement of its navigation and aiming systems and in its addition of another infrared tracking system to the radar truck [ sentence as published ] .  
In another development , the Chinese put on display for the first time an advanced guided missile whose name remains unknown .  Though it was only a model and was attached to the model of the Qianhong 7 aircraft ( namely , the Flying Leopard heavy bomber especially manufactured for its naval air force ) , it has attracted the attention of foreign military experts .

At present , financial departments at all levels should foster the idea of managing the public finance in a conscientious way and change their financial management model from the old tradition of laying more weight on distribution than on management , more weight on examination and approval than on supervision , and more weight on microeconomy than on macroeconomy to the practice of intensifying macroeconomic regulation and control , macroscopic management , and financial supervision .

He urged the new Bush administration to make vigorous efforts to get both sides of the strait to resume talks so as to avoid the potential crisis that might arise from suspended cross-strait interactions .  
Thus , in order to achieve the strategic target for the new century , Hubei can not adopt the " strategy of following others " in its choice of development model .  Instead , it must adopt a strategy of developing by leaps and bounds .  What this means is that in the process of industrialization , it must persist in using an information-based economy to boost industrialization , fully bring into play its advantage in having a late start , and rely on technological leaps to boost leaps in social productivity from a high starting point .

In that case , what do such marks and placings really represent ? In addition , newspaper opinion polls often do n't follow social science principles .

In a photograph , a concrete model animal , of a kind which can be seen anywhere in Taiwan , is pictured in the most natural , realistic style ; it looks so false - - and yet so real .  
Chang Chin-un , a designer and consultant for several large hospitals and president of the Hospital Association of the Republic of China , points out a direction which is concrete . Group-practice clinics should be established to draw in patients with a stronger line-up of physicians and advanced equipment , as well as striking up a cooperative relationship with large hospitals , further strengthening a bi lateral referral system . He also suggests establishing " half-open system hospitals , " along the American model , which specialize in offering equipment and locales for use by licensed physicians .  
The scale model in the ancestral altar roomAfter several consultations , the house which Huang Sheng-yuan designed combines a traditional sloping-roofed courtyard dwelling with a two-storey concrete house in the square box style . " This echoes the style of existing residences in the Lanyang area . " To meet Mother Yu 's requirement of easy access on all sides , the house has a total of seven outside doorways .  
But after some discussion it was concluded that the reason Mother Yu had this " false impression " was perhaps because the model was so small and was not colored , combined with the visual effect of looking down on it from above When Huang Sheng-yuan remade the model at one-fiftieth scale , and , in accordance with Mother Yu 's wishes , pasted up spring couplets in the right places and painted the walls red where they were to be built of bricks , Mother Yu was finally more able to accept the house 's appearance .  
This pragmatic approach may be the model for the future presence in Hong Kong of the countries which maintain diplomatic ties with Taipei . The loss of a major diplomatic partner is a blow to the ROC 's hopes for " dual recognition , " and also reveals the cruel and unsentimental nature of international politics .  
Two years ago on Women 's Day , several hundred wives , mothers and grandmothers left their homes and their kitchens to take to the streets . They carried with them a revised copy of the Family Law provisions of the civil code which they delivered to the Legislative Yuan . They were rejecting having their praises sung yet again as " all-sacrificing model women , " and instead were representing the rights and interests of " three million injured Taiwanese women crying in the dark . "  
Another reason for the PRC 's low-key attitude is that the current model for direct shipping does not have the " domestic " shipping label which PRC officials regard as ideal , meaning that the flagging issue has not been completely resolved . Further , the PRC 's Taiwan policy-making bodies and its Ministry of Transportation and Communications , which is responsible for handling this issue , are at odds with one another .  
A soil researcher , Professor Wu says that the red clay widely distributed in tropical countries is usually barren , and it is difficult to coax a good crop from it . However , Chuang Yu-long has overcome this problem , and could rightly be called a model of success in organic farming . When he has the time , in the future Wu plans to write down Chuang 's unique farming experiences .  
There is a stereotype that says that Central American workers are less dedicated , or at least less malleable , and it is true that strikes often occur . But Chen , who began working at a garment factory doing the most basic work at the age of 17 , has a keen eye for worker quality . He uses different incentives in different places to improve the efficiency of his workers . His high level of productivity is now a model for other garment producers in Nicaragua .  
A : For a long time now , our government has been plainly telling the Communist Chinese authorities that our final goal is a free , democratic , and prosperous reunified China . But before reunification , the ROC must continue to seek survival and development in international society . This is the basic right of survival of the people living in the Taiwan area . And this can create a model for the Chinese on both sides to pursue a better future way of life and system .  
Starting in 1984 , this group was able to harness the collective energies of government and industry to promote and complete more than 10 public works projects , and through corporate self-awareness and community supervision were able to gradually improve the quality of the environment . After 10 years of hard work , the city had completely remade itself and become a model of urban renaissance .  
Huang Chien-yi also reveals that in a future textbook edition which is still at the experimental stage , historical and mythical exemplary personages have almost disappeared , and the few remaining representative persons are all taken from daily life . The old style of teaching loyalty and filial piety by expecting children to model themselves on saints and sages is to disappear .  
The US Federal Drug Administration has accepted the use of herbal drugs , and Medicare and Medicaid now cover it . " While many of its methods still defy explanation , Chinese medicine does provide an entirely different model for modern medicine and thus is a priceless asset , " Chen says . " Yet the scientific method as used in Western medicine shows clearly how individual medicines work and provides Chinese medicine with effective new techniques . "  
The idea of an imaginary miniature world become real is one that seemingly everyone has entertained at one time or another , and it has been represented in art in many ways . China has its bonsai , miniature rock gardens , calligraphy on grains of rice , and jewelry boxes . The West has its eggshell sculpture and model cars . And what could be more representative of miniaturized art than the dollhouses that are so popular in Europe , North America , and Japan ?  
Perhaps these are mere technical problems . Even more important however , is that , in this model in which one exam decided a person 's entire life , the instinct for choice was lost . The prerequisite of choice is thinking , and in an environment where we accepted everything as given , we unwittingly abandoned our ability to think !  
Though Lang witnessed war and brutality in one of China 's most turbulent and tragic eras , these experiences never effaced the love that the traditional Chinese literati always held for the beautiful landscape . Thus , with a product of Western technology in hand , he embarked on an effort-conditioned by his own cultural learning and by the model of the Chinese landscape painting-to create composite images of different landscapes separated by space and time .  
The Western-led model of environmental protection that focused on rescuing a few big creatures , like the panda , rhino , and whale , has failed . Despite huge sums of money spent on these causes , as in the case of the Formosan landlocked salmon , these species remain threatened . Meanwhile , micro-organisms of far greater importance to mankind are given the cold shoulder .  
Moreover , with relations across the Taiwan Strait unstable and the two sides of the strait still seeking a mutually acceptable model for interaction , extreme positions calling for rapid reunification or independence are not beneficial to the vast majority of Taiwan 's people .  
Any performer who got a bit careless might find himself labeled a " saboteur of the model operas . " They took to singing in the very high-pitched falsetto of Peking Opera , while the costumes and makeup were based on Yue Opera . As a result , gezai xi gradually lost its distinctive character , and came more and more to resemble Peking and Yue Opera . There was also the problem of tailoring southern opera for a northern audience .  
Chang Chi-luan , whom the historian Wu Hsiang-hsiang referred to as " the model Chinese newspaper man , " always held onto the spirit of a traditional Chinese man of letters . When he put out the Takungpao , he proclaimed his famous " four ' nevers ' " : " Never serve any political faction , never sell out , never be selfish , and never become blind to the truth . " Strengthening the character of Chinese newspapermen , he created a model of journalistic ethics .  
When teachers produced by these colleges entered campuses , they taught children based on the same model , and , using the uniform textbooks edited and printed by the national government , implemented a system of rote memorization of dead facts . Taiwan education became increasingly rigidified , headed for a dead end .  
With this concept they came up with their 500 cc ice beverage model , which they have since rolled out across all of Taiwan . Their stainless-steel counters , automatic sealers , in-store preparation for take-out , and prominent giant cup sign have changed the face of ice drink retailing in Taiwan .  
Once , Wei came to the main island of Taiwan , and saw that people had nailed coins into the heads of chickens and pigs carved out of wood . He had a sudden inspiration to use NT $ 1 coins to produce a genuine " money turtle . " At that time Wei , already an accomplished model boat maker , created with his own hands a vivid and dazzling money turtle out of stacked coins . As you may have guessed , it was an immediate hit , and temples competed to purchase it .  
Take a model of a fishing boat : The hull is white , with reflective beads attached as fishing lamps . Underneath the boat , transparent light blue acrylic has been cut to simulate ocean waves , and white cotton serves as the foam at the crests of the waves .  
Because of Yu 's clear status as a " friendly critic " of the government , the ruling party always treated Yu with great respect . Yu long held a seat on the KMT 's Central Standing Committee . Many years ago while visiting family in mainland China , Yu was received as a VIP by Jiang Zemin . During their meeting , Yu forcefully expressed his position on the inappropriateness of the " one country , two systems " model , recommending instead a " China confederation " model .  
The recent spread of bad economic times around the globe , like the spread of a plague , can not be divorced from the changing information-era economic model . The dramatic increase in information-intensive industry , and changes in manpower demand , costs , price and market structure all influence the global economic stage .  
And so he often placed his classmates against barren backgrounds for photographs . He sometimes painted half of a model 's face white or had him lie on a rock with a plastic bag over his head and a black cape over his shoulders . Chang tried to make his subjects look alienated and isolated , as if life had given up on them .  
But " back when traditional filial piety was the only model for intergenerational relations , there were also many problems , " argues Chuang Hui-chiu . In the past , everyone held an idealized version of home . When social change exposed problems to the light of day , people started talking about them . This discussion is healthy .  
Each occasion of volunteer clinical services sponsored by Tzu Chi starts with sowing seeds at the local level . Assistance is not limited to medical care , moreover , but uses an integrated-team model that allows Tzu Chi operations to set down local roots , so that people can become independent and help themselves .  
After local people began to gather here in large numbers , the " Fangliao Good Life Society " was established to promote artistic and literary events in the community . A resounding success , in 1998 the site was voted a national model for the improvement of urban landscapes .  
But it 's a model suitable only to authors willing to demean themselves . As a whole , mainland writers are either concerned with popular urban lit or more focused on their own high personal expectations about their work . Few are candidates to write popular motivational books , let alone take long tours around the country to publicize these books .  
These books are regarded as books " by bad kids , for bad kids . " There are numerous young writers on the mainland now attempting to gain a name for themselves by following Han Han 's model . Han himself is rich and famous . Like Taiwan singing idol Lin Chih-ying , Han is fond of racing expensive cars .  
Unexpected was the fact that children very much hoped to live with their elderly parents and conform to the traditional model of filial piety in this regard , while the image they had for themselves in old age was rather untraditional . Future plans for almost half of them tended toward living with their spouses only or living alone ( 43.9% ) , and they also stressed economic independence ( 44.4% ) .  
Scholars of architecture can not bring themselves to write books that appeal to popular taste , while publishers soldier on despite losses , remaining committed to selling what is available . Yet in the uneven balance between the beautiful and the marketplace , some people do produce books that are big sellers . Architectural writer Chen Shih-liang , from his Architecture in Postcard I and Architecture in Postcard II to Hooked on Architectural Travel has produced an excellent model for the marketability of architectural books-and has pioneered a new direction for the genre .  
" Given the inadequate economic scale and lack of material incentives , Taiwan baseball has a tough row to hoe , " says Jackie Shao , an assistant professor in sports science at Taipei Physical Education College . She argues , however , that there is nothing inherently good or bad about any particular path ; rather , this is the model that has evolved by trial and error over many years , and the one most suited to local conditions .  
" Back in the early days , " recalls Lee , " Eslite found itself stuck with huge numbers of foreign-language books in stock . Over time , we refined our business model and learned what we needed to order . We became selective and stopped having to dump books to clear our inventory . "  
The simple absolute ( additive ) model assumes a constant ( dose-related ) excess of induced cancer throughout life , unrelated to the age-dependent spontaneous rate of cancer .  
The simple relative ( multiplicative ) model , assumes that the rate of induced cancers will increase with age as a constant multiple ( dose-related ) of the spontaneous cancer rate .  
The representative of FICSA expressed concern at the rapid change in the New York / Washington costofliving differential and hoped that it did not indicate inherent instability in the model chosen , but represented its sensitivity to real external factors .  
In addition to the external disputes of international organizations , relatively important internal disputes could also arise which did not lend themselves to settlement by reference to the model established by national constitutional or administrative norms .  
Aware that its characteristics are atypical in our region , since its basic goal is to replace a paternalistic , oil-dependent model by an open culture based on work and self-reliance rather than on seeking the understanding of other countries , our Government is proceeding to solve our nation 's problems , which , fortunately , are no match for our diverse and solid economic resources . 
We hope that the Agency will develop more projects that have a direct bearing on improving the quality of life of people in developing countries and that such model projects will provide an impetus to the growth of the peaceful uses of atomic energy .  
The representative and participatory democratic model has been enriched , contributing to overcoming substantial political and social tensions characteristic of the establishment of a state of law and the perfecting of democratic institutions , through economic and social harmonization and the constant search for a political consensus . 
At a time when the international order has lost its regulatory capability and the international community lacks the frames of reference that could help guide its action , it is up to the United Nations to regulate inter-State relations , to promote a stable and equitable order and to foster a model that would be acceptable to all .  
Reaffirms the importance of creating a new model of regional security based on a reasonable balance of forces , the pre-eminence of civil authority , the elimination of extreme poverty , the promotion of sustainable development , the protection of the environment and the eradication of violence , corruption , terrorism and trafficking in drugs and arms , a commitment made at the fifteenth meeting of Central American Presidents ;  
In reply to the concern expressed by members regarding the neo-liberal economic model and as to whether action directed towards the prevention and reduction of its negative effects on women was planned or being taken , she informed the Committee that the Government had opted for a model based on growth with fairness . 
Being of the opinion that the establishment of model legislative provisions on procurement of services that are acceptable to States with different legal , social and economic systems contributes to the development of harmonious international economic relations ,  
Recognizing also that there is no single political system or single model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples , and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
In support of the WH initiative and to meet needs identified in the field , a decentralized model of national participants , which includes information on types of teams ready for deployment and functional areas of expertise , could be envisaged as part of an overall roster system maintained by UNV in accordance with the parameters defined by the Department of Humanitarian Affairs and UNV .  
The second model , the information initiative approach , requires a series of basic steps that generate high quality of information , which then can be utilized to identify ( a ) shortcomings in the current human resources capacities of the public sector ; ( b ) types of professional development programmes needed in order to upgrade the quality of the staff ; and ( c ) the knowledge and skills needed for those who will be recruited into the public sector .  
They should be seen not as omnipotent decision makers and providers , as in the traditional management model , but rather as the focal point of a system that will work more effectively if it is expanded through cooperation with outside organizations and if its efficiency is enhanced through decentralization , giving more power to regional and municipal decision makers .  
The task of transforming disaster into constructive development requires a conceptual model different from the traditional , linear model of economic development which assumes a stable administrative system .  
On 18 July 1995 , Nicaragua and 14 other countries addressed a letter ( A / 50 / 145 ) to you in which they requested the inclusion on the agenda of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly of an item relating to the " Consideration of the exceptional situation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the international context , based on the principle of universality and in accordance with the established model of parallel representation of divided countries at the United Nations " .  
A regional model is a coordinated set of activities in the mental health field in a certain geographic area , each programme consists of training in post traumatic therapy and in assisting victims of sexual violence .  
On the other hand , the memorandum of understanding confirmed the principle of respect for and defence of the democratic model contained in the Constitution , obliging each to recognize the popular will expressed through universal suffrage as the sole and exclusive way to maintain and obtain political power . 
The implementation of the international instruments for mutual assistance in criminal matters and of the model treaties on different aspects of bilateral and multilateral cooperation also requires technical assistance , and efforts have been made to provide this , beginning with the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) countries of western Africa . 
That was to include the provision of technical assistance for the development of bilateral and multilateral agreements , based on the United Nations model treaties and other sources , and the drafting of proposed model legislation or agreements on international cooperation in criminal matters , alternative or complementary articles for existing model treaties , and articles for possible model multilateral instruments .  
With regard to item 158 of the draft agenda ( Consideration of the exceptional situation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the international context , based on the principle of universality and in accordance with the established model of parallel representation of divided countries at the United Nations ) , the General Committee decided not to recommend its inclusion . 
Fads in policy design have repeatedly swept across segments of the community of policy advisers , only to be followed by reassessments after unanticipated difficulties have arisen .  No single model of financial development applies equally well in all institutional , cultural and technological situations .  
The Committee welcomes the financial management model of UNOPS by which administrative expenditures are planned and monitored based on a continuous review of the demand for services , as well as the actual programme delivery figures and resulting support income earned ;  
NULLUNFPA is continuing to play a catalytic role in assisting the member States of OIC to develop common projects using the technical cooperation among developing countries ( TCDC ) model of cooperation and strengthening its collaboration with regional institutions and the specialized institutions of OIC in areas of mutual interest .  
In other words , the prospects for lasting peace in El Salvador will call for sustained expansion of its economy based on a new model , expansion which is stimulated by a modern State apparatus guaranteeing fairness of distribution and presupposing all of the transformations wrought through the new democratic institutions .  
Very often the economic model on which structural adjustment programmes are based has made it impossible to overcome the particularly serious social problems of the countries concerned , especially poverty , and in some cases has increased the concentration of wealth , exclusion and marginalization .  
also that there is no single political system or single universal model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
also that there is no single political system or single universal model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples , and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
In this connection , it is appropriate to take into account the diversity of situations prevailing in each country in economic , social , cultural and political terms to appreciate the effectiveness and efficiency of the administrative apparatus and then perhaps to suggest adjustments , since there can not be just one analytical criterion or just one model for good administration .  
In this manner , we are seeking to include Africa in all its aspects on the international agenda , stressing , on the one hand , the scale and economic potential of the African continent , which is deserving of a new approach and a new model for dialogue , and , on the other hand , encouraging African countries to embark on their own process of development based on the promotion of peace , democracy , stability and economic and social progress .  
We must foster and strengthen democratic participation in the political sphere to develop , through a sharing of responsibility between the State , local government and civil society , a model of unified efforts for social development .  
Under no circumstances would it be politically justifiable not to promote corrective measures in all areas or to move the United Nations , at an appropriate way , closer to the effective promotion of an alternative model of development so as to ensure compatibility between the required social changes and the current opening up of our economies .  
Instead of continuing to be caught up in a log-jam with no solution in sight , the concept of permanent regional representation offers a practical alternative and a viable model for the future structure of the Security Council .  
The outstanding features of this new model have been embodied in the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , which is a national and regional strategy to foster a change in personal and social attitudes to ensure the establishment of a model of sustainable development in the political , economic , social , cultural and environmental fields .  
In view of the conclusions of the Colloquium , it had been decided that it would be worthwhile for UNCITRAL to attempt to provide a legislative framework to limit uncertainty in settlement of cross-border insolvency cases , for example , by drawing up model legal provisions and incorporating provisions on access and recognition in the text that it prepared .  The Commission had therefore decided to assign to a working group the task of developing a model legislative framework for judicial cooperation and for access and recognition .  
Supports the concern of the Central American countries to create a new model of regional security based on a reasonable balance of forces and the pre-eminence of civil authority , urges the Central American Security Commission to pursue negotiations for the preparation of the treaty on democratic security in Central America , which constitutes one of the basic aims of the Central American Integration System , and requests the Secretary-General to provide it with the requisite support in a timely manner ;  
One of the purposes of the Central American Integration System , as set forth in the Tegucigalpa Protocol , is to attain the sustainable development of Central America , which presupposes defining a new , unique , comprehensive and indivisible regional security model inspired by the region 's achievements during its intensive process of pacification and integration ;  
The report , which shall be a classified State and regional document , shall be drawn up in accordance with the format and contents determined by the Security Commission and shall include all naval , air , land and public security data needed for the information provided to be complete , transparent and verifiable , solely and exclusively by the organs of the model established in article 47 of this Treaty or by those designated by them ;  
Recognizing also that there is no single political system or single universal model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples , and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
In addition , the Council recommended that the expert group should , in the light of the discussion at the workshop held during the Ninth Congress , explore ways and means of increasing the efficiency of extradition and related mechanisms of international cooperation in criminal matters , having due regard to the rule of law and the protection of human rights , including where appropriate such measures as : ( a ) the provision of technical assistance in the development of bilateral and multilateral agreements based on the United Nations model treaties and other sources ;  
That could include the development of model legislation dealing with matters such as the exercise of jurisdiction over stateless vessels on the high seas ; providing legal authority for stopping , boarding and searching vessels in accordance with article 17 of the 1988 Convention ; and the collection , translation and distribution of relevant legislation , of bilateral and multilateral agreements , and of national and international memoranda of understanding between States , agencies or other entities such as private companies .  
In areas in which public interest is lacking , there is no requirement of effective and beneficial use , and regulations and planning are disregarded and discouraged , experience shows that the role of markets has not been as relevant as is assumed by the theoretical justification of the model ; ( f ) Such areas are already experiencing problems due to the monopolization of water rights and related public services .  
In Viet Nam , a technical cooperation project was recently completed that assisted the Government in completing a new mining law , together with the implementation of regulations and a model mining agreement , and in establishing an administrative framework for the effective operation of the new legislation and the sustainable development of the mining sector .  
It was also noted that further modalities had to be explored in addition to the existing forms of providing technical assistance , including advisory services aimed at drafting new legislation , at adapting model laws , and at developing comprehensive national criminal legislation , training activities , exchange of information , and assistance provided as part of peace-keeping operations .  
However , in the absence of a general framework or model for international cooperation against organized transnational crime and in view of the diversity of legal systems , as well as the variety of the legislative agenda of countries , while desirable , it might not be appropriate and effective at present to effect world cooperation through such an international convention .  
A major objective of this subprogramme is to provide Governments and legislators with universally acceptable , modern and harmonized treaties and model laws in areas where harmonization of commercial law is desirable and feasible , and also to provide commercial parties with non-legislative texts ( e.g . model clauses , rules and legal guides ) to assist them in implementing international transactions . 
It would be an illusion to think that this innovative model of peace-keeping will be able to succeed in Liberia , especially under current conditions , unless sufficient and reliable sources of funding are provided to ECOMOG , and unless the force is strengthened and structured in a manner that will enable it to carry out its tasks as a professional peace-keeping force .  
The agreement represents a model for national reconciliation ; it offers the prospect of building a pluralistic democratic society with high standards in the sphere of the human rights and equal participation of all political and regional forces in the public life of the country .  
These long-term trends characterizing natality and the rate of marriages result in the following consequences : accelerated exchange of generations ; juvenation of grandparenthood ; gradual stabilization of the two-child model ; reduction of sibling relations and closing of sibling ages ; reduction in the number of family-nucleus members ; and horizontal narrowing and vertical broadening of families ( increasing the number of generations to include great-grandparents ) .  
The legality of the occupancy under these conditions does not , however , exempt the Organization from liability to pay adequate compensation or fair rental for privately owned property , while maintaining its right to seek reimbursement from the Government pursuant to article 16 of the model status-of-forces agreement or the principle reflected therein . 
Later , some mercenaries established ties with paramilitary forces of the resistance groups and extreme right-wing groups , while others are said to be operating in other countries ; finally , the company which reportedly serves as a model for companies offering , on the worldwide free market , security services which hitherto were the exclusive responsibility of the internal security forces of each State is registered in South Africa .  
Furthermore , model legislative provisions constituted a less ambitious and more flexible instrument for legal harmonization and might , therefore , be more effective in a field where conventions had so far failed to achieve the desired objectives .  
Convinced that the establishment of a model law facilitating the use of electronic commerce that is acceptable to States with different legal , social and economic systems could contribute significantly to the development of harmonious international economic relations ,  
ICRC had also been developing a model manual for the armed forces on the law of armed conflicts , designed primarily for use by senior officers with tactical responsibilities , and intended as a reference tool for the military commander without legal background .  
Convinced that the establishment of a model law facilitating the use of electronic commerce that is acceptable to States with different legal , social and economic systems could contribute significantly to the development of harmonious international economic relations ,  
This stage is characterized by the formation of a vision of the place and the role of these two organizations within the framework of the comprehensive security model for the twenty-first century currently being developed ; by an intensification of the process of determining innovative ways effectively to implement the principles and obligations set forth in the United Nations Charter and in the basic documents of the OSCE ; and by the search for new forms of cooperation aimed at finding acceptable formulas for the solution of existing regional problems .  
We think that it is necessary to establish the practice of convening regular meetings between the official representatives of these organizations , in order to exchange opinions on a future security model for Europe , to divide their responsibilities properly within the framework of cooperation in the maintenance of international peace and security in the OSCE region , and to elaborate relevant arrangements for coordinating their activities and decision-making .  
The Office has advanced the view that the lead agency model should be retained among the options available to the Secretary-General and the Emergency Relief Coordinator , as a well-tested and flexible formula for ensuring a coordinated response to complex emergencies .  In the view of UNHCR , the lead agency approach has the advantage of avoiding multiple layers of coordination , minimizing cost and avoiding diffused accountability .  
The Bucharest document identified an almost universal recognition that a democratic system of government is the best model to ensure a framework of liberties for lasting solutions to political , economic and social problems .  
In keeping with this view , the Kingdom of Swaziland believes that democracy is not a model to be copied but a goal to be attained , and the pace at which it can proceed is dependent on a variety of political , economic , social and cultural factors proper to the circumstances of a particular culture and society .  
Mongolia agrees with the conclusion that democracy is not a model to be copied or imposed , but rather a goal to be attained , and that the pace at which democratization can proceed is dependent on a variety of political , economic , social and cultural factors proper to the circumstances of a particular culture or society .  
My predecessor , the late President Cheddi Jagan , challenged the international community on many occasions to strive for a new global human order , a development paradigm which would seek simultaneously to achieve optimal economic growth , social equity , poverty reduction and protection of the environment : a development model rooted in a partnership that seeks a better balance within and among States .  
A policy that is geared towards a sustainable development model is conceivable and feasible only through international political intervention an intervention that implies a spirit of cooperation and solidarity among the industrialized countries , the developing countries and the poorest parts of the world . 
A useful model for developing improved partnerships with non-governmental organizations is the PARinAC initiative of UNHCR , which emphasizes the formulation of common principles and goals and the creation of an umbrella framework for action and extensive consultative processes involving non-governmental organizations at the country , regional and international levels .  
I am firmly convinced that with the final fine tuning of these ultimate requirements , this United Nations compensation operation will pass into history as a model of effectiveness , correction and fairness in the delicate and difficult circumstances that led to its creation , and that its work , its rules and its results will guide and shape the outcome of future compensation operations .  
Convinced that the establishment of a model law facilitating the use of electronic commerce that is acceptable to States with different legal , social and economic systems could contribute significantly to the development of harmonious international economic relations ,  
While some support was expressed for modifying the article as suggested , one view was that the article should be deleted because it either stated what applied anyway or because it was not for a ( model ) national statute to deal with matters that concerned the hierarchy among legislative acts , an issue that had constitutional implications .  
Member States are also urged to rely on the existing United Nations model treaties on extradition , mutual assistance in criminal matters , transfer of proceedings and transfer of prisoners , as necessary , as useful tools in improving international cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of cases of illicit trafficking in motor vehicles ;  
The follow-up to the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan has generated both a focused discussion on the issue of organized transnational crime , as well as a wealth of information that would need systematization and analysis to be transformed into practical tools , in particular model legislation , training for law enforcement and advisory assistance for the reform of the criminal justice system .  
In a second step , during the biennium 1997-1998 , it will be necessary to supplement the new version with a number of new provisions , such as detailed packing instructions for individual substances and other provisions normally found in instruments regulating the transport of dangerous goods by one given mode , so that the model regulation can be directly integrated into national or international instruments , without substantial redrafting .  
The Committee requested the secretariat to prepare the tenth revised edition of the Recommendations on the basis of its work in the biennium 1995-1996 and the texts adopted at its nineteenth session and to publish it in the form of a model regulation , annexed to a basic recommendation , in the most effective manner , without delay , in all official languages of the United Nations and not later than the end of 1997 . 
The Committee decided not to take a position at the current time on future policy regarding the cycle of amendments after 2001 , since several experts thought it preferable to reconsider the question in 1998 in the light of the progress made in the global harmonization of systems of classification and labelling of chemicals and in the process of restructuring the various modal instruments concerned on the basis of the model regulations .  
That framework was built on an innovative model that combined central coordination functions , vested in the mandates of the Administrative Committee on Coordination and the newly established Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development , and decentralized allocation of specific responsibilities to relevant organizations of the United Nations system , based on their comparative strengths , to act as task managers for various programme components of Agenda 21 .  
Consultations and coordination with IMF , the World Bank and other relevant specialized organizations , including UNCTAD and the regional commissions ; provision of improved global on-line access to the LINK model and its analytical databases to other bodies of the United Nations system and to Member States ; external relations with a network of non-governmental research institutes through the exchange of background papers and informal consultations .  
However , although the National Civil Police is a professional public security body with the potential to execute modern and democratic public security policies , the model established by the peace accords has not been consolidated without the occurrence of distortions .  
The revised model Contribution Agreement between the United Nations and participating States contributing resources to United Nations peacekeeping operations contained in the annex to the present note has been submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 51 / 218 E of 17 June 1997 , in which , inter alia , the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to ensure that the Contribution Agreement1 fully reflects the reports of the Phase II and III Working Groups of Reimbursement of Contingent-owned Equipment2 and to issue an appropriate corrigendum to the Agreement .  
In addition to that proposal , various other topics were mentioned with respect to which it might be worthwhile to explore the desirability and feasibility of work at the international level ; those were : legislative treatment of cross-border insolvency in the banking and financial services sector , preparation of model agreements or practices for cross-border cooperation in reorganizations of insolvent enterprises , conflict-of-laws solutions in cross-border insolvency cases , and the effects of insolvency proceedings on arbitration agreements and arbitral proceedings .  
The sponsor stated that the purpose of the draft declaration was to develop a comprehensive United Nations document in the format of a declaration containing a set of model basic principles , agreed by all Member States , to guide peacekeeping and other relevant activities of the Organization .  
But I feel that it is appropriate to repeat the principal characteristic of our development model , which is a harmonious and rational complementary relationship between economic and social policies , which for the first time in many years is enabling us to carry out a realistic strategy for sustainable human development .  
During the Security Council debate of 14 August 1997 on the conclusion of Operation Alba , many delegations described it as a model , including the following aspects : unity of intent by the group of countries involved ; decisive , prompt action taken by the Security Council ; a very clear mandate ; definite limits on the time-frame ; rapid planning and deployment ; and in-depth political coordination and consultation among all the parties involved , with none excluded , through an ad hoc steering committee .  
The international community has acknowledged the extraordinary foresight of the authors of the Tlatelolco Treaty , who responded , in an intelligent and creative manner , to the challenge posed by the danger of nuclear proliferation by drafting an international legal instrument that has become an inspiration and a model for other countries wishing to establish nuclear-weapon-free zones .  
The trend to policy convergence towards the open-economy model derives in part from the demonstrated or perceived successes of that model ; it is also driven by global market actors , in particular developed country Governments and international financial and trade institutions that make such policies a condition for access to resources . 
Also in its resolution 5 / 2 , the Commission reaffirmed the importance of continuing to improve and strengthen the operational activities of the Programme , particularly in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , in order to meet the needs of Member States by undertaking advisory services and training programmes ; by carrying out field studies at the regional , subregional , national and local levels , also drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions ; by developing comprehensive strategic plans for technical cooperation ; and by preparing model assistance projects .  
Future activities envisaged by the resource committee on correctional systems and rights include a model seminar using the Manual for other central and eastern European States , the use of selected parts of the Manual in a seminar on prisoners rights for African participants , a joint initiative with Penal Reform International and an international symposium planned for the third quarter of 1997 .  
The South African political climate is fortunately relaxed and there is no persecution of any sector of opinion ; the rules in force are those of a State subject to the rule of law in which institutions such as the Parliament and the judiciary are respected and one of the main concerns is the solidity of the legal edifice , starting with the new Constitution , on the basis of which democracy is a stable system that is appreciated by all and capable of making South Africa a model country .  
States could also usefully rely on the existing United Nations model treaties on extradition , mutual assistance in criminal matters , transfer of proceedings and transfer of prisoners , as necessary , as tools in improving international cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of cases of illicit trafficking in motor vehicles .  
The same year , the annual party congress of FRELIMO decided to adopt the classical Soviet model for the organization and development of the country , and the Government developed close links with communist and socialist countries .  
Furthermore , the recruitment of children into the armed forces of States or by non _ governmental armed groups deprives them of a normal education and their protective family environment ; this has a direct impact on their development and is at variance with the provisions of article 27 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , which states that States parties recognize the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the child 's physical , mental , spiritual , model and social development . 
The approach represents the satellite as a combination of individual elements and positions these to provide maximum protection to the satellite components .  [ 29 ] The PLATFORM model uses a novel element termed SHIELD [ 30 ] which uses genetic algorithms to determine the optimal configuration of a spacecraft based on the encountered environment and design constraints such as thermal and mass balancing .  
Recognizing also that there is no single political system or single universal model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples , and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
UNHCR has advanced the view that the lead agency model should be retained , amongst the options available to the Secretary-General and the Emergency Relief Coordinator ( ERC ) as a well tested and flexible formula for ensuing a coordinated response to complex emergencies .  In the view of UNHCR , the lead agency approach has the advantage of avoiding multiple layers of coordination , minimizing cost and avoiding diffused accountability .  
It was built on an innovative model that combined central coordination functions , vested in ACC and the newly established Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development , and decentralized allocation of specific responsibilities to relevant organizations of the United Nations system , based on their comparative strengths , to act as task managers for various programme components of Agenda 21 .  
Since countries differed in terms of their living conditions , level of development , geographic characteristics and cultural traditions , there could be no uniform standard or model for solving the problems related to human settlements .  
In its resolution 51 / 202 , the Assembly stressed the importance of encouraging national initiatives for social development , including , inter alia , credit for people living in poverty , particularly women , along the model of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh in connection with self-employment and income generation to address the feminization of poverty , and noted with interest the micro credit summit to be held in Washington , D.C . , in February 1997 .  
Recognizing the importance of prevention in order to achieve demand reduction , his Government had developed a strategy which accorded a major role to the family and also involved teachers , voluntary organizations , youth , media , parents , local councils and the leisure industry .  It had adopted a social model rather than a medical model in the treatment and rehabilitation field and was giving priority to community services .  
First , the new and equitable global partnership must be based on equality and recognize that there was no single model for development that was universally applicable ; since the world was characterized by diversity , there must be respect for the economic and social development model chosen by each country and any attempt to use aid as a leverage for exerting political pressure must be abandoned .  
As a result of the major conferences held during the 1990s , the international community had adopted a development model that encompassed objectives in the areas of economic growth , social progress , environmental protection and respect for human rights , which the member countries of MERCOSUR and Bolivia and Chile had decided to make into reality .  
Consultations and coordination with IMF , the World Bank and other relevant specialized organizations , including UNCTAD and the regional commissions ; provision of improved global on-line access to the LINK model and its analytical databases to other bodies of the United Nations system and to Member States ; and external relations with academic , governmental and non-governmental economic research institutes through the exchange of background papers and consultations .  7A . 8 During the biennium the following activities will be undertaken :  
The model is a good example of successful institutional public / private-sector cooperation involving political , social and economic actors for creating an environment conducive to enterprise development .  
In illustration of a " top-down " method for estimating the impact of coercive economic measures , the expert group referred itself to a recent study that attempts to empirically measure the impact of sanctions on bilateral trade flows , particularly on exports by the United States which is the most frequent sender of unilateral sanctions . 36 But the method used , a common one in economics known as the " gravity model " , also captures the impact on the trade of the target country . 
In order to be operational , however , such a global model should comprise large-scale national models that should be designed to cover domestic economy , external sector and supply-side response to external shocks such as coercive economic measures .  
Similarly , most UNDCP technical and financial resources for alternative development in the Andean region no longer support a wide range of isolated model projects , but rather aim at strengthening the institutional capacities of national alternative development entities and their programmes .  
There is a need in international drug control for internationally accepted standards , methodological knowledge and tested and effective model approaches , all of which would contribute to make national and international drug control efforts more efficient and effective .  
They facilitate the spread of an economic model based on the principles of a market economy , while mass advertising and the global media help shape human aspirations and perceptions of social values .  
The International Committee was currently developing a model manual for use by armed forces , which would serve as a reference tool for military commanders to incorporate the norms of humanitarian law into the operational decision-making process .  
AOUIJ said that , although the extent to which political power was shared between women and men in Denmark constituted a model for developing and developed countries alike , economic power was not shared to the same extent .  
The United Nations had a key role to play in the effective coordination and promotion of multilateral efforts and in the collective examination of lessons learned by countries which had applied the sustainable development model .  
The widely prevailing view had been that a model national statute , or set of legislative provisions , would be appropriate to give judicial cooperation a clearer legal framework .  
Given the results of the sampling projects , the Panel determined that a logistic regression model should be applied to all losses in the target group to predict whether specific losses should be classified as for lost or stolen motor vehicles or for repairs .  
It is for this reason that the logistic regression model was developed from , compared to and tested with the electronic claims for which the type of loss had been ascertained before being applied to the set of claims for which the type of loss was unknown .  
As has been observed even in Europe , which is the most advanced along the road to regional consolidation , and where economic and monetary union have become a reality , in the European Union there is no agreement on the rotational model .  
Applying a common statistical technique , known as ordinary least squares regression analysis , to the gravity model allows the researcher to isolate the direct and indirect effects of sanctions on bilateral trade flows while holding other factors constant .  
The mathematical model for the determination of outer limits from straight baselines on the surface of a geodetic reference ellipsoid is computationally more intensive than the method of envelopes of arcs .  
The operating model utilized depends mainly upon the technological sophistication of the local exporter and trade services communities which in turn depends on the general development stage , geographical size and logistical constraints of the local market .  
For that reason , my delegation believes that we must reflect the cultural , social and religious diversity of all countries as we strive to attain realistic and objective social development , without imposing a single model on everyone . 
IFF may wish to consider the success of CGIAR in mobilizing resources and achieving coherence for international efforts to address a shared global agenda in the field of agriculture and food security and to examine the potential of extending that model to address forest research to ensure sustainable forest management and to maintain adequate cover of all types of forest and other wooded lands to meet a variety of current and future human needs .  
In pursuing a comprehensive model of preventive action , UNPREDEP has also been involved in a wide range of programmes related to good governance and the rule of law , strengthening of national capacity and infrastructure , institution - building and human resources development in the governmental and civil sectors .  
Since certain of the subject matters included in the model curriculum as well as the other guidance will become dated in the long term and other subjects and information may need to be added to enable professional accountants to function in a rapidly changing global environment , the model curriculum should be modified as appropriate .  
Since its foundation , the United Nations has developed a broad range of international standards , guidelines and model treaties in crime prevention and criminal justice that represent internationally agreed upon principles of desirable practice based on the rule of law .  
In 1998 , IPU published a model code of conduct for elections13 which acknowledges that a successful and informed electoral process is the joint responsibility of all involved : political parties and candidates ; supporters and voters ; police and security forces ; Governments and public officials ; media and observers .  
The Set also provides for work aimed at achieving common approaches in national policies relating to RBPs compatible with the Set ( article F . 1 ) , and continued work on the elaboration of a model law or laws on RBPs in order to assist developing countries in devising appropriate legislation ( article F . 2 ) ; the OECD instruments do not have such provisions , but the 1998 OECD recommendation recommends convergence in ( as well as effective enforcement of ) laws prohibiting hardcore cartels .  
To this end , the Section will build on existing legal advice and assistance programmes to expand its capacity to facilitate the exchange of relevant information between countries and relevant entities , including through the use of improved modern technology , promote subregional and regional agreements through meetings , memoranda of understanding and by the provision of model agreements , as well as further develop training programmes for judicial and prosecutorial personnel .  
Two high-level regional seminars on the implementation of the PEDA model ; two seminars on the monitoring of the series of globally agreed upon programmes and conventions that flow from the New Agenda for Development of Africa in the 1990s ; two workshops on developing methodologies and guidelines on sustainable agricultural production systems and environmental rehabilitation programmes in Africa ; two seminars on topical issues on food security and sustainable development ;  
Since certain of the subject matters included in the model curriculum as well as the other guidance will become dated in the long term and other subjects and information may need to be added to enable professional accountants to function in a rapidly changing global environment , the model curriculum should be modified as appropriate .  
Contrary to the textbook model of large numbers of investors making careful independent judgements as to profitable opportunities , the capital markets are subject to bouts of herd behaviour that is , investors follow one another without forming their own judgements or expectations about individual economies .  
No firm decision as regards a possible future four-year periodicity of amendments should be taken during the period of alignment of the format of the various legal instruments concerning modal aspects of the transport of dangerous goods on that of the model regulations , and pending decisions regarding the implementation of the globally harmonized system of classification and labelling of chemicals in accordance with Agenda 21 objectives ;  
Recognizing also that there is no single political system or single universal model of democracy equally suited to all nations and their peoples and that political systems and the electoral processes which guarantee the establishment of democratic governments are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
The model selected will constitute a missing element in the range of tools available at present to the astrophysical community for the exploration of the universe , extending from the near solar environment to the far distant phases of evolution , when the basic building blocks of human life were being created .  
Based on the Empretec model , it operates as a regional network and also as a focal point for coordinating existing and new initiatives sponsored by UNDP , other donor agencies , Governments and NGOs aimed at accelerating the growth , expansion and competitiveness of SMEs in Africa and improving the quality of indigenous African entrepreneurship .  
These included the reviews of technical assistance activities submitted to the annual meetings of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Competition Law and Policy ; analytical studies dealing with economic aspects of restrictive business practices ; practical information papers outlining the basic features of restrictive business practices ; commentaries on a possible model law on restrictive business practices ; and the reports of regional seminars organized by UNCTAD .  
Opinions were sought also from experts in restrictive business practices in some developed countries and international organizations regarding the quality of the analytical studies prepared by the UNCTAD secretariat and the commentaries on the model law , which are revised periodically .  
The objective of the meeting was to formulate an environmental studies model to encourage cooperation among States , national scientific institutions , the registered pioneer investors and potential contractors in research on environmental predictions for deep seabed mining .  
My own country of Saint Lucia , and our Eastern Caribbean sister State of Dominica , share special cultural , economic and social ties with the overseas departments of Guadeloupe , Martinique and French Guyana , which represents the political model of integrated status and whose representatives have been present with us here at this Seminar to discuss the intricacies of that political status .  
A model law would also be appropriate when the purpose of the uniform text is , on the one hand , to establish a standard of a modern law in an area where national systems are widely disparate , undeveloped or outdated and , on the other hand , to provide an incentive for a movement towards unification .  
The studies covered such areas as the update of the Trade Policy Simulation econometric model , assistance in positive agenda formulation for developing countries , assessment of the quantitative impact of multilateral trade negotiations on developing countries , implementation of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and the required improvements thereto .  
For this purpose new course materials were developed ( on the analysis of the effects of international trade policies , using a global model ) , existing material was adapted to distance learning techniques and a new project intended for Portuguese-speaking countries is currently being developed in Brazil and Cape Verde and will be extended to other lusophone countries , with the expertise of consultants specialized in human resources development in those countries .  
Recent calls for such reform were born of a political desire to protect human rights in the context of international consensus , rather than through the unilateral imposition of a single cultural model .  
The Seattle Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization and the tenth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , to be held at Bangkok , should reassert the continuing need for differential treatment for developing countries and , because there was no one valid model of behaviour , the need for national autonomy .  
In 1998 , the Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity had recommended that member States should adopt a draft model legislation on access to biological resources at national level ; initiate a process of negotiation among African countries to adopt an African convention on biological diversity ; and develop a common position to safeguard their sovereign rights and the vital interests of local communities .  
Concerned at the uncertain situation of the Centre for International Crime Prevention , her delegation believed that that body should be provided with adequate resources to provide Member States with the technical assistance needed to ensure the rule of law and juvenile justice , and to elaborate model legislation on mutual assistance in criminal matters .  
A striking differentiation in national paths of systemic and developmental change was another surprise and puzzle for the transition doctrine , with its uniform initial strategy and its underlying notion of convergence towards an idealized normative model of the market economy .  
Conflicts will continue as long as the North continues to impose an imperfect and environmentally and economically unsustainable political model that may , perhaps , work in the North a model reached after centuries of absolute monarchies , without free or just elections , without universal suffrage , without women having the vote , without eight-hour work days , without what today is called good governance , though this concept has yet to be defined or agreed on by anybody .  
The IPU has taken up the cause of the large segment of humanity which is not a beneficiary of globalization and , at the recent conference in Berlin , discussed the need to revise the current global financial and economic model , and adopted a resolution which called for special initiatives for underdeveloped , debt-ridden countries .  
One-thousand-six-hundred representatives from 131 countries came to Berlin and cooperated in the drafting of important resolutions on the promotion of international humanitarian law ; on the peaceful coexistence of ethnic , cultural and religious minorities , including migrant populations within a single State ; and on the need to revise the current global financial and economic model .  
At the Third International Conference of New or Restored Democracies on Democracy and Development , held at Bucharest , Romania , two years ago , the representatives of new or restored democracies noted that a democratic system of government is the best model to ensure a framework of liberties for lasting solutions to the political , economic and social problems that our societies face .  
The activities carried out by UNIAPRAVI are intended to meet the new policy and operational requirements of housing sector institutions with a view to enhancing the role of the housing sector as a factor for economic growth and social development.The central , underlying idea in this regard is that the sectoral development model must be compatible with the overall economic development model .  
Therefore , the public sector can play a catalytic role by helping to promote stable and profitable housing finance systems , the introduction of new products that satisfactorily meet demand , the introduction and adoption of banking regulations and , most of all , by promoting a housing policy model that takes the long-term view and that is based on a partnership between the public and private sectors .  
An initial , simple mathematical model , based on a system of just two differential equations , proved suitable to illustrate the mechanism that can ultimately lead to a chain reaction of orbiting debris .  
Commending the work of the Intergovernmental Expert Group Meeting on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters , held at Arlington , Virginia , United States of America , from 23 to 26 February 1998 , to implement in part resolution 52 88 by proposing complementary provisions for the Model Treaty , elements for inclusion in model legislation on mutual assistance in criminal matters , and training and technical assistance for national officials engaged in that field ,  
The discussion contained in this section is illustrative of different options that have been used in domestic legislative measures to set up a regulatory framework for privately financed infrastructure projects , but the Guide does not thereby advocate the establishment of any particular model or administrative structure .  
This relates to the familiar basic questions of whether the concept is correctly defined and meaningful , whether the statistical methodology identified fits the conceptual definitions and model selected , and whether the statistics collected map both reality and the conceptual and methodological foundations .  
The digital satellite ( hot standby ) terminal is needed to replace the existing main analog terrestrial microwave link on Mount Olympus , which is an obsolete model for which maintenance is not cost-effective , and to extend the field assets control system , installed at UNFICYP headquarters in 1997 , to the three Sectors .  
Consultations and coordination with UNCTAD , the regional commissions , IMF and the World Bank ; provision of improved global on-line access to the Project Link model for other bodies of the United Nations system and to Member States ; and external relations with academic , governmental and non-governmental economic research institutes through the exchange of background papers and consultations .  
Because the diversity of national legal traditions and administrative practices made formulating model legislation difficult , his delegation supported the idea that legislative recommendations should be reviewed with the assistance of experts , subject to the participation of all Member States .  
The discussion contained in this section is illustrative of different options that have been used in domestic legislative measures to set up a regulatory framework for privately financed infrastructure projects , but the Guide does not thereby advocate the establishment of any particular model or administrative structure .  
In particular , the strong State would have to be reinvented applying the decentralized model of organization of the modern global corporation , with the local states taking a proactive role in wealth creation across the territory and the national State acting as strategic leader , consensus-builder and broker between the supranational and subnational levels .  
Tectonic and environmental hazard mapping of the northern segment of the Dead Sea fault system using a digital elevation model ( DEM ) from ESA remote sensing satellite ( ERS ) tandem mission synthetic aperture radar ( SAR ) data ( international ) ;  
While there was no single model to resolve the problem of underdevelopment , international cooperation was increasingly necessary for the strengthening and sharing of the human , institutional , economic and technical capacities of States .  
A deterministic analytical model of debris has also been developed in order to allow computational tracking of the movement of individual large observed space objects with given orbital characteristics .  
The dialogue segments launched in 1998 have since been recognized as a unique participatory model for effectively engaging major groups and Governments in a genuine dialogue on specific sustainable development issues .  
He said India , which had over a-billion inhabitants and constituted a real ethnic , linguistic and religious patchwork , had chosen an economic , social and political model which was unique for a former colony with development problems .  
With regard to public and private resources , we are currently developing a mixed welfareState model that gives public support in the form of financial relief and special subsidies and the like to private institutions providing social services .  
In these countries , a headlong rush to adopt a neoliberal model of state functions and responsibilities has frequently left large populations bereft of any effective institutional structure for delivering social protection and social programmes more broadly .  
However , he stressed that there was no single universal model of democracy ; different models shared common features , but the economic , social and cultural circumstances of each country had evolved differently and needed to be taken into account .  
General support had been expressed in favour of the proposal to prepare a harmonized and widely acceptable model legislative regime governing the enforcement of interim measures of protection ordered by arbitral tribunals .  
No less than some thirty conventions , multilateral agreements , uniform model laws or standard rules relating to international commercial dealings or international carriage are involved .  
Turkmenistan has consistently and insistently supported the establishment in international relations of a more humane , equitable and constructive order , opposed all forms of discrimination , the isolation of States on political or ideological grounds and the imposition of various types of economic sanctions , embargoes and the like , and urged respect for the distinctive characteristics of each country and its chosen model of social and political development .  
[ 16 ] Alongside the absence of a commitment to making primary education free , and uncertainties as to which children will be classified as poor ( or ultra-poor ) to merit bursaries , this model also raises concerns about the administrative costs of collecting school fees ( necessarily minuscule in poor rural Zambia ) and administrating the bursaries ( also minuscule ) . 
Its innovative programmes in the field of sustainable development , for example the BIOTRADE initiative and the greenhouse gas emission trading rights programme , could sow the seeds of a future development model featuring economic growth compatible with life , human values and nature .  
The Council inspected the minutes of the nineteenth meeting of the committee on industrial cooperation , where agreement had been reached on the amended model normative regime for industrial organization in the GCC States , and the minutes of the tenth meeting of the committee on scientific and cultural cooperation .  
After consideration of the various views expressed , the Commission decided that the question of the desirability and feasibility of preparing a model law or model legislative provisions on selected issues covered by the Legislative Guide should be considered by the Commission at its current session . 
The training and technical assistance programme carried out by the Secretariat under the mandate given by the Commission , in particular in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , encompasses two main lines of activity : ( a ) information activities aimed at promoting understanding of international commercial law conventions , model laws and other legal texts ; and ( b ) assistance to Member States with commercial law reform and adoption of UNCITRAL texts .  
As to the form that work might take , while a model law might be more desirable from the point of view of completeness and uniformity , to the extent that it would need to reflect certain fundamental guiding principles that would not be common ground to all legal systems , it would represent a significant change from current law in many countries and might , as a result , not meet with sufficient acceptance .  
The licences authorizing the manufacture of small arms and light weapons could contain obligations to maintain comprehensive records subject to national verification and / or audit ( including qualifications of the licensee , the type model , calibre or gauge , and serial number of each completed firearm manufactured and the name of the purchaser and date of sale ) .  
These assumptions related to the prices of the metals contained in polymetallic nodules , the technical feasibility of mining operations and the need to ensure an adequate rate of return on investment in deep seabed mining and resulted in a model which required each mine site to be capable of sustaining an annual commercial production of 3-million tonnes of dry nodules per year over a period of 20 years . 
The Working Group had had three main objectives : to create a generic model for updating reimbursement rates and , subsequently , to update the rates approved by the General Assembly at the beginning of 1996 ; to review and update the existing standards and to seek new fields in which standards could be applied ; and to consider the methodology underlying the calculation of standard rates for reimbursement of troop costs , including ways of producing timely and more representative data .  
It encourages [ political parties to take concrete steps to promote solidarity , tolerance and respect , inter alia by developing [ model ] voluntary code [ s ] of conduct as well as penal measures for members of such parties that engage in statements and actions that could encourage or incite racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and racist sentiment among the public ] ;  
Clearly economic , social , cultural and hence nutritional situations tend to be extremely varied from one country to another and a model law would fail to address the problems experienced by people in their everyday lives and produce legislative solutions ill-adapted to legal and political systems in different countries .  
Furthermore , it was reported that the relevant authorities were revising labour legislation governing the private sector with a view to producing model legislation conducive to the implementation of a policy of economic and social development .  
Based on these principles , a set of new concepts has emerged and started to take form : a new security concept which consists in mutual trust , disarmament and cooperative security ; a new type of international relationship which centres on partnership and non-alignment ; and a new model of regional cooperation in which all countries , large or small , jointly take the initiative in promoting mutually beneficial cooperation .  
In preparing and adopting model legislative provisions on international commercial conciliation , the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law ( UNCITRAL or the Commission ) was mindful that such provisions would be a more effective tool for States modernizing their legislation if accompanied by background and explanatory information .  
In that connection he stressed the need for an open , equitable , predictable , non-discriminatory and rule-based multilateral trading system and expressed the hope that the forthcoming International Conference on Financing for Development would achieve a new consensus model that took into account the needs and priorities of the developing world . 
Austria congratulated the Commission secretariat on organizing a Colloquium on Privately Financed Infrastructure in Vienna in July and endorsed the initiative to establish a Working Group to draft a core model law , because a legislative and regulatory framework for infrastructure projects would send a reassuring signal to all potential private investors and might help to attract private investment for infrastructure projects in developing States .  
The EU had undertaken to modernize the European social model in order to create a dynamic Union of active social States and had set itself the objectives of improving the quality of employment promoting social inclusion , encouraging participation of the social partners in managing change , ensuring the responsibility of enterprises and designing social-protection systems , including reliable retirement schemes .  
While reaffirming its importance for the purpose of making legislators aware of the implications of their policy choices in the field of privately financed infrastructure , the Working Group agreed that the recommendation had an educational rather than a prescriptive character and therefore was not suitable to be transformed into a model legislative provision .  
While that view attracted some support , a concern was that mentioning governmental financial or economic support in a model legislative provision would be tantamount to recommending that support be given by the Government , a result that was considered inappropriate in respect of those Governments whose policy was not to grant any support for privately financed infrastructure projects .  
Against that background , the Working Group held an extensive exchange of views on whether it would be desirable to formulate a model legislative provision that listed essential issues that needed to be addressed in the project agreement .  
Having considered the various views that were expressed , the Working Group agreed that it would be useful to formulate a model legislative provision that listed essential issues that needed to be addressed in the project agreement .  
The view was expressed that model legislative provisions in respect of recommendations 46-48 should be drafted , since the issue of both collection of fees and other payments to be made to the concessionaire was crucial in respect of the financial balance of the project and the very notion of concession agreement and therefore needed to be addressed at a legislative rather than at a contractual level .  
Accordingly , it was agreed that it would be useful to draft a model legislative provision reflecting the recommendation , for the purpose of either eliminating existing legal obstacles or to overcoming possible contrary practices of judicial or administrative authorities .  
It had applied a model unique of its kind based on a number of common policies with regard to asylum and migration providing , inter alia , for criteria for the granting of refugee status , minimum standards regarding reception , minimum standards regarding the status of long-term residents from third countries , and the establishment of analytical and descriptive statistics by the Statistical Office of the European Communities ( EUROSTAT ) .  
Being of the opinion that the establishment of model legislation to facilitate the use of electronic signatures in a manner acceptable to States with different legal , social and economic systems could contribute to the development of harmonious international economic relations ,  
Disseminate internationally agreed materials such as guidelines , legal and technical manuals , minimum standards , proven practices and model legislation to assist legislators and law enforcement and other authorities in the development , adoption and application of effective measures against high-technology and computer-related crime and offenders both in general and in specific cases ;
