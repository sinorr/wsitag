At first , people were skeptical over his intentions , since with the improving living conditions in Taiwan , beggars and private garbage collectors were becoming part of history . But despite this problem , and the rheumatism and neurasthenia that afflicted him , he continued to work until he had won the support and understanding of the public , and even his health improved .  
Though the advent of free markets is supposed to have brought improvements in amounts of goods for sale and improved service , the shabby stalls , aged vendors and lack of variety in commodities gave mute evidence of weak purchasing power , low consumption standards , and general poverty .  
At the meeting , foreign guests discovered that the quality of Taiwan 's medicine had improved rapidly over the past 30 years . The death rate has declined and the average life expectancy has increased . This period has seen the eradication of most acute infectious diseases .

As his techniques improved , his stock was sold out only hours after it had been taken out of the ovens . Now aged 72 , Kuo gives the reasons for his success : " If you run a reliable business which produces pastries and other snacks suited to the public taste , your reputation will spread far and wide by word of mouth .  
As a result , the Chinese lost a considerable part of one of their most priceless heritages . Today , however , as standards of living in the Republic of China have improved , the flow is being reversed .

Market trends in Europe and the U . S . this year show that older people are buying ceramic dolls to pass on to the younger generation . International demand for gift items , steadily increasing apace of world population growth and improved living standards , has led to the development of worldwide gift industries . Advanced nations often phase out their production of small gifts in favor of larger , technical and high profit items .  
Ho Te-hong , Chairman of the Forestry BureauThe Taiwan Forestry Bureau is like the eldest brother or sister in a family who earned money to support their younger brothers or sisters . And after their living standard improved , the younger brothers and sisters , now having grown up , turn around and reject their elder brother or sister , viewing them as good-for nothings or saying that their former jobs were not prestigious enough . When our nation was poor the Taiwan Forestry Bureau struggled to keep our heads above water .  
In view of the greater access to improved modes of travel , the Tourism Bureau intends to transform the Yueh-mei Farm in Taichung County into an amusement complex with varied functions . The complex is designed to reflect traditional Chinese culture and yet present the natural sciences and modern science and technology . The Bureau will also promote private investment in tourist hotels and recreational facilities in the area .  
What 's different is , the ones doing best are no longer first-generation immigrants but Chinese Americans born in the U . S . The main reason is that the new wave of immigrants is more of a mixed bag than the previous one . That group , for coincidental reasons , was so high in quality that its like has rarely been seen . They not only improved the status of Chinese Americans as a whole , but many of their children have made brilliant accomplishments .  
Water buffalos and Chinese cattle produce just enough to feed their calves , without any extra for people . Domestic livestock and poultry have always been a major source of animal protein , with the sole point in raising them being to fill our bellies . New , improved varieties with rapid growth , greater fecundity or better taste have won favor over time , and pure native strains that have n't been interbred have gradually declined in popularity or even face extinction .  
Despite Taiwan 's small size , its tropical and sub-tropical climate and unique geography mean that it has a rich flora , many original varieties of which retain excellent characteristics .

Now people will think of going to check out Europe . With the improved economic situation in Taiwan , there 's only the language problem , which Leuven has solved by providing the international curriculum . So all at once everyone began coming . " Here he makes a short critique : " Those coming for travel and study - - without clear study objectives , with the aim of adding to what they 've seen and experienced - - are more numerous than those coming in pursuit of scholarship . "  
If earthworms could be raised in polluted soil , and then after a time moved out , even if the total amount of heavy metals in the environment was not changed , the land could be improved in this way , and the speed at which heavy metals are " passed on ' ' could be increased , thus lowering the recuperation time for the land .  
Yet on this occasion Yang was able to put out five such vehicles .

These innovations have greatly increased the practicality of the electric vehicle .  
Fortunately , after years of contention , the situation has slightly improved . Today it is no longer necessary to get approval from the central government for anyone below civil service level 8 . And with regard to the top officials who can make or break the administration of a city or county , the executive has more room to haggle if he or she does not approve of the individual selected by the provincial government . The more influential chiefs can even recommend candidates and ask the provincial government to formally appoint them .

Wang argues that the ideal situation would be to establish " resource classes for hyperactive children . " Hyperactive children having a hard time adjusting could first stay in these resource classes until they showed improved functioning and learning impairments were eliminated . Then , accompanied by a special-ed teacher , they could transfer to a regular class . The special-ed teacher would continue to provide guidance until the child had adjusted .  
In the reign of the Tang emperor Xuanzong ( ruled 712-755 ) , Buddhist Master Yixing ( 673-727 ) , another outstanding astronomer , improved on Zhang Heng 's instrument by making a bronze armillary sphere which revolved through one degree a day and one full revolution per year , and also had two wooden mannikins which beat a drum and a bell to mark the time of day .  
But it also proved to be a turning point , for " to save the situation , the New Zealand government stepped in and set up the New Zealand Kiwifruit Marketing Board ( NZKMB ) .

Today journalists are part of the salaried middle class , well trained , with stable lives . The improved social position means that they no longer have to write to please authority to ensure their livelihood .

What is more important is doing their specialized job and allowing the free competition of the market to decide their success or failure .  
Looking from another angle , after the Communist Party of China had won power , if they had governed well , developed China , fulfilled the calls to " overtake the US and Britain , " and improved the living conditions of the people , then even if Zhang had acted traitorously , even though his actions were morally flawed , the result of these actions would have been that China became rich and strong and he would still be a national hero to be revered through the ages . However , this has not been the reality .  
Few people know of those researchers like Dr . Green who have quietly toiled for many years at Taiwan 's one and only international organization , the AVRDC . Together these agricultural experts from around the world have developed today 's improved cherry tomatoes , soybeans , and Chinese cabbage . They have raised the quality of Taiwan 's fruits and vegetables , and helped innumerable farmers in Southeast Asia , South Asia , Africa and Latin America raise their incomes and improve their nutrition .  
In addition to improving the quality and quantity of vegetable production , its efforts allowed young soybeans to become a major agricultural export for Taiwan , which improved farmers ' incomes and earned foreign exchange for the country . Chou says that the center has also , over the years , nurtured a large pool of skilled personnel from both overseas and Taiwan .  
The visit has undoubtedly helped to promote a deeper understanding of Taiwan on the other side of the Taiwan Strait . In the midst of these positive signs , however , China surprised Taiwan by resuming diplomatic relations on 23 April with Guinea Bissau . This development was a slap in the face for Taiwan , which has lost diplomatic relations with yet another country . This naked reminder of China 's unflagging campaign to isolate Taiwan internationally makes a mockery of budding hopes for improved cross-strait relations .  
In another situation , a performer in a flashy costume showed off his improved version of the once popular robot dance . Like a newly wound musical doll , he danced to the mechanical drum beats with an elated expression . Occasionally , he would interact with the tourists passing by , generating cheers as well as showers of coins .  
With improved technology , doctors rely increasingly on machines , and are unwilling to make any judgments before tests are completed . One book called Why Things Bite Back tells the true story of a Stanford University medical student who had a stomach ailment for four weeks . He entered the university hospital , and underwent a series of painful tests , and was told that the problem was with his appendix . But a retired old doctor only had to hear his descriptions of his symptoms , and that veteran physician knew immediately what the problem was .  
As economic conditions and the quality of life have improved , people today naturally value life far more highly than in former times . For instance , although chickenpox usually produces only mild symptoms , it is potentially crippling or even fatal . Old people still believe that the earlier a child gets chickenpox the better , but despite the high price of the chickenpox vaccine now imported from America , many parents are willing to have their children immunized .  
For the whole global village to be improved into an enormous " aseptic chamber " is surely impossible , but what we can predict is that if humans do not change their attitudes towards the environment and nature , and if they continue to pay scant regard to safe practice in medical treatment and the use of drugs , new viruses and infectious diseases will never stop appearing .  
" For every ten people who come to me for authentication , nine end up disappointed and leave mad , " says Ted Cheng , executive manager of Buddhist Chen De Plaza , who helped to stir up the rage for dZi beads in the early days and became famous last year when he was commissioned to make a gold throne for the Dalai Lama to use in Taiwan .

Assistance also comes from locals who have long been active in the labor and human rights movements , such as Yvonne Lin , who for nearly ten years has helped foreign laborers stuck in detention centers to get back to their home countries . Lin says that caring for the lives of working people is a cause that transcends nationality , and that disputes between overseas workers and their employers often simply highlight problems already faced by Taiwanese workers . Tackling such problems can help to pave the way for improved rights all round .  
Years before Copernicus advanced the theory that the sun was at the center of the universe , da Vinci surmised that the earth revolved around the sun ; before Galileo improved the telescope , da Vinci had drawn designs for telescopes ; long before the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , he invented a lathe , a lifting jack , a water pump , a lift , and geared machinery ; he was also the first to use the modern plus and minus signs in mathematics .

Chang Tien-fu says : " Schools chose to focus on transforming themselves and in the process forgot their own position and character . " Although many schools did change their name , their relative position in the educational hierarchy was not improved .

In other words , they stopped focusing on the need for practical work and started to emphasize theory and R &amp; D .  
He has experienced " snow blindness " from carving too long under the rays of a magnifying lamp . He would feel pain in both eyes and see nothing but white everywhere .

The Committee took note of the annual overview report of ACC , welcomed its new improved format , commended the Secretariat for a concise and well focused report , and requested that future reports be more analytical than descriptive .  
The themes that recurred in the reports and their presentation acknowledged the role of new technologies introduced in order to generate digital geographical data for improved map production purposes and to feed geographical information systems ( GIS ) as essential tools for supporting better planning of sustainable development and environmental management . 
There is an increased use in the region of satellite imagery and global positioning systems ( GPS ) ; geodetic networks are being improved ; and there is a continuing need to maintain topographic and thematic mapping and a priority need to produce data and maps in support of cadastre .  
The promotion and maintenance of the child 's health through strengthened safe motherhood ; breastfeeding , and improved weaning ; universal immunization ; control of diarrhoeal diseases and respiratory infections ; and other existing public health programmes . 
The resulting improved and sustained macroeconomic stability in several least developed countries and the good weather conditions and strength in the international demand for the exports of African least developed countries are the main reasons for the third year of relatively strong growth and rising per capita output in the least developed countries .  
While the overall economic performance in the least developed countries has improved , poverty remains pervasive and the majority of the population in the least developed countries suffers from reduced caloric intakes , increased mortality and morbidity , the re-emergence and spread of disease and lower school enrolment .  
The motor of that process was the promotion of an enabling environment that would ensure increased access for the poor to economic services and industrial goods , given that the great majority of poor people in rural areas were self-employed and that their prosperity depended on their having direct access to more and improved means of production .  
There is a need for concerted action by all countries and for improved cooperation to assist developing countries in implementing the relevant agreements and instruments in order that they may participate effectively in the sustainable use , conservation and management of their fishery resources , as provided for in the Convention and other international legal instruments , and achieve integrated coastal zone management .  
These initiatives focused on increased use of alternative transportation fuels ( e.g . , natural gas ) , support for urban public transport , and improved transportation planning and regulation .  
In addition , an extraordinary appropriation of $ 1-million was approved by the Governing Council , comprising $ 500,000 for studies requested by the Governing Council for activities directly related to the implementation of improved management and administrative practices by UNEP , and $ 500,000 for the costs associated with the anticipated special session of the Governing Council in the event that these costs are not covered by the regular budget of the United Nations .  
The quantitative efforts set out above should be complemented by measures to improve the qualitative aspects of international development cooperation , particularly a better focus on its distribution ; greater national capacities to coordinate national and international resources ; improved national ownership of externally financed programmes ; international cooperation based on national priorities , involving other development partners , including civil society ; and strengthened national capacities to plan for , manage , monitor and evaluate the impact of development cooperation .  
His delegation hoped that appropriate measures would be taken at the national and international levels to ensure that the benefits of foreign direct investment were shared by as many developing countries as possible , since such investment played a critical role not only in terms of capital flow but also served as a channel for the transfer of technology and improved access to international export markets .  
Nuclear testing is continuing using non-explosive techniques ; existing weapons are being improved ; new types of weapons are being designed : all indications that CTBT is set to start a new technology race in the quest for more innovative and more lethal nuclear weapons .  
The speaker said that significant changes would be required in order to increase the flow of FDI to a meaningful size in areas such as governance , development of an enabling policy environment and sustained policy reforms , and an improved partnership between the public and private sectors .  
The results had been reduced government expenditure , improved economic administration , a stabilized Yemeni rial , promotion of private sector activities , enactment of transparent investment and trade policies , agricultural privatization , giving priority to technical education and starting the implementation of a social security system .  
While the quality of United Nations programmes in the field of science and technology for development had improved , the question of how to bridge the gap between those countries that generated and utilized new scientific ideas and modern technologies , and those countries which were unable to do so remained one of the major challenges facing the international community .  
In that light , agency programming through 1997 has evolved to reflect several new developments , including an increased orientation towards reconstruction projects and confidence-building measures , support for capacity-building of local authorities in the health , education and social welfare sectors , improved targeting of beneficiaries and more consolidated and integrated projects oriented towards employment / income generation .  
Unless national and local capabilities for basic early warning functions are improved within individual countries , external enhancements in hazard forecasting and telecommunications will not necessarily lead to successful mitigation practices .  
The objective of programming in this area is to increase understanding of the socio-economic determinants of the HIV epidemic at a policy level , among Governments , and in the private sector and civil society , resulting in policies and programmes to promote an improved and effective response to the epidemic .  
Success will be measured by the number of additional jobs and improved livelihoods generated by new investments , increased trade and development of infrastructure , and the cooperative mechanisms established and strengthened to ensure sustainability and promote peaceful and productive development among the member States .  
The objectives of this project are to help to formulate sound human development policies through : ( a ) the preparation of national human development reports , combined with an annual regional human development report ; and ( b ) the development of improved statistics on human development indicators , including reports on social trends by countries , the latter in close cooperation with ECE . 13 .  Subregional workshops will bring together specialists responsible for national human development reports and from the national statistical offices .  
A substantial proportion of maternal deaths , approximately 13 per cent , result from complications associated with unsafe abortion . 4 The Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development has recognized unsafe abortion to be a major public-health issue and recommended that the recourse to abortion be reduced through expanded and improved family planning services . 
Invites donor countries , the United Nations Development Programme and multilateral financial institutions to provide landlocked and transit developing countries with appropriate financial and technical assistance in the form of grants or concessional loans for the construction , maintenance and improvement of their transport , storage and other transit-related facilities , including alternative routes and improved communications , and to promote subregional , regional and interregional projects and programmes ;  
This entails conducive macro and sectoral policies , as well as a transparent and simple regulatory framework ; provision of necessary infrastructure ; improved access to credit , technology and markets ; extension services geared towards improving product design and quality of goods produced ; and support services for improved linkages with other sectors of the economy .  
Expresses the conviction that a stable and transparent environment for commercial transactions in all countries is essential for the mobilization of investment , finance , technology , skills and other important resources across national borders , in order to promote growth and development , and recognizes in this context that effective efforts at all levels to combat corruption and bribery are essential elements of an improved international business environment ;  
Paragraph 22.2 should read : " The programme aims at a major strengthening of coordination for human rights throughout the United Nations system leading to a comprehensive and integrated approach to the promotion and protection of human rights based on the contributions of each of the United Nations organs , bodies and specialized agencies whose activities deal with the human rights and on improved inter-agency cooperation and coordination .  
That would lead to improved aviation and marine and maritime safety and efficiency , agricultural productivity , forest and range management , weather forecasting for the public , environmental quality and understanding of the climatology and climate variability .  
There is absolutely no doubt that increased international assistance and initiatives for debt relief or cancellation , increased official development assistance to meet agreed targets , private capital flows , increased foreign direct investment , and improved terms of trade would play a catalytic role in Africa 's efforts to achieve economic development .  
The Commission , which at its thirty-fifth session considered the question of employment and sustainable livelihoods , reached certain agreed conclusions that have as their goal productive employment ; decreasing unemployment through improved social services , such as education and health care ; giving loans to the private sector in both urban and rural areas ; and improving information and guidance services .  
The Action Strategy begins with measures representing a set of possible early priority interventions , including land title reform ; a new agricultural development initiative and special agricultural economic zones ; promotion of new manufacturing investment through relocation of labour-intensive industries to create industrial estates in the region ; introduction of modern and appropriate technologies ; marketing systems ; and human resource development , including improved skills . 
Our efforts are focused on trying to establish a common market , within a gradual and continuous process in which the basic stages still need to be rounded off , improved and studied in depth .  
The programme of the workshop covered four main topics : conceptual issues of poverty in old age ; women as one of the groups at risk , and the process known as the feminization of poverty ; specific issues of poverty among other groups at risk ; disabled and single persons ; and ways to create an enabling environment for the improved well-being of older people .  
The need for improved access to funding is recognized by the innovative proposal to establish a global mechanism to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms and to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial financial resources to affected developing country Parties to the Convention .  
Despite the major role that non-governmental organizations play in supporting improved environmental management of the drylands and the strong support of many smaller non-governmental organizations at the negotiations for the Convention , it is disappointing that the larger international non-governmental organizations have not played a more prominent role in the follow-up process .  
Recognizing that , in general , large external capital movements are likely to be the market response to changes in expectations about domestic economic performance , the 1995 meeting of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) Interim Committee enhanced the IMF ability to monitor the economic policies of member countries and increase the transparency of national policies through improved and more timely provision of data .  
These were the accession of more developing countries and economies in transition to WTO ; improvements in the human and administrative capacities of developing countries , leading to their greater involvement in initiatives in the WTO and in the regional trading arrangements ; and an improved understanding of the developmental dimension of the trade and environment nexus .  
These changes have led to the improved economic position of many farmers in some developing countries , but a great number of small and marginal agricultural producers , especially those in ecologically fragile and remote areas , are handicapped in their access to productive resources , and can not benefit fully from the improved overall environment and better price incentives .  
While legal and institutional instruments have definitely improved the basis for sustainable development of oceans and coastal areas , implementation lags behind owing , among other things , to ( a ) the difficulty in making political decisions regarding resources and wealth allocation ; ( b ) the difficulty of improving inadequate or inefficient institutions ; and ( c ) in many cases , difficulties in meeting the related financial commitments .  
While the need for improved information is recognized , the actual trend in the quality and quantity of data and information being gathered and exchanged is decreasing owing to the impact of economic constraints , particularly but not only in developing countries and countries with economies in transition , and , often , the lack of real priority accorded by Governments .  
It is expected that about two thirds of the increases in agricultural production required to meet projected increases in effective demand will come as a result of improved yields from land currently under cultivation in developing countries , much of which is irrigated .  
Dependence on aquaculture ( mainly inland ) for an important part of future net increases in fish consumption will require improved management of freshwater resources , protection of aquaculture sites from industrial and urban pollution , as well as protection of coastal areas , wetlands and mangrove swamps from irresponsible coastal aquaculture practices .  
This analysis is considered a starting point and focuses on two main elements : ( a ) global interception rates at a time of expansion of international trade and transportation and improved illicit drug trafficking methods ; and ( b ) law enforcement approaches applied in order to improve interception rates and their range of application in selected key trafficking regions .  
A typical example of the technical superiority of the traffickers has been their increased use of mobile cellular phones and faxes since the mid-1980s , once law enforcement authorities were known to be legally and technically equipped to carry out successful wire-tapping operations of the traditional phone network ( which showed improved interdiction and arrest results ) .  
Recognizing also that effective efforts at all levels to combat and avoid corruption and bribery in all countries are essential elements of an improved international business environment , that they enhance fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions and form a critical part of promoting transparent and accountable governance , economic and social development and environmental protection in all countries , and that such efforts are especially pressing in the increasingly competitive globalized international economy ,  
It was suggested that since the interrelationship between the Sixth Committee and the Commission was a vital component of the functioning of the Commission which must be improved and rendered more effective , the input from the Sixth Committee should therefore be as constructive as possible , whether through responses to questionnaires , through written comments by Governments or through oral comments during the debates on the Commission 's annual report .  
Unpaid work in the household and in agriculture , and volunteer work should be measured and valued using improved methods including regular time-use studies , and international organizations and research institutions should provide technical assistance to developing countries in valuing and making visible women 's unpaid work . 
Successful efforts at the regional level demonstrate the feasibility of this undertaking and constitute proof of the ability of the international community to arrive at common concepts and to devise generally acceptable methods and strategies that would form the basis of improved and effective international cooperation .  
Invites donor countries , the United Nations Development Programme and multilateral financial institutions to provide landlocked and transit developing countries with appropriate financial and technical assistance in the form of grants or concessional loans for the construction , maintenance and improvement of their transport , storage and other transit-related facilities , including alternative routes and improved communications , and to promote subregional , regional and interregional projects and programmes ;  
The United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) has implemented HIV / AIDS prevention projects in sub-Saharan Africa , to meet the combined objectives of industrial development and the prevention of the spread of HIV / AIDS . UNIDO is supporting improved access to and affordability of products used in prevention programmes condoms , latex gloves , syringes , HIV-1 / 2 test kits through development of local manufacturing capability . 
Convinced that a stable and transparent environment for commercial transactions in all countries is essential for the mobilization of investment , finance , technology , skills and other important resources across national borders , in order to promote growth and development , and recognizes in this context , that effective efforts at all levels to combat corruption and bribery are essential elements of an improved international business environment ;  
Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access , trade practices , access to technology , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
A simple step in this direction would be to record in a succinct and simple form the principal lessons learned from Habitat 's experience over the last five years in at least two of the main areas in which Habitat will be active in the foreseeable future and then see whether the lessons learned have improved the quality of programme and projects design and implementation .  
This includes improved contribution to the work of those bodies on the development and updating of a wide range of international legal instruments , regulations and recommendations that provide a common technical and legal basis for the development of coherent international infrastructure networks , for the improvement of the efficiency , safety and environmental performance of the transport sector and for the facilitation of border crossing .

There will be particular emphasis on strengthened planning and recruitment systems and methods , taking full account of the principle of equitable geographical distribution and gender balance ; staff learning , training and career development ; managed staff reassignment programmes ; established managerial competencies ; support to organizational and managerial reform ; improved work environment and managerial practices ; and better technical human resources management services and support to departments and offices .  
In a world of integrated financial markets and rapid capital movements , it is also essential to ensure the soundness of the banking system through prudential regulations , better assessment of credit risks , stringent capital requirements , actions to prevent money laundering , improved management of banks and better regulation of security markets .  
The quantitative efforts set out above should be complemented with measures to improve the qualitative aspects of international development cooperation , particularly : a better focus on its distribution ; greater national capacities to coordinate national and international resources ; improved national ownership of externally financed programmes ; international cooperation based on national priorities , involving other development partners , including civil society ; and strengthened national capacities to plan for , manage , monitor and evaluate the impact of development cooperation .  
There is a need for concerted action by all countries and for improved cooperation to assist developing countries in implementing the relevant agreements and instruments in order that they may participate effectively in the sustainable use , conservation and management of their fishery resources , as provided for in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and other international legal instruments , and achieve integrated coastal zone management . 
With the advance of the Allied Democratic Forces for the Liberation of the Congo ( ADFL ) in eastern Zaire and the consequent elimination of rear bases of armed Hutu rebels close to the Burundi-Zaire border , the security situation in Burundi gradually improved during the first months of 1997 , though strong pockets of rebels remained within the former Zaire ( now the Democratic Republic of the Congo ) near Fizi , Kalemie and Moba - enabling them to launch operations against targets in Burundi , including the Government 's military strongholds of Bururi and Makamba provinces .  
In the case of illicit transfers , which often rely on criminal organizations , countries should focus on improved national legislative measures and their effective implementation , and on improving international cooperation and coordination to prevent illegal transfers , including customs and police cooperation .  
We also believe that concerted action at the international level can greatly benefit from closer and improved subregional and regional cooperation , which constitute a necessary complement to the global approach that is essential to deal with the dangers posed by the transnational forms of crime .  
Other measures taken included the provision of additional developed land and adequate financial assistance , the promotion of energy-saving building materials and cost-effective construction technologies , the upgrading of unusable housing , special programmes for the disadvantaged and for women , programmes linking improved housing to the eradication of poverty , the support for development of the informal sector , the introduction of land reform , and public and private-sector partnerships .  
In the context of the achievements of a first generation of policy reforms in terms of trade liberalization , price stability , lower fiscal deficits and improved balance of payments , the Group believes that a dynamic and competitive environment , underpinned by competition policy and legislation adequately tailored to a countrys specific circumstances , is an essential characteristic of successful second _ generation policy reforms .  
Consultations and coordination with IMF , the World Bank and other relevant specialized organizations , including UNCTAD and the regional commissions ; provision of improved global on-line access to the LINK model and its analytical databases to other bodies of the United Nations system and to Member States ; and external relations with academic , governmental and non-governmental economic research institutes through the exchange of background papers and consultations .  7A . 8 During the biennium the following activities will be undertaken :

While the situation of human rights in Croatia had been improving constantly since the end of the conflict and since the Croatian Governments establishment of control over the entire territory of Croatia , and while that situation had definitely improved in Bosnia and Herzegovina , it had worsened in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , where numerous conflicts had broken out and there had been a renewed outbreak of human rights violations .  
In terms of national strategies , many countries had undertaken policies aimed at strengthening fiscal performance , increasing domestic savings , strengthening financial sectors by improved regulation and monitoring and greater capital requirements , and increasing macroeconomic stability .  
Noting with concern that , during the assessment and review of progress made at its nineteenth special session , the General Assembly concluded that although some progress had been made , especially at the local level , the overall trends with respect to the global environment had not improved , and emphasizing that the implementation of Agenda 21 in a comprehensive manner remains vitally important and is now more urgent than ever ,  
Success in using this tool to promote improved forest management will depend on the existence of mutually supportive and effective management institutions ; the political will to implement appropriate policies ( including regulation ) ; and physical parameters , such as the level of sustainable harvest and cost of production .  
Examples of such issues included whether changes of historic realities had caused some existing legal provisions to become irrelevant , whether some instruments and / or mechanisms provided for within the instruments were too cumbersome or confusing and should therefore be improved , and whether some provisions within the instruments were being interpreted and implemented differently by various States parties .  
The objectives of these conferences were to improve the scientific understanding of and the ability to predict the environmental and societal impacts of the phenomena , and to define improved operational and institutional approaches to reducing damage from future occurrences .  
Since the most recent triennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system , coordination had greatly improved , the resident coordinator system had been strengthened and cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions in such areas as humanitarian assistance , post-conflict peace-building and regional-level operations had increased .  
In that context , it was important to explore the many proposals put forward , including that of the Intergovernmental Group of 24 on International Monetary Affairs on the establishment of a task force of developed and developing countries to design a more effective surveillance mechanism for international financial and capital flows , as well as improved national information systems .  
It works for international understanding , for improved social and economic conditions and for basic human rights for all people ; and acts in cooperation with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations in matters of common concern .  
Given the limited staffing capacity of the Service , its operations are more reactive than proactive : a greater focus on Headquarters strategic planning and staff resource management would lead to improved service delivery and increased effectiveness in meeting operational and administrative needs in the field .  
There will be increased understanding of crime trends and emerging challenges in crime prevention and criminal justice , improved expertise for Member States to draw upon and enhanced international cooperation in addressing crime prevention and criminal justice concerns that require a concerted international response .  
To this end , the Section will build on existing legal advice and assistance programmes to expand its capacity to facilitate the exchange of relevant information between countries and relevant entities , including through the use of improved modern technology , promote subregional and regional agreements through meetings , memoranda of understanding and by the provision of model agreements , as well as further develop training programmes for judicial and prosecutorial personnel .  
At its nineteenth special session , the General Assembly stated that while energy is essential to economic and social development and improved quality of life , sustainable patterns of production , distribution and use of energy are crucial . 
The core programmatic actions which will be supported include youth education and mobilization , voluntary counselling and testing , interventions to prevent mother-to-child transmission , strengthened action to prevent and treat sexually transmitted diseases , distribution of condoms , improved community standards of care , treatment of common opportunistic infections , and special services for families with orphans .  
The economic recovery programme and economic policy measures laid the foundation for accelerated privatization in FRY , opening up of the economy and other measures aimed at increased productivity , starting with improved conditions of business operations and the creation of real possibilities for enterprises to rid themselves of redundant workers , as well as at resolving employment issues and providing for the subsistence of these workers outside enterprises .

The studies carried out in those areas have all contributed to a better understanding of the real conditions prevailing in the country and have led to the adoption of better focused development plans and strategies , which in turn have improved the management of physical , human and financial resources and have guaranteed their rational use , while also yielding a corresponding increase in productivity .  
Later , programme targets were declared by the IDNDR Scientific and Technical Committee to encourage all countries to conduct a national hazard risk assessment ; incorporate a sustained disaster mitigation strategy into the national economic development plan ; and ensure improved access to effective early warning practices at all levels of responsibility .  
Took note of the information provided by the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) on how to sign / ratify the Tampere Convention which provides a legal framework for the use of telecommunications in international humanitarian assistance ; ( i ) Noted that the considerable recent advances in seasonal weather and climate predictions , including of such phenomena as El Nio , enable improved preparedness of vulnerable communities against natural disasters .  
Progress in domestic economic reforms , though varying from country to country , and the improved international environment , notably less unfavourable commodity prices and more stable global financial markets , have been instrumental in improving the outlook .  
There are various reasons for this : the lagged growth cycle in many emerging market economies ; the former high levels of interest rates in some of these countries , especially in real terms ; the greater , though still limited , degree of independence gained for monetary policy in the many countries that have embraced floating exchange-rate regimes ; and the improved international and domestic financial conditions in many countries . 
The internationalization of the economy of the United States as well as of that of most countries as a result of improved communications , declining transport costs , trade liberalization , and global financial integration has stimulated a wide range of economic activities and changed the international division of labour in many industries . 
The inspection covered two aspects : first on the basis of the reasoning that sound central services provide a logical staging ground for common services , the inspection examined how the central support services in areas included in the Secretary-Generals plan to strengthen common services had improved or otherwise effected changes in the work approaches that would enhance cost-effectiveness , quality of services delivered and timeliness .  
India considers that the integration of environmental and developmental concerns is essential for the fulfilment of basic needs and ensuring improved living standards for all , better protected and managed ecosystems and a safer and more prosperous future .  
Decisive action at the national and international levels will determine whether these consequences will be either a downward spiral of increased poverty and environmental degradation or the achievement of sustainable development and improved quality of life for our people .  
Initiated in January 1998 , this process was broadened over the course of the last year to engage a wide range of non-state actors - - including major human rights and humanitarian NGOs , United Nations sister agencies and the corporate sector - - in a series of dialogues on the nature and dimensions of the current protection challenges ; where the main problems lie ; and what States and organizations might do together with UNHCR to ensure improved and sustained support for protection principles .  
The IDNDR secretariat and its key partners within the International Framework of Action accepted this challenge and engaged in a structured and concerted approach towards the Yokohama follow-up , taking in the evolved strategic orientation described in paragraph 15 above and striving towards further improved interface with all relevant United Nations system sectors , as described below .  
Noting with appreciation the concerted international efforts made , in particular through the Inter _ Agency Task Force on El Nio , in close cooperation with member agencies of the Inter _ Agency Committee on the Climate Agenda , to reduce the impact of natural disasters related to the El Nio phenomenon through improved scientific understanding , close monitoring and the dissemination of timely forecasts to communities affected ,  
While the transparency commitments made under the SPS Agreement had improved the flow of information on SPS-related regulations of WTO member countries , an application of country-specific SPS requirements beyond what was recommended as an international standard saddled developing country producers and exporters with additional costs to meet disparate SPS measures on the same product in different markets .  
Such activities are intended to promote energy efficiency and demand-side management ; clean energy technologies ; more widespread development and application of renewable energy technologies ; improved access to modern energy services by rural populations ; capacity-building and institutional development ; energy sector planning and management to achieve the economic , social and environmental objectives of sustainable development ; and the promotion of environmentally sound energy technologies .

She stated that specific action related to the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries required action on many fronts , notably , improvement of physical factors as regards inadequate infrastructure as well as trade balances , transport systems , better utilization of assets and improved managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
The project will lead to the development or harmonization of relevant legal instruments and to improved coordination among the concerned institutions and , based on an analysis of the institutional capacity to respond to that form of crime , will contribute to the development of a national strategy and elements of a subregional strategy against trafficking in human beings .  
A United Nations Childrens Fund ( UNICEF ) nutrition survey , conducted in April and May , confirmed that overall nutritional standards in Bahr Al Ghazal had improved , but from a very low initial level : the average global malnutrition rate , in fact , was 22 per cent .  
Thus based on consensus , arrangements enabling improved coherence , complementarity and coordination in global policy-making can avoid unnecessary divisiveness and conflict while promoting fruitful forms of international economic cooperation .  
Considerable advances have been achieved in the last five decades in social and economic development , including disease eradication , massive immunization programmes , improved agricultural productivity , increased adult literacy rates , improved sanitation and water systems , and technological advances for production and communication .  
GOOS aims to meet the need for : ( a ) forecasting climate variability and change ; ( b ) assessing the state of health of the marine environment and its resources ( including the coastal zone ) ; and ( c ) supporting an improved decision-making and management process which takes into account potential natural and man-made changes in the environment and their effects on human health and resources .  
She stated that specific action related to the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries required action on two fronts : improvement of physical infrastructure and removal of non-physical obstacles , including better utilization of assets and improved managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .

This was the combined result of the strong rebound in Hong Kong 's exports of goods upon the improved regional and global economic environment and the slack in retained imports reflecting the modest domestic demand for most of the year .  
With exports of services rising on the back of improved regional demand but imports of services still falling amidst a weak local demand , the invisible trade surplus surged to $ 80.7 billion in 1999 , from $ 66.7 billion in 1998 .

Ho Te-hong , Chairman of the Forestry BureauThe Taiwan Forestry Bureau is like the eldest brother or sister in a family who earned money to support their younger brothers or sisters . And after their living standard improved , the younger brothers and sisters , now having grown up , turn around and reject their elder brother or sister , viewing them as good-for nothings or saying that their former jobs were not prestigious enough . When our nation was poor the Taiwan Forestry Bureau struggled to keep our heads above water .

What 's different is , the ones doing best are no longer first-generation immigrants but Chinese Americans born in the U . S . The main reason is that the new wave of immigrants is more of a mixed bag than the previous one . That group , for coincidental reasons , was so high in quality that its like has rarely been seen .

These innovations have greatly increased the practicality of the electric vehicle .  
Fortunately , after years of contention , the situation has slightly improved . Today it is no longer necessary to get approval from the central government for anyone below civil service level 8 . And with regard to the top officials who can make or break the administration of a city or county , the executive has more room to haggle if he or she does not approve of the individual selected by the provincial government . The more influential chiefs can even recommend candidates and ask the provincial government to formally appoint them .

Wang argues that the ideal situation would be to establish " resource classes for hyperactive children . " Hyperactive children having a hard time adjusting could first stay in these resource classes until they showed improved functioning and learning impairments were eliminated . Then , accompanied by a special-ed teacher , they could transfer to a regular class . The special-ed teacher would continue to provide guidance until the child had adjusted .  
In the reign of the Tang emperor Xuanzong ( ruled 712-755 ) , Buddhist Master Yixing ( 673-727 ) , another outstanding astronomer , improved on Zhang Heng 's instrument by making a bronze armillary sphere which revolved through one degree a day and one full revolution per year , and also had two wooden mannikins which beat a drum and a bell to mark the time of day .

What is more important is doing their specialized job and allowing the free competition of the market to decide their success or failure .  
Looking from another angle , after the Communist Party of China had won power , if they had governed well , developed China , fulfilled the calls to " overtake the US and Britain , " and improved the living conditions of the people , then even if Zhang had acted traitorously , even though his actions were morally flawed , the result of these actions would have been that China became rich and strong and he would still be a national hero to be revered through the ages . However , this has not been the reality .  
Few people know of those researchers like Dr . Green who have quietly toiled for many years at Taiwan 's one and only international organization , the AVRDC . Together these agricultural experts from around the world have developed today 's improved cherry tomatoes , soybeans , and Chinese cabbage . They have raised the quality of Taiwan 's fruits and vegetables , and helped innumerable farmers in Southeast Asia , South Asia , Africa and Latin America raise their incomes and improve their nutrition .  
In addition to improving the quality and quantity of vegetable production , its efforts allowed young soybeans to become a major agricultural export for Taiwan , which improved farmers ' incomes and earned foreign exchange for the country . Chou says that the center has also , over the years , nurtured a large pool of skilled personnel from both overseas and Taiwan .  
The visit has undoubtedly helped to promote a deeper understanding of Taiwan on the other side of the Taiwan Strait . In the midst of these positive signs , however , China surprised Taiwan by resuming diplomatic relations on 23 April with Guinea Bissau . This development was a slap in the face for Taiwan , which has lost diplomatic relations with yet another country . This naked reminder of China 's unflagging campaign to isolate Taiwan internationally makes a mockery of budding hopes for improved cross-strait relations .  
In another situation , a performer in a flashy costume showed off his improved version of the once popular robot dance . Like a newly wound musical doll , he danced to the mechanical drum beats with an elated expression . Occasionally , he would interact with the tourists passing by , generating cheers as well as showers of coins .  
With improved technology , doctors rely increasingly on machines , and are unwilling to make any judgments before tests are completed . One book called Why Things Bite Back tells the true story of a Stanford University medical student who had a stomach ailment for four weeks . He entered the university hospital , and underwent a series of painful tests , and was told that the problem was with his appendix . But a retired old doctor only had to hear his descriptions of his symptoms , and that veteran physician knew immediately what the problem was .  
As economic conditions and the quality of life have improved , people today naturally value life far more highly than in former times .

Bearing in mind the rapid pace and interdependence of global , political , social and economic developments , and their implications for all countries , particularly the developing countries , and that there is a critical need for improved efficiency and effective public institutions , administrative procedures and sound financial management to harness these challenges in support of sustainable development in all countries ,  
These challenges include the completion of the reconstruction and rehabilitation of networks damaged during the wars and occurrences of civil strife that have plagued the region during the past decade ; the standardization of technical specifications , harmonization of border crossing procedures , and removal of non-physical trade and transport barriers ; and the improved maintenance of the existing infrastructure and equipment which is not considered , as is the case in other developing countries , among the priority areas for regular funding .  
To that end , the inventory of effective strategies , approaches , projects and programmes to reduce illicit demand and supply maintained by the Programme will be improved and expanded , and effective countermeasures tailored to local conditions against drug abuse , cultivation of illicit crops and drug trafficking will be developed .  
The control of water use in irrigated agriculture can be addressed in various ways , such as levying penalties for water use in excess of water requirements projected for the next growing season , or by promoting the adoption of more efficient irrigation systems to replace the traditional techniques , for example , by making available low-interest loans contingent on the purchase and installation of improved irrigation equipment . 
With the successful design , development , launch and in-orbit performance of the first generation of the Indian remote sensing satellite ( IRS ) , India was surging ahead to provide improved and enhanced data services from the second generation remote sensing satellites , IRS-1C and IRS-1D . IRS-1C , which was launched on 6 December 1995 , was characterized by an improved spatial resolution , extended spectral bands , stereo viewing and faster revisit capability .  
The Committee concluded that global demand was likely to increase for the foreseeable future , mainly as a result of the continuing increase in global population through most of the next century , and of the demand for improved living standards in developing countries .

The FAO Committee on Fisheries in March 1995 endorsed the creation of a Fisheries Technical Assistance Programme for small island developing States , focusing on the following priority areas , as identified by countries : institutional strengthening and capacity-building ; conservation and management of fisheries in the exclusive economic zone ; improved post-harvest management and marketing ; safety at sea ; strengthening the economic role of national fisheries industries ; and aquaculture and inland fisheries conservation and management .  
The Board recommended that action be taken to establish a reliable unified management information system and a comprehensive database , including high-value procurement cases that were exempted from the bidding process ; that detailed guidelines be established on the methods of invitation to bid covering the various aspects of procurement ; and that the requirements and appropriate categories of goods and services that could be covered by systems contracts be identified in advance through improved procurement planning ( A / 51 / 5 ( Vol . I ) , sect .  
Much more information is needed regarding the actual and potential costs on various alternative routes available to the Central Asian republics as a basis for regional and national decisions on transport priorities for investment in infrastructure , technical assistance , training , better management and improved cooperative arrangements .  More precise information , available to all parties , would result in far more effective cooperation concerning rates and conditions on existing or proposed alternative routes .  
It is desirable for the information systems to be Internet-based for this would allow easy access and information-sharing among multilateral agencies , countries ' institutions , non-governmental organizations and other interested parties .  The Panel may wish to invite relevant multilateral forest agencies and international organizations to review and initiate the development of improved information systems that support activities for sustainable forest management , particularly so as to facilitate private sector investment , speed up technology transfer to developing countries and improve coordination in financial assistance .  
It should also focus on improved cooperation and implementation by national Governments of bilateral and multilateral forest-related planning activities and programmes , and the use of national-level participatory approaches to that end . "  The Panel also decided to schedule programme element I . 1 for initial discussion at its second session ( Geneva , 11-22 March 1996 ) , and for substantive discussion at its third session ( Geneva , 9-20 September 1996 ) .  
Finally , as will be discussed below , improved information on markets and revenues is required in order to assess the additional financial assistance that may be needed by low-income producer countries if they are to adopt sustainable forest management and the most efficient and equitable international mechanism for providing that assistance .  
Urges the funds and programmes of the United Nations system to finalize work on the harmonization of their budget presentations in time for a final decision to be made by their respective executive boards in advance of the biennium 1998-1999 , and to include in this work a common presentational framework for the budget based on agreed definitions and usage of budget terms and the identification of additional steps required for further harmonization and improved transparency ;  
" To that end , in certain subregions , coordination of bilateral and multilateral technical assistance to combat illicit trafficking of drugs and precursors will be improved , taking into account national priorities and in a continuous dialogue with the competent national authorities " .  
Governments as enabling partners should create and strengthen effective partnerships with women , youth , the elderly , persons with disabilities , vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities , local authorities , the private sector and non-governmental organizations in each country " .  It further indicates that " national mechanisms should be established or improved , as appropriate , to coordinate actions at all relevant government levels that have an impact on human settlements and to assess this impact prior to governmental actions " .  
In 1994 , the United States of America , Canada , the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Australia experienced relatively strong economic growth ; economic recovery accelerated in continental Europe ; Japan started to show signs of improved economic activities ; and the developing economies experienced above average growth rates .  
In any case , the Special Rapporteur has raised questions and issues which need to be resolved in the light of improved knowledge of the facts and specific reports and following a systematic analysis that will produce suggestions and proposals for the adoption of political , legal and operational criteria concerning mercenary activities .  
Under the theme of governance , UNIFEM is continuing to build on its three-pronged strategy to ( a ) create an enabling environment where the legal and social status of women is improved , and more gender-sensitive policies and plans are not only developed but also implemented ; ( b ) strengthen the women 's movement so that it is able to create an enabling environment and effect social change ; and ( c ) promote women 's enhanced leadership and participation .  
A growing need for effective and timely measures to address urgent water problems that are often directly or indirectly related to agricultural water uses , such as water scarcity and environmental degradation , has increased the demands for improved decision-making , clear water policies , and adequate legal and institutional frameworks at the national level .  
The Secretary-General submitted to the Commission a report that provided an overview of the differences and similarities between transnational organized crime and terrorist crimes , as well as a summary of the responses received from States . 8 / The report concluded that , while the links between transnational organized crime and terrorist crimes are usually more circumstantial than institutional , both forms of crime present formidable challenges to the international community and require improved international cooperation .  
Starting in 1995 , political and economic transition in Mozambique has shown promising signs of a return to stability and normality : peace , national reconciliation and the vitality of the young democracy have taken root ; parliamentary performance improved noticeably ; one has witnessed an open , free and lively interface between government , legislature and media ; overall the social climate remained calm ; resettlement of internally displaced people and returning refugees was consolidated ; reintegration of demobilized soldiers has been relatively free of major disruption ;  
During the 1996 CG meeting donors ' interventions were characterized by three " leitmotifs " or central themes : need for greater government accountability ( as opposed to mere statements of good intentions ) and improved governance , most importantly to combat corruption ; need for more rapid economic growth to reduce poverty , through boosting supply response ; and need for deepening the democratization process , through in particular multi-party local elections .  
The veto power , flawed in principle as it was and remains , may have had a useful purpose during the cold war era , but with the improved international environment and , indeed , the increase of diplomatic avenues to resolve differences , the continued existence of the veto is as undemocratic as it is irrelevant .  
" Recognizing that effective efforts at all levels to combat and avoid corruption and bribery in all countries are essential elements of an improved international business environment , that they enhance fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions and form a critical part of promoting transparent and accountable governance , economic and social development and environmental protection , and that such efforts are especially pressing in the increasingly competitive globalized international economy ,

Although the Department of Peacekeeping Operations had established a number of bodies to increase its effectiveness , acquired considerable experience in that area and carried out many studies , Mozambique was concerned to see that the Organization remained slow to respond to conflict situations and that it repeated errors which had been committed in past operations .  Cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations must be improved .  
Concrete measures which had been identified included improved police training methods , a protection programme for witnesses of human rights violations , assistance to victims of violent crimes , transfer to civilian courts of competence to try military police crimes , and federal investigation of human rights violations .  
The representative of Norway , a country with which Burundi had excellent cooperative relations , had , at a previous meeting , said that the coup d ' \ x { 5f4b } at that had taken place in Burundi in 1995 had not improved the security or human rights situation but , on the contrary , had exacerbated the suffering of the people .  
The right to development was thus essential to the peoples of developing countries , who needed higher incomes , improved social , health and education services and a chance to escape from extreme poverty and enjoy better living conditions if they were to be able to make a constructive contribution to the development of democratic systems that would guarantee full respect for their human rights .  
" Recognizing also that effective efforts at all levels to combat and avoid corruption and bribery in all countries are essential elements of an improved international business environment , that they enhance fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions and form a critical part of promoting transparent and accountable governance , economic and social development and environmental protection in all countries , and that such efforts are especially pressing in the increasingly competitive globalized international economy ,

Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access and access to international financial markets , flow of financial resources , trade practices , access to technology and technological infrastructure , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Stresses the importance for developing countries of continuing their efforts to promote a favourable environment for attracting foreign investment , thereby promoting economic growth and sustainable development , and stresses the need for the international community to promote a conducive external economic environment through , inter alia , improved market access , stabilization of exchange rates , effective stewardship of international interest rates and increased resource flows , as well as improved access to technology for the developing countries ;  
The following questions arose concerning the current system : the extent to which placement and promotion were tied to merit ; whether the promotion process could be improved to reward performance ; how open decision-making was in that area ; what changes were practical and desirable in policies and procedures ; whether the functioning of the appointment and promotion bodies could be improved ; and whether programme managers could be held more accountable for placement and promotion decisions .  
In an earlier report , JIU had expressed the view that it would be premature and even counterproductive to delegate essential functions before human resources management policies were formulated , all personnel procedures were reviewed and improved , proper demarcation of responsibilities in human resources management was established between OHRM and other offices and departments , and appropriate mechanisms for reporting and accountability were put in place .  
Today , the infrastructure in remote and rural areas can be significantly improved through satellite remote sensing , particularly with respect to natural disaster warning and mitigation , management of water , forest and food resources , planning and operation of transport systems and other supporting activities relating to social and economic development .  
Recognizing also that effective efforts at all levels to combat and avoid corruption and bribery in all countries are essential elements of an improved international business environment , that they enhance fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions and form a critical part of promoting transparent and accountable governance , economic and social development and environmental protection in all countries , and that such efforts are especially pressing in the increasingly competitive globalized international economy ,

The participants of the Second United Nations Regional Conference on Space Technology for Sustainable Development in Africa noted that , as it has been proven in other parts of the world , space technology has tremendous potential for contributing to the economic and social development of countries in Africa , particularly through the improved management of the environment , improved communications , enhanced food security , delivery of services in health care and education , and the mitigation of natural disasters , just to name a few .  
As stated in those agreed conclusions , the Commission considered that its effectiveness and efficiency could be improved through innovative methods of work , including inviting experts to participate in the substantive debate on selected issues as part of the regular work of the Commission .  
The quantitative efforts set out above should be complemented with measures to improve the qualitative aspects of international development cooperation , particularly : a better focus on its distribution ; greater national capacities to coordinate national and international resources ; improved national ownership of externally financed programmes ; international cooperation based on national priorities , involving other development partners , including civil society ; and strengthened national capacities to plan for , manage , monitor and evaluate the impact of development cooperation .  
This affirmative vote will , however , reflect more our firm and overriding attachment to the overall process of codification and progressive development of international law , rather than a strong conviction that the text of the draft Convention now before us is a fully satisfactory and balanced one which could not have been improved in some of its major aspects .  
While disseminating information about the Court through traditional methods is to be welcomed and further encouraged , my delegation believes that the use of advanced technology in enhancing public awareness about the Court and its activities should be improved .  To this end , we express strong support for the steps taken by the Court to take advantage of the benefits provided by the electronic media , such as the Internet , and in particular the construction of its own website , which should facilitate public access to the Court 's voluminous documents .  
Future international action should address the oceans , particularly the sustainable use of marine resources through improved environmental approaches to marine ecology ; the protection and sustainable use of fresh water and wetland habitats , particularly in arid regions ; the protection and sustainable use of forests and woodlands ; and the problems of hazardous chemicals .  
The scope for female employment has been rapidly expanded by technological change , increasing concentration of employment in service industries , increased flexibility of work times and availability of part-time work , changing social attitudes towards female employment , and improved provision of childcare .  
A useful model for developing improved partnerships with non-governmental organizations is the PARinAC initiative of UNHCR , which emphasizes the formulation of common principles and goals and the creation of an umbrella framework for action and extensive consultative processes involving non-governmental organizations at the country , regional and international levels .  
The Plan of Action is based on three cardinal principles : the central role of an improved statistical system in economic and social development ; the key role of ECA in the development and promotion of statistics in Africa without prejudice to the role of other agencies and donors ; and the need to coordinate the support provided by international agencies and donors .  
According to the information received , the situation of political and civil rights and fundamental freedoms has not improved : arbitrary arrests have taken place on a massive scale in Khartoum and other major towns in the north ; detention without due process was prevalent ; torture and degrading treatment was often reported ; freedom of association , assembly and movement were severely restricted and , where tolerated , tight government control was exercised , accompanied in most cases by the arbitrary acts of those in charge of the implementation of relevant government measures .  
Their declaration recognized that public-private partnerships not only foster sustainable cities , but also generate profitable opportunities for business through increased productivity , a better educated and dynamic work force and improved infrastructure .  
The project has six immediate objectives : ( a ) increased awareness and improved understanding of the money-laundering phenomenon and acceptance of the need for countermeasures ; ( b ) introduction of relevant legislation , inter alia , promoting mutual legal assistance ; ( c ) improved global infrastructure , including the delivery of training services ; ( d ) improved capacity of legal and related law enforcement systems , including the establishment of financial intelligence units or similar bodies ; ( e ) reduced financial system vulnerability ; and ( f ) improved process of performance evaluation .

Its strategy was based on a number of measures , which were summarized as legislative provisions in the areas of proceeds of crime , improvement of law enforcement capabilities , relying on the assistance and expertise of other countries that had already experienced organized crime problems and had developed methods to prevent and control it , better coordination among the relevant national authorities and improved international cooperation .  
His Government welcomed new mechanisms for funding and for improved financial management and supported the current reforms of the administrative and financial structure which had the potential to alleviate the financial burdens of the Organization . However , the objective of the reform must be to improve performance ; the downsizing of the Secretariat must be designed to make it more efficient and less bureaucratic and should not lead to any impairment of its effectiveness .  
It is united by shared organizational values and managerial principles that foster effective teamwork , high standards and managerial and individual responsibility and clear norms of staff conduct ; is secure in the justness of its accountability framework and in the provisions for staff empowerment , recognition and sanctions which that framework actively guarantees .  45 .  It has improved leadership styles and has established among all staff a strong culture of efficiency and professionalism .  
It is a dynamic long-term process , including economic and social development as essential elements , seen in perspectives that may change over time , and leading to improved quality of life for all human beings , the eradication of poverty and the reduction of inequality .  
Handling guidelines , better inventories , and improved treatment are typical preventive strategies for the management of hazardous waste ; reduction strategies and enhanced treatment are used for solid wastes , with reduction targets established in some countries .  
While recognizing that forest land rehabilitation would be required in many areas and that that would need international assistance , including financial resources and technology transfer to support local and national efforts , the Panel emphasized the need for prevention , rather than mitigation and restoration , wherever practicable , with emphasis on improved and sustainable management of existing natural forest and other vegetation .  
Altogether , the new directions report contains 20 major recommendations that touch on other issues such as the formulation of national TCDC policies , the strengthening of national TCDC focal points , the reorientation of capacity and needs matching exercises , the promotion of " triangular cooperation " , the establishment of improved linkages with the private sector and non-governmental organizations , and the identification of new funding arrangements for TCDC , including the formulation of subject-specific TCDC " products " that could attract special funding on the basis of their intrinsic importance .  
These were the accession of more developing countries and economies in transition to WTO ; improvements in the human and administrative capacities of developing countries , leading to their greater involvement in initiatives in the WTO and in the regional trading arrangements ; and an improved understanding of the developmental dimension of the trade and environment nexus .  
There are departmental directors in the nine regions and each of the main police stations is now headed by a commissaire ; salaries are paid more regularly ; many stations have received basic equipment ; radio links have been established between departmental headquarters and HNP headquarters in Port-au-Prince ; and cooperation with the judiciary has improved .  
Early implementation of key public investments would result not only in increased aggregate demand , employment and incomes , but in a recovery of private investment - an essential factor for a more sustained , self-reliant economic growth and significantly improved security .  
Consultations and coordination with IMF , the World Bank and other relevant specialized organizations , including UNCTAD and the regional commissions ; provision of improved global on-line access to the LINK model and its analytical databases to other bodies of the United Nations system and to Member States ; external relations with a network of non-governmental research institutes through the exchange of background papers and informal consultations .  
The Committee took note of the annual overview report of ACC , welcomed its new improved format , commended the Secretariat for a concise and well focused report , and requested that future reports be more analytical than descriptive .  
The themes that recurred in the reports and their presentation acknowledged the role of new technologies introduced in order to generate digital geographical data for improved map production purposes and to feed geographical information systems ( GIS ) as essential tools for supporting better planning of sustainable development and environmental management . 
There is an increased use in the region of satellite imagery and global positioning systems ( GPS ) ; geodetic networks are being improved ; and there is a continuing need to maintain topographic and thematic mapping and a priority need to produce data and maps in support of cadastre .  
The promotion and maintenance of the child 's health through strengthened safe motherhood ; breastfeeding , and improved weaning ; universal immunization ; control of diarrhoeal diseases and respiratory infections ; and other existing public health programmes . 
The resulting improved and sustained macroeconomic stability in several least developed countries and the good weather conditions and strength in the international demand for the exports of African least developed countries are the main reasons for the third year of relatively strong growth and rising per capita output in the least developed countries .  
While the overall economic performance in the least developed countries has improved , poverty remains pervasive and the majority of the population in the least developed countries suffers from reduced caloric intakes , increased mortality and morbidity , the re-emergence and spread of disease and lower school enrolment .  
The motor of that process was the promotion of an enabling environment that would ensure increased access for the poor to economic services and industrial goods , given that the great majority of poor people in rural areas were self-employed and that their prosperity depended on their having direct access to more and improved means of production .  
There is a need for concerted action by all countries and for improved cooperation to assist developing countries in implementing the relevant agreements and instruments in order that they may participate effectively in the sustainable use , conservation and management of their fishery resources , as provided for in the Convention and other international legal instruments , and achieve integrated coastal zone management .  
These initiatives focused on increased use of alternative transportation fuels ( e.g . , natural gas ) , support for urban public transport , and improved transportation planning and regulation .  
In addition , an extraordinary appropriation of $ 1-million was approved by the Governing Council , comprising $ 500,000 for studies requested by the Governing Council for activities directly related to the implementation of improved management and administrative practices by UNEP , and $ 500,000 for the costs associated with the anticipated special session of the Governing Council in the event that these costs are not covered by the regular budget of the United Nations .  
The quantitative efforts set out above should be complemented by measures to improve the qualitative aspects of international development cooperation , particularly a better focus on its distribution ; greater national capacities to coordinate national and international resources ; improved national ownership of externally financed programmes ; international cooperation based on national priorities , involving other development partners , including civil society ; and strengthened national capacities to plan for , manage , monitor and evaluate the impact of development cooperation .  
His delegation hoped that appropriate measures would be taken at the national and international levels to ensure that the benefits of foreign direct investment were shared by as many developing countries as possible , since such investment played a critical role not only in terms of capital flow but also served as a channel for the transfer of technology and improved access to international export markets .  
Nuclear testing is continuing using non-explosive techniques ; existing weapons are being improved ; new types of weapons are being designed : all indications that CTBT is set to start a new technology race in the quest for more innovative and more lethal nuclear weapons .  
The speaker said that significant changes would be required in order to increase the flow of FDI to a meaningful size in areas such as governance , development of an enabling policy environment and sustained policy reforms , and an improved partnership between the public and private sectors .  
The results had been reduced government expenditure , improved economic administration , a stabilized Yemeni rial , promotion of private sector activities , enactment of transparent investment and trade policies , agricultural privatization , giving priority to technical education and starting the implementation of a social security system .  
While the quality of United Nations programmes in the field of science and technology for development had improved , the question of how to bridge the gap between those countries that generated and utilized new scientific ideas and modern technologies , and those countries which were unable to do so remained one of the major challenges facing the international community .  
In that light , agency programming through 1997 has evolved to reflect several new developments , including an increased orientation towards reconstruction projects and confidence-building measures , support for capacity-building of local authorities in the health , education and social welfare sectors , improved targeting of beneficiaries and more consolidated and integrated projects oriented towards employment / income generation .  
Unless national and local capabilities for basic early warning functions are improved within individual countries , external enhancements in hazard forecasting and telecommunications will not necessarily lead to successful mitigation practices .  
The objective of programming in this area is to increase understanding of the socio-economic determinants of the HIV epidemic at a policy level , among Governments , and in the private sector and civil society , resulting in policies and programmes to promote an improved and effective response to the epidemic .  
Success will be measured by the number of additional jobs and improved livelihoods generated by new investments , increased trade and development of infrastructure , and the cooperative mechanisms established and strengthened to ensure sustainability and promote peaceful and productive development among the member States .  
The objectives of this project are to help to formulate sound human development policies through : ( a ) the preparation of national human development reports , combined with an annual regional human development report ; and ( b ) the development of improved statistics on human development indicators , including reports on social trends by countries , the latter in close cooperation with ECE . 13 .  Subregional workshops will bring together specialists responsible for national human development reports and from the national statistical offices .  
A substantial proportion of maternal deaths , approximately 13 per cent , result from complications associated with unsafe abortion . 4 The Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development has recognized unsafe abortion to be a major public-health issue and recommended that the recourse to abortion be reduced through expanded and improved family planning services . 
Invites donor countries , the United Nations Development Programme and multilateral financial institutions to provide landlocked and transit developing countries with appropriate financial and technical assistance in the form of grants or concessional loans for the construction , maintenance and improvement of their transport , storage and other transit-related facilities , including alternative routes and improved communications , and to promote subregional , regional and interregional projects and programmes ;  
This entails conducive macro and sectoral policies , as well as a transparent and simple regulatory framework ; provision of necessary infrastructure ; improved access to credit , technology and markets ; extension services geared towards improving product design and quality of goods produced ; and support services for improved linkages with other sectors of the economy .  
Expresses the conviction that a stable and transparent environment for commercial transactions in all countries is essential for the mobilization of investment , finance , technology , skills and other important resources across national borders , in order to promote growth and development , and recognizes in this context that effective efforts at all levels to combat corruption and bribery are essential elements of an improved international business environment ;  
Paragraph 22.2 should read : " The programme aims at a major strengthening of coordination for human rights throughout the United Nations system leading to a comprehensive and integrated approach to the promotion and protection of human rights based on the contributions of each of the United Nations organs , bodies and specialized agencies whose activities deal with the human rights and on improved inter-agency cooperation and coordination .  
That would lead to improved aviation and marine and maritime safety and efficiency , agricultural productivity , forest and range management , weather forecasting for the public , environmental quality and understanding of the climatology and climate variability .  
There is absolutely no doubt that increased international assistance and initiatives for debt relief or cancellation , increased official development assistance to meet agreed targets , private capital flows , increased foreign direct investment , and improved terms of trade would play a catalytic role in Africa 's efforts to achieve economic development .  
The Commission , which at its thirty-fifth session considered the question of employment and sustainable livelihoods , reached certain agreed conclusions that have as their goal productive employment ; decreasing unemployment through improved social services , such as education and health care ; giving loans to the private sector in both urban and rural areas ; and improving information and guidance services .  
The Action Strategy begins with measures representing a set of possible early priority interventions , including land title reform ; a new agricultural development initiative and special agricultural economic zones ; promotion of new manufacturing investment through relocation of labour-intensive industries to create industrial estates in the region ; introduction of modern and appropriate technologies ; marketing systems ; and human resource development , including improved skills . 
Our efforts are focused on trying to establish a common market , within a gradual and continuous process in which the basic stages still need to be rounded off , improved and studied in depth .  
The programme of the workshop covered four main topics : conceptual issues of poverty in old age ; women as one of the groups at risk , and the process known as the feminization of poverty ; specific issues of poverty among other groups at risk ; disabled and single persons ; and ways to create an enabling environment for the improved well-being of older people .  
The need for improved access to funding is recognized by the innovative proposal to establish a global mechanism to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms and to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial financial resources to affected developing country Parties to the Convention .  
Despite the major role that non-governmental organizations play in supporting improved environmental management of the drylands and the strong support of many smaller non-governmental organizations at the negotiations for the Convention , it is disappointing that the larger international non-governmental organizations have not played a more prominent role in the follow-up process .  
Recognizing that , in general , large external capital movements are likely to be the market response to changes in expectations about domestic economic performance , the 1995 meeting of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) Interim Committee enhanced the IMF ability to monitor the economic policies of member countries and increase the transparency of national policies through improved and more timely provision of data .  
These were the accession of more developing countries and economies in transition to WTO ; improvements in the human and administrative capacities of developing countries , leading to their greater involvement in initiatives in the WTO and in the regional trading arrangements ; and an improved understanding of the developmental dimension of the trade and environment nexus .  
These changes have led to the improved economic position of many farmers in some developing countries , but a great number of small and marginal agricultural producers , especially those in ecologically fragile and remote areas , are handicapped in their access to productive resources , and can not benefit fully from the improved overall environment and better price incentives .  
While legal and institutional instruments have definitely improved the basis for sustainable development of oceans and coastal areas , implementation lags behind owing , among other things , to ( a ) the difficulty in making political decisions regarding resources and wealth allocation ; ( b ) the difficulty of improving inadequate or inefficient institutions ; and ( c ) in many cases , difficulties in meeting the related financial commitments .  
While the need for improved information is recognized , the actual trend in the quality and quantity of data and information being gathered and exchanged is decreasing owing to the impact of economic constraints , particularly but not only in developing countries and countries with economies in transition , and , often , the lack of real priority accorded by Governments .  
It is expected that about two thirds of the increases in agricultural production required to meet projected increases in effective demand will come as a result of improved yields from land currently under cultivation in developing countries , much of which is irrigated .  
Dependence on aquaculture ( mainly inland ) for an important part of future net increases in fish consumption will require improved management of freshwater resources , protection of aquaculture sites from industrial and urban pollution , as well as protection of coastal areas , wetlands and mangrove swamps from irresponsible coastal aquaculture practices .  
This analysis is considered a starting point and focuses on two main elements : ( a ) global interception rates at a time of expansion of international trade and transportation and improved illicit drug trafficking methods ; and ( b ) law enforcement approaches applied in order to improve interception rates and their range of application in selected key trafficking regions .  
A typical example of the technical superiority of the traffickers has been their increased use of mobile cellular phones and faxes since the mid-1980s , once law enforcement authorities were known to be legally and technically equipped to carry out successful wire-tapping operations of the traditional phone network ( which showed improved interdiction and arrest results ) .
