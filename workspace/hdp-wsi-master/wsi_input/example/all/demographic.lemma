The Board noted the current position of Hong Kong in the compilation of disability statistics .  Board members were aware that data on persons with disabilities were scattered in various administrative records maintained by different Government departments , statutory bodies and non-governmental organizations .  There was no single and comprehensive data source that could provide a complete picture on the demographic and socio-economic profiles of such persons .  
The estimates derived from the model suggested that about half of the swings in property prices in Hong Kong since the early 1990s could be attributed to changes in fundamental variables , such as macro-economic activity , monetary conditions , demographic movement and public housing supply .  The other half was explained by the build-up of a bubble and its sudden collapse .  
Among reports in the publication plan are a series of thematic reports on population sub-groups .  Thematic reports published earlier include older persons , youths , and women and men .  The report " Hong Kong 2001 Population Census Thematic Report - Ethnic Minorities " provides a comprehensive range of statistics on ethnic minorities in Hong Kong . It goes into some length in analysing the characteristics of ethnic minorities in Hong Kong : demographic characteristics , education , labour force , living arrangement and household characteristics , and geographical characteristics .  
( h ) of the criteria for deciding which districts should be provided with mobile medical services ; whether it has regularly re-assessed if such services should be maintained in the relevant districts in the light of factors such as demographic changes , the demand for such services , the availability of public transport services and networks , as well as the costs for providing the services in these districts ?  
Within the six months it was given to work , the Task Force sought to analyse the main social and economic challenges that our demographic trends readily present to us and have explored a set of practical measures to be taken in the short and medium term to address these challenges . 
An abnormal excess of male over female births in recent demographic statistics is causing many people to be concerned that in future , men will be hard put to find a mate . Others joke that families with daughters will be in great demand .  
Professor Yang Kuo-chu of NTU 's psychology department sums up the situation by saying that in the West , demographic change and equal rights for women have developed over a relatively long period , whereas in Taiwan demographic change has been compressed into a short timeframe , and it is difficult for traditions of male preeminence and of continuation of the male family line to disappear so quickly . These factors , combined with the timely appearance of techniques for determining fetal gender , probably provide the best explanation for the imbalance between male and female births .  
Viewing this demographic shift within its proper historical context , however , sheds a different light on the issue . Water resources were seldom located in the plains ; rather , they were most accessible along the middle reaches of rivers . This was a key reason why Taiwan 's early Hakkas chose to live in the hills .  
Bearing in mind that official statistical information is an essential basis for sustainable development in the economic , demographic , social and environmental fields and for mutual knowledge and trade among the States and peoples of the world ,  
Cognizant of urban transition as an irreversible demographic , economic and societal process which can be a major instrument for securing balanced economic and spatial development and relieve the severe pressure on scarce agricultural land ,  
National access to information on international economic , demographic , social and environmental conditions is essential not only to informed decisionmaking , but also to competitive and effective participation in international markets .  
We are also of the view that additional permanent members should be chosen on the basis , not only of equitable geographical representation , but also of such objective criteria as the political , economic and demographic weight of a country , its capability and proven track record of contributing to the promotion of peace , security and development , both regionally and globally , and its commitment to assume the responsibilities inherent in permanent membership .  
To the traditionally elusive development problems of persistent poverty , debilitating debt , declining levels of official development assistance , unemployment , demographic pressures and the worsening income gap and terms of trade between developed and developing countries , one must add the new and additional challenges of environmental degradation and globalization .  
The Beijing Conference , along with the other global conferences held at Rio , Barbados , Cairo and Copenhagen , have served to buttress the case for an integrated approach to sustainable development , which must be informed by environmental , social , demographic , gender and human - resource considerations .  
An increase in the membership of the Security Council should therefore accommodate new permanent members , which should join on the basis of a combination of these and other appropriate criteria , reflecting , among other things , the new and emerging constellation of Powers and their proven regional and global responsibilities , as well as political , economic and demographic realities .  
These variable criteria are subject to historical , human , demographic , political , economic , territorial and other changes .  
My Government also considers that all the steps and measures taken by the Israeli occupation authorities with the aim of altering the legal status and demographic character of the Palestinian and Arab occupied territories , particularly with regard to Al-Quds , are null and void and constitute a serious breach of international law .  Peace , security , stability and development in the Middle East require the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction in the region , including nuclear weapons .  
In this context , let me thank the Department of Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis , headed by Mr . Jean-Claude Milleron , which is responsible for generating and producing economic , demographic , social and environmental information and for analyzing national and regional development policies and trends .  It also provides technical assistance to developing countries for their projects in the areas of statistics and population .  
Note by the Secretariat on draft decision III , entitled " Contribution of comprehensive national social policies to societal management and to the solving of economic , environmental , demographic , cultural and political problems " , contained in the report of the Commission for Social Development on its thirty-third session ( E / CN . 5 / 1995 / L . 3 ) .  
Awareness should be increased of the fundamental linkages between improving the status of women and demographic dynamics , particularly through women 's access to education , primary and reproductive health care programmes , economic independence and their effective , equitable participation in all levels of decision-making .  
The long forms included a wide range of specific questions on demographic , social and economic characteristics or on special groups of the population ( for example , persons with a disability ) or were utilized to meet the specific requirements of users .  
Sixteen demographic indicators are given : total populations for males , females and both sexes combined ; population density ; female population aged 15-49 ; population under age 15 ; population aged 15-64 ; population aged 65 or over ; average annual rate of population growth ; crude birth and death rates ; total fertility rate ; life expectancies at birth for males , females and both sexes combined ; and infant mortality rate .  
It decided to transmit to the Economic and Social Council a draft resolution on the contribution of comprehensive national policies to societal management and to the solving of economic , environmental , demographic , cultural and political problems ( draft decision III ) .  
Other types of policies are needed for promoting economic growth and trade , changing demographic behaviour , developing human resources , alleviating poverty , promoting the transfer to developing countries of environmentally sound technology and financial resources , and managing natural resources .  
In a document UNCHS prepared for the Conference , on population , urbanization and quality of life , it underlined the positive effects of urbanization on social change and modernization , on fertility , mortality and other demographic trends , on personal and household income levels and on the general economic development of both the rural and urban areas .  
In decision 1993 / 239 , the Economic and Social Council took note of draft decision III , entitled " Contribution of comprehensive national social policies to societal management and to the solving of economic , environmental , demographic , cultural and political problems " , contained in the report of the Commission for Social Development on its thirty-third session , 1 / and requested the Commission to reconsider it at its thirty-fourth session .  
The Economic and Social Council , in decision 1993 / 239 , took note of draft decision III , entitled " Contribution of comprehensive national social policies to societal management and to the solving of economic , environmental , demographic , cultural and political problems " , contained in the report of the Commission for Social Development on its thirty-third session , and requested the Commission to reconsider it at its thirty-fourth session .  
Research themes to be studied from the data are : main facts and trends in vital events and population structures ; social , economic and demographic characteristics of older persons who are institutionalized ( and comparisons with those who are not institutionalized ) ; the living arrangements of older persons ; older persons ' labour-force participation status ; and their economic conditions , mobility patterns and spatial distribution .  
Particularly in Kuwait , Qatar and the United Arab Emirates , relatively large national incomes generated by oil revenues , combined with rapid urbanization , high standards of living , improved health care and gradually declining fertility rates resulting in part from improved education of women , will produce drastic changes in the demographic structure , including the marked ageing trends which have been projected .  
Note by the Secretariat on draft decision III , entitled " Contribution of comprehensive national social policies to societal management and to the solving of economic , environmental , demographic , cultural and political problems " , contained in the report of the Commission for Social Development on its thirty-third session ( E / CN . 5 / 1995 / L . 3 ) .  
The areas to be covered will include economic statistics and national accounts , demographic and social statistics , industry and trade statistics , statistics for special population groups , household surveys , the situation of women , environment statistics , geographical information systems , statistical training , and organization and management of national statistical services .  
Services on organizational and institutional issues affecting national statistical services ; implementation of the 1993 System of National Accounts ; economic , social and demographic statistics ; electronic interchange and networking ; design and development of government information systems ; and technical and substantive support to the Statistical Institute for Asia and the Pacific ;  
Services on economic reforms in the least developed countries ; economic and financial management in Pacific island developing countries ; demographic issues in the Pacific island developing countries ; institutional capability-building , including private sector development for the promotion of industrial investment and technology transfer ; and promotion of sustainable development in small island developing States ; ( b ) Group training , including seminars and workshops .  
National measures for the Year have been successful in raising public awareness of family issues , including increased knowledge of the economic , social , demographic , cultural and other factors affecting families and their members .  
[ 1 ] These demographic trends are expected to be reinforced by negative economic trends : even if global wealth grows , it is expected to further widen the gap between rich and poor , between and within countries . 
The Division is responsible for establishing policies for environmentally sound and sustainable multi-sectoral development plans , the integration of environmental imperatives into the development process , the development of energy and natural resources and the reduction of natural disasters , taking into account technological and economic and demographic development .  
It assists in increasing the statistical capacity of developing countries in their efforts by improving the quality of demographic , social , economic and other statistics in a form suitable for retrieval and dissemination .  
The continuing plundering of the cultural heritage of the Greek Cypriots and the changing demographic structure of the area under Turkish military occupation through massive importation of settlers were two additional characteristics of the unacceptable situation created in Cyprus through the force of arms .  
The Croatian aggression resulted in major and forcible demographic displacement in the areas under the protection of the United Nations forces , i.e . , in mass resettlement and exodus of the Serbian population , violation of human rights , burning and destruction of their property including the Orthodox places of worship and Serbian cultural and historical monuments .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially in the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements , and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory ,  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially in the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements , and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory ,  
demographic trends would be compounded by the economic crisis facing the developing countries : even if global wealth increased , the gap between rich and poor , between and within countries , was likely to widen further and foster social unrest , drug abuse and crime .  
In our view , new permanent members should be chosen on the basis not only of equitable geographic representation , but also of such criteria as political , economic and demographic weight , their capability and proven track record of contributing to the promotion of peace , security and development , both regionally and globally , and their commitment to assuming responsibilities inherent to permanent membership .  
Therefore , any action taken by Israel since the beginning of the Madrid process to alter the political , legal or demographic status of Jerusalem is tantamount to creating a fait accompli to be imposed on the Arab party , which would constitute a judgement on the status of the Holy City before the beginning of the final status negotiations .  This is unacceptable and can not be conducive to the peace we all desire .  
Proposes that , in addition to their special coverage in the World Population Monitoring reports , main demographic trends be covered biennially , starting in 1997 , in a complementary concise report prepared by the Population Division of the Department for Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis of the United Nations Secretariat , to be discussed under the agenda item concerning the work programme of the Population Division ;  
The operative part of the resolution called on Israel to respect the relevant resolutions of the Security Council , declared invalid all Israeli acts in the occupied Syrian Golan , called on Israel to desist from attempting to alter the physical , demographic , institutional and legal character of the occupied Syrian Golan , and referred to the issue of settlements in that territory .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially in the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements , and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory ,  
Recalling that the Committee had requested a summary of the report presented by Ukraine at the Fourth World Conference on Women and had asked for further details of the commitments which Ukraine had made in Beijing , she said that the Ukrainian report to the Conference had described the overall deterioration of the situation of women , the decline in the standard of living , and the worsening demographic situation resulting from economic problems and the impact of the Chernobyl disaster , which continued to consume significant budgetary resources .  
The cross-national and global impacts of unsustainable patterns of production and consumption , particularly in industrialized countries , environmental degradation , demographic changes , widespread and persistent poverty , and social and economic inequality are clearly visible .  
Proposes that , in addition to their special coverage in the World Population Monitoring reports , main demographic trends be covered biennially , starting in 1997 , in a complementary concise report prepared by the Population Division of the Department for Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis , to be discussed under the agenda item concerning the work programme of the Population Division ;  
In the face of these serious challenges to the peace process , we call upon the Security Council to take effective and practical measures that would ensure the realization of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people ; the cessation of the policy of aggression , settlement and Judaization of Jerusalem ; the preservation of its cultural , religious and material heritage , and demographic composition ; and the lifting of the siege against the Palestinian villages and cities .  
Typically , such a process should include ( i ) assessing the hydroclimatic , hydrographic and demographic conditions ; ( ii ) establishing water management objectives ; ( iii ) formulating and evaluating alternative resource management actions , implementation tools and institutional arrangements ; ( iv ) assessing the impacts of promising alternatives ; and ( v ) choosing and implementing the preferred course of action .  
The evolution of an integrated land / water-oriented action plan to achieve a balanced development of the river system , taking into account all relevant factors ( demographic changes , ecological , socio-economic , hydrologic and hydraulic factors , and spatial and agronomic potentials of the basin ) and ensuring proper attention to urban / rural and upstream / downstream competition for water ;  
Thus , the rapid demographic growth of some cities and the movements of landless farm workers in hot , rainy ecosystems are extreme examples of the critical links that exist between demographic dynamics and the natural environment .  
Furthermore , ESCWA published the biennial demographic and related socio-economic indicators on human development and socio-cultural specificity - the case of the Arab world ; the social dimensions of human development ; the situation of disabled women , their marginalization , and measures for social integration in the ESCWA region ; changing values in the Arab family ; and regional perspectives of human settlements in ESCWA countries .  
A major regional project covering 26 countries in eastern Europe and CIS was launched in 1995 and executed by ECE to assist national statistical offices in developing the human resources necessary for building self-sustainable capabilities for the collection , processing and analysis of reliable social and demographic statistics , and enabling the appropriate governmental institutions and agencies of these countries to monitor the social aspects of development .  
We strongly believe that under present circumstances , when Abkhazia is left uninhibited by Georgians , when more than 300,000 refugees and displaced persons remain homeless , disenfranchised and humiliated , and in the face of the present demographic conditions , this decision is not only unlawful but also immoral , capable of damaging the peace process beyond repair .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
The United Arab Emirates , which welcomes the peace process on the basis of international law and the land for peace principle , considers illegal and inadmissible all current Israeli measures aimed at changing the demographic composition and the legal status of the occupied Palestinian and other Arab territories , including the city of Jerusalem , Syrian Golan and southern Lebanon .  
Since Israel 's occupation of East Jerusalem , more than 28 years ago , the Israeli Government has tried to judaize the city by distorting its identity , changing its demographic character , deporting Palestinian inhabitants and reducing their numbers through the application of military , administrative and legal measures , moving settlers into the city and expanding Jerusalem 's borders to prejudice the final status of the city .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
Part four , ( Census products and data utilization ) is designed , in part , to serve as an introduction to users who are unfamiliar with population and housing censuses as a source to meet their needs for demographic and social statistics and , in part , to provide some of the indicators needed to monitor progress on the goals identified in the plans of action adopted by various international conferences held in the 1990s .  
Unfortunately , these gains were nullified by subsequent events , characterized by the ominous statements made by the Israeli Prime Minister and members of his Government and backed by continued military occupation ; land confiscation and settlement in the occupied territories ; construction of housing units in the settlement of Givat Zeev ; demolition of Palestinian houses in the occupied territories ; confiscation of identity documents of Palestinians ; imposition of closures to drain the Palestinian economy , resulting in the loss of potential income ; and systematic change in the physical character and demographic composition of Jerusalem .  
In addition to its influence on the regular programme of work of the Conference , the increase in the number of ECE member countries , which has greatly extended the number of countries in the region in need of technical assistance , has obliged ECE to appoint regional advisers , including on economic statistics , and to seek to provide other forms of technical assistance , such as through a UNDP-funded project in social and demographic statistics .  
Within that meeting , a programme of activities has been developed and the functions of regional and international cooperation in the statistical field have been distributed in the areas of national accounts ; environmental statistics ; dissemination of information ; and social and demographic indicators .  
In 25 years , the population debate has evolved dramatically from a narrow focus on population size and growth rates to a more integrated agenda embracing demographic structures , distribution patterns and urbanization , levels of exploitation of natural resources , and creation of viable agricultural and industrial infrastructures .  
Priority research5 should focus on : coastal areas where populations are growing rapidly and critical resources are being depleted at an accelerated rate , such as on highly urbanized coasts ; soil erosion and desertification , linked with inappropriate land-use practices often brought on by migration patterns ; water scarcity , and misuse and pollution of water resources in both rural and urban areas ; and deforestation resulting from inappropriate shifting cultivation patterns , fuelwood demands , and conversion of forests in upland areas to other uses , linked with demographic pressures among the poorest groups in society .  
This includes reaffirming that all legislative and administrative measures taken by Israel aimed at changing the legal status of Jerusalem and its demographic composition are legally null and void ; that Israeli settlements are illegal and represent a great obstacle on the road to peace ; that the plight of Palestinian refugees must be resolved through their right to return or through compensation ; and that the acquisition of territory by acts of war is inadmissible .  
My delegation , therefore , can not accept any policies adopted or illegal measures taken by Israel in occupied East Jerusalem aimed at judaizing the city and changing its legal status and demographic character to advance its own political and strategic interests .  
Reaffirms that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , is applicable to the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967 , including Jerusalem , and considers any change in the geographic and demographic status of the city of Jerusalem from its situation prior to the June 1967 war to be illegal and void ;  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
The international community of States ( the United Nations , OSCE , CIS and the European Parliament ) , in condemning the policy of " ethnic cleansing " in the form of mass extermination and forcible expulsion of the predominantly Georgian population of Abkhazia , has affirmed the unacceptability of refusing to allow them to return to Abkhazia and of forcibly changing the demographic composition of Abkhazia , Georgia . 
From all the above , the relevant changes in the demographic situation in Abkhazia may be clearly observed , as a result of the systematic genocide and ethnic cleansing carried out by the Ardzinba regime in the occupied territories - and still continuing - directed primarily against the Georgian population .  * A / 52 / 50 .  
The City and its Palestinian population have been subjected to human rights violations resulting from concerted and accelerated efforts by the Israeli authorities to create facts on the ground , such as those affecting the demographic and geographic balance in the city , which would be , if allowed to continue unabated , clearly to the advantage of its Jewish population and have negative implications for the Palestinians , placing them before a fait accompli and pre-empting their future efforts to challenge Israeli sovereignty in East Jerusalem . 
Despite their economic limitations , the developing countries had made strenuous efforts to achieve the objectives of the Programme , and in particular to integrate more fully demographic changes and the development processes , since population programmes were accepted as a fundamental component of any viable strategy for sustainable economic and social development .  
With regard to migration , that extremely complex phenomenon was linked to many demographic , social , ecological , psychological , historical and technological factors .  
During the period following its establishment in 1922 , Jordan experienced tremendous economic , social and demographic changes which fundamentally altered its demographic map and affected the size , composition and distribution of the population , which increased from 225,000 in 1922 to 300,000 in 1938 , representing an annual growth of 1.8 per cent . 
For example , the parties involved in the projects conducted geological studies and a national inventory of natural resources in Madagascar , established a forest inventory in Tunisia , created an agricultural land information system in Egypt and an action plan for flood control in Bangladesh , controlled resettlement of refugees in Cambodia , and prepared a demographic census in Nigeria , a dam site impact study in Cameroon , erosion studies in Chile and a cartographic survey of mine dumps in South Africa .  
A low rate of economic growth ; intense demographic pressures ; a decline in agricultural production ; the continuing decrease in bilateral and multilateral aid the result of new alliances ; the burden of debt servicing ; and socio-political conflicts these are the many pitfalls along the path to Africa 's development . 
In operative paragraph 2 , the Assembly would reaffirm that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that have altered or purported to alter the character , legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem are null and void and have no validity whatsoever .  
It was the Israeli decision to build a new settlement in Jabal Abu Ghneim in East Jerusalem that constituted its latest attempt at pre-empting the outcome of negotiations on the final status , by trying to change the legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem , a city which is of central importance for not only the Arab world but also the entire Muslim world , being the first Kiblah and the third Holy City of Islam , and for all three major religions , as well as for the international community . 
New sets of demands on families and new issues for Governments to address are being created by rapid but uneven changes in economic and demographic trends , such as an increasing number of single-parent households ( largely headed by women ) ; increasing incidence of first marriages at a later age but also a surge in teenage pregnancy ; a decreasing number of children in families ; longer life expectancy and increasing population of elderly family members ; a predominantly young population in developing countries ; and growing participation of women in the labour market .  
Such issues included : human adaptation to alpine conditions , the general pathology and the curative properties of the mountain climate , distinctive features of the social environment and mentality of mountain peoples , and economic development and demographic stability in mountain regions .  
In this regard , the Group expressed particular concern over the Israeli decision on 26 February 1997 to build a new settlement in Jabal abu Ghneim in East Jerusalem , which constitutes the latest attempt by Israel at pre-empting the outcome of the negotiations on final status by changing the legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem - a city which is of central importance to the Arab world and the world of Islam , the three major religions , as well as the international community in general . 
We are concerned to see the Israeli authorities continuing to commit certain acts that are intended to change the Holy City 's demographic and institutional character in order to Judaize Arab Jerusalem and alter its legal , historical , religious and cultural reality .  
Reaffirms that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that have altered or purported to alter the character , legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem are null and void and have no validity whatsoever ;  
Technical advisory services on economic , demographic , social , industrial , energy and environment , and trade statistics to developing countries and countries with economies in transition ; and ad hoc provision of technical cooperation services on national accounts and computers and informatics ;  
Databases on contraceptive use ; fertility levels and trends ; mortality ; international migration ; world population ; demographic indicators ; sex and age in five year groups ; populations ; sex and age in single years ; age patterns of fertility ; urban and rural areas ; urban agglomerations ; global review and inventory of population policies ; and population , resources , environment and development ; ( iv ) Information materials and services .  
As part of this , it will coordinate region-wide data collection , analysis , training and technical assistance activities designed to expand policy-relevant knowledge of ( a ) demographic processes , such as family transformation and childbearing , international migration and integration of foreigners , population ageing and changes among older people and shifts in the health status of mothers , children and other population groups ; and ( b ) interrelationships between these processes and economic and social developments . 
There had been thinly veiled attempts at altering the demographic composition and physical characteristics of the occupied Palestinian territory , incessant human rights violations , plundering of the territory 's natural resources and exploitation of its labour force .  
Today 's cities were faced with a lack of financial resources and socio-economic and demographic pressures ; the gap between rich and poor was widening , providing basic social services was increasingly difficult , health , environmental and security problems were getting worse and unsustainable patterns of production and consumption were becoming widespread . 
Assumptions related to gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth , demographic growth , energy prices , structural changes in energy demand and supply , and policy choices differed considerably among Parties , reflecting the different national circumstances , and the time span of the projections .  Economic growth was considered to be a driving force for several Parties , but in some of them ( e.g .  
Given the demographic , economic and geographic constraints , small island developing States should consider a well educated , highly adaptable and environmentally conscious population and workforce as a central pillar of national sustainable development .  
However , the unique demographic , economic and geographic constraints faced by small island developing States call for a strengthening of the concerted efforts at human resource development .  
Given demographic , economic and geographic constraints , small island developing States should consider a well educated , highly adaptable and environmentally conscious population and workforce to be a central pillar of national sustainable development .  
The dynamism of tourism is expected to continue outpacing economic growth in the future , driven by globalization , economic expansion in developing countries and in countries in transition , structural and demographic change in developed countries , and so on .  
They are located in fragile ecosystems and have been subject to strong degradation for many years , owing to environmental stress ( arid climate , poor soils , strong erosion , overgrazing and demographic expansion ) .  
The basic objective of the national population programme for the period 1995-2000 was to raise living standards and the quality of life of all Mexicans , and to bring demographic trends into line with the country 's potential for economic development .  
As mentioned earlier , the enormous number of landmines planted in such vast areas of my country has altered the demographic edifice by hindering economic development .  
Reaffirms that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel , the occupying Power , which have altered or purport to alter the character , legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory , including the law adopted recently on 26 January 1999 and the legislation of 27 January 1999 are all null and void and have no validity whatsoever ;  
Expresses its grave concern at the adoption by the Knesset of the law of 26 January 1999 and the legislation of 27 January 1999 , and reaffirms that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel , the occupying Power , which have altered or purport to alter the character , legal status and demographic composition of Occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory , are all null and void and have no validity whatsoever ;  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
Consistently and methodically Turkey continues its unabated policy of altering the demographic character of occupied Cyprus through destruction , looting and pillaging of its copious archaeological and religious treasures , which form an integral part of the rich patrimony of the world .  
Expresses its grave concern at the adoption by the Knesset of the law of 26 January 1999 and the legislation of 27 January 1999 , and reaffirms that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel , the occupying Power , which have altered or purport to alter the character , legal status and demographic composition of Occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory , are all null and void and have no validity whatsoever ;  
While the question of poverty must be dealt with primarily as a violation of human rights and of the right to development , the measures to be taken for its eradication required integrated approaches encompassing its economic , social , cultural , educational , demographic and other dimensions .  
Attention continued to be focused on disadvantaged persons in peasant and indigenous settlements , as well as on the improvement , during this period , of services in the outlying neighbourhoods of Asuncin , which were reorganized and rescaled because they were out of step with the actual demographic situation and the demand for services .  
In addition , sample surveys and qualitative studies , such as the rapid assessment approach , are common sources for data on a large number of economic , social and demographic issues ; but they are not always large enough to provide reliable estimates on indicators for smaller population groups , such as indigenous populations , or on characteristics such as disability that affect a very small proportion of the population ;  
Also reaffirms that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War is applicable to the Palestinian territory and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967 , including East Jerusalem , and considers any change in the geographical and demographic status of the city of East Jerusalem from its situation prior to the June 1967 war to be illegal and void ;  
Also reaffirms that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War is applicable to the Palestinian territory and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967 , including East Jerusalem , and considers any change in the geographical and demographic status of the city of East Jerusalem from its situation prior to the June 1967 war to be illegal and void ;  
Specifically , the Security Council has adopted sixteen resolutions regarding Jerusalem and has repeatedly declared that all measures and arrangements taken by Israel , the occupying Power , aimed at changing the legal status , demographic composition and character of the city are null and void and without any legal validity whatsoever .  
The strategic framework is to comprise integrated and coordinated actions for addressing any combination of political , military , humanitarian , human rights , environmental , economic , social , cultural and demographic factors .  
Further , the resolutions reaffirmed that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel that have altered or purported to alter the character , legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem are null and void and have no validity whatsoever .  
On the one hand , changes in the need for disaster reduction will be determined by the changing patterns of natural hazards , their future potential for association with technological disasters or political conflicts , and shifts in the socio-economic and demographic trends .  
The implementation of this strategy has yielded tangible progress in understanding the situation of our population , which is indispensable for adjusting demographic trends and certain social behaviours that are not conducive to sustainable human development .  
Furthermore , at a time when the economic and demographic situation is a global issue , it is important to strengthen international cooperation in this inevitable process of globalization and to exchange ideas and know-how , in the spirit of consensus-building , in order to reach the ultimate goal of improving the quality of life of present and future generations set by the ICPD .  
Despite the fact that it has slowed in many countries , the current rate of demographic growth will , in the coming decades , have a considerable impact on economic , social and even political stability in numerous developing countries which are already enduring serious difficulties .  
This search is being guided by the expectation that demographic ageing holds the promise of maturing attitudes and capabilities in social , economic , cultural and spiritual undertakings , and for global peace and development in the next century .  
In light of rapid population ageing and the projected demographic shifts extending into the coming century , action is necessary in the short , medium and long term .  
Other issues examined included : the economic , social and cultural factors that encourage the expectation that women will take care of the elderly ; whether care-giver is a universal female identity ; and widowhood and how it is affected by the economic and demographic changes occurring in different parts of the world .  
Capital movements had played a large part in the recent financial crises , and developing countries must honestly evaluate whether their economic policies were adequate to face the challenges of the abrupt demographic , economic and technological changes resulting from globalization .  
Despite that welcome development , the Israeli Government was continuing its policy of establishing Jewish settlements and confiscating Palestinian land , especially in East Jerusalem , in the area around Jerusalem , and in the Syrian Golan , and was still engaging in practices that adversely affected the human rights of the Palestinian people , with the result that in Jerusalem , the demographic , legal , cultural and historic situation was being altered .  
In 1996 , the Croatian Parliament adopted the National Programme for Demographic Development , which defined the right to a decent life and development of children and their parents by encouraging demographic measures such as : child allowances , social welfare and health care , basic education , paid maternity leave , the protection of pregnant women in their workplaces .  
The National Programme for Sustainable Development , which is being prepared , includes the social , demographic , economic , environmental , educational , ethical and strategic and political aspects of sustainable development , and is aimed at the definition of guidelines for the general development of the country to emphasize the right of every individual to his or her own dignity and development , in accordance with international conventions signed by the Republic of Croatia .  
This has produced a disturbing split , caused by the fact that the technological explosion is taking place in the developed countries , where a lesser portion of the world ' s population lives , while elsewhere a demographic explosion is accompanied by an acute technological deficit .  
In 53 years the number of independent countries has grown fourfold , and new great Powers can , whether on economic , demographic or geopolitical grounds , legitimately claim a larger share of international responsibility .  
I am confident that over the next two days the debate will be characterized by new ideas and a renewed commitment to the Proclamation on Ageing , which calls for the recognition of humanity ' s demographic coming of age and the promise it holds for maturing attitudes and innovations in political , legal , social , economic , cultural and spiritual fields as our collective and determined way of preparing ourselves towards social justice , global peace , human development equality in the next century . 
We will soon be celebrating the twentieth anniversary of the Vienna International Plan of Action on Ageing , and the Government of Chile believes that on that occasion in 2002 the international community will have to meet to analyse the progress made and set long-term guidelines and strategies for the coming years , years which , demographic trends indicate , will be characterized by a continuous ageing of our population . 
Let me refer here to the fact that the Security Council has repeatedly stressed in its relevant resolutions that Jerusalem is an indivisible part of the occupied land and that all Israeli measures aimed at changing the legal and demographic status of the city of Jerusalem are null and void .  
They are unilateral attempts to change the legal , historical and demographic composition of the occupied territories and are aimed at imposing a fait accompli on the ground prior to the final status negotiations to determine the fate of the Palestinian people and its attempt to establish its independent State on its national soil , as other peoples of the world have done .  
Paragraph 2 reaffirms that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel which have altered or purport to alter the character , legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied Palestinian Territory , including the law adopted recently on 26 January 1999 and the legislation of 27 January 1999 , are all null and void and have no validity whatsoever .  
We are all aware of the grave repercussions of such illegal measures and the adverse consequences of making the whole region face an untenable situation , and our deliberations are being held to reject Israeli settlement policies which are aimed at altering the character , legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory .  
Measures such as these , and any others intended to alter the legal status and the demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , are inherently null and void ; they are unlawful and in breach of the fundamental norms of international law and international humanitarian law .  
In this respect , major challenges face not only developing countries , but also developed ones , and demographic ageing will manifest itself in growth in the cost of old-age pensions , medical care and assistance in daily needs .  
The objective of health policy is to correct the imbalances in the national health system and make health care provision more effective and equitable , taking account of the constraints on choice imposed by the repercussions of demographic pressure and changes , the roles of the participants , and the funding and administration mechanisms for the sector .  
Modelling is most advanced in the field of global warming and climate change , and those models are gradually being developed and linked to other models to take account of demographic trends , land use changes , economic development projections and freshwater supplies , as well as atmospheric and oceanic factors .  
The low gross domestic product ( GDP ) , which was essentially equivalent to that of 1958 , although the population had tripled in size since that time , the annual demographic growth rate having risen from 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent ;  
The official United Nations demographic estimates and projections will be prepared for all countries and areas of the world , as well as urban and rural areas and major cities , and will serve as the standard and consistent set of population figures for use throughout the United Nations system . 
In order to stabilize regional labour markets in the light of the difficult demographic situation and the considerable strain on the labour market as a whole , the Government is creating special economic zones and encouraging an investment drive .  
As mentioned earlier , the enormous number of landmines planted in such vast areas of my country has altered the demographic structure by hindering economic development .  
Mr . Boldt ( Germany ) said that , to a large extent , fundamental social , economic and cultural challenges were triggered by demographic change , and the main demographic issue of the coming century would be ageing .  
Additionally , the triangle has embarked on a policy of social engineering with the aim of changing the demographic composition of various provinces of Afghanistan through the relocation and dislocation of the native inhabitants of central and northern parts of Afghanistan in order to disturb the harmonious fraternal coexistence of Afghan ethnic groups , which has endured for hundreds of years .  
Reaffirms that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War is applicable to the Palestinian territory and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967 , including East Jerusalem , and considers any change in the geographical and demographic status of the city of East Jerusalem from its situation prior to the June 1967 war to be illegal and void ;  
Reaffirms that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War is applicable to the Palestinian territory and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967 , including East Jerusalem , and considers any change in the geographical and demographic status of the city of East Jerusalem from its situation prior to the June 1967 war to be illegal and void ;  
This approach requires a comprehensive and holistic framework to articulate needs , and generate effective strategies and efficient policies , covering a broad range of interactive determinants , including demographic dynamics , social and economic conditions and natural resource endowments .  
It also agreed to the importance of peace-building as a broad-based approach to conflict prevention , and stressed the need to address the political , military , humanitarian , human rights , environmental , economic , social , cultural and demographic root causes of conflicts .  
[ Urges all States to refrain from taking any measure leading to the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel or of any measures aimed at altering its geographic , demographic and institutional characteristics in violation of the norms of international humanitarian law and relevant repeated United Nations resolutions ] ;  
Encourages the international donor community , relevant United Nations bodies and the private sector to provide support , including financial and technical support , for data collection and greater empirical research by Member States , particularly developing countries , and the relevant bodies of the United Nations system on the causes and patterns of migration , including on irregular migration and trafficking , as well as its social , economic and demographic impacts , and for documenting and disseminating information on successful migration management programmes ;  
Despite the indivisible nature of Euro-Mediterranean security and despite the promises of partnership that have been reiterated on many occasions , the Mediterranean , as a recent declaration of the European Parliament declared , has become a zone that is a microcosm of the principal contradictions of the twenty-first century and is likely to produce irreversible demographic , economic , political and cultural divisions .  
At the crossroads of three continents , the Mediterranean is in a state of constant tension and must cope with major political , economic , ecological and demographic challenges , let alone a host of global social scourges that affect this region .  
The interlinkages between international migration and development were complex in the sense that they brought into play a multiplicity of factors economic , technological , demographic , social , ecological , historical and cultural depending on regional characteristics .  
The Board noted the current position of Hong Kong in the compilation of disability statistics .  Board members were aware that data on persons with disabilities were scattered in various administrative records maintained by different Government departments , statutory bodies and non-governmental organizations .  There was no single and comprehensive data source that could provide a complete picture on the demographic and socio-economic profiles of such persons .  
The estimates derived from the model suggested that about half of the swings in property prices in Hong Kong since the early 1990s could be attributed to changes in fundamental variables , such as macro-economic activity , monetary conditions , demographic movement and public housing supply .  The other half was explained by the build-up of a bubble and its sudden collapse .  
Among reports in the publication plan are a series of thematic reports on population sub-groups .  Thematic reports published earlier include older persons , youths , and women and men .  The report " Hong Kong 2001 Population Census Thematic Report - Ethnic Minorities " provides a comprehensive range of statistics on ethnic minorities in Hong Kong . It goes into some length in analysing the characteristics of ethnic minorities in Hong Kong : demographic characteristics , education , labour force , living arrangement and household characteristics , and geographical characteristics .  
( h ) of the criteria for deciding which districts should be provided with mobile medical services ; whether it has regularly re-assessed if such services should be maintained in the relevant districts in the light of factors such as demographic changes , the demand for such services , the availability of public transport services and networks , as well as the costs for providing the services in these districts ?  
Within the six months it was given to work , the Task Force sought to analyse the main social and economic challenges that our demographic trends readily present to us and have explored a set of practical measures to be taken in the short and medium term to address these challenges . 
An abnormal excess of male over female births in recent demographic statistics is causing many people to be concerned that in future , men will be hard put to find a mate . Others joke that families with daughters will be in great demand .  
Professor Yang Kuo-chu of NTU 's psychology department sums up the situation by saying that in the West , demographic change and equal rights for women have developed over a relatively long period , whereas in Taiwan demographic change has been compressed into a short timeframe , and it is difficult for traditions of male preeminence and of continuation of the male family line to disappear so quickly . These factors , combined with the timely appearance of techniques for determining fetal gender , probably provide the best explanation for the imbalance between male and female births .  
Viewing this demographic shift within its proper historical context , however , sheds a different light on the issue . Water resources were seldom located in the plains ; rather , they were most accessible along the middle reaches of rivers . This was a key reason why Taiwan 's early Hakkas chose to live in the hills .  
Bearing in mind that official statistical information is an essential basis for sustainable development in the economic , demographic , social and environmental fields and for mutual knowledge and trade among the States and peoples of the world ,  
Cognizant of urban transition as an irreversible demographic , economic and societal process which can be a major instrument for securing balanced economic and spatial development and relieve the severe pressure on scarce agricultural land ,  
National access to information on international economic , demographic , social and environmental conditions is essential not only to informed decisionmaking , but also to competitive and effective participation in international markets .  
We are also of the view that additional permanent members should be chosen on the basis , not only of equitable geographical representation , but also of such objective criteria as the political , economic and demographic weight of a country , its capability and proven track record of contributing to the promotion of peace , security and development , both regionally and globally , and its commitment to assume the responsibilities inherent in permanent membership .  
To the traditionally elusive development problems of persistent poverty , debilitating debt , declining levels of official development assistance , unemployment , demographic pressures and the worsening income gap and terms of trade between developed and developing countries , one must add the new and additional challenges of environmental degradation and globalization .  
The Beijing Conference , along with the other global conferences held at Rio , Barbados , Cairo and Copenhagen , have served to buttress the case for an integrated approach to sustainable development , which must be informed by environmental , social , demographic , gender and human - resource considerations .  
An increase in the membership of the Security Council should therefore accommodate new permanent members , which should join on the basis of a combination of these and other appropriate criteria , reflecting , among other things , the new and emerging constellation of Powers and their proven regional and global responsibilities , as well as political , economic and demographic realities .  
These variable criteria are subject to historical , human , demographic , political , economic , territorial and other changes .  
My Government also considers that all the steps and measures taken by the Israeli occupation authorities with the aim of altering the legal status and demographic character of the Palestinian and Arab occupied territories , particularly with regard to Al-Quds , are null and void and constitute a serious breach of international law .  Peace , security , stability and development in the Middle East require the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction in the region , including nuclear weapons .  
In this context , let me thank the Department of Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis , headed by Mr . Jean-Claude Milleron , which is responsible for generating and producing economic , demographic , social and environmental information and for analyzing national and regional development policies and trends .  It also provides technical assistance to developing countries for their projects in the areas of statistics and population .  
Note by the Secretariat on draft decision III , entitled " Contribution of comprehensive national social policies to societal management and to the solving of economic , environmental , demographic , cultural and political problems " , contained in the report of the Commission for Social Development on its thirty-third session ( E / CN . 5 / 1995 / L . 3 ) .  
Awareness should be increased of the fundamental linkages between improving the status of women and demographic dynamics , particularly through women 's access to education , primary and reproductive health care programmes , economic independence and their effective , equitable participation in all levels of decision-making .  
The long forms included a wide range of specific questions on demographic , social and economic characteristics or on special groups of the population ( for example , persons with a disability ) or were utilized to meet the specific requirements of users .  
Sixteen demographic indicators are given : total populations for males , females and both sexes combined ; population density ; female population aged 15-49 ; population under age 15 ; population aged 15-64 ; population aged 65 or over ; average annual rate of population growth ; crude birth and death rates ; total fertility rate ; life expectancies at birth for males , females and both sexes combined ; and infant mortality rate .  
It decided to transmit to the Economic and Social Council a draft resolution on the contribution of comprehensive national policies to societal management and to the solving of economic , environmental , demographic , cultural and political problems ( draft decision III ) .  
Other types of policies are needed for promoting economic growth and trade , changing demographic behaviour , developing human resources , alleviating poverty , promoting the transfer to developing countries of environmentally sound technology and financial resources , and managing natural resources .  
In a document UNCHS prepared for the Conference , on population , urbanization and quality of life , it underlined the positive effects of urbanization on social change and modernization , on fertility , mortality and other demographic trends , on personal and household income levels and on the general economic development of both the rural and urban areas .  
In decision 1993 / 239 , the Economic and Social Council took note of draft decision III , entitled " Contribution of comprehensive national social policies to societal management and to the solving of economic , environmental , demographic , cultural and political problems " , contained in the report of the Commission for Social Development on its thirty-third session , 1 / and requested the Commission to reconsider it at its thirty-fourth session .  
The Economic and Social Council , in decision 1993 / 239 , took note of draft decision III , entitled " Contribution of comprehensive national social policies to societal management and to the solving of economic , environmental , demographic , cultural and political problems " , contained in the report of the Commission for Social Development on its thirty-third session , and requested the Commission to reconsider it at its thirty-fourth session .  
Research themes to be studied from the data are : main facts and trends in vital events and population structures ; social , economic and demographic characteristics of older persons who are institutionalized ( and comparisons with those who are not institutionalized ) ; the living arrangements of older persons ; older persons ' labour-force participation status ; and their economic conditions , mobility patterns and spatial distribution .  
Particularly in Kuwait , Qatar and the United Arab Emirates , relatively large national incomes generated by oil revenues , combined with rapid urbanization , high standards of living , improved health care and gradually declining fertility rates resulting in part from improved education of women , will produce drastic changes in the demographic structure , including the marked ageing trends which have been projected .  
Note by the Secretariat on draft decision III , entitled " Contribution of comprehensive national social policies to societal management and to the solving of economic , environmental , demographic , cultural and political problems " , contained in the report of the Commission for Social Development on its thirty-third session ( E / CN . 5 / 1995 / L . 3 ) .  
The areas to be covered will include economic statistics and national accounts , demographic and social statistics , industry and trade statistics , statistics for special population groups , household surveys , the situation of women , environment statistics , geographical information systems , statistical training , and organization and management of national statistical services .  
Services on organizational and institutional issues affecting national statistical services ; implementation of the 1993 System of National Accounts ; economic , social and demographic statistics ; electronic interchange and networking ; design and development of government information systems ; and technical and substantive support to the Statistical Institute for Asia and the Pacific ;  
Services on economic reforms in the least developed countries ; economic and financial management in Pacific island developing countries ; demographic issues in the Pacific island developing countries ; institutional capability-building , including private sector development for the promotion of industrial investment and technology transfer ; and promotion of sustainable development in small island developing States ; ( b ) Group training , including seminars and workshops .  
National measures for the Year have been successful in raising public awareness of family issues , including increased knowledge of the economic , social , demographic , cultural and other factors affecting families and their members .  
[ 1 ] These demographic trends are expected to be reinforced by negative economic trends : even if global wealth grows , it is expected to further widen the gap between rich and poor , between and within countries . 
The Division is responsible for establishing policies for environmentally sound and sustainable multi-sectoral development plans , the integration of environmental imperatives into the development process , the development of energy and natural resources and the reduction of natural disasters , taking into account technological and economic and demographic development .  
It assists in increasing the statistical capacity of developing countries in their efforts by improving the quality of demographic , social , economic and other statistics in a form suitable for retrieval and dissemination .  
The continuing plundering of the cultural heritage of the Greek Cypriots and the changing demographic structure of the area under Turkish military occupation through massive importation of settlers were two additional characteristics of the unacceptable situation created in Cyprus through the force of arms .  
The Croatian aggression resulted in major and forcible demographic displacement in the areas under the protection of the United Nations forces , i.e . , in mass resettlement and exodus of the Serbian population , violation of human rights , burning and destruction of their property including the Orthodox places of worship and Serbian cultural and historical monuments .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially in the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements , and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory ,  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially in the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements , and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory ,  
demographic trends would be compounded by the economic crisis facing the developing countries : even if global wealth increased , the gap between rich and poor , between and within countries , was likely to widen further and foster social unrest , drug abuse and crime .  
In our view , new permanent members should be chosen on the basis not only of equitable geographic representation , but also of such criteria as political , economic and demographic weight , their capability and proven track record of contributing to the promotion of peace , security and development , both regionally and globally , and their commitment to assuming responsibilities inherent to permanent membership .  
Therefore , any action taken by Israel since the beginning of the Madrid process to alter the political , legal or demographic status of Jerusalem is tantamount to creating a fait accompli to be imposed on the Arab party , which would constitute a judgement on the status of the Holy City before the beginning of the final status negotiations .  This is unacceptable and can not be conducive to the peace we all desire .  
Proposes that , in addition to their special coverage in the World Population Monitoring reports , main demographic trends be covered biennially , starting in 1997 , in a complementary concise report prepared by the Population Division of the Department for Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis of the United Nations Secretariat , to be discussed under the agenda item concerning the work programme of the Population Division ;  
The operative part of the resolution called on Israel to respect the relevant resolutions of the Security Council , declared invalid all Israeli acts in the occupied Syrian Golan , called on Israel to desist from attempting to alter the physical , demographic , institutional and legal character of the occupied Syrian Golan , and referred to the issue of settlements in that territory .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially in the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements , and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory ,  
Recalling that the Committee had requested a summary of the report presented by Ukraine at the Fourth World Conference on Women and had asked for further details of the commitments which Ukraine had made in Beijing , she said that the Ukrainian report to the Conference had described the overall deterioration of the situation of women , the decline in the standard of living , and the worsening demographic situation resulting from economic problems and the impact of the Chernobyl disaster , which continued to consume significant budgetary resources .  
The cross-national and global impacts of unsustainable patterns of production and consumption , particularly in industrialized countries , environmental degradation , demographic changes , widespread and persistent poverty , and social and economic inequality are clearly visible .  
Proposes that , in addition to their special coverage in the World Population Monitoring reports , main demographic trends be covered biennially , starting in 1997 , in a complementary concise report prepared by the Population Division of the Department for Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis , to be discussed under the agenda item concerning the work programme of the Population Division ;  
In the face of these serious challenges to the peace process , we call upon the Security Council to take effective and practical measures that would ensure the realization of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people ; the cessation of the policy of aggression , settlement and Judaization of Jerusalem ; the preservation of its cultural , religious and material heritage , and demographic composition ; and the lifting of the siege against the Palestinian villages and cities .  
Typically , such a process should include ( i ) assessing the hydroclimatic , hydrographic and demographic conditions ; ( ii ) establishing water management objectives ; ( iii ) formulating and evaluating alternative resource management actions , implementation tools and institutional arrangements ; ( iv ) assessing the impacts of promising alternatives ; and ( v ) choosing and implementing the preferred course of action .  
The evolution of an integrated land / water-oriented action plan to achieve a balanced development of the river system , taking into account all relevant factors ( demographic changes , ecological , socio-economic , hydrologic and hydraulic factors , and spatial and agronomic potentials of the basin ) and ensuring proper attention to urban / rural and upstream / downstream competition for water ;  
Thus , the rapid demographic growth of some cities and the movements of landless farm workers in hot , rainy ecosystems are extreme examples of the critical links that exist between demographic dynamics and the natural environment .  
Furthermore , ESCWA published the biennial demographic and related socio-economic indicators on human development and socio-cultural specificity - the case of the Arab world ; the social dimensions of human development ; the situation of disabled women , their marginalization , and measures for social integration in the ESCWA region ; changing values in the Arab family ; and regional perspectives of human settlements in ESCWA countries .  
A major regional project covering 26 countries in eastern Europe and CIS was launched in 1995 and executed by ECE to assist national statistical offices in developing the human resources necessary for building self-sustainable capabilities for the collection , processing and analysis of reliable social and demographic statistics , and enabling the appropriate governmental institutions and agencies of these countries to monitor the social aspects of development .  
We strongly believe that under present circumstances , when Abkhazia is left uninhibited by Georgians , when more than 300,000 refugees and displaced persons remain homeless , disenfranchised and humiliated , and in the face of the present demographic conditions , this decision is not only unlawful but also immoral , capable of damaging the peace process beyond repair .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
The United Arab Emirates , which welcomes the peace process on the basis of international law and the land for peace principle , considers illegal and inadmissible all current Israeli measures aimed at changing the demographic composition and the legal status of the occupied Palestinian and other Arab territories , including the city of Jerusalem , Syrian Golan and southern Lebanon .  
Since Israel 's occupation of East Jerusalem , more than 28 years ago , the Israeli Government has tried to judaize the city by distorting its identity , changing its demographic character , deporting Palestinian inhabitants and reducing their numbers through the application of military , administrative and legal measures , moving settlers into the city and expanding Jerusalem 's borders to prejudice the final status of the city .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
Part four , ( Census products and data utilization ) is designed , in part , to serve as an introduction to users who are unfamiliar with population and housing censuses as a source to meet their needs for demographic and social statistics and , in part , to provide some of the indicators needed to monitor progress on the goals identified in the plans of action adopted by various international conferences held in the 1990s .  
Unfortunately , these gains were nullified by subsequent events , characterized by the ominous statements made by the Israeli Prime Minister and members of his Government and backed by continued military occupation ; land confiscation and settlement in the occupied territories ; construction of housing units in the settlement of Givat Zeev ; demolition of Palestinian houses in the occupied territories ; confiscation of identity documents of Palestinians ; imposition of closures to drain the Palestinian economy , resulting in the loss of potential income ; and systematic change in the physical character and demographic composition of Jerusalem .  
In addition to its influence on the regular programme of work of the Conference , the increase in the number of ECE member countries , which has greatly extended the number of countries in the region in need of technical assistance , has obliged ECE to appoint regional advisers , including on economic statistics , and to seek to provide other forms of technical assistance , such as through a UNDP-funded project in social and demographic statistics .  
Within that meeting , a programme of activities has been developed and the functions of regional and international cooperation in the statistical field have been distributed in the areas of national accounts ; environmental statistics ; dissemination of information ; and social and demographic indicators .  
In 25 years , the population debate has evolved dramatically from a narrow focus on population size and growth rates to a more integrated agenda embracing demographic structures , distribution patterns and urbanization , levels of exploitation of natural resources , and creation of viable agricultural and industrial infrastructures .  
Priority research5 should focus on : coastal areas where populations are growing rapidly and critical resources are being depleted at an accelerated rate , such as on highly urbanized coasts ; soil erosion and desertification , linked with inappropriate land-use practices often brought on by migration patterns ; water scarcity , and misuse and pollution of water resources in both rural and urban areas ; and deforestation resulting from inappropriate shifting cultivation patterns , fuelwood demands , and conversion of forests in upland areas to other uses , linked with demographic pressures among the poorest groups in society .  
This includes reaffirming that all legislative and administrative measures taken by Israel aimed at changing the legal status of Jerusalem and its demographic composition are legally null and void ; that Israeli settlements are illegal and represent a great obstacle on the road to peace ; that the plight of Palestinian refugees must be resolved through their right to return or through compensation ; and that the acquisition of territory by acts of war is inadmissible .  
My delegation , therefore , can not accept any policies adopted or illegal measures taken by Israel in occupied East Jerusalem aimed at judaizing the city and changing its legal status and demographic character to advance its own political and strategic interests .  
Reaffirms that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , is applicable to the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967 , including Jerusalem , and considers any change in the geographic and demographic status of the city of Jerusalem from its situation prior to the June 1967 war to be illegal and void ;  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
The international community of States ( the United Nations , OSCE , CIS and the European Parliament ) , in condemning the policy of " ethnic cleansing " in the form of mass extermination and forcible expulsion of the predominantly Georgian population of Abkhazia , has affirmed the unacceptability of refusing to allow them to return to Abkhazia and of forcibly changing the demographic composition of Abkhazia , Georgia . 
From all the above , the relevant changes in the demographic situation in Abkhazia may be clearly observed , as a result of the systematic genocide and ethnic cleansing carried out by the Ardzinba regime in the occupied territories - and still continuing - directed primarily against the Georgian population .  * A / 52 / 50 .  
The City and its Palestinian population have been subjected to human rights violations resulting from concerted and accelerated efforts by the Israeli authorities to create facts on the ground , such as those affecting the demographic and geographic balance in the city , which would be , if allowed to continue unabated , clearly to the advantage of its Jewish population and have negative implications for the Palestinians , placing them before a fait accompli and pre-empting their future efforts to challenge Israeli sovereignty in East Jerusalem . 
Despite their economic limitations , the developing countries had made strenuous efforts to achieve the objectives of the Programme , and in particular to integrate more fully demographic changes and the development processes , since population programmes were accepted as a fundamental component of any viable strategy for sustainable economic and social development .  
With regard to migration , that extremely complex phenomenon was linked to many demographic , social , ecological , psychological , historical and technological factors .  
During the period following its establishment in 1922 , Jordan experienced tremendous economic , social and demographic changes which fundamentally altered its demographic map and affected the size , composition and distribution of the population , which increased from 225,000 in 1922 to 300,000 in 1938 , representing an annual growth of 1.8 per cent . 
For example , the parties involved in the projects conducted geological studies and a national inventory of natural resources in Madagascar , established a forest inventory in Tunisia , created an agricultural land information system in Egypt and an action plan for flood control in Bangladesh , controlled resettlement of refugees in Cambodia , and prepared a demographic census in Nigeria , a dam site impact study in Cameroon , erosion studies in Chile and a cartographic survey of mine dumps in South Africa .  
A low rate of economic growth ; intense demographic pressures ; a decline in agricultural production ; the continuing decrease in bilateral and multilateral aid the result of new alliances ; the burden of debt servicing ; and socio-political conflicts these are the many pitfalls along the path to Africa 's development . 
In operative paragraph 2 , the Assembly would reaffirm that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that have altered or purported to alter the character , legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem are null and void and have no validity whatsoever .  
It was the Israeli decision to build a new settlement in Jabal Abu Ghneim in East Jerusalem that constituted its latest attempt at pre-empting the outcome of negotiations on the final status , by trying to change the legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem , a city which is of central importance for not only the Arab world but also the entire Muslim world , being the first Kiblah and the third Holy City of Islam , and for all three major religions , as well as for the international community . 
New sets of demands on families and new issues for Governments to address are being created by rapid but uneven changes in economic and demographic trends , such as an increasing number of single-parent households ( largely headed by women ) ; increasing incidence of first marriages at a later age but also a surge in teenage pregnancy ; a decreasing number of children in families ; longer life expectancy and increasing population of elderly family members ; a predominantly young population in developing countries ; and growing participation of women in the labour market .  
Such issues included : human adaptation to alpine conditions , the general pathology and the curative properties of the mountain climate , distinctive features of the social environment and mentality of mountain peoples , and economic development and demographic stability in mountain regions .  
In this regard , the Group expressed particular concern over the Israeli decision on 26 February 1997 to build a new settlement in Jabal abu Ghneim in East Jerusalem , which constitutes the latest attempt by Israel at pre-empting the outcome of the negotiations on final status by changing the legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem - a city which is of central importance to the Arab world and the world of Islam , the three major religions , as well as the international community in general . 
We are concerned to see the Israeli authorities continuing to commit certain acts that are intended to change the Holy City 's demographic and institutional character in order to Judaize Arab Jerusalem and alter its legal , historical , religious and cultural reality .  
Reaffirms that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that have altered or purported to alter the character , legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem are null and void and have no validity whatsoever ;  
Technical advisory services on economic , demographic , social , industrial , energy and environment , and trade statistics to developing countries and countries with economies in transition ; and ad hoc provision of technical cooperation services on national accounts and computers and informatics ;  
Databases on contraceptive use ; fertility levels and trends ; mortality ; international migration ; world population ; demographic indicators ; sex and age in five year groups ; populations ; sex and age in single years ; age patterns of fertility ; urban and rural areas ; urban agglomerations ; global review and inventory of population policies ; and population , resources , environment and development ; ( iv ) Information materials and services .  
As part of this , it will coordinate region-wide data collection , analysis , training and technical assistance activities designed to expand policy-relevant knowledge of ( a ) demographic processes , such as family transformation and childbearing , international migration and integration of foreigners , population ageing and changes among older people and shifts in the health status of mothers , children and other population groups ; and ( b ) interrelationships between these processes and economic and social developments .
